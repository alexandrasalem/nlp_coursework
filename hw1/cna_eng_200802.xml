      <P>The government is urging housing developers to make use of a NT$200 billion
(US$6.22 billion) loan program to engage in city renovation projects,  Ministry
of the Interior officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The officials with the ministry's Construction and Planning Agency disclosed
that the Interior Ministry has granted a total of NT$2.7 billion in loans to
applicants since the program began in May 2006.</P>
      <P>They added that the joint program between the government and 27 banks is
intended to serve the dual purpose of helping property developers cope with
their financial difficulties and stimulating domestic market demand.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, applicants can borrow up to 80 percent of their
costs for municipal renovation projects. All loans carry an interest rate of
less than 2 percent per annum and should be repaid over six years.</P>
      <P>Homeowners who can present a renovation plan are also elegible for a loan, the
officials said, adding that homeowners in a block of apartments are encouraged
to talk with their neighbors to work out a plan to renovate the entire building
and increase their property value.</P>
      <P>The officials compared the construction industry to a locomotive driving the
nation's economic development and expressed hope that the low-interest  loans
will generate  more business  for domestic construction companies.</P>

the official noted.</P>
      <P>Under the amendments, the definition of public buildings will be extended to
include convenience stores and hypermarkets, as well as cram schools and day
care centers occupying an area of over 500 square meters, the official went on.</P>
      <P>Contrary to the ministry's previous regulations  that only required public
buildings to establish disabled-friendly facilities, the amendments  will make
specific requirements  on what such facilities should consist of, the official
explained.</P>
      <P>In addition, the new amendments will require schools to equip their buildings
with disabled-friendly facilities, the official went on.</P>
      <P>Beginning in April, the ministry will conduct comprehensive inspection  tours

give him one of my own. When I have pointed out the bearing of a subject in one
direction and found that my student cannot himself see its bearings into other
directions, I do not then repeat my lesson."</TEXT>

      <P>A collection of 116 ancient Chinese artworks from the National Palace Museum
(NPM) in suburban Taipei are being painstakingly packed for shipment to the
Austrian capital Vienna for a three-month exhibition set to begin Feb. 25, the
museum's curator said Friday.</P>
      <P>"The collection is not the largest the museum has ever sent abroad, but it is
the most comprehensive, including masterpieces that connect the 5,000 years of
China's history and demonstrate the vitality and fusion of Chinese culture, "
said NPM Director Lin Mun-lee.</P>
      <P>Among the precious items, 88 are ancient artifacts, 23 are paintings and
calligraphy, and five are rare books and documents, Lin explained, adding that
55 of them have never left Taiwan before.</P>
      <P>One of the most famous is a scroll painting titled "Along the River on the
Chingming Festival." The 11-meter handscroll masterfully depicts life and
customs in China's Soong Dynasty capital, Bianjing -- today's Kaifeng.</P>
      <P>"The Vienna exhibition will mark the first time the 270-year-old painting has
ever been shipped abroad," Lin said.</P>
      <P>It took four years to prepare for the exhibition, to be staged at the
Kunsthistorishches Museum, Lin said, paying tribute to her colleagues for their
strenuous efforts to make the show possible.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the exhibition is part of a cultural exchange project between
Taiwan and Austria. The first phase of the program is an exhibition of Great
Habsburg collectors masterpieces of the Baroque period that opened at the NPM
last October and will run until the end of February.</P>
      <P>Austria is the fourth foreign country to engage in cultural exchanges with the
NPM, home to the best of the 1,000-year-old art collection of China's emperors.</P>
      <P>The museum,  which is often compared  to leading  Western institutions like the
Louvre in Paris and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, has cooperated
with the United States, France and Germany in showcasing some of its magnificent
art treasures in the past decade or so.</P>
      <P>Lin said Belgium has also reached a consensus with the museum on a collaborative
exchange program. Belgium has followed the example of the other countries in
passing legislation to guarantee that none of the NPM's priceless artworks will
be impounded due to China's sovereignty claim over Taiwan, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, she said, Japan has also shown keen interest in showcasing the
museum's art collection.</P>
      <P>At a Wednesday news conference, NPM staffers explained to the media how the
works will be packed for shipment overseas using advanced technology and
materials.</P>
      <P>Lin said the collection has been insured for US$220 million.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese films will be featured in the Black Movie film festival that opened
Friday in Geneva, Switzerland and will run through Feb. 10.</P>
      <P>The festival, launched in 1991, is focusing on Taiwanese films for the first
time this year. The series, titled "Taiwan plus 25, "conveys the idea that 25
years have passed since the first emergence of the Taiwanese New Wave film
movement.</P>
      <P>It's true that the New Wave is over," said Kate Reidy, assistant director of the
festival, "but in the small country there are still lots of really interesting
films being made today.</P>
      <P>"Twenty-five years after, what remains?" That is what the festival expects its
audience to find out, Reidy said.</P>
      <P>Four sub-sections relating to Taiwan include a selection of 10 films by director
Tsai Ming-liang, four works by Edward Yang as a homage to the director who died
last summer, eight recent movies by Chang Tso-chi, Cheng Wen-tang, Chung Mong-
hong, Lee Kang-sheng, Yao Hung-I and Lin Jing-jie, and 15 short films by cinema
students of the National Taiwan University of Arts (NTUA).</P>
      <P>"Tsai Ming-liang is probably one of the most important and innovative directors
working today, we really believe he's some sort of a genius," Reidy said.</P>
      <P>Starting with interest in Tsai's work and receiving assistance from the Taipei
Cultural and Economic Delegation in Switzerland, Reidy visited Taiwan last
autumn and the idea of featuring Taiwan in the festival began to take form.</P>
      <P>She said she and her colleague discovered the work of Chang Tso-chi during the
trip to Taiwan and added that many of the NTUA students' works are quite
promising. Taiwanese films form one of the eight sections in this year's Black
Movie festival, with Africa, Iran and Malaysia also featured.</P>

      <P>The Bankers Association of the Republic of China (BAROC) reminded the public
ahead of the Chinese New Year holidays to be on guard against ATM card scams
when withdrawing cash from their accounts.</P>
      <P>BAROC officials said Friday that ATM card swindlers  have developed a variety of
new scams for tricking cardholders into revealing their PIN numbers and other

      <P>The officials reminded people to first seek verification of the authenticity  of
any organization  requesting  their  ATM card information or to call the
National Police Agency's anti-fraud hotline on 165 before divulging any
information.</P>
      <P>As banks will be closed for six straight days between Feb. 6-11, the BAROC
officials also offered some reminders to the public to avoid problems when using
ATM services during the holiday period.</P>
      <P>Noting that there is a daily limit on the amount that can be withdrawn from an
ATM machine, the officials urged people to work out their budget beforehand to
ensure that they have ample cash available for the holidays.</P>
      <P>They also suggested that people try to refrain from using ATM machines between 2
p.m. and 4: 30 p.m. during the three days before the start of the holidays in
order to avoid long lineups.</P>
      <P>ATM cardholders were urged to hold on to their transaction receipts as proof if
they experience any problems while using an ATM machine and to call the
emergency service number posted by the machine to explain their situation
immediately.</P>
      <P>If they cannot get through to anyone at the service number listed by the ATM

      <P>An Insect Ecology Hall (IEH) , featuring a unique ventilated Living Butterfly
Greenhouse Garden -- Taiwan's first -- was inaugurated Thursday in the southern
city of Chiayi.</P>
      <P>Located on the campus of National Chiayi University, the IEH contains a
butterfly greenhouse equipped with seven ventilators that circulate the air and
greatly reduce the butterfly mortality rate, according to IEH staff.</P>
      <P>The inauguration ceremony was highlighted by the release of 600 butterflies of
about 20 different species that fluttered around the guests and even alighted on
their shoulders.</P>
      <P>They included the idea leuconoe Clara, better known as "big stupid butterflies"
in Taiwan, for they fly more slowly than their relatives of the same family.
They are the biggest butterflies in the danaidae family found in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the staff, 100 new mature butterflies or pupae will be placed each
week in the greenhouse, with the varieties changed in accordance with the
seasons.</P>
      <P>The greenhouse designers tried to provide the butterflies and other insects
housed there with the same living conditions they have in nature, the staff
noted, adding that all the vegetation the larvae feed on is cultivated in the
greenhouse garden. An estimated total of 5,700 butterflies and other living
insects will be raised in the greenhouse per year.</P>
      <P>Besides the greenhouse, the IEC includes other sections, such as the Living
Aquatic  Insect Zone and the Taiwan-Protected  and World-Rare Living Insects
Zone.</P>
      <P>During the trial operation from February 1-5, visitors to the IEC can benefit
from a 50 percent discount on the admission fee. The IEC will begin formal
operations Feb. 7 and will be open year-round, except for Chinese New Year's
Eve.</P>

      <P>A local activist group called on members of the Seventh Legislative Yuan Friday
to sign a petition pledging to build the new, restructured legislature into a
transparent lawmaking body and clean up legislative politics.</P>
      <P>Citizen Congress Watch Chairman Ku Chung-hua urged Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-
pyng, who was re-elected to his post earlier in the day, to lead the campaign to
turn the new 113-member legislature into a clean, transparent lawmaking body.</P>
      <P>With over half of the 113 legislators yet to endorse the petition since it was
proposed last month, Ku's group called on all lawmakers to sign the petition by
March 10.</P>
      <P>Those who do not will have images of their faces paraded in public at the
group's rally on March 15 and earn the condemnation of Taiwan's citizens, Ku
insisted.</P>
      <P>Members of the watchdog group -- made up of 40 civic groups around Taiwan --
sent newly sworn-in legislators bouquets of carnations, sunflowers, narcissus,
tulips and lilies as symbols of their five requests to lawmakers to protect the
public interest, pass sunshine laws, and be transparent, civilized and
efficient.</P>
      <P>Ku said the group hopes that members of the new legislature will do away with
the shenanigans pulled by their predecessors, who made a habit of putting on
shows, disrupting sessions with violence, and trading favors.</P>
      <P>Ku also urged the new legislature to open itself to the public by providing an
online feed, allowing viewers access to legislative sessions and enabling them
to monitor the body more easily.</P>
      <P>In addition, the group called for an end to the practice of holding closed-door
caucus negotiations as a way to solve major controversies among rival parties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NPSU urges not to hold U.N. referendums along with March election</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 1 (CNA)
02/01/08  17:32:12
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman of the opposition Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU) urged the
Central Election Commission (CEC) Friday to keep two planned referendums on
Taiwan's bid for a seat in the United Nations on hold and let the new president
handle the issue.</P>
      <P>Lin Ping-kun, who is also a legislator representing Penghu County, said the NPSU
believes economic issues related to the people's welfare and livelihood are the
top priority at present, and the referendums, therefore, should be less of a
focus for the administration.</P>
      <P>If the CEC does not push the referendums back, Lin said, the initiators  of the
two referendums  --  the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the
largest opposition Kuomintang (KMT) -- would be politically responsible for
possible "ethnic conflicts and Taiwan's suffering from international isolation
caused by the controversial polls."</P>
      <P>The DPP's question asks voters if Taiwan should enter the U.N. under the name
"Taiwan" while the KMT's question asks if the country should return to the U.N.
under the name "Republic of China" or any other feasible name.</P>
      <P>Taiwan lost its seat at the U.N. to China in 1971.</P>
      <P>Lin made the call at a press conference he held along with the NPSU's two other
lawmakers, Yen Ching-piao and Kao Chin Su-mei, at the party's office at the
legislature, ahead of a CEC meeting scheduled later in the day to decide on the
date of the referendums.</P>
      <P>Lin suggested that the CEC not post the voting date for the referendums on its
bulletin announcing election procedures, which would open the door for them to
be postponed until after the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Under the Referendum Act, the announcement and publication of the voting date 28
days ahead of the vote is the final official step that has to be completed
before the polls are carried out.</P>
      <P>"If the CEC does not publicly announce a date, there will be more time for
discussion on the U.N.-bid issue, " the legislator argued. He suggested a
broader public consensus on how to pursue a seat in the international
organization was needed before taking the issue to a popular vote.</P>
      <P>"Such a move should be taken in a cautious manner on the basis of maintaining
Taiwan's national dignity," he said.</P>
      <P>Lin, Yen and Kao won re-election in the Jan. 12 legislative elections, the only
NPSU lawmakers to emerge victorious.</P>
      <P>The Seventh Legislative Yuan opened earlier in the day, beginning its four-year
term.</P>
      <P>The NPSU, established June 15, 2004, emerged as a major player on the national
political scene during the 2004 legislative elections, when 26 candidates ran
for local constituency and aboriginal seats and six others were nominated for
proportional representation seats.</P>
      <P>It won six seats that year, and three seats in the 2008 elections. Although non-
partisan in name, the union generally is considered to be part of the KMT-led
pan-blue camp.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) will soon list the Asiatic water
shrew, only a small number of which can be found in western, central, and
northern Taiwan, as the country's first protected rodent, a local scholar said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The council's Forestry Bureau paved the way for the decision by approving a
proposal to list the Asiatic water shrew as a protected species at a
commissioners' meeting on the preservation of wild animals in early January.</P>
      <P>Lin Liang-kong, a professor in Tunghai University's Department of Life Science,
said that the Asiatic water shrew -- one of Taiwan's 19 kinds of rodents -- was
not discovered until 1971 when it was found along the Mei River in central
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The polluted river and a river treatment project have resulted in a sharp
decline in the rodent's population in the area. Lin said he had been able to
find only a dozen of them over the past two years.</P>
      <P>The Asiatic water shrew weighs a maximum of 50-60 grams and feeds on water
insects, small fish, and small shrimps. It lives close to the water, with snakes

      <P>All 113 newly elected lawmakers reported to the Legislative Yuan Friday, with
one exception, as the weather and the lower number of lawmakers put a damper on
the usual opening day festivities.</P>
      <P>Legislator-elect Lu Chia-cheng of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) was the
only one who did not register, as the Seventh Legislature marked the start of
its four-year term.</P>
      <P>Lu, the incumbent mayor in Taipei County's Tucheng, spent the day visiting
elderly residents of his city instead. He said earlier he will report  to the
legislature  March 1 to avoid a mayoral by-election.</P>
      <P>By reporting to the legislature next month, Lu will pass the halfway point of

seat. Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei will appoint a replacement for Lu
instead.</P>

lawmaking body and expressed the hope that the new legislature would step up its
service to the public and help improve its image.</P>
      <P>Hoping for an end to the serious gridlock from incessant partisan bickering that
plagued the previous legislature, he also called on the ruling and the
opposition parties to show "rationality" in reviewing major development projects
and budget bills.</P>
      <P>The traditional ritual of new legislators walking up the red carpet was not as
lively and bustling as in the past, the festivities dampened by the dreary rainy
weather and the lower number of lawmakers who will be seated in the restructured
assembly.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Chiu Ching-chun of Hsinchu County, who won 127,892 votes in the
Jan. 12 legislative elections, the most of any candidate, expressed the hope
that a downsized legislature will help upgrade the lawmaking body's efficiency.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Chang Chia-chun, the youngest legislator at age 27, registered in

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's National Penghu University has successfully cultivated a batch of
cuttlefish in a fully controlled environment -- a first-ever achievement that
could increase the population of the species suffering from dwindling numbers.</P>
      <P>"The birth of the fish, kept in an artificially controlled environment, is the
first program of its kind in Taiwan, " Wong Chin-ping, a researcher at the
university on the outlying island of Penghu, said Thursday at a ceremony to
celebrate the university's accomplishment.</P>
      <P>Wong said last spring, the research team successfully cultivated 1,500
cuttlefish from 2,000 eggs collected from the wild, of which 100 were raised in
a tank at a laboratory and were fed blue Buddha shrimps.</P>
      <P>The little fish grew rapidly and weighed 500 to 800 kilograms at nine months
old, Wong said. They later lay eggs and gave birth to more than 1,000 fish at 1
to 3 centimeters in size, with some 500 died before maturity.</P>
      <P>The project's aim is to enable Taiwan to mass produce cuttlefish -- a popular
seafood for consumers. In Taiwan, cuttlefish are made into fish balls, stirred
fried or added to soup.</P>
      <P>However, in recent years, the number of cuttlefish in the natural environment
has been sharply dwindling and there are only a small number of people working
on artificial breeding.</P>
      <P>The project is not only considered an academic achievement but also a great
milestone for stimulating the regeneration of cuttlefish stocks and developing
the marine and aquaculture industries, Wong said.</P>
      <P>The fish species used in the study is the pharaoh cuttlefish. Its normal life
expectancy is about one year and it lays eggs only once in its lifetime, with
the number of eggs at approximately 300 to 500, Wong said.</P>
      <P>"Normally, the female cuttlefish would die once after giving birth and the male
fish would take over the job to care for their babies." Wong added.</P>
      <P>The breeding and growth of the two generations of cuttlefish have been kept in a
fully controlled environment.</P>
      <P>Under "full cultivation" conditions, the survival rate of the cuttlefish species
reached 80 percent, far higher than that in a natural environment, said Hsue
Yung-lin,  a university student participating in the program. Hsue added that
with the feeding methods and procedures of raising the cuttlefish all under
human control, the fish showed more rapid growth than ordinary ones.</P>

      <P>Tseng received one less vote than Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who was re-

      <P>Former Legislator Lin Chung-te of the opposition People First Party was indicted
Friday for buying votes during his re-election compaign in the round-up to the
Jan. 12 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>The Nantou District  Prosecutors  Office in central Taiwan requested the court
hand down a sentence of five years' imprisonment plus a fine of NT$5 million
(US$155,900) to Lin, a prosecutor said Friday.</P>
      <P>Ten other people were also indicted for their suspected roles in the vote-buying

      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang made the remarks while presiding over

central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Two other MOFA offices were also opened Friday in Hualien City in eastern Taiwan

      <P>Huang said the three new offices will help local governments strengthen Taiwan's

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan-developed technology which uses radio frequency chips to trace where
live food, such as chickens and fish, come from has attracted attention from
breeding industry representatives around the world, local officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>Live spotted groupers implanted with the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
chip hit the market for the first time in southern Taiwan's Tainan City in
January.</P>
      <P>Since then, the technology has attracted attention overseas, with breeding
industry representatives from several countries, including the United States,
Japan and Germany, sent to Taiwan in recent months to learn more about the
system, according to officials of a local company which developed the technology
for commercial use.</P>
      <P>Tekho Group officials added that the company hopes to begin exporting the live
food traceability technology within the next two years.</P>
      <P>The RFID chip was developed by the quasi-official Institute for Information
Industry (III), which later transferred the technology to the Tekho Group for
commercial application.</P>
      <P>Tekho Group then cooperated with a restaurant in Tainan to cater the technology
for widespread use.</P>
      <P>Institute officials said that the system allows the history of an individual
spotted fish to be traced from the breeding grounds all the way to the
restaurant table.</P>
      <P>If a customer wants to know about a spotted breeder's history before purchasing
it, a simple scan of the RFID chip implanted below the fish's gill reveals its
complete history, they said.</P>
      <P>"This allows the consumer to enjoy the spotted breeder without any concerns
about safety," one Institute official said.</P>
      <P>They expressed hope that with the new technology, a comprehensive nationwide
live food traceability  system will eventually  be established to ensure
consumer safety.</P>
      <P>Currently, the RFID traceability chip is only available in Tainan City, Tekho
officials said, adding that it will spread to the rest of Taiwan in the near
future.</P>
      <P>Annual output for Taiwan's spotted grouper industry is about NT$3 billion, with
about 80 percent of the fish being exported to Hong Kong and China, according to
the Tekho officials.</P>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislative caucus has vowed to
promote bills aimed at increasing the transparency of the new legislature and
the professionalism of new lawmakers, DPP caucus whip Ker Chien-ming said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Ker made the remarks at a press conference held after newly elected legislators
elected in the Jan. 12 elections reported to duty at the new 113-member
legislature.</P>
      <P>Despite holding only a minority of seats, Ker stressed that DPP legislators will
still focus on "quality" over "quantity" in their performance.</P>
      <P>The DPP only grabbed 27 legislative seats in the Jan. 12 elections, a
humiliating defeat compared to the 81 seats won by the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Ker explained that the DPP caucus will first ask the legislature to review the
Political Donation Act, the Public Functionary Assets Disclosure Act, and other
bills that are designed to establish a clean government.</P>
      <P>In addition, the caucus will push for putting the assets of all lawmakers into
trust, and requiring lawmakers to explain unusual increases in their assets, Ker
said.</P>
      <P>To increase the professionalism of lawmakers, the caucus will promote a
regulation barring lawmakers from serving as on the board of directors for
companies, Ker noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the caucus will also push for the transparency of negotiations
between the ruling and opposition parties as well as live broadcasts of meetings
at the legislature, he said.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the caucus will push for the passage of amendments aimed at
increasing the efficiency of the legislature, better protecting the rights of
laborers, providing better care for disadvantaged children, and carrying out
land tax reforms, according to Ker.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ratio of nonperforming loans on the books of locally owned banks stood at
1.84 percent as of the end of December 2007, a new low since the ratio was
redefined in July 2005, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The nonperforming loan ratio registered at the end of December was 0.29
percentage points lower than that of a month earlier, the commission said.</P>
      <P>The three-year low indicated that banks have become more adept at liquidating or
writing off nonperforming assets and were accelerating their disposal, said an
FSC official.</P>
      <P>Bank loan expansion also helped lower the ratio of nonperforming loans, with
outstanding loans at domestic banks increasing by NT$180 billion in December to
reach NT$17.87 trillion (US$530.78) at the end of the month, the official said.</P>
      <P>Of the amount, nonperforming loans totaled NT$328.1 billion at the end of
December, down from the NT$377.6 billion on the books at the end of the previous
month.</P>
      <P>Prior to July 2005, any loan that was overdue by more than six months in Taiwan
was considered a nonperforming loan. But the FSC tightened the standard to
include loans overdue by more than three months in the "nonperforming" category,
increasing the bad loan ratios of domestic banks.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-run CPC Corp., Taiwan, the country's largest oil refiner, announced
Friday that gasoline and diesel fuel prices will remain unchanged in February.</P>
      <P>Prices of natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas and fuel oil will also be
maintained at the current level to help stabilize consumer prices and boost
industrial competitiveness, CPC said in a statement.</P>
      <P>As a result, prices will remain at NT$32.2 per liter for 98-octane  unleaded
gasoline,  NT$30.7 per liter for 95-octane unleaded, NT$30 per liter for
92-octane unleaded, and NT$27.5 per liter for super diesel fuel.</P>
      <P>Had it followed a floating price mechanism the government introduced in January
2007, however, CPC would have raised the price of gasoline by more than NT$2 a
liter.</P>
      <P>The mechanism was adjusted in September, though, as crude approached US$80 per
barrel. Gasoline prices in the future would be adjusted on a monthly rather than
weekly basis and would not be permitted to exceed 15 percent of the September
price.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs adjusted the 15 percent cap to 12 percent in
November when crude appeared on its way to breaking the US$100 per barrel
barrier and fears of inflation had gripped consumers.</P>
      <P>Calculating the current price level of oil based on a 70/30 mix of Brent and
Dubai crude, CPC said gasoline prices should be 23.39 percent higher than those
of September 2007, well above the 12 percent threshold -- forcing the oil giant
to keep prices steady.</P>
      <P>The pricing mechanism raises gasoline prices by about 80 percent of the crude
oil price increases in the previous two months, so the per liter increase would
have been about NT$2 per liter had the old mechanism remained in effect.</P>

      <P>The government will grant residence to stateless persons from Thailand and
Myanmar who entered Taiwan with fake passposts before May 21, 1999, as long as a
local court has processed their case, National Immigration Agency officials said
Friday.</P>
      <P>If the stateless persons have turned themselves in to authorities and a court
has decided not to indict them, commuted their indictment or settled their case,
those court documents can be used as verification of their stateless status as
part of their application for permanent residence.</P>
      <P>Under the Immigration Act that took effect on May 21, 1999, the stateless
persons were not only required to turn themselves in to authorities but also get
a document from their home country attesting to their inability to return home.</P>
      <P>That documentation proved nearly impossible to get, leaving the cases of many of
the illegal immigrants in limbo. Under Friday's decision, that documentation is
no longer necessary.</P>
      <P>Those individuals from Thailand and Myanmar who arrived with fake travel
documents before May 21, 1999 but did not turn themselves in and had no contact
with local courts, can still report to authorities to obtain court verification
of their stateless status.</P>
      <P>The new measure is intended  to find a solution  to the long-stalled issue
concerning the dilemma faced by ethnic Chinese refugees in northern Thailand and
Myanmar who have entered Taiwan with fake travel documents.</P>
      <P>Many of them are descedents of Kuomintang soldiers who retreated to the region
after losing the civil war in China in 1949.</P>
      <P>The problem remained unanswered after the implementation of the Immigration Act,
which stipulates that stateless people coming to Taiwan from Thailand,  Myanmar
or Indonesia  before the law's implementation shall be granted residence in the
country.</P>
      <P>Applications for permanent residence are being accepted at any agency service

      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin introduced the expo logo and mascot at apress
conference, where he announced that preparations for the event are officially

      <P>"Holding a world-acclaimed event like this will boost Taipei's visibility in the

      <P>Taiwan will become the fourth Asian country to host the highly regarded event,

      <P>Hau said 1,669 logo designs from all over the world, including Germany, the U.S.

the show.</P>
      <P>A logo design by Taiwanese designer and mascot design by local designer Li Kai-

      <P>The AIPH is a coordinating body representing horticultural producers'
organizations throughout the world to stimulate the international marketing of
flowers, plants and landscaping services. Its committee classifies flower fairs
into 4 categories -- A1, A2, B1, and B2 -- based on country's capability and
experience in hosting events.</P>
      <P>Taiwan joined the AIPH in 2004, and was awarded the right to host the show in
2007, said Hsiung-Wen Chen, the commissioner of Taipei City's Department of
Economic Development, the organizer of the fair. He said the Taipei fair is
classified as an A2/B1 event and will run for 171 days from November 2010 to
April 2011,</P>
      <P>"The AIPH will evaluate the overall performance of the organizer and decide if

took the Chinese exam at the invitation of the center, said the exam's
difficulty ranged from median to high, and that students were able to get good
grades if the questions were answered carefully.</P>
      <P>Held once a year, the GSAT is the first college entrance examination students
can take and serves as the primary measuring stick for admission into colleges
or universities in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Students who are not satisfied with their GSAT results can enroll in a second
test, the Department Required Test, which is usually held in July.</P>
      <P>The CECC arranged 30 exam locations this year for examinees, who included 185
students with physical disabilities, Hung said.</P>
      <P>The Chinese exam was followed by mathematics and social sciences, with absenteee
rates of 1.7 percent and 1.73 percent, respectively, Hung said.</P>
      <P>According to those who took the tests, most questions on the mathematics exam
tested basic concepts, with some problems dealing with complex ideas, and
students had to think carefully before giving their answers on social sciences
in order to get good grades, Hung said.</P>
      <P>Other subjects to be tested Saturday are English and natural sciences.</P>

      <P>An exhibition of paintings and calligraphic works by big-name contemporary
Chinese artists is to open Feb. 2 at the Matsu Folklore Culture Museum and will
run until March 2.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, the most important ever hosted on the outlying island, is titled
"Glory on the Voluminous Sea." Altogether 65 masterpieces -- insured for NT$40
million -- will be on display.</P>
      <P>The event is jointly sponsored by the National Museum of History in Taipei,  the
Matsu County  government,  and seven  private organizations.</P>
      <P>The works  in the exhibition  were all painted  by noted contemporary master
artists, including Chi Pai-shih (1863V1957), known for the often playful style
of his watercolor works, and Chang Da-chien (1899-1983), who created a whole new
style of modern Chinese painting in his later years by combining a unique
splashed-ink technique with the masterly texture strokes of his early years.</P>
      <P>Also on display are works by Hsu Pei-hung (1895-1953) , who combined Chinese
brush and ink techniques with Western realism and was particularly famous for
his dynamic paintings of horses, and by Fu Pao-shih (1904-1965), whose landscape
paintings employed skillful use of dots and inking methods, and traditional
Chinese water-and-ink artist Huang Chun-pi (1898-1991).</P>
      <P>Other famed artists featured at the exhibition are Wu Chang-shou (1844-1927),
renowned for his paintings of bamboos, pine trees, plum blossoms and
chrysanthemum; Lin Feng-mian (1900-1991) , who combined the essence of
Occidental art with that of traditional Chinese art; and ink painter Chiang
Chao-shen (1925-1996) , who was noted for his excellence in Chinese ink
painting, calligraphy, poetry and the carving of seals.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Legislative speaker willing to contribute to cross-strait exchanges</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Friday he is willing to contribute to
cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges if the newly elected president feels there is a
need.</P>
      <P>Wang contended that the interests of Taiwan's people lie in reaching out to
enhance cross-strait exchanges and reconciliation so the country can continue to
thrive in a globalizing world.</P>
      <P>He said there is a team in the legislature dealing with cross-strait affairs,
with him serving as a convener, that can help fulfill this mission.</P>
      <P>"After the March 22 presidential election, if the new president feels the need,
the legislature and I are willing to work according to his wishes to contribute
to cross-strait rehabilitation and exchanges, " he said.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference after his swearing-in ceremony, Wang also said
that he will respect the views of the minority party and preside over the
legislature with impartiality, even if the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has
an absolute majority in the body with 81 seats while the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) has only 27.</P>
      <P>He said many people have harbored high expectations of the new legislature, and
vowed to push for a spate of "sunshine" bills so as not to let down the public.</P>
      <P>The efficiency of the legislature and the quality of the bills should also be
upgraded, and the functions of the disciplinary committee strengthened, Wang
said.</P>
      <P>He also said that the eight committees in the legislature should enhance their
ability to review bills and budgets and reduce the need for "closed-door"
coordination that has created misgivings among the public.</P>
      <P>Wang expected  a live broadcasting  system for legislative proceedings should
also be ready at an early date.</P>
      <P>In view  of a legislative  committee  entrusted  with the investigation of the
controversial shooting on the eve of the March 20, 2004 presidential election
that made few inroads into the case, Wang expressed the wish to push for the
institutionalization of the investigative rights of the legislature.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the Council of Grand Justices have ruled that the legislature
should have investigative rights to effectively exercise its legislative power
under the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The March 19 shooting has been widely regarded as having polarized Taiwan's
people, with the KMT accusing President Chen Shui-bian, who won the election by
a razor-thin margin, of staging the shooting to win sympathy votes. The KMT has
not been able to provide substantive evidence to support its claim.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that the Sports Affairs Council's (SAC)
move to Kaohsiung will lead to a marked improvement in the output value of
Taiwan's sports industry and the upgrading of its sports capabilities.</P>
      <P>Chen also indicated that the government will evaluate the performance of the
relocated council, and continue to promote the relocation of other government
organizations to bring more balanced development between northern and southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president  made the remarks while presiding  over the inauguration ceremony
of the relocated SAC, which was moved from Taipei City to the National Sports
Training Center in the Zuoying District of Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>The inauguration  will be followed by the first group of approximately 30 SAC
employees moving into their new offices after the Chinese New Year holidays.
Other staff members will complete the move by Sept. 1.</P>
      <P>The government hopes the move will improve the training of Taiwan's top athletes
ahead of the 2008 Olympic Games and the 2009 World Games in Kaohsiung and help
integrate the selection, training, counseling, and competitive programs of the

    <HEADLINE>DPP candidate launches new book on 'blessed state'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 1 (CNA)
02/01/08  23:12:31
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Frank Hsieh, presidential candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) , published a new book Friday that highlighted his concept of turning
Taiwan into a "blessed state."</P>
      <P>Hsieh introduced  the book to the public at his campaign headquarters, with
representatives from cultural and academic circles taking part, including Taiwan
Thinktank Chairman Chen Po-chih and Lee Min-yung, a well-known poet.</P>
      <P>In his book, Hsieh argues that Taiwan and China should join together to iron out
an approach that works for both sides to resolve their rifts over Taiwan's
sovereignty, instead of resorting to the controversial "1992 consensus" as the
Kuomintang (KMT) has suggested.</P>
      <P>The "1992 consensus" refers to a supposed verbal agreement reached by officials
from the two sides in Hong Kong in 1992 accepting the idea of "one China" with
different interpretations as a formula to overcome sovereignty disputes.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh's book, Taiwan and China should first seek a method accepted
to both sides to break their decades-old political impasse by stepping up
communications  and understanding in a peacemeal fashion, as there is no
"imminent" need to achieve the aim in a short period of time.</P>
      <P>In addition, procedures should be observed by the two sides in seeking a way out
of their existing estrangement.</P>
      <P>"The willingness of Taiwan's people must be taken into account and fully
respected if both sides were to work on a procedural consensus, " he stressed.</P>
      <P>In terms of cross-Taiwan Strait trade and economic relations, Hsieh contended
that a balance must be maintained between Taiwan's national sovereignty and
business competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Hsieh wrote that in light of continued flows of Taiwanese investment to China,
he favors broader economic exchanges across the strait, including permitting
Taiwan-based banks to open branches of affiliates in China and in turn allowing
Chinese banks to set up offices in Taiwan, as the first step toward a greater
opening.</P>
      <P>The DPP presidential candidate also broached his ideas of authorizing multiple
point-to-point direct charter flights across the Taiwan Strait and permitting up
to 3,000 Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan per day -- an increase over his and
the Democratic Progressive Party's government current position of allowing 1,000
visitors per day.</P>
      <P>He also proposed a string of measures to prop up Taiwan's economy and take care
of youth and the underprivileged, such as lowering Taiwan's inheritance tax rate
to 10 percent and building cheaper housing for young adults.</P>
      <P>Hsieh will face KMT rival Ma Ying-jeou  in the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Ma has focused his campaign theme on economic issues and put forward several
major economic policies aimed at improving the people's livelihood and
reinvigorating the economy.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung Public Prosecutors Office indicted three Kaohsiung city government
officials and 18 other individuals Friday on charges of vote buying in an
attempt to help a ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislator get re-
elected in the Jan. 12 elections.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors  are seeking a 14-year sentence for Hsiao Yu-cheng, director of
the Kaohsiung City government's Bureau of Environmental Protection, plus
stripping his civil rights for 10 years after serving the sentence.</P>
      <P>Also  indicted  were  Shih Tao-kun,  an inspector  of the Environmental
Protection Bureau, and Wang Kuo-chuan, a sanitation squad leader. The
prosecutors are seeking 13 years and six and a half years in prison for them,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Hsiao was detained Nov. 24 last year and held for more than one month for
alleged vote-buying activities. The prosecutors charged that he had spent
NT$14,400 of his office funds to treat 17 of his subordinates -- mostly heads of
street cleaning squads in the Sanmin District -- to a dinner in a restaurant in
November, asking them to vote for DPP Legislator Lee Kun-tse, a candidate in the
Jan. 12 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Hsiao insisted he was innocent, saying that he was merely entertaining the
sanitation workers in appreciation of their efforts in helping the city to bring
a dengue fever outbreak under control.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu declined to comment on the prosecution of the three
city government officials, saying that she needed to read the indictment first.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP candidate launches new book on 'blessed state'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 1 (CNA)

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Frank Hsieh, presidential candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) , published a new book Friday that highlighted his concept of turning
Taiwan into a "blessed state."</P>
      <P>Hsieh introduced  the book to the public at his campaign headquarters, with
representatives from cultural and academic circles taking part, including Taiwan
Thinktank Chairman Chen Po-chih and Lee Min-yung, a well-known poet.</P>
      <P>In his book, Hsieh argues that Taiwan and China should join together to iron out
an approach that works for both sides to resolve their rifts over Taiwan's
sovereignty, instead of resorting to the controversial "1992 consensus" as the
Kuomintang (KMT) has suggested.</P>
      <P>The "1992 consensus" refers to a supposed verbal agreement reached by officials
from the two sides in Hong Kong in 1992 accepting the idea of "one China" with
different interpretations as a formula to overcome sovereignty disputes.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh's book, Taiwan and China should first seek a method accepted
to both sides to break their decades-old political impasse by stepping up
communications  and understanding in a peacemeal fashion, as there is no
"imminent" need to achieve the aim in a short period of time.</P>
      <P>In addition, procedures should be observed by the two sides in seeking a way out
of their existing estrangement.</P>
      <P>"The willingness of Taiwan's people must be taken into account and fully
respected if both sides were to work on a procedural consensus, " he stressed.</P>
      <P>In terms of cross-Taiwan Strait trade and economic relations, Hsieh contended
that a balance must be maintained between Taiwan's national sovereignty and
business competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Hsieh wrote that in light of continued flows of Taiwanese investment to China,
he favors broader economic exchanges across the strait, including permitting
Taiwan-based banks to open branches of affiliates in China and in turn allowing
Chinese banks to set up offices in Taiwan, as the first step toward a greater
opening.</P>
      <P>The DPP presidential candidate also broached his ideas of authorizing multiple
point-to-point direct charter flights across the Taiwan Strait and permitting up
to 3,000 Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan per day -- an increase over his and
the Democratic Progressive Party's government current position of allowing 1,000
visitors per day.</P>
      <P>He also proposed a string of measures to prop up Taiwan's economy and take care
of youth and the underprivileged, such as lowering Taiwan's inheritance tax rate
to 10 percent and building cheaper housing for young adults.</P>
      <P>Hsieh will face KMT rival Ma Ying-jeou  in the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Ma has focused his campaign theme on economic issues and put forward several
major economic policies aimed at improving the people's livelihood and
reinvigorating the economy.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that the Sports Affairs Council's (SAC)
move to Kaohsiung will lead to a marked improvement in the output value of
Taiwan's sports industry and the upgrading of its sports capabilities.</P>
      <P>Chen also indicated that the government will evaluate the performance of the
relocated council, and continue to promote the relocation of other government
organizations to bring more balanced development between northern and southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president  made the remarks while presiding  over the inauguration ceremony
of the relocated SAC, which was moved from Taipei City to the National Sports
Training Center in the Zuoying District of Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>The inauguration  will be followed by the first group of approximately 30 SAC
employees moving into their new offices after the Chinese New Year holidays.
Other staff members will complete the move by Sept. 1.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Friday he is willing to contribute to
cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges if the newly elected president feels there is a
need.</P>
      <P>Wang contended that the interests of Taiwan's people lie in reaching out to
enhance cross-strait exchanges and reconciliation so the country can continue to
thrive in a globalizing world.</P>
      <P>He said there is a team in the legislature dealing with cross-strait affairs,
with him serving as a convener, that can help fulfill this mission.</P>
      <P>"After the March 22 presidential election, if the new president feels the need,
the legislature and I are willing to work according to his wishes to contribute
to cross-strait rehabilitation and exchanges, " he said.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference after his swearing-in ceremony, Wang also said
that he will respect the views of the minority party and preside over the
legislature with impartiality, even if the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has
an absolute majority in the body with 81 seats while the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) has only 27.</P>
      <P>He said many people have harbored high expectations of the new legislature, and
vowed to push for a spate of "sunshine" bills so as not to let down the public.</P>
      <P>The efficiency of the legislature and the quality of the bills should also be
upgraded, and the functions of the disciplinary committee strengthened, Wang
said.</P>
      <P>He also said that the eight committees in the legislature should enhance their
ability to review bills and budgets and reduce the need for "closed-door"
coordination that has created misgivings among the public.</P>
      <P>Wang expected  a live broadcasting  system for legislative proceedings should
also be ready at an early date.</P>
      <P>In view  of a legislative  committee  entrusted  with the investigation of the
controversial shooting on the eve of the March 20, 2004 presidential election
that made few inroads into the case, Wang expressed the wish to push for the
institutionalization of the investigative rights of the legislature.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the Council of Grand Justices have ruled that the legislature
should have investigative rights to effectively exercise its legislative power
under the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The March 19 shooting has been widely regarded as having polarized Taiwan's
people, with the KMT accusing President Chen Shui-bian, who won the election by
a razor-thin margin, of staging the shooting to win sympathy votes. The KMT has
not been able to provide substantive evidence to support its claim.</P>

      <P>The number of Internet users in Taiwan reached 14.76 million in 2007, an
increase of 1.7 percent over the year-earlier level, the Institute for
Information Industry (III) estimated Saturday.</P>
      <P>The estimate was based on a survey conducted last August by the institute's
Foreseeing Innovative New Digiservices, which revealed that 64.4 percent of
individuals in Taiwan have access to the Internet, up 0.6 percentage points from
the previous year.</P>
      <P>Internet use is more common among residents in northern Taiwan than in other
parts of the country, with 66 percent of northern Taiwan residents and 73.6
percent of those in Taipei City being Internet users, the survey results show.</P>
      <P>Home was mentioned by 88.2 percent of users as where they usually use the
Internet, compared with offices by 33.7 percent of users and schools or research
institutes by 25.5 percent of users. Less than 16 percent of users said they use
Internet cafes or other public establishments for surfing the Web.</P>
      <P>Respondents who had used the Internet at home during the month before the survey
was conducted went online on 21.8 days of the month on average, with each
spending an average of 16 hours online per week.</P>
      <P>Classifying home Internet users according the amount of time they spend online,
43 percent are defined as heavy users who are online more than two hours per day
and 31.9 percent are light users who are online no more than one hour per day.</P>
      <P>The survey, carried out last Aug. 4-23, was part of a study on the status of

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislative caucus whip Yeh Yi-jin
said Saturday that the decision to hold the U.N.-bid referendum in tandem with
the March 22 presidential election is meant to save administrative costs and is
not an attempt to "swindle votes."</P>
      <P>Yeh made the comments in response to main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
legislative caucus whip Kuo Su-chun's accusation the day before that the DPP is
aiming to garner more votes for its presidential candidate, Frank Hsieh, by
moving to hold the referendum and presidential election simultaneously.</P>
      <P>The Central Election Commission  announced Friday that two referendums -- one
initiated by the DPP on the country applying to join the United Nations under
the name Taiwan and the other initiated by the KMT on using the name Republic of
China when applying to return to the world body -- will be held alongside the
presidential poll.</P>
      <P>In response, Kuo said the KMT is mapping out countermeasures to the move to hold
the referendums and presidential poll together and that the party will make a
final decision on the matter before the first session of the new legislature
opens Feb. 22.</P>
      <P>Speaking to reporters Saturday, Yeh said that although the KMT has an
overwhelming majority in the new legislature which gives it the power "to do
whatever it wants, " she hopes the party will remember that Taiwan gaining entry
into the United Nations is the desire of the people.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the KMT should "respect the will of the people " and expressed the hope
that the party will not move to oppose the referendum.</P>
      <P>In January, the KMT launched a boycott of the two referendums -- one launched by
itself on giving the legislature the power to investigate government corruption
and the other initiated by the DPP on recovering the KMT's "ill-gotten" assets
-- that were held in tandem with the legislative elections. Both referendums
were a resounding failure, with only a quarter of the voters even bothering to
participate.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that holding the U.N. bid referendum alongside the presidential
election is not the key issue.</P>
      <P>"The key issue is that Taiwan entering the United Nations is the will of the
majority of the public, " she said, adding that the KMT should think twice

      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung expressed regret
Saturday over the Central Election Commission's (CEC's) decision the day before
to hold two U.N. bid referendums in tandem with the March 22 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Speaking with reporters after meeting with KMT youth volunteers at the
Legislative Yuan, Wu said the KMT "is not opposed to referendums, but rather to
hijacking elections with referendums."</P>
      <P>On Friday, the CEC announced that the two referendums -- one initiated by the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on the country applying to join the
United Nations under the name Taiwan and the other launched by the KMT on the
Republic of China applying to return to the world body under its official title
-- will be held alongside the presidential poll.</P>
      <P>During a rare meeting with Chen in January, Wu recalled that he had reminded
Chen of the importance of the CEC remaining an impartial body.</P>
      <P>He further expressed the hope that Chen will make personnel changes at the CEC
to achieve this goal, saying the commission "should not be run as an
organization that is controlled by a particular party."</P>
      <P>"Unfortunately, I have still not received a response from the president on this
matter," he added.</P>
      <P>As to whether the KMT will move to boycott the referendums in response to the
CEC's decision as it did with the two referendums held alongside the legislative
elections Jan. 12, Wu said this depends  on how the situation  unfolds,  adding
that the KMT headquarters had yet to make a final decision on the matter.</P>
      <P>In the legislative polls, the KMT called for voters not to cast ballots in the
two accompanying referendums -- one launched by itself on giving the legislature
the power to investigate government corruption, and the other initiated by the
DPP on retrieving the KMT's "ill-gotten" assets.</P>
      <P>Earlier Saturday, KMT legislative caucus whip Kuo Su-chun said the party is

      <P>A recent Chinese tax reduction on ethanolamine products might help Taiwanese
petrochemical exports to China outplay foreign competitors in the red-hot
Chinese market, a senior official of the Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) under
the Ministry of Economic Affairs said Saturday.</P>
      <P>China cut an anti-dumping tax imposed on ethanolamine imports from Taiwanese
petrochemical manufacturer Oriental Union Chemical Co. to 5.3 percent from 20
percent, according to a Jan. 31 announcement issued by China's Ministry of
Commerce (MOC).</P>
      <P>Oriental Union Chemical filed an appeal with the MOC in 2006 pleading for a
reversal of the ministry's previous decision to impose a 20 percent anti-dumping
tax on the company. After a year of investigation, the Chinese ministry decided
that the company showed no trade dumping inclinations and thus awarded a massive
tax reversal in its favor.</P>
      <P>Describing the ruling as an opportunity, BOFT Deputy Director-General Wu Hsin-
hua called for more Taiwan companies to ask the MOC to reduce its anti-dumping
tax rates.</P>
      <P>From 2004,  China has imposed heavy anti-dumping taxes on ethanolamine products
imported from foreign countries, such as Japan, the United States and Taiwan,
with tax rates ranging from 20 percent to 74 percent, to prevent foreign
products monopolizing the market and boost burgeoning Chinese petrochemical
companies.</P>
      <P>Japan's Nippon Shokubai Co. was also given a tax reduction on its ethanolamine
products, down to 7.3 percent from its previous 74 percent, according to the
same Chinese statement.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's petrochemical industry is facing raw material shortages because of
soaring global oil prices and a number of manufacturers have begun to develop
value-added product lines such as ethanolamine manufacturers that focus on
pesticides and pharmaceutical products to diversify their investments.</P>

      <P>At the ceremony, Hau urged citizens to take advantage of the premium modern
facilities at the brand-new community sports center -- the sixth of its kind
built and operated by the city government.</P>
      <P>An avid jogger, Ma, who served as Taipei mayor from 1998-2006, said he took
measures during his mayoral tenure to encourage citizens to take physical
exercise as a way to keep healthy, which included building community sports
centers.</P>
      <P>He also instructed more than 130 public schools with outdoor playgrounds to be
opened to the public as exercise areas and outlined a policy aimed at equipping
every district of the city with a community sports center.</P>
      <P>Taipei now has six such facilities and in the next year, the Xinyi and Neihu
districts will each also get their own sports centers, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Touting the facilities in the Zhongshan, Zhongcheng, Beitou, Nankang, Wanhua and
Shihlin districts, Hau described the charge for using the facilities as cheap.</P>
      <P>Citing the Shihlin Sports Center as an example, Hau said users of the center's
modern swimming pool have to pay just NT$110 for entry.</P>
      <P>In addition to the pool, the center, built in a 10-floor building with two
underground floors serving as parking places, is also equipped with facilities

economic policies of the two presidential candidates, according to the results
of a survey released Saturday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Thinktank, which conducted the survey, said that 72.9 percent of the
respondents said they do not know about the economic vision for Taiwan held by
Frank Hsieh, the presidential candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party, when he "advocated a thriving economy."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, up to 91.8 percent of the respondents said they have no idea about
the economic policies of Ma Ying-jeou, the presidential candidate of the main
opposition Kuomintang, other than that he advocates a further opening of cross-
Taiwan Strait trade.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Thinktank conducted the survey Jan. 24-25 among eligible voters. A total
of 1,087 effective samples were collected with a margin of error of 3.2
percentage points.</P>
      <P>Asked if direct postal, trade and transportation links -- commonly known as the
three links -- between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are pivotal to
promoting  cross-strait  economic development, 50 percent said they are, while
35.7 percent said they are not.</P>
      <P>On whether a further opening of cross-strait relations will bring about
substantive assistance to their personal economic situations, 31.3 percent of
the respondents answered in the affirmative, compared with 54.8 percent who did
not.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's advocacy of "mitigating the burden on youth by helping them buy houses,
including building public housing complexes for young people" received 71
percent support from those polled, compared with 15.8 percent who disapproved.</P>
      <P>His proposal of "normalizing cross-strait charter flights to avoid disputes over
whether they are domestic or international routes" received support of 57.9
percent of the respondents, compared with 18 percent who expressed opposition to
the suggestion.</P>
      <P>At present, charter flights across the Taiwan Strait are launched for four
holiday period -- Chinese New Year, Tombsweeping Day, the Dragon Boat Festival
and the Mid-Autumn Festival.</P>
      <P>Asked whose economic policies -- Hsieh's or Ma's -- will best advance the
wellbeing of the Taiwanese, 29.8 percent said Hsieh's are better, while 30.2
percent said Ma's are more acceptable, while 40 percent refused to comment.</P>
      <P>Asked about their attitude if Taiwan cooperates with China and sees an economic
turnaround, but has to accept Beijing's "one China" principle like Hong Kong has
done, 60.7 percent said they would be opposed to such an approach, compared with
24.4 percent who said they would be in favor.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chinese New Year a rarity for many migrant workers in Taiwan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/02/08  18:49:43</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA Staff Reporter</P>
      <P>Taipei, Feb. 2 (CAN) In Chinese societies, the most important festival is the
Lunar New Year, when families reunite in a holiday atmosphere.</P>
      <P>Many migrant workers in Taiwan, however, do not have the luxury of a holiday.</P>
      <P>Lunar New Year's day falls this year on Feb. 7 and most people have six days
off, although many workers from Southeast Asia will see their workloads
increased, particularly the 160,000 domestic workers and caregivers who make up
almost half of the 360,000 foreign laborers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Such is the case for Mary, a young Indonesian who came to Taiwan one-and-a-half
years ago. Working as a domestic helper, she starts her day at 6 a.m. by
preparing breakfast, then goes to market, cleans the house and takes out the
garbage. She doesn't get to call it a day until after 11 p.m. Ostensibly hired
to take care of an elderly member of her bosses family, in reality that is only
a small portion of her strenuous workload.</P>
      <P>Asked if she is allowed any days off, Mary said her employer deducts her daily
wage of about NT$500 if she takes any time off, so she usually takes only two
days off per month.</P>
      <P>Chinese New Year is not a holiday for her. On the contrary, as family members of
her employer get together for the traditional reunion, she will have an even
heavier workload.</P>
      <P>"What can I do? I came here to make money. Others (her compatriots) are in the
same situation," Mary said resignedly, adding that a year-end bonus of just
NT$5,000 is her only consolation.</P>
      <P>Another Indonesian, Tina, came to Taiwan also to look after an old stroke
victim. Every night she has to turn the old person's body to prevent bedsores
and do regular medical checks every 90 minutes, so she has hardly had any normal
sleep in the past three years, not to mention the housework she must do in the
daytime. However, she still believes she made the right decision to come to work
in Taiwan, saying that "it's easier to earn money here."</P>
      <P>Another girl from the Philippines who has taken care of an old person in Taiwan
for more than two years without a break, received this year a red envelope
containing a bonus of NT$10,000. But she confessed that she would prefer some
days off instead.</P>
      <P>Not all the guest workers have the luck to be hired by a generous or wealthy
employer. Another Filipina, who requested anonymity, has just finished her
three-year contract taking care of a sick elderly person and received a bonus of
a paltry NT$300. Asked why she does not want to renew her contract, she laughed:
"I don't want to come back anymore! I really need a rest."</P>
      <P>"Migrant caregivers are not covered by the Labor Standards Law, " a social
worker of the Taiwan International Workers' Association (TIWA) noted, adding
that "the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) has promised to apply the law to these
workers in two years, but as the CLA personnel have changed several times in
recent years, we are not sure if the promise will be kept."</P>
      <P>Last December, TIWA organized the third "I Want Days Off" demonstration with the
participation of 1,600 demonstrators, to express their frustration and anger at
not being protected by the Labor Standards Law.</P>
      <P>While it is true that not all Southeast Asian people celebrate Chinese New Year,
migrant workers are also deprived of vacations on other occasions as well, such
as Christmas for Catholics from the Philippines, Songkran for Thai and Cambodian
people, and Al Hijra for Indonesian Muslims.</P>
      <P>As people in Taiwan celebrate Chinese New Year, a little care or love for their
foreign workers might make their celebrations more significant.</P>

      <P>People should be sure to delete their personal data before recycling old mobile
phones or optical discs, Environmental  Protection  Administration  (EPA)
officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The step is crucial to protecting their privacy and ensuring the information
stored in the devices is not misused by criminals, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The EPA officially listed mobile phones and optical discs as recyclable in April
2006.</P>
      <P>By the end of 2007, approximately 2.04 million mobile phones with a total weight
of 310,000 metric tons were discarded by the public for recycling, while the
number of waste optical discs for recycling amounted to 67 million units with a
total weight of 1.11 million metric tons, EPA tallies show.</P>
      <P>According to the EPA, in addition to the plastic covers, mobile phone parts made
of metals such as copper, gold, silver and palladium can also be reused.</P>
      <P>However, as harmful materials such as lead, cadmium and arsenic can also be
found in mobile phones, they can pollute the environment and threaten human
health if they are dumped in landfills or incinerated, EPA officials said.</P>
      <P>Optical discs are mainly made of polycarbonate and plated with precious metals
such as gold and silver, which can all be reused, they said.</P>

      <P>The first direct charter flight between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait for
this year's Chinese New Year holiday landed at Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport Saturday, carrying 141 Taiwanese businessmen operating in China, along
with their families.</P>
      <P>The flight from Beijing was offered by China's Hainan Airlines to bring
Taiwanese people home for the Feb. 6-11 holiday.</P>
      <P>Several hours later, a similar holiday charter flight from Shanghai to Taipei
arrived, delayed by an hour because of heavy snow at the Shanghai airport.</P>
      <P>Gao Ling-feng, a pop singer who was on the flight, said recent snowstorms have
caused severe damage in southern China and the Yangtze River Basin. Power
systems and road traffic were mostly cut in those regions, he said, noting that
it took him a lot of effort to board a train from Nanjing to Shanghai to catch
the flight.</P>
      <P>"Many Taiwanese entertainers are still trapped in China, " he added.</P>
      <P>The cross-strait charter flight services are being operated by 12 carriers from
the two sides offering a total of 93 flights during the holiday period that will
end Feb. 12, according to a consensus reached among airline operators on both
sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>Chinese New Year's Day falls on Feb. 7 this year.</P>
      <P>Direct flights between Taiwan and China are prohibited due to the two sides'
political differences, except on major holidays such as Chinese New Year when
they provide ease of travel for many of the more than 1 million Taiwanese
citizens living in China, many of whom wish to spend the holiday in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taoyuan County most physically challenged-friendly area in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taoyuan County and Kaohsiung City are among the most physically challenged-
friendly areas in Taiwan in terms of public infrastructure and facilities,
according to the results of a study released Saturday by the Construction and
Planning Agency under the Ministry of the Interior (MOI).</P>
      <P>The agency launched a project last summer aimed at creating an obstacle-free
environment  for  physically  disabled  citizens islandwide.</P>
      <P>As part of the project, the agency formed a task force made up of experts and
members of several organizations, including the Eden Social Welfare Association,
the Republic of China League of Welfare Associations  for the Disabled,  the
National  Association  of Architects, ROC and the MOI's Architecture and
Building Research Institute.</P>
      <P>The task force dispatched personnel to each of Taiwan's 25 cities and counties
to conduct the survey between Aug. 20 and Sept. 7.</P>
      <P>Agency officials said that because of differences in terms of scale of resources
and stage of development, the various regions of Taiwan were divided into three
categories -- metropolises, townships and villages, and remote areas and
outlying islands -- for the purposes of the study</P>
      <P>In the metropolises category, Taoyuan County, Kaohsiung City and Taipei City
were rated the three most physically challenged-friendly places, in that order.</P>
      <P>In the townships and villages category,  Kaohsiung County, Taichung County and
Yilan County finished in the top three spots, while in the remote areas and
outlying islands category, Lianchang County was rated the most physically
challenged-friendly place, followed by Kinmen Island and Penghu County.</P>
      <P>In the survey, two areas were found to not be up to par in terms of adequate
public facilities catering to the needs of the physically challenged. Both were
in the township and villages category -- Yunlin County, which received a lowly
score of 47.33 out of a possible 100, and Hsinchu County, which received a score
of 58.17.</P>
      <P>Agency officials said the results of the study will be sent to the Executive
Yuan's Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics for reference in
making adjustments to fund allocations to various government programs aimed at
creating an obstacle-free environment for Taiwan's physically challenged
citizens.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Thousands of people packed shoulder to shoulder into Taipei City's Dihua Street
to attend a food festival Friday just before the last weekend prior to the Lunar
New Year.</P>
      <P>The festival, now in its 10th year, is being organized by the Taipei city
government for the first time this year in several areas of the city to offer
the public alternative locations to buy traditional food for the Lunar New Year
holiday, which starts Feb. 6 this year.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, local residents would store food supplies for the Lunar New Year
holiday, as most stores, restaurants and markets used to close for the holiday
period.</P>
      <P>Today, local residents do not really need to store food because they can easily
purchase fresh or frozen meals from convenience stores, which never close.</P>
      <P>The festival began Jan. 18 and will run through Feb. 5.</P>
      <P>Last years event attracted at least 700,000 visitors from home and abroad keen
to take part in the frenzied and colorful atmosphere of shopping for treats and
delicacies for the holiday, things such as dumplings, peanuts, grilled sausages,
dried shredded squid, stir fried chestnuts and sticky milk candies, many of
which are handed out in the form of free samples by vendors eager to get one up
on the competition.</P>
      <P>To quench their thirst, visitors to the festival also find themselves with a
wide range of choices from sweet grape wine, cold sugarcane juice, hot ginger
herbal tea, starfruit juice and coffee.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Post Co. and President Transnet Corp., which manages the Japanese fast-
delivery service Takkyubin in Taiwan, has also set up stands to help visitors
who want to deliver newly purchased goods to their homes or those of their
families and friends.</P>
      <P>An absence of English signs at the street apparently did not stop some
foreigners from getting a taste of Taiwanese life.</P>
      <P>Dmitri Detwyler, a 28-year-old who working as an English teacher, was spotted
among a few foreign visitors to the street that day.</P>
      <P>Describing the festival ascrowded and noisy, Detwyler said it is particularly
special in that it sells mostly food, rather than the clothes and bags that
usually feature at other night markets in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked if he would recommend the festival market to other foreign visitors to
Taiwan, Detwyler, clutching a plastic bag of dried fruit and crackers,
replied:Sure, if they love to eat.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu said Saturday that she has "every faith in the
integrity" of a Kaohsiung city government official and that she will not
consider replacing him for the time being.</P>
      <P>She was referring to Hsiao Yu-cheng, director of the Kaohsiung city government's
Bureau of Environmental Protection, who Kaohsiung prosecutors have indicted on
charges of vote-buying. The prosecutors have demanded a 14-year jail sentence
plus the stripping of his civil rights for 10 years after he serves the
sentence.</P>
      <P>Hsiao was detained Nov. 24 last year and held for more than one month for
alleged vote-buying. The prosecutors accused him of spending NT$14,400
(US$436.36) of his office funds to treat 17 of his subordinates -- mostly heads
of street cleaning squads in the city's Sanmin district -- to a dinner in a
restaurant earlier that month, during which he asked them to vote for ruling
Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Lee Kun-tse, a candidate in the Jan. 12
legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that after Hsiao was detained, the Taiwan High Court's Kaohsiung
branch twice revoked the detention ruling by the Kaohsiung District Court, which
she claimed "proves the stark differences in the interpretation of the case."</P>
      <P>She claimed that Hsiao's integrity is "beyond doubt, " as is the integrity of
his subordinates.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that prosecutors have been "specifically" targeting Hsiao, adding
that Taiwan society is full of people who view things from "a certain political
viewpoint, so that they can give rulings that do not live up to the public's
concept of right and wrong."</P>
      <P>Hsiao served as spokesman for Chen's election campaign office before she won the

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu returned to Taiwan Saturday from a tour of three of
Taiwan's six diplomatic allies in the South Pacific -- the Marshall Islands,
Nauru and the Solomon Islands.</P>
      <P>Lu, who departed Taipei Monday on the diplomatic tour, said she envies the three
allies, who have become independent since World War II and asked why Taiwan, who
was freed from Japanese colonial rule in 1945, cannot become independent like
them.</P>
      <P>Lu said all three nations have seen leadership changes in recent weeks and that
she met with their new leaders and invited them to visit Taiwan in March or
April to help cement bilateral diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>She said the visit was "not only for President Chen Shui-bian, but for the new
president to be elected in the March 22 election."</P>
      <P>According to Lu, the country's new president might take one year or two to
become as "well-versed in diplomatic, internal, economic and financial affairs"
as Chen.</P>
      <P>"We are worried about the situation, as it will give rise to a Chinese
diplomatic coup in this diplomatic vacuum period," she said.</P>
      <P>She was referring to Chinese tactics to use "checkbook diplomacy" to undermine
relations between the Republic of China and its allies.</P>
      <P>Touching on the recent controversy over whether main opposition Kuomintang
presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou has a U.S. green card, Lu said that rather
than getting mired in a war of words, the public should demand that new leader
unequivocally say if he is committed to the independence and sovereignty of
Taiwan, claiming that "this is the issue that the voters are most concerned
with."</P>
      <P>Frank Hsieh, the standard bearer of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, has
accused Ma over the past week of lacking integrity and loyalty because Ma held a
green card in the 1970s when he was a student. Ma pointed out, however, that he
has not used the green card to enter the U.S. for more than two decades and that
it has therefore long since become invalid.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that construction of a runway on the
remote Taiping Island in the South China Sea is mainly for humanitarian
purposes.</P>
      <P>Chen was quoted as having made the remarks while presiding over the inauguration
ceremony for the runway on Taiping Island earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>According to a report released by the Military News Agency, Chen flew in a
military aircraft to Taiping Island at around noon to officiate at the airstrip
inauguration ceremony and extend his regards and concerns for personnel
stationed there ahead of the Lunar New Year festival.</P>
      <P>Chen praised the military officers and enlisted men for their high efficiency in
completing the airstrip construction in just 273 days, the report said.</P>
      <P>A total of 581 service personnel were involved in the runway construction
project, and the two top leading officers -- Col. Chen Huang-cheng and Capt. Lin
Hung-chieh -- have not taken a single day off since last August, the report
added.</P>
      <P>The new Taiping runway is transformed from a central road on the island. The
road was extended and expanded into a 1,150-meter-long, 30-meter-wide cement
path that will be used as the main traffic trunk most of the time and as an
airstrip during emergencies so that transport planes can land and take off.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed his admiration for close cooperation among various military units
and the Coast Guard Administration in carrying out the tough construction
project which covered land preparation, shipment of construction materials and
equipment from Taiwan to the remote island, weather forecast, navigation route
evaluation, equipment maintenance, geological survey and building wrok.</P>
      <P>MND officials said only C-130 transport planes can make landings and take-offs
on the island, which is located some 1,600 kilometers southwest of Taiwan
proper. It takes three to four days for a one-way voyage between the island and
the southern Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Taiping is the largest islet of the Nansha or Spratly island group in the South
China Sea. With surrounding countries increasing their activities in the region
in recent years, the number of shipwrecks and cases involving fishermen getting
injured or missing has increased, making it necessary to build an airstrip on
the Taiping Island to facilitate emergency response and humanitarian relief,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>Last November, Chen went on, scores of Chinese, Philippine and Vietnamese
fishing boats were stranded in the Spratlys area. The Philippine military
authorities sent a trainer on a sear and rescue mission,  but the military plane
lost contact. The Philippine authorities then sought the help of Taiwan
personnel stationed on Taiping Island. The case highlighted the need to enhance
the island's humanitarian  relief  capacity,  Chen noted,  adding  that the
construction of an airstrip on the island is for humanitarian purpose only.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian came up with a Spratly Initiative Saturday during a
visit to the Taiwan-held Taiping Island in the South Chin Sea, urging all
surrounding countries to cooperate in regional environmental protection instead
of bickering over sovereignty claims.</P>
      <P>Taiping is the largest in the Spratly island chain which is composed of a string
of rocky outcrops possibly holding large oil and gas deposits. Besides Taiwan,
five other countries -- China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei --
also claim sovereignty over the Spratlys.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the inauguration ceremony for a 1,150-meter airstrip on Taiping
Island, Chen said Taiwan is willing to accept the principles and spirit of the
Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea signed between
ASEAN member states and China in 2002 on an equal footing. The declaration calls
for resolving sovereignty disputes with peaceful means and formulating a code of
conduct for the South China Sea.</P>
      <P>In the face of the threat of global warming,  Chen said exploration of natural
resoruces in the South China Sea should give priority  to maritime ecological
conservation  and sustainable development.</P>
      <P>He promised that Taiwan will invite international ecologists and representatives
of major environmental groups to visit Taiwan-held islands in the South China
Sea, including Dongsha (Pratas) Islands, the Taiping Island and Chungzhou reefs,
for survey and research purposes.</P>
      <P>To shun the sensitive sovereignty issues, Chen suggested that a non-governmental
South China Sea research center be established to facilitate international
cooperation in protecting natural ecology and resources in the region.</P>
      <P>Chen made the half-day visit to Taiping Island to preside over the inauguration
of the airstrip which was completed in January to supplement coastguard
facilities on the island for emergency and humanitarian relief operations.</P>
      <P>Chen was accompanied by Defense Minister Lee Tien-yu, Interior Minister Lee Yi-
yang, Coast Guard Administration Minister Wang Chin-wang and Presidential Office
Deputy Secretary-General Chen Chi-mai on the unpredecented visit to the Taiping
Island aboard an Air Force C-130 transport plane.</P>
      <P>Noting  that construction  of the airstrip  is mainly for humanitarian purposes,
Chen praised the military officers and enlisted men for their high efficiency in
completing the airstrip in just 273 days.</P>
      <P>A total of 581 service personnel were involved in the runway construction
project, and the two top leading officers -- Col. Chen Huang-cheng and Capt. Lin
Hung-chieh -- have not taken a single day off since last August.</P>
      <P>The new Taiping runway is transformed from a central road on the island. The
road was extended and expanded into a 1,150-meter-long, 30-meter-wide cement
path that will be used as the main traffic trunk most of the time and as an
airstrip during emergencies so that transport planes can land and take off.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed his admiration for close cooperation among various military units
and the Coast Guard Administration in carrying out the tough construction
project which covered land preparation, shipment of construction materials and
equipment from Taiwan to the remote island, weather forecast, navigation route
evaluation, equipment maintenance, geological survey and building wrok.</P>
      <P>Only C-130 transport planes can make landings and take-offs on the island, which
is located some 1,600 kilometers southwest of Taiwan proper. It takes three to
four days for a one-way voyage between the island and the southern Taiwan port
city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>With surrounding countries increasing their activities in the region in recent
years, the number of shipwrecks and cases involving  fishermen getting injured
or missing has increased, making it necessary to build an airstrip on the
Taiping Island to facilitate emergency response and humanitarian relief, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Last November, Chen went on, scores of Chinese, Philippine and Vietnamese
fishing boats were stranded in the Spratlys area. The Philippine military
authorities sent a trainer on a sear and rescue mission,  but the military plane
lost contact. The Philippine authorities then sought the help of Taiwan
personnel stationed on Taiping Island. The case highlighted the need to enhance
the island's humanitarian  relief  capacity,  Chen noted,  adding  that the
construction of an airstrip on the island is for humanitarian purpose only.</P>
      <P>Chen was originally scheduled to make a visit to Dongsha Island following the
Taiping trip to extend regards and concerns for service members posted there
ahead of the Lunar New Year. But inclement weather forced Chen to cancel the
travel plan. Chen extended his Chinese New Year greetings to service members in
Dongsha via phone after his return to Taipei.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President proposes Spratly Initiative on Taiping Island visit</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian came up with a Spratly Initiative Saturday during a
visit to the Taiwan-held Taiping Island in the South Chin Sea, urging all
surrounding countries to cooperate in regional environmental protection instead
of bickering over sovereignty claims.</P>
      <P>Taiping is the largest in the Spratly island chain which is composed of a string
of rocky outcrops possibly holding large oil and gas deposits. Besides Taiwan,
five other countries -- China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei --
also claim sovereignty over the Spratlys.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the inauguration ceremony for a 1,150-meter airstrip on Taiping
Island, Chen said Taiwan is willing to accept the principles and spirit of the
Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea signed between
ASEAN member states and China in 2002 on an equal footing. The declaration calls
for resolving sovereignty disputes with peaceful means and formulating a code of
conduct for the South China Sea.</P>
      <P>In the face of the threat of global warming,  Chen said exploration of natural
resoruces in the South China Sea should give priority  to maritime ecological
conservation  and sustainable development.</P>
      <P>He promised that Taiwan will invite international ecologists and representatives
of major environmental groups to visit Taiwan-held islands in the South China
Sea, including Dongsha (Pratas) Islands, the Taiping Island and Chungzhou reefs,
for survey and research purposes.</P>
      <P>To shun the sensitive sovereignty issues, Chen suggested that a non-governmental
South China Sea research center be established to facilitate international
cooperation in protecting natural ecology and resources in the region.</P>
      <P>Chen made the half-day visit to Taiping Island to preside over the inauguration
of the airstrip which was completed in January to supplement coastguard
facilities on the island for emergency and humanitarian relief operations.</P>

      <P>Newly sworn-in legislators of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will strive
to build "new image" for the Legislative Yuan by not being extravagant, among
other things, a KMT official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>KMT Central Policy Committee Executive Director Lin Yi-shih said that all newly
elected KMT legislators have been told to stick to legislative regulations by
controlling spending on refurbishing their research offices at the Legislative
Yuan building and keeping it under NT$100,000 (US$3,106)</P>
      <P>The lawmakers of the KMT -- which now holds an absolute majority with 81 seats
in the downsized, restructured 113-member legislature after the Jan. 12
legislative polls -- should be particularly careful in their behavior so as to
help build a "new and clean" image of the Legislative Yuan, to which the voters
have given the KMT a clear mandate to continue its program of reform, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin called for all new KMT lawmakers to observe the regulation, pointing out
that all members of the KMT legislative caucus voted to pass a "no more than
NT$100,000 refurbishment spending" resolution Feb. 1, when the 7th Legislature
was sworn in.</P>
      <P>Lin said that if some KMT legislators cannot prevent their spending from
exceeding NT$100,000, they will have to pay for the excess themselves.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said, the KMT legislative caucus will suggest, if necessary, to
have a list of spending by all legislators from all parties for refurbishment of
their research offices published to allow the general public to better
understand the operations of the Legislative Yuan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Philippines representative to Taiwan Antonio Basilio said recently that the
Philippines "will continue to enhance its relationships with Taiwan, "
downplaying controversy over the disputed Spratly Islands.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian visited Taiping Island Saturday -- the largest of the
Spratly islands -- to inaugurate a new airstrip there, arousing concern and
protest from the Philippine government. Basilio expressed concern over the visit
but said Taiwan will remain a very important economic partner of the
Philippines.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Philippines and Taiwan are in the final stage of completing the
negotiations for an "Economic Corridor, " Basilio expressed confidence that it
will help Taiwanese businesses tap markets in Southeast  Asia when the member
countries  of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) implement a
Free Trade Agreement (FTA), from which Taiwan is excluded.</P>
      <P>The Economic Corridor, based on a bilateral Memorandum of Understanding signed
Dec. 6, 2005, aims at linking the Subic and Clark Special Economic Zones in the
Philippines with the Economic Processing Zones in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>By linking the economic and export processing zones and allowing easier product
and manpower movement, Taiwan and the Philippines will be able to further expand
trade relations, creating a win-win situation, Armand Arreza, administrator and
CEO of the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority, was quoted as saying while visiting
Taiwan in May 2007 to review the progress of the Economic Corridor.</P>
      <P>Tallies from various sources suggest that Taiwanese products will lose their
competitiveness in the ASEAN market as tariffs on all products within ASEAN
member countries are set to be completely eliminated by 2015.</P>
      <P>Basilio said that if Taiwanese businesses meet the "local content" criteria of
the Philippines,  their products will be considered products of the Philippines
and will therefore be eligible for duty free treatment in ASEAN, adding that
Subic Bay and Clark are working hard to improve infrastructure, with the hope
that the plan can be accomplished later this year.</P>
      <P>Referring  to Taiwanese  business interests  in setting up production bases in
Southeast Asia, Basilio said that "we want to offer the Philippines as a
location."</P>
      <P>Bilateral trade between Taiwan and the Philippines reached US$7.2 billion  in
2006,  with  Taiwan  ranking  as the Philippines' sixth-largest trading partner,
according to statistics from Taiwan's Bureau of Trade.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Basilio encouraged Taiwanese tourists to visit his country during the
Lunar New Year holiday amid increasing worries that snowstorms hitting China
might hamper their plans of visiting China.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is the fifth-biggest source of tourists to the Philippines,  Basilio
also  promised  to help eliminate  visa requirements.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is continuing to communicate with and explain to countries that have
expressed concerns over a trip by President Chen Shui-bian to Taiping Island in
the disputed Spratly islands and Taiwan's construction of a runway there, a top
foreign official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Chen's visit to the island in the South China Sea and construction
of the airstrip there is mainly for humanitarian purposes, Ministry of Foreign
Affairs spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh made the remarks in the wake of a protest lodged
by the Philippines a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Citing a Spratly initiative broached by Chen stressing that "the sovereignty
dispute should be replaced with environmental protection and depletion of
resources should be replaced with sustainable ecology, " Yeh called on all
countries concerned for a peaceful solution to the disputes by setting a
strategic dialogue mechanism and including Taiwan in the mechanism.</P>
      <P>Chen visited the Taiwan-held Taiping Island, the largest island in the Spratlys
group, to preside over the inauguration ceremony for a 1,150-meter airstrip on
the island a day earlier.</P>
      <P>The move immediately drew protests from other countries that claim all or part

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Chen Ming-tong urged Beijing Sunday not
to "twist" Taiwan's referendum on the country's U.N. membership bid to be held
along with the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chen made the call after the Chinese communist party's Central Office for Taiwan
Affairs and the Taiwan Affairs Office of State Council issued a statement the
previous day objecting to the referendum initiated by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>In the statement, Beijing accused Taiwan of seeking to alter the status quo
across the Taiwan Strait and of moving toward de-jure independence by having the
referendum.</P>
      <P>"It is no surprise at all that China would issue such a statement now to set the
tone for Taiwan's U.N. membership bid," Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC head, Beijing would have chosen the timing probably because
the Central Election Commission maintained its decision last Friday to hold the
DPP-proposed referendum and another by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
alongside the presidential poll.</P>
      <P>Chen called on Beijing to face up to Taiwan's public opinion in this regard and
not to "misinterpret" the DPP's referendum aimed at gauging public opinion on
the country's pursuit of U.N. membership under the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Beijing's twisted interpretation viewing the DPP's referendum as a covert move
toward de-jure Taiwan independence will only further push Taiwan's people away
from China," he said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan only hopes to transmit its people's strong desire for a U.N. seat to the
international community through the referendum," he went on.</P>
      <P>China and the United States have voiced opposition to the DPP's U.N. cause
referendum out of fear of further complicating the sensitive cross-strait
situation, but not the one proposed by the KMT, which seeks public endorsement
for U.N. membership in the name of Republic of China or other appropriate
designations.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's first "English village" for children featuring a total language
immersion environment opened Saturday at Taichung English and Art Museum in Dali
City in Taichung County.</P>
      <P>The "village" occupying 15,206.61 square meters is comprised of 21 theme rooms
to give students a simulated experience of life in English, including a model
flight cabin, a mock immigration agency, an airport lobby and a restaurant.</P>
      <P>Taichung Magistrate Huang Chung-sheng said at the inauguration ceremony that the
most important function of the village is providing an all-English learning
environment for students.</P>
      <P>"The learning center, touted as the first of its kind in Taiwan, is aimed at
stimulating children's natural ability to learn English in an all-English
learning environment and allowing them to improve their English without going
abroad," Huang said.</P>
      <P>To celebrate the village's inauguration, more than 300 children were provided
with the chance that day to experience the full English environment in which
they can learn and practice English through language immersion classes.</P>

English was just like playing  a game, " one seven-year-old girl said.</P>
      <P>The learning institution  will design 15 simulated English learning situations,
each lasting for 40-50 minutes, for students in varying age groups. Children

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh
said Sunday that he will drop out of the presidential race if he is found to
have received NT$500,000 (US$15,528) allegedly given by a biopharmacists
association as a political donation.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a rally marking the establishment of his campaign headquarters
in the eastern county of Hualien, Hsieh said that although it is legal for
candidates to receive donations from supporters during campaigns, he has not
received the NT$500,000 from any domestic biopharmacists association as alleged
by Ma Yi-nan -- the elder sister of his election rival, main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) standard-bearer Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Ma Yi-nan claimed recently that the biopharmacists association donated NT$1
million to Hsieh's campaign group and that Hsieh had taken half of the amount.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that if the association had made the donation, it must have receipt
from his campaign office. He challenged the person who made the claim to come up
with the receipt.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsieh challenge Ma Ying-jeou to bow out of the race too if he has
received any political contributions he has kept secret.</P>
      <P>Hsieh claimed that the KMT is now "much richer" than ever after it won a
landslide victory in the Jan. 12 legislative polls.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the KMT -- which now holds an absolute majority with 81 seats in

gotten" party assets and much more resources at its disposal.</P>
      <P>He added that the KMT spent "a fortune" late last year to run television
commercials "on a daily basis" to "drive a wedge" between himself and Su Tseng-
chang, who is now his running mate but was a rival during the DPP presidential
primaries.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the situation is "worse than the days of martial law, " with the
KMT sitting as a single dominant party in the legislature while small parties
have no voice at all, Hsieh called on the public to vote for him "as the only
way to turn around the situation."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Hsu Kuo-yung, a spokesman for Hsieh's campaign headquarters,
acknowledged an Apple Daily report Sunday that the campaign subsidies that
Hsieh's headquarters has been able to distribute to local campaign centers
around the country are about 60 percent less than what was given out by
President Chen Shui-bian's re-election campaign headquarters in 2004.</P>
      <P>Noting that the DPP has always had much less campaign funds than the KMT, Hsu
said that despite financial constraints, the DPP has always been adept in using
funds efficiently and added that the DPP is confident of winning the March 22
presidential election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP camp accuses China of rigging presidential election</HEADLINE>

      <P>The camp of ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate
Frank Hsieh accused China Sunday of "brazenly interfering" in Taiwan's March 22
presidential election by offering preferential plane tickets to help Taiwan
businessmen to return home and vote.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuo-yung and Sheng Fa-hui, both former lawmakers, and ex- Government
Information Office Minister Cheng Wen-Tseang, who work as spokesmen for Hsieh's
presidential campaign, made the accusation in a news conference.</P>
      <P>According to Sheng, China has been encouraging Taiwan businessmen to return home
to vote in the presidential election by offering discounted plane tickets and
hinted that they should vote te for "a certain candidate" as part of its efforts
to "rig" the event.</P>
      <P>Displaying a notification issued Jan. 28 by the China-based Taiwan Compatriot
Investment Enterprises Association, Sheng said that Chinese state-run carriers
are providing Taiwan businessmen with cheap plane tickets to achieve the aim.</P>
      <P>Normally, a ticket from Shanghai to Taiwan via Hong Kong or Macau costs
NT$18,000 (US$565) ,  but Chinese aviation companies are providing Taiwan
businessmen with tickets for about NT$12,150 -- even more affordable than prices
for Lunar New Year charter flights.</P>
      <P>China has been exploring all possible means to push Taiwan businessmen to go
home to vote, Cheng said, claiming that China' s "behind-the-scenes" maneuvering
is aimed at affecting the result of the election.</P>
      <P>"China must respect the free will of each Taiwan businessman operating in China
in this regard," Cheng argued.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the Communist Party of China has been colluding with the
Kuomintang (KMT) , Taiwan's largest opposition party, Hsu, however, denied that
he was making his insinuation and voiced his hope that such a collusion does not
exist.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, more than 3,000 Taiwan businessmen based in the Shanghai area have
booked the cheap tickets -- organized by a Taiwan businessman's association in
Shanghai and the local branch of a Taipei-based tour agency -- ahead of the
presidential election.</P>
      <P>According to a Taiwan businessman surnamed Huang, his ticket cost 2,700 Chinese
yuan -- 100 yuan cheaper than the price in 2004.</P>
      <P>A tour agency official said that more charter flights will be arranged for
Taiwan businessmen wishing to go home prior to the presidential race.</P>
      <P>According to a local media report, some 250,000 China-based Taiwanese
businessmen are planning to return to Taiwan for the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Hsieh  faces  KMT rival  Ma Ying-jeou  in the approaching presidential election,
who has vowed to relax restrictions on Taiwanese businessmen operating in China.</P>
      <P>According to public opinion polls in the past few months, Ma is steadily
enjoying a lead over Hsieh by a wide margin of more than 20 percent in terms of
public support rate.</P>

      <P>An American citizen who began to head the Indiana Chapter of the pro-
independence Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA) a year ago was
appointed as an adviser to Taiwan's Cabinet-level Overseas Compatriot Affairs
Commission (OCAC) Saturday.</P>
      <P>John Conklin, who has served as chief of the FAPA Indiana Chapter since early
2007,  was presented with a certificate by Cheng Chieh-sung, director of the
OCAC office in Chicago, during a Lunar New Year celebration held at the Taiwan
Association in Indiana Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lauding Conklin at the party, Cheng said that over the past year, Conklin, who
is married to a Taiwanese citizen, has spared no efforts to make the voice of
Taiwan heard in the Indiana state legislature and relevant organizations.</P>
      <P>Conklin has also helped boost Taiwan's diplomatic efforts in the United States,
including being instrumental in arranging for speeches made by Taiwan's top
representative in the U.S., Joseph Wu, at an educational institute and a public
affairs organization in Indiana last month, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>For his part, Conklin said it is a great honor for him to be appointed by the
Cabinet-level OCAO as an adviser. The appointment is a token of the Taiwan
administration's recognition of members of the Taiwanese community in Indiana
for their efforts, he said.</P>
      <P>He added that the FAPA Indiana Chapter will strive harder in the future for the
cause of championing Taiwan's hard-earned democracy.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cheng gave the thumbs up to the Taiwan Association in Indiana for its
staunch support shown to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration
over the past year.</P>
      <P>The association organized a Week of Taiwan Traditions last May, showcasing
various colorful aspects of Taiwanese folklore, including a lion dance performed
by a troupe from Taiwan, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Last August, he went on, the Taiwan Association in Indiana invited more than 30
representatives of Taiwanese civic groups from 10 major cities in seven
Midwestern states to speak for Taiwan's bid to enter the United Nations as a
full member under the name Taiwan. Those representatives also traveled to New
York to take part in activities to champion the Taiwan cause there, he said.</P>
      <P>Last November, he added, the Taiwan Association took part in an international
Cultural Festival sponsored by the Indiana state government and won the champion
of the festival with an entry on Taiwan's education and traditions.</P>

international school and begin to enroll foreign students for the 2009 academic
year in an effort to nurture international  talent and boost the university's
international competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The university is now studying what departments, courses and subjects will be

      <P>The international school, featuring an all-foreign language learning
environment, will have all courses taught in foreign language at the university
transferred to the new school, Fu added.</P>
      <P>"We are planning to open management classes next academic semester on a trial
basis for 25 undergraduate students who will be selected from various schools
except management schools," Fu noted.</P>
      <P>In light of a severe lack of nursing professionals in many Western countries,
the university has also decided to set up a department of global health and
international nursing, with relevant courses to be taught in foreign languages,
according to Fu, who added that students will also be recruited from Southeast
Asian countries.</P>
      <P>The construction of the international school complex is expected to be completed
by the end of this year, according to Fu.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the new school is part of the school's measures to respond
to the Ministry of Education's call for promotion of campus

    <HEADLINE>Chinese spouses in Taiwan longing for families across the strait</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Most Chinese spouses of Taiwanese citizens are anticipating the approaching
Lunar New Year holiday with the same excitement as people in Taiwan, tinged with
a little disappointment that they cannot be reunited with their relatives in
China to celebrate the year's most important festival.</P>
      <P>Despite the company of the family of her husband and friends, Yin, a Chinese
woman married to a Taiwanese man who has lived here for eight years, cannot stem
her yearning for her daughter, who studies in Zhejiang, a southern province of
China.</P>
      <P>Yin had her daughter in an earlier marriage. When she decided to remarry a
Taiwanese and move to the island, her daughter was only a teenager and she had
to consign her to her relatives' care. During the past eight years, Yin has
returned a few times to her hometown, yet her greatest desire -- to live close
to her daughter -- will not be realized soon.</P>
      <P>In contrast to the cheerful atmosphere of the Chinese New Year, Yin's regret
seems to be more intense than usual. " However happily you live here, the sorrow
over the separation from your close relatives remains inconsolable," Yin said.</P>
      <P>Yin is not alone. Feng, a young woman from the eastern province of Anhui, who
had been hoping to see her parents, ditched the idea after realistic
considerations. "Procedures for applying for a family visit visa are too
complicated and the maximum permitted time is just one month, at most two," Feng
said.</P>
      <P>The way to a family reunion is long because it is difficult for Chinese spouses
to receive an identity card. They often have to wait eight years to be
naturalized and according to government statistics, until November 2007, only
44,493 out of 250,160 Chinese spouses (17.8 percent) had been granted an
identity card, while 59,906 out of 137,353 spouses from other countries (43.6
percent) were naturalized Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chinese people can only come to Taiwan on a group tourist visa and
can only stay for a maximum of 10 days.</P>
      <P>Although Chinese spouses suffer from the separation from their families in China
during the Lunar New Year, they are excited nevertheless about the most
important festival in Chinese societies.</P>
      <P>"In the province of Guangdong,  well-off  families prepare `Dragon-Phoenix soup'
made with snake and chicken or `turtle-snake soup, '" noted a young woman
originating from the city of Shenzhen, adding that in general, Taiwan celebrates
the Lunar New Year with much the same traditions and customs as in China.</P>
      <P>"But I was surprised that people in Taiwan keep the tradition of worshiping gods
and ancestors during the Chinese New Year. In China, this kind of tradition is
no longer popular after the Cultural Revolution," she explained.</P>
      <P>"We people from Chaozhou do not have the custom of eating pineapple and fish
like in Taiwan or in other provinces in China, " another woman said, explaining
that in their dialect, the two indispensable ingredients for Chinese New Year do
not have fortuitous meanings in way they do in Mandarin Chinese.</P>
      <P>Another woman from northeastern China said that in Taiwan, people can afford
sumptuous meals, but the ambiance is not animated enough. "In my hometown,
Chinese operas are performed in our community for a whole week, and children
play hobbyhorses in the street, " she said, adding that "in Taiwan we just play
mahjong and visit relatives and friends."</P>
      <P>Asked about their New Year wishes, the new Taiwanese mothers said they wish for
health and academic performance for their children.</P>
      <P>Some non-governmental organizations (NGOs) make efforts to help foreign spouses
adapt to life in Taiwan. The Taipei-based Chinese Association for Relief and
Ensuring Services, for instance, organizes English, dancing and cooking courses
for Chinese spouses, while on Jan. 20, the Pearl S. Buck Foundation invited low-
income families of foreign spouses for an early celebration of the Lunar New
Year.</P>
      <P>These NGOs do not want their activities to be tagged as charity for foreigners,
since they do not want to differentiate between Taiwanese and foreign spouses.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Drill to be held for avian flu prevention</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A drill codenamed "Black-faced Spoonbill Operation No.2 " will be conducted late
this month or in March to get the nation ready for a fight against a possible
outbreak of the deadly H5N1 avian flu, an official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>National Science Council Minister Chen Chien-jen, who concurrently heads a
Cabinet task force on avian flu prevention and control, made the remarks in an
interview with CNA.</P>
      <P>Chen said the planned drill will be the second of its kind following a similar
exercise in 2007. In that drill, some public functionaries were required to work
from home as response measures were practiced in a simulation in which that
Taiwan was hit by a human-to-human bird flu epidemic.</P>
      <P>This year, Chen said, the private sector will join government agencies in the
drill, particularly those in the transportation service and public utilities
sector as well as some high-tech companies in the country's three science-based
industrial parks.</P>
      <P>Chen said the policy of prohibiting live poultry slaughter in traditional
markets will be put into force April 1 as scheduled.</P>
      <P>"The government's stance on carrying out this policy remains unchanged, " Chen
said. Nevertheless, he acknowledged that certain complementary measures must be
reinforced before the new slaughtering ban takes effect.</P>
      <P>On a suggestion by local poultry farmers associations that Taiwan follow the
example of Hong Kong in using glass to separate consumers from slaughtering
areas in traditional markets, Chen claimed that the proposal is "not feasible in
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>In Hong Kong, each poultry vending booth covers an area of about 15 pings (one
ping equals 3.31 square meters) , which makes it possible to have glass erected
to separate shoppers from poultry slaughtering areas. In Taiwan, each booth
usually covers an area of just 5 pings, which he claimed is too small to
accommodate any separating structures.</P>
      <P>Chen said he will invite officials  from the Council  of Agriculture, the
Ministry of Economic affairs, the Department of Health and other relevant
agencies to discuss other feasible alternatives and consult with chicken farmers
associations, electric slaughtering and processing service providers, poultry
transport service industry associations and poultry vendor representatives.</P>
      <P>"Despite some technical difficulties that are pending a solution, the policy of
banning poultry slaughter in traditional markets from April 1 remains intact,"
Chen reaffirmed.</P>
      <P>Thanks to collaborative efforts of the public and private sectors, Taiwan is
still free from H5N1 bird flu infection. As a result, the country has been able
to continue chicken meat exports to Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea. "We must
remain on guard, as the consequences of an H5N1 outbreak could be detrimental,"
Chen said.</P>
      <P>As of mid-January, warnings against possible massive outbreaks of bird flu
infection among poultry had been issued in Vietnam, Bangladesh, India, Israel,
Iran, Egypt and Portugal. In Egypt, 64,000 poultry were infected with bird flu,
leading to a cull of 1 million birds.</P>
      <P>On Jan. 24, more than 4,000 chickens died on a poultry farm in northern Thailand
and subsequent laboratory tests confirmed that all the birds were infected with
the virulent H5N1 virus. More than 10,000 chickens raised at the farm were
culled to prevent a further spread of the disease.</P>
      <P>As for H5N1 infection among humans, the number of cases reported in China
remains limited. In comparison, Indonesia faces a far more serious threat of the
outbreak. Chen said avian flu infection among humans has almost become a local
disease that will not abate simply because of seasonal changes.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, Chen said quarantine officials have checked 4,026 samples of migrant
birds, 572 chicken farms, 569 goose farms and 105 duck farms for avian flu
virus, but no traces of H5N1 have been discovered.</P>
      <P>Quarantine officials found low-pathogenic H7N7 avian flu virus in wild bird
feces collected from the Suchao wetlands in Tainan City, Chen went on, adding
that there are no poultry farms within three kilometers of the wetlands.
Nevertheless, he said, quarantine officials have heightened alert over the
finding.</P>
      <P>"Fighting avian flu is a constant challenge and we cannot afford any momentary
lapse of attention," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>DPP presidential candidate Fran Hsieh's claims that China is helping Taiwanese
businesspeople in China return to vote in Taiwan's March 22 presidential
election has betrayed his "ignorance" of commercial practice and his "attempts
to hinder these businesspeople to vote", a Kuomintang (KMT) official said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung,  deputy chief of KMT Policy  Coordination Committee and
director of KMT Mainland Affairs Department, argued in a statement that it is a
common practice in China for air carriers to sell tickets at a discount between
40 percent and 70 percent, and it is nothing unusual for them to offer a
discount of 60 percent on flight fares to Taiwanese businesspeople.</P>
      <P>Hsieh was apparently ignorant of this practice when he accused, through his
aide, China of trying to interfere in Taiwan's election by offering flight
tickets at a discount of 60 percent to Taiwan businesspeople in attempts to help
them return and vote, Chang went on.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Chang said, the ticket prices for chartered flights to be lined up
exclusively for the March 22 election were set by the many associations of
Taiwan businesspeople and aviation authorities on both sides of the strait,
rather than by Chinese authorities alone.</P>
      <P>The accusation only exposed Hsieh's attempts to prevent these Taiwan
businesspeople from voting in the presidential election due to his concerns that
they probably won't vote for him, Chang claimed,</P>
      <P>Hsieh's distrust in these people, calls call into questions his campaign
promises that he would push for direct chartered flights across the strait if
elected, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Noting that these Taiwan business people and their family members in Taiwan
number about four million, Chang said Hsieh should encourage their enthusiasm
for the election, or "face their backlash prompted by his attempts to exclude
them from the election."</P>
      <P>Chang issued the statement after three of Hsieh's campaign spokesmen claimed
Sunday that China is trying to meddle with March 22 election by offering
unreasonable cheap flight tickets to Taiwan businesspeople working in China to
return and vote for a certain candidate.</P>
      <P>They denounced the alleged Chinese scheme as bribery.</P>

wireless devices stood at 24.2 percent in 2007, marking an increase of 8.6
percentage points over the year-earlier level, according to the results of a
survey released recently by the Institute for Information Industry (III).</P>
      <P>The figure includes 9.7 percent of the population that uses mobile Internet
services and 19.7 percent who access the Internet wirelessly. The ratios of the
two groups of users were up 1.6 percentage points and 7.7 percentage points,
respectively, from 2006.</P>

were mobile or wireless Internet users in 2007, up 56.8 percent from 2006.</P>
      <P>The survey found that mobile phones remained the most common devices for mobile
online use in 2007, with 82.6 percent of mobile respondents using their mobile
phones to go online.</P>
      <P>In terms of the networks used, 41.3 percent of mobile Internet users accessed to
the Internet through general packet radio services (GPRS) , while 33.5 percent
of users did so through a 3G network, compared with just 21.6 percent of users

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng urged newly sworn-in lawmakers of the 7th
Legislature Monday to observe legislative regulations and control spending on
the refurbishment of their research offices at the Legislative Yuan building and
keeping expenses under NT$100,000 (US$3,106).</P>
      <P>Wang said that if some legislators cannot keep their spending under NT$100,000,
they will have to pay for the excess themselves.</P>
      <P>Wang's reminder came in response to remarks made by Lin Yi-shih, director of the
main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) Central Policy Committee, the day before
calling for newly-sworn in KMT legislators to be frugal while having their
research offices refurbished.</P>
      <P>Lin call for KMT legislators to avoid extravagance and strive to build a "new
image" for the Legislative Yuan, in which the KMT now holds an absolute majority
after winning a landslide victory in the Jan. 12 legislative polls to take 81
seats of the downsized, restructured 113-member legislature.</P>
      <P>Lin also said that the KMT legislative caucus will suggest, if necessary, that
all legislators from all parties submit accounts of spending  on the
refurbishment  of their research offices for publication to allow the general
public to better understand the operations of the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the speaker said that although the space of the legislators'  offices
has been doubled  as the number of the legislators has been almost halved, their
offices are still not spacious and resemble "pigeon holes."</P>
      <P>Wang also noted that the work days of the 7th legislature will be much tougher
than those of its predecessor, pointing out that although each new legislator is
now able to hire two more aides, their work loads, in terms of serving the
constituents, will be much more difficult than before given the larger
constituencies.</P>

      <P>Super Bowl frenzy hit the sports pubs of Taipei Monday morning with hordes of
domestic and foreign fans thronging to watch live the match-up between the New
England Patriots and New York Giants.</P>
      <P>A local pub, the Tavern Premier, opened in 2000 by Swiss expatriate Michael
Blanc, kept its doors open throughout the night and showed a full program of
Super Bowl XLII, including pre-game shows, highlights of previous Super Bowls
and of course the live broadcast of the big game itself from 7 a.m. Taipei time.</P>
      <P>David Rucledge, an American teaching English in Taipei, pointed to himself as a
"super fan."</P>
      <P>"For Americans, this game is a big deal, like Christmas. It's like a national
holiday," he said, adding, "this is the only game for which I will wake up at 6
o'clock in the morning."</P>
      <P>Rucledge said he comes to Tavern Premier every Monday to watch NFL matches and
never misses the Super Bowl. He has been working in Taiwan for 5 years.</P>
      <P>Football fans swarmed to Tavern Premier to catch the action on the field, with
over 70 satellite tvs, 7 inch personal screens and three huge 150 inch screens
guaranteeing the most extensive coverage of the event.</P>
      <P>"This is the eighth year that the Tavern Premier has shown the Super Bowl live,
and our coverage is second to none, " manager Sandy Wang said, adding that they
also showed the NFL quarter-finals and semi-finals.</P>
      <P>"Every year the pub is fully booked when the Super Bowl kicks off and
reservation are made as early as a month in advance," she said.</P>
      <P>She went on to say that "football to the Americans is just as soccer to the
British and baseball to Taiwanese, " and "some overseas businessmen even came
here directly from the airport just to catch up with the match."</P>
      <P>Fans can enjoy 10 kinds of draft beer on tap at the Tavern Premier, which also
served the all you can eat "Fantastic Grand American Super Bowl Breakfast
Buffet, " for NT$495 (US$ 15) per person, including a 10 percent Service Charge,
from 6: 30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. to fill the fans' rumbling empty stomachs.</P>
      <P>"The food is really good and it's all you can eat, " said Randy Bennett, an
American custom painting artist who has been working in Taiwan for 10 years.</P>
      <P>Two British tourists, Ben Chrystie and Chris Rumney, said that to watch Super
Bowl in United Kingdom pubs would cost twice the price, around 20 pounds
(US$39).</P>
      <P>As the Super Bowl, America's most popular annual spectacle, falls on Monday
morning Taiwan time, the manager said the Tavern Premier will rebroadcast the
match at 7: 30 p.m. for those that had to work Monday morning.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S., China more concerned with referendums than presidential race</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  4 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Results of the two referendum proposals regarding Taiwan's bid for membership in
the United Nations -- not the results of Taiwan's presidential election -- are
of greatest concern to China and the United States, academics said at a recent
seminar.</P>
      <P>"It seemed to me that China does not care who will win the presidential election
in March. It is more concerned with the referendums, " Chiang Chi-chen, an
assistant professor at Soochow University, said in a seminar held Friday on the
prospects of cross-strait relations in 2008.</P>
      <P>Two referendums  on whether  Taiwan should apply for U.N. membership under the
name Taiwan, or return to the world body under the country's official title
Republic of China, or any other feasible name, will be held alongside the
presidential election March 22.</P>
      <P>The landslide victory of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) in the January
Legislative election guarantees that the new president will have limited room to
maneuver, regardless of who wins the presidency -- KMT candidate Ma Ying-jeou or
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate Frank Hsieh, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>"There is little doubt that China will focus on the referendum issue this year,
" said Wang Kun-yi, a professor at Tamkang University's  Graduate Institute  of
International  Affairs and Strategic Studies.</P>
      <P>There are four possible scenarios concerning the results of the presidential
election and the referendum, said Chang Wu-ueh, chairman of the Friends of Hong
Kong and Macau Association.</P>
      <P>Beijing's preferred outcome will be seeing Ma elected with the DPP's proposal,
which asks for popular approval of applying for U.N. membership under the name
Taiwan, failing to pass, Chang said. He added that a Hsieh victory and passage
of the DPP proposal is the scenario Beijing most dislikes.</P>
      <P>While it's inappropriate to portray the DPP's proposal as an "independence
referendum", which President Chen Shui-bian vowed not to hold in his 2000
inauguration speech, the U.S. and China both took it as a "provocative first
step towards de jure independence", said Lin Cheng-yi, a researcher at Academia
Sinica.</P>
      <P>"Which was why both China and the U.S. have seen the referendum issue as more
important than the presidential election, " Lin noted.</P>
      <P>China is expected to keep pressuring Taiwan on the referendum issue through
third countries ahead of the March election. It is also expected to try to
influence swing voters and supporters of the KMT-led pan-blue alliance to vote
in the referendum, Chang said.</P>
      <P>It will best serve Taiwan's interests if at least one referendum passes, either
that of the DPP or the KMT, Lin said.</P>
      <P>"What kind of message will we be sending the world if both referendums fail to
pass?" he asked.</P>

      <P>Although both the Taiwan-Macau and Taiwan-Hong Kong air pacts are set to expire
this summer, the Civil Aviation Association (CAA) is not sure whether the
agreements will be extended or new agreements will be signed.</P>
      <P>The current Taiwan-Macau air pact is set to expire May 30, while the Taiwan-Hong
Kong agreement will expire June 30.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan-Macau aviation agreement was originally scheduled to expire in
November 2005, but the two sides extended the agreement for half year periods
several times.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan-Hong Kong agreement was originally set to expire in June 2007, but
similar extensions were negotiated between the two sides.</P>
      <P>CAA Director Chang Kuo-cheng said that the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs

      <P>As many as 90 percent of children surveyed recently by the Formosa Cancer
Foundation identified themselves as victims of second-hand tobacco smoke, with
the majority exposed to the hazard at home.</P>
      <P>The results of the survey were released by the foundation Monday to coincide
with World No Tobacco Day 2008, which focused on the theme of tobacco-free
youth.</P>
      <P>The survey revealed that while more than 90 percent of the respondents wish to
live in a smoke-free environment, 70 percent have family members who smoke at
home and another 60 percent have been forced to consume second-hand smoke
exhaled by a visitor.</P>
      <P>Half of the respondents do not know how to reject second-hand smoke, mainly
because they are afraid they might get scolded by their parents or family
members.</P>
      <P>Some respondents also complained that their smoking family members ignore their
protests, while others said they are too shy to stop their visitors from
smoking.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted Jan. 15-28 online among 1,825 children.</P>
      <P>To help children reduce their exposure to second-hand smoke, the foundation has
designed a set of "no smoking" stickers to be placed in living rooms, cars,
schools and bathrooms.</P>
      <P>The stickers are being provided free of charge, and those wishing to receive
them can write to the foundation at 5-2F, 16, Section Five, Nanjing East Road,
Taipei, including a stamp with a value of NT$35. For further information, the
public are urged to visit the foundation's Web site at www.canceraway.org.tw or

      <P>New Taiwan dollar-Chinese yuan exchanges conducted on the Taiwan-held outlying
islands of Kinmen and Matsu have amounted to 4.56 million Chinese yuan
(US$634,567) over the past two years, the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) reported Monday.</P>
      <P>At a regular meeting, MAC officials said that since the new Taiwan dollar-
Chinese yuan exchange services were legally opened in October 2005, four Taiwan
financial institutions have been allowed to operate 12 currency exchange outlets
on Kinmen and Matsu providing the exchange services.</P>
      <P>A total of 4.56 million yuan had been exchanged in 61,900-odd transactions
conducted at these 12 banking outlets as of the end of 2007, MAC officials said.</P>
      <P>According to the Taipei-based Central Bank of China (CBC) , the buying and
selling of Chinese yuan has been the major business of these Kinmen and Matsu
bank outlets.</P>
      <P>Among the customers, 99.7 percent were Taiwan citizens, with a mere 0.3 percent
being Chinese citizens, according to the CBC.</P>
      <P>Most of the transactions involved the sale of Chinese yuan for NT dollars, CBC
officials said.</P>
      <P>Unconfirmed reports have claimed that Taiwan residents might have amassed a
total of more than 100 billion Chinese yuan over the past several years.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said in January 2007 that Taiwan cannot allow a full
opening of exchange services for Chinese currency before the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait have signed a currency clearance and liquidation agreement.</P>
      <P>In March 2004, the CBC began to allow each local citizen to bring in up to 6,000
yuan per homecoming visit, an amount that was raised to 20,000 yuan in October
2005.</P>
      <P>According to an estimate by the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, local
people have made a total of more than 12 million visits to China over the past
three years.</P>

      <P>Enterovirus topped the list of infectious</P>
      <P>diseases hitting Taipei school campuses last year, with 2,010 cases reported,
Taipei City's health officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>The officials, speaking at a press conference, said that the enterovirus was
followed by chicken pox, mumps, scarlet fever, head louse, and pertussis.</P>
      <P>Health officials said that the enterovirus is most prevalent in the spring,
summer and early autumn, but that the disease could strike Taiwan almost all
year round.</P>
      <P>The number of enterovirus cases surged in the latter half of 2007 mainly because
of the global warming effect, which saw temperatures not dropping even in the
winter, the officials added.</P>
      <P>Enteroviruses can be found in the respiratory secretions and stool of an
infected person. Other persons may become infected by</P>
      <P>direct contact with secretions from an infected person or by contact with
contaminated surfaces or objects, such as a drinking glass or telephone.</P>
      <P>Infected persons who become ill usually develop either mild upper respiratory
symptoms a flu-like illness with fever and muscle aches, or an illness with
rash.</P>
      <P>Health authorities advised students to wash their hands, keep a healthy diet and

      <P>Excessive levels of the carcinogenic chemical formaldehyde were found in 47
percent of playing cards surveyed recently by the Consumers' Foundation,
foundation officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>Of the total of 55 playing cards sampled, 26 were detected to contain
formaldehyde residue ranging between 122.7 ppm to 1,691 ppm, much higher than
the limit of 75 ppm set by the government for free formaldehyde, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>Sixteen, or 61.5 percent, of the substandard products were made in China, they
added.</P>
      <P>Also, 43, or 78 percent, of the cards surveyed were not labeled properly,
including 17 China-made products, 13 Taiwan-made products and one U.S.-made
product. The other 24 did not indicate their country of production.</P>
      <P>Formaldehyde is a colorless, strong-smelling gas that is widely used as an
industrial fungicide, germicide and disinfectant. It has been classified by the
International Agency for Research on Cancer as a known human carcinogen.</P>
      <P>In addition to the long-term carcinogenic effect, formaldehyde exposure can also
result in short-term health effects such as skin irritation and burning
sensations of the eyes, nose and throat, foundation officials noted.</P>
      <P>In light of the popularity of card games among Taiwanese during the Chinese New
Year holiday, the officials urged consumers to avoid using cards that have a
pungent smell when the wrapper is opened because they are very likely to contain
formaldehyde.</P>
      <P>Consumers should also wash their hands after playing and must not allow infants
or young children to put playing cards in their mouths, they added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The highest starting salaries for new recruits who have worked for less than a
year were paid by companies in the real estate sector in Taiwan in 2007, at an
average of NT$32,452 (US$1,013) per month, according to the results of a survey
issued Monday by the 1111 Job Bank, one of the country's major online job-
brokering companies.</P>
      <P>The lowest starting salary for new recruits was found in the retail and service
business sector at an average of NT$26,457 per month among nine major lines of
business in Taiwan, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The  nine  sectors  include:  information  and  technology; manufacturing and
traditional industries; financial and consultant services;  trading and
distribution;  real estate and relevant operations; medicine, medical care, bio-
chemistry, agriculture and animal husbandry; retail and service; media and
publishing; and educational and non-governmental organizations.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted using a total of 137,815 copies of updated resumes
offered by Job Bank members in 2007.</P>
      <P>Apart from the real estate and the information and technology sectors, the
starting salaries for young employees were all below the NT$30,000 per month
barrier in all categories.</P>
      <P>After working for seven or nine years, salaries in the real estate sector would
surpass NT$40,000 per month, the report shows.</P>
      <P>1111 Job Bank spokesman Wu Juei-yi indicated that factors such as work
experience, position, educational background, company scale, and gender all have
an impact on salary amounts.</P>
      <P>Wu said his company conducted the survey not only to reflect the exact supply
and demand situation in the manpower market but also to help young job seekers
or those seeking to change jobs to know their "market value."</P>
      <P>"Presenting a salary demand that is acceptable to the employer could help win a
salary battle in the employment interview, " said Wu.</P>
      <P>In terms of salary levels in 23 job categories, the survey results show that an
employee serving in the general administration department and having seniority
of less than 12 months was offered the lowest salary of NT$24,089 per month on
average, while the salary for a junior construction engineer recorded the
highest level at NT$37,983 per month.</P>
      <P>After working seven or nine years, only those employed in the fields of opto-
electronics and semiconductor were found to enjoy a monthly salary surpassing
NT$50,000.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that jobs requiring few professional skills, such as administration
service workers, generally offered the lowest starting salaries, while in the
case of the real estate sector, the relatively high salaries were a result of
demand for professional skills.</P>
      <P>He also suggested  that job seekers cultivate  attraction, beautification,
creativity, distinctiveness and expressiveness in order to maintain their
competitiveness in the employment market.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian visited military personnel stationed on the outlying
islet of Siaociou Monday to recognize their efforts two days before the Lunar
New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>Speaking to the soldiers, Chen said that he visited Wuchiu township three times
after he assumed his post in 2000, but it was his first visit to Siaociou.</P>
      <P>Siaociou is one of the two major islets that form Wuchiu township in Kinmen
County, one of Taiwan's outlying islands in the Taiwan Strait. Kinmen lies
closer to China's Fujian Province than to Taiwan proper and has been one of
Taiwan's key defense outposts.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the newly inaugurated helicopter apron on Siaociou this year has
greatly facilitated logistics, transportation, and the transport of medical
resources for local residents and soldiers, expressing appreciation to those who
helped complete the construction project.</P>
      <P>Chen was accompanied by Defense Minister Lee Tien-yu, Chief of the General Staff
Huo Shou-yeh, and Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Chen Chi-mai.</P>
      <P>The visit to Siaociou Monday followed a trip by Chen to the Taiwan-held Taiping
Island in the Spratly island chain in the South Chin Sea Saturday to inaugurate
a 1,150-meter airstrip there, which Chen said was built for humanitarian
purposes.</P>
      <P>Taiping is the largest in the disputed Spratly island chain which is composed of
a string of rocky outcrops possibly holding large oil and gas deposits. Besides
Taiwan, five other countries -- China, Vietnam,  the Philippines,  Malaysia and
Brunei -- also claim sovereignty over the Spratlys.</P>
      <P>Chen's Spratlys visit sparked protests from Vietnam and the Philippines.</P>
      <P>But Chen urged all surrounding countries to jointly protect natural ecology and
resources in the South China Sea rather than focusing on the exploration of
natural resources in the region.</P>

      <P>Radio frequency thermotherapy offers an alternative choice other than surgery to
treat liver cancer, with each process taking only 30 minutes, a Taiwanese doctor
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lin Hsien-ping, a physician at Jen Ai Hospital in the central city of Taichung,
said that he started using the method two years ago.</P>
      <P>Lin said during an interview with the Central News Agency that the method can
"effectively kill cancer cells without damaging normal ones."</P>
      <P>The treatment was introduced into Taiwan a decade ago, but was not widely used
as it was expensive and was not covered by the national health insurance program
until in recent years, Lin said.</P>
      <P>He noted that clinical experiences show that the treatment rarely resulted in
major complications.</P>
      <P>Citing as an example the 12 liver cancer patients who received such treatment
from him, Lin said that only one could not bear with the pain caused by the
treatment and thus gave it up.</P>
      <P>Another patient had a relapse, while other patients did not experience any
complications afterwards, Lin said, adding that the condition of these patients
is still being monitored and they are still receiving treatment.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that after undergoing such treatment, patients only need to stay in
hospital for one day for further observation before being released.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin also warned that radio frequency thermotherapy is not suitable
for all liver cancer patients, except those who are in the early stage.</P>
      <P>Lin explained that the treatment is better for those patients who have one tumor
smaller than 5 cm, or those who have fewer than three tumors, with the largest
one not bigger than 3 cm.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has an estimated 3 million hepatitis B carriers and 600,000 hepatitis C
suffers, making liver cancer one of the most common cancers in the country.</P>

according to the group's spokesman.</P>
      <P>Twu Shiing-jer,  secretary-general of the U.N.  for Taiwan Alliance, told the
Central News Agency Sunday that many civic groups were very concerned about
whether Hsieh will be able to win the March 22 election after his party's

      <P>The DPP won a mere 27 seats of the 113-seat legislature, compared with 81 seats
clinched by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>For this reason, the alliance and the Hand-in-Hand to Safeguard Taiwan Alliance
plan to hold a march -- which will start from Eluanbi, the southernmost tip of
Taiwan, and end in the capital Taipei -- to consolidate and seek more general
support for Hsieh, said Twu, who is also a DPP lawmaker.</P>
      <P>The march, slated to take place between Feb. 7 and Feb. 28, is aimed at
attracting more than one million people from various civic groups and the

      <P>The government expects to draw more foreign visitors to Taiwan in 2008 and 2009,
thanks to a new promotion program integrating resources of the public and
private sectors to be launched after the Chinese New Year holiday, a Tourism
Bureau official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The program, dubbed "Tour Taiwan Years 2008-2009," is expected to attract 4
million foreign visitors to Taiwan in 2008 and 4.25 million in 2009, with annual
visitor expenditures by 2009 estimated at NT$200 billion (US$6.24 billion), the

      <P>The program has several major directions for implementation, including a
domestic promotion project that will create a friendly travel environment and

sightseeing sites, and will encourage Taiwan residents to learn to be good
hosts.</P>
      <P>The program will also market Taiwan's traditional festivals and local cultural
events such as the lantern festival, the dragon boat festival and the tung
blossom season, along with in-depth travel information for different market
segments, such as mountain climbing trips, wedding photo trips and nostalgia
trips.</P>
      <P>The bureau has also designed  packages  covering  Taiwan's must-sees, must-eats
and must-dos, like the Taipei 101 building in Taipei City, sampling local dishes
in night markets and visiting the Taroko National Park in eastern Taiwan, with
visitors assured of convenient transport.</P>
      <P>Foreign visitors will get a variety of free gifts from the bureau, depending on
the season and the bureau will also give out prize money for the first, second,
third and fourth millionth foreign tourist as an incentive to encourage more

      <P>The Red Cross Society of the Republic of China has appealed to local residents
for support of its fundraising effort to help victims of China's worst snowstorm
in 50 years, a Red Cross spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>The storm, which has killed at least 60 people, has persisted for nearly three
weeks and caused an estimated US$4.55 billion in economic losses.</P>
      <P>The Red Cross spokesman said that the relief and rescue response to China's
disaster has been overlooked because many of the reports on the storm have
focused on the resulting transportation problems.</P>
      <P>The group's effort is aimed at encouraging local residents to get into the
spirit of helping those who are hungry or have nowhere to turn and allow people
in China to get substantive assistance and feel the warmth of Taiwan's people,
the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Those interested in making donations can download forms from the Red Cross' Web
site, the spokesman added.</P>
      <P>For many in China, the situation is dire, the Red Cross said. The storm has
caused 140,900 houses to collapse and left 600,200 homes damaged. Over 1.61
million Chinese have been evacuated from their neighborhoods and more than 100
million acres of farmland have been impacted.</P>
      <P>Many provinces in China's center, east, and south have been seriously affected
by the bad weather, and several highways and airports were shut, leaving tens of
thousand of passengers returning home for the Chinese New Year holiday stranded
at various stations.</P>

      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister James Huang said Monday that the ministry is trying to
find out about the situation of two Taiwanese businessmen in Chad who reportedly
will be airlifted by China from the central African country.</P>
      <P>Huang was responding to reports that China was in the process of airlifting 210
Chinese and two Taiwan nationals to safety in neighboring Cameroon amid heavy
fighting between government and rebels forces in the nation's capital N'Djamena.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that since Taiwan severed diplomatic ties with Chad in August 2006
following Chad's decision to forge ties with China, it has no representative
offices there.</P>
      <P>"The ministry is concerned with the situation of the two Taiwan businessmen
there and will try to learn about their situation so that it can provide
necessary assistance," Huang said.</P>
      <P>The severing of ties came just hours before then-Premier Su Tseng-chang  was to
embark on a trip to Chad to attend the inauguration ceremony of Chad President
Idriss Deby,  who was re-elected to a third term in May that year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will negotiate with Southeast Asian
nations on the disputed Spratly Islands based on a Spratly Initiative introduced
Saturday by President Chen Shui-bian, Minister James Huang said Monday.</P>
      <P>President Chen unveiled the initiative during his visit to the Taiwan-held
Taiping Island, the largest in the Spratly Island archipelago in the South China
Sea, that called for peaceful methods to develop the area's natural resources.</P>
      <P>Huang said the spirit of the initiative is in line with the consistent positions
of the countries that also claim sovereignty over the Spratlys, including the
Philippines, Vietnam,  China, Malaysia and Brunei.</P>
      <P>"The MOFA will communicate with neighboring countries on the basis of the spirit
of the initiative, " he said.</P>
      <P>The Philippines and Vietnam protested Chen's visit to Taiping, but Huang
reiterated Taiwan's sovereignty over the islet, where Taiwan has military and
coast guard installations and Taiwanese-built permanent facilities.</P>
      <P>"The  so-called  sovereignty  disputes  have  been  overly exaggerated," he
said.</P>
      <P>Speaking of Chen's visit to Taiping to preside over a ceremony marking the
inauguration of a 1,150-meter runway, Huang said the visit was also aimed at
extending the president's regards and concerns for personnel stationed in
Taiwan's southernmost inhabited territory ahead of the Chinese New Year, which
begins Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Spratlys, located farther away from Taiwan than any other of its outlying
islands, have the poorest living facilities of any Taiwan-held area, Huang said.</P>
      <P>President Chen had expressed the hope that he would visit Taiping residents
before completing his tenure in May, after visiting most of the other military
bases of the country over the past seven years to show his concern for soldiers
safeguarding the country, Huang added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taichung mayor calls for turning airport into international one</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The mayor of Taiwan's third-largest city, Taichung, called Monday for an
upgrading of the city's airport to turn it into an international airport to
promote travel and trade.</P>
      <P>"An upgrading for the airport, through private investment and adequate
management by such world-level corporations which run Singapore's Changi
Airport, Hong Kong International Airport or Thailand's Suvarnabhum Bangkok
Airport, would definitely turn the airport into an international one with strong
competitiveness, " said Jason Hu.</P>
      <P>The mayor of the central Taiwan city, issued the call during a municipal meeting
with city government officials.</P>
      <P>Currently, Chingchuankang Airport serves only 28 "outbound" charter flights to
Hong Kong and Macau per week -- an indication that there is still ample room for
the facility to explore international service, according to Hu.</P>
      <P>"I strongly believe that if the Evergreen Group or China Airlines were willing
to invest in building a new terminal at Chingchuankang Airport, and top
professional management corporations could take charge of operating the airport,
it would undoubtedly become a leading international airport to better serve
passengers," Hu said.</P>
      <P>However, Hu said the central government has consistently turned a cold shoulder
to his BOT (build-operate-transfer) proposal to allow private-sector investment
and management in the airport.</P>
      <P>According to Hu, he has contacted the Evergreen Group for an investment project
involving building a terminal at the airport. But the Civil  Aeronautics
Administration  under the Ministry  of Transportation and Communications has
failed to respond to the issue positively, he said.</P>
      <P>Air travel in central Taiwan has been hit hard since the Taichung airport was
relocated  in 2004 from near the city center to Chingchuangkang in neighboring
Taichung County.</P>
      <P>Carriers are keen to open new flights from the airport to overseas destinations
to mitigate the adverse impact, including direct charter flights to China.</P>
      <P>A significant number of Taiwan businessmen operating in China are from the
Taichung area, where many traditional Taiwanese businesses currently are
headquartered.</P>
      <P>The many China-based Taiwan businessmen have to stop over in Hong Kong or Macau
when traveling between Taiwan and China for business or family visits.</P>
      <P>Direct shipping and airlinks between Taiwan and China are still banned following
a Chinese civil war in 1949.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's national baseball team continued to toy with its roster Monday in its
quest to find the lineup that will earn it a berth in the 2008 Olympic baseball
tournament.</P>
      <P>Manager Hung Yi-chung announced a 37-man training camp roster in prepartion for
the final Olympic qualifying tournament, which will be held in Taichung and
Yunlin in central Taiwan from March 3-14.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will need to finish in the top three among eight teams in the tournament
to earn the right to compete in Beijing.</P>
      <P>"After a lengthy discussion with the coaching staff, we decided to expand the
original 30-man roster to 37 as a number of young players have been playing well
for the Select Team in Puerto Rico, " Hung said, referring to a team consisting
of young and promising players currently training on the Caribbean island.</P>
      <P>Expanding the roster will give Hung and his coaches a final chance to compare
some of the younger players with battle-tested veterans before naming the
squad's final 24-man roster for the qualifying tourney.</P>
      <P>Taiwan finished an embarrassing eighth in the Baseball World Cup last November
and finished a disappointing third in the Asian Baseball Championship last
December, in which the top finisher, Japan, earned a spot in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Although the Chinese Taipei Baseball Association failed to get permission from
the New York Yankees to add Wang Chien-ming to the roster, the team will still
have access to other hurlers who pitch professionally abroad.</P>
      <P>They include Tsao Chin-hui, formerly of the Colorado Rockies and Los Angeles
Dodgers who recently signed a minor league contract with the Kansas City Royals,
Keng Po-hsuan, who is in the Toronto Blue Jays' farm system, and Hsu Ming-chieh
and Chiang Chien-ming who pitch professionally in Japan.</P>
      <P>The team's training camp will start Feb. 11 in Taichung, Hung said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's main competition in the tourney figures to comes from Australia,
Mexico, South Korea and Canada, though it is unclear how much their rosters will
be affected by being unable to call up U.S.-based players.</P>
      <P>England, Spain and South Africa are not expected to pose much of a threat.</P>
      <P>China, the United States, Cuba, the Netherlands and Japan have already booked
their spots in the eight-team Olympic tournament.</P>
      <P>The complete 37-man roster for Taiwan's national team is listed below:</P>
      <P>Pitchers (18) : Tsao Chin-hui, Keng Po-hsuan, Lin En-yu, Hsu Ming-chieh, Chiang
Chien-ming, Chang Chi-chia, Huang Jun-chung, Pan Wei-lun, Yang Chien-fu, Ni Fu-
te, Lee Cheng-chang, Lee Wei-hua, Lin Po-yu, Lee Chu-kuan, Cheng Kai-wen, Lin
Ke-chien, Tang Chia-jun, Huang Chih-lung.</P>
      <P>Catchers (4): Yeh Chun-chang, Chen Feng-min, Kao Chih-kang, Lin Kun-sheng.</P>
      <P>Infielders (9): Kao Kuo-ching, Yang Sen, Chang Tai-shan, Peng Cheng-min, Wang

      <P>More than 60 percent of Taiwan's salaried workers felt that their personal
finances worsened in 2007, while over 30 percent said they had a second job,
according to a poll conducted by a local manpower company.</P>
      <P>In results of the survey released Monday by JCASE, an outsourcing and
recruitment agency, nearly 66 percent of respondents complained of their "very
poor" or "poor" economic situation, while 24 percent described their financial
situation as "average."</P>
      <P>Only 10 percent described themselves as "well off" or "rich."</P>
      <P>Compared to their 2006 economic condition, 64.3 percent felt they had grown
poorer, while 31.4 percent thought it was "about the same, " the survey found.
Only 4.3 percent felt that they had become "richer."</P>
      <P>Nearly 65 percent of those surveyed who felt they were worse off in 2007
attributed their financial plight to "soaring prices, " with other factors such
as "insufficient incomes, " "excessive expenses" and "having credit card or bank
loans, " also being cited by many respondents.</P>
      <P>To tackle their monetary  shortage,  34.2 percent  of the respondents said they
"have held an additional job or are in the process of getting one, "while 53.5
percent said they "were thinking of getting a second job to earn extra money,"
the survey found.</P>
      <P>Only 12.3 percent said they "do not have a second job and are not thinking about
getting one."</P>
      <P>According to the poll results, Taiwan's moonlighters can earn an additional
NT$22,000 per month on average.</P>
      <P>Inputing data, writing for special projects, doing subcontracted odd jobs at
home, and serving as convenience store clerks or part-timers at fast food
chains, are the most popular part-time jobs among local moonlighters, the survey
indicated.</P>
      <P>The random online survey was conducted between Jan. 14-30, with 1,158 valid
questionnaires received out of 5,000 sent. It had a margin of error of
plus/minus 2.88 percent.</P>

      <P>Supporters of Taiwan in Japan called on Japanese businesses and people Sunday to
boycott any product or action that belittles Taiwan.</P>
      <P>They were referring to companies making globes portraying Taiwan as part of
China and the Japanese government's inclusion of Taiwan as part of China in its
geography textbooks and foreigners' registration certificates.</P>
      <P>They issued the call at a meeting in Tokyo to protest against Tokyo-based Gakken
Toys Co. for "belittling" Taiwan by portraying Taiwan as a part of China in its
toy globes. The company has said it did so at the insistence of Beijing.</P>
      <P>Participants at the meeting -- organized by three different groups and attended
by Taiwanese expatriates and sympathetic Japanese -- raised objections to not
only the toy globes but a Web site set up by Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs
which displays Taiwan as a part of China.</P>
      <P>Participants indicated that the Japanese government should be held responsible
for disseminating  incorrect information which describes Taiwan as a Chinese
territory in geography textbooks, and for mistakenly entering the nationality of
Taiwanese expatriates as "China" in their alien registration certificates.</P>
      <P>Meeting attendees passed a resolution demanding that Japan correct all of the
"misleading" and "false statements" disseminated over past decades.</P>
      <P>The resolution said that "the sale and spread of the incorrect globes is related
to Japan's decision to curry favor with China."</P>
      <P>In the statement, participants also urged Japan's foreign ministry, Ministry of
Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology and Ministry of Justice to
correct the errors, while calling on the public to stage protests against the
agencies in question until those corrections are made.</P>
      <P>The meeting was organized three Japan-based organizations -- the Friends of Lee
Teng-hui Association in Japan, the Taiwan Research Forum and an online magazine
"The Voice of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The Friends of Lee Teng-hui Association is a group linked to former Taiwanese
President Lee Teng-hui, which aims to promote friendly relations between Taiwan
and Japan.</P>
      <P>Gakken Toys Co. has announced it will shut down by the end of March after taking
a string of actions to apologize for its mistake and recalling its products in

      <P>A total of 3,103 passengers traveled between Taiwan-held Kinmen Island and two
ports in China's Fujian province Monday, setting a new daily high for the
expanded mini-links service set up last week to accommodate Chinese New Year
travelers, according to the Kinmen harbor bureau.</P>
      <P>With only two days left before the Chinese New Year, 2,058 passengers coming
from the Fujian ports of Xiamen and Quanzhou entered Kinmen's Shuitou Port,
including two Taiwanese patients suffering from brain hemorrhages, while 1,045
departed from Kinmen to the opposite side, port statistics showed.</P>
      <P>The 3,000-plus passengers represented the highest daily level since Kinmen
authorities launched a special program Jan. 29 to handle a surge in travelers
during the peak period prior to the Feb. 7 Chinese New Year.</P>
      <P>Over the past week, a total of 17,466 passengers have traveled between Kinmen
and the two ports in Fujian province, with 10,442 coming from China and 7,042
heading for the Chinese side, Kinmen harbor bureau director Chang Kuo-tu said.</P>
      <P>Most of the China-bound travelers are Chinese spouses or family members of
Taiwanese citizens.</P>
      <P>Special Lunar New Year charter flights have been put in place across the Taiwan
Strait to fly China-based Taiwanese businessmen home ahead of the holiday, a
period of peak demand.</P>
      <P>Chang said, however, that the mini links service is still important to travelers
sailing between the two sides, in particular to those from Taiwan's central
region, due to its cheaper cost and shorter travel time.</P>
      <P>"The number of passengers traveling via the mini links is expected to further
pick up in the last two days before the start of the new year, " Chang
predicted.</P>
      <P>He said Shuitou port authorities have stepped up services to help travelers pass
through immigration checkpoints more quickly.</P>
      <P>The mini links -- direct trade and transport services between Taiwan's Kinmen
and Matsu islands and Fujian's Xiamen, Fuzhou and Quanzhou ports -- were
initiated Jan. 2001 to offset the lack of such links between Taiwan proper and

      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves hit a new record in January, but still
dropped a notch in the world rankings to fifth, said Lin Sun-yuan, deputy
director-general of the central bank's Department of Foreign Exchange Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin said January's foreign currency reserves reached US$272.82 billion,
increasing by US$2.51 billion over last December's figure.</P>
      <P>China topped the world rankings with US$1.53 trillion in foreign reserves last
December, the last month for which data there was available, Lin said.</P>
      <P>It was followed by Japan, Russia, and India, which surpassed Taiwan for the
first time with US$279.5 billion in reserves.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's increasing foreign exchange reserves last month resulted from interest
income, net incoming foreign investment, and the appreciation of major
currencies such as the euro and Japanese yen against the dollar, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The euro and the Japanese Yen rose against the dollar by 0.22 percent and 5.03
percent, respectively, from the end of last December to the end of January, Lin

      <P>South Korea, one of the other members of the traditional four Asian Tigers along

Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh said Monday.</P>
      <P>Earlier media reports said China was in the process of airlifting 200-plus
Chinese people and two Taiwanese businessmen in Chad to Cameroon.</P>
      <P>Yeh said, however, that the report was not correct. The two Taiwanese  citizens
in Chad were CPC employees,  not ordinary businessmen and drove to neighboring
Cameroon on their own without China's help.</P>
      <P>Since Chad switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in August
2006,  Taiwan has not maintained  an office there. Nevertheless, CPC staff have
continued working there to fulfill a contract signed by the company and the

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh on
Monday called on his rival, Ma Ying-jeou of the main opposition Kuomintang, to
join him in opposing China's interference in Taiwan's presidential election.</P>
      <P>Hsieh complained that Chinese state-run air carriers are offering 40 percent
discounts on airfares ahead of the March 22 election to encourage China-based
Taiwanese businessmen to return to vote.</P>
      <P>Many believe most of the business community based across the Taiwan Strait is
likely to support Ma.</P>
      <P>"Such an election will not be fair, " said Hsieh at an autograph session for his
new book "Viva Taiwan! Frank Hsieh's Commitment to Taiwan's Renewal" in the
southern Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>He asked Ma to openly reject China's interference with Taiwan's businessmen and
in Taiwan's election.</P>
      <P>Ma, for his part, said Monday that Taiwan's democracy will not allow
intervention from anyone, adding that if China factors in the March 22
presidential election, he'll strongly condemn it.</P>
      <P>He would not acknowledge media reports, however, that Taiwanese businessmen
operating in China overwhelmingly back him, saying, "that is not necessarily the
case."</P>
      <P>Ma said that as far as he knows, if the number of Taiwan businessmen returning
to Taiwan is large enough, they should be able to get cheaper group fares.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also tried to draw a distinction between the more open cross-strait
policies of the two presidential contenders, saying he would insist on Taiwan's
sovereignty and opposed a full opening.</P>
      <P>He also said that he agreed to the opening of Chinese capital to invest in
Taiwan's residential and commercial property market, but stressed he is opposed
to speculation in real estate.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese enterprises' investment in China should also not exceed 40 percent of
their net worth, he added, although on previous occasions he has said the policy
could be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>Hsieh claimed that Ma's support for a cross-strait common market will result in
a loss of jobs for local workers, lower prices and dwindling markets for
Taiwan's agricultural products, and a rise in smuggled goods into the country.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's campaign team first voiced its concerns Sunday over China's influence on
the election when it displayed a notification issued Jan. 28 by the China-based
Taiwan Compatriot Investment Enterprises Association that Chinese state-run
carriers are providing Taiwan businessmen with cheap plane tickets to return to
Taiwan to vote.</P>
      <P>Campaign staffers said Monday that the top officials of the association are
currently the top brass of Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office under its State
Council.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Bi-khim, former DPP legislator and a Hsieh spokeswoman, said the
association's honorary chairman, Chen Yunlin, is the director of Taiwan Affairs
Office (TAO).</P>
      <P>The association's vice chairman and secretary-general He Shizhong is the
director of TAO's Economic Bureau under the Taiwan Affairs Office. Its adviser
Zheng Lizhong is TAO's deputy director. Another adviser Li Bingcai is the vice
president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, he said.</P>
      <P>Hsiao  said  that the association  is "obviously  a group orchestrated by
Chinese authorities."</P>
      <P>Hsiao pointed out that the association's offer of discount tickets will only be
offered between March 1 and March 22 for returning to Taiwan, and back to China
after March 22.</P>
      <P>Hsiao said that China's subsidizing its air carriers to mobilize Taiwan
businessmen to return to Taiwan shows its "brazen political intention."</P>
      <P>A KMT official said Monday Taiwanese associations' deals with China's state-
owned air carriers is "strictly business, " and asked Hsieh's  team to apologize
for attempting  to smear Taiwan's businessmen operating in China for being in
the 'same league" with China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 60 percent of Taiwan's salaried workers felt that their personal
finances worsened in 2007, while over 30 percent said they had a second job,
according to a poll conducted by a local manpower company.</P>
      <P>In results of the survey released Monday by JCASE, an outsourcing and
recruitment agency, nearly 66 percent of respondents complained of their "very
poor" or "poor" economic situation, while 24 percent described their financial
situation as "average."</P>
      <P>Only 10 percent described themselves as "well off" or "rich."</P>
      <P>Compared to their 2006 economic condition, 64.3 percent felt they had grown
poorer, while 31.4 percent thought it was "about the same, " the survey found.
Only 4.3 percent felt that they had become "richer."</P>
      <P>Nearly 65 percent of those surveyed who felt they were worse off in 2007
attributed their financial plight to "soaring prices, " with other factors such
as "insufficient incomes, " "excessive expenses" and "having credit card or bank
loans, " also being cited by many respondents.</P>
      <P>To tackle their monetary  shortage,  34.2 percent  of the respondents said they
"have held an additional job or are in the process of getting one, "while 53.5
percent said they "were thinking of getting a second job to earn extra money,"
the survey found.</P>
      <P>Only 12.3 percent said they "do not have a second job and are not thinking about
getting one."</P>
      <P>According to the poll results, Taiwan's moonlighters can earn an additional
NT$22,000 per month on average.</P>
      <P>Inputing data, writing for special projects, doing subcontracted odd jobs at
home, and serving as convenience store clerks or part-timers at fast food
chains, are the most popular part-time jobs among local moonlighters, the survey
indicated.</P>
      <P>The random online survey was conducted between Jan. 14-30, with 1,158 valid
questionnaires received out of 5,000 sent. It had a margin of error of

    <TEXT>
      <P>Supporters of Taiwan in Japan called on Japanese businesses and people Sunday to
boycott any product or action that belittles Taiwan.</P>
      <P>They were referring to companies making globes portraying Taiwan as part of
China and the Japanese government's inclusion of Taiwan as part of China in its
geography textbooks and foreigners' registration certificates.</P>
      <P>They issued the call at a meeting in Tokyo to protest against Tokyo-based Gakken
Toys Co. for "belittling" Taiwan by portraying Taiwan as a part of China in its
toy globes. The company has said it did so at the insistence of Beijing.</P>
      <P>Participants at the meeting -- organized by three different groups and attended
by Taiwanese expatriates and sympathetic Japanese -- raised objections to not
only the toy globes but a Web site set up by Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs
which displays Taiwan as a part of China.</P>
      <P>Participants indicated that the Japanese government should be held responsible
for disseminating  incorrect information which describes Taiwan as a Chinese
territory in geography textbooks, and for mistakenly entering the nationality of
Taiwanese expatriates as "China" in their alien registration certificates.</P>
      <P>Meeting attendees passed a resolution demanding that Japan correct all of the
"misleading" and "false statements" disseminated over past decades.</P>
      <P>The resolution said that "the sale and spread of the incorrect globes is related
to Japan's decision to curry favor with China."</P>
      <P>In the statement, participants also urged Japan's foreign ministry, Ministry of
Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology and Ministry of Justice to
correct the errors, while calling on the public to stage protests against the
agencies in question until those corrections are made.</P>
      <P>The meeting was organized three Japan-based organizations -- the Friends of Lee
Teng-hui Association in Japan, the Taiwan Research Forum and an online magazine
"The Voice of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The Friends of Lee Teng-hui Association is a group linked to former Taiwanese
President Lee Teng-hui, which aims to promote friendly relations between Taiwan
and Japan.</P>
      <P>Gakken Toys Co. has announced it will shut down by the end of March after taking
a string of actions to apologize for its mistake and recalling its products in
the face of widespread criticism in early January over the globes.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two engineers working for Taiwan's state-run oil company CPC Corp., Taiwan in
Chad have safely reached neighboring Cameroon amid clashes between government
forces and rebels in the capital of the central African country, Ministry of
Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh said Monday.</P>
      <P>Earlier media reports said China was in the process of airlifting 200-plus
Chinese people and two Taiwanese businessmen in Chad to Cameroon.</P>
      <P>Yeh said, however, that the report was not correct. The two Taiwanese  citizens
in Chad were CPC employees,  not ordinary businessmen and drove to neighboring
Cameroon on their own without China's help.</P>
      <P>Since Chad switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in August
2006,  Taiwan has not maintained  an office there. Nevertheless, CPC staff have
continued working there to fulfill a contract signed by the company and the
Chadian government on oil exploration in the central African country.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was forced to announce an end to diplomatic ties with Chad just hours
before then-Premier Su Tseng-chang was to embark on a trip to Chad to attend the
inauguration ceremony of Chadian President Idriss Deby, who was re-elected to a
third term in May that year.</P>

      <P>Cross-Taiwan Strait talks were made impossible by former Republic of China
President Lee Teng-hui in the mid-1990s due to his displeasure over China's
attempts to interfere in Taiwan's democratization movement, according to a
recent Japanese news agency report.</P>
      <P>Lee was quoted by Kyodo News --  a Japan-based nonprofit cooperative news agency
-- as having confirmed recently that there was indeed a chance for him to meet
with his Chinese counterpart, Jiang Zemin, during the 1990s.</P>
      <P>There was speculation at the time that Evergreen Group Chairman Chang Jung-fa
tried to arrange for Lee and Jiang to hold talks aboard a vessel sailing in the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>But the Kyodo report marks the first time Lee has confirmed the authenticity of
the rumors surrounding the proposed talks.</P>
      <P>Lee rejected the proposal because he was afraid that if he had met with Jiang,
he might have to compromise on the democratic reforms he was pushing at the
time, the Japanese news agency said.</P>
      <P>His decision was also triggered partly by his irritation over China's attempts
to manipulate Taiwan's democratization movement, the report said.</P>
      <P>Some analysts are of the opinion that Lee's rejection of the proposal
contributed to the worsening ties between Taipei and Beijing in the latter part
of the decade.</P>
      <P>To show its displeasure with Lee, China launched three ballistic missiles on
March 8, 1996 -- part of a week-long missile testing program -- that landed just
off Taiwan's northern and southern coasts.</P>
      <P>Beijing acknowledged the move was to intimidate Taiwan's voters ahead of the
country's first direct presidential election on March 23, and persuade them not
to vote for Lee. The former president won the election with an absolute
majority, however, against three other high-profile rivals.</P>

      <P>CNA Staff Reporters</P>
      <P>Taipei, Feb. 5 (CNA) Hordes of Taiwanese commonly swarm to temples around Taiwan
before and during the Lunar New Year to pray for good luck.</P>
      <P>But now with the help of technology, those seeking the attention of local
deities can use the Internet, ATM machines and even cell phones to connect with
the gods.</P>
      <P>Several telecommunication companies, banks and convenience stores have launched
"virtual lantern-lighting" and "virtual Taishuei- pacifying" services that
enable people too busy to visit temples in person to still perform the rituals.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Telecom, Taiwan Mobile, Far Eastone Telecom and Asia Pacific Telecom
are working with the 300-year-old Mazu Temple in Lugang,  Changhua  County,  to
provide the service,  while 3G telecommunication company VIBO is cooperating
with the Hsinkang Feng-Tien Temple of Chiayi City in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The companies are seeking to capitalize on local adherence to Taoist tradition,
in which "pacifying Taishuei" and "lighting the lantern" are indispensable
rituals.</P>
      <P>Taishuei is the title of the god whose constellation  is designated as the
monarch of a particular year of the Chinese zodiac, and who must be pacified by
people born in certain years if they want to avoid bad luck.</P>
      <P>In the coming Year of the Rat, people born under the sign of the rat or horse
are considered to have offended the Taishuei and must therefore pacify Ying Ban,
the Taishuei of 2008.</P>
      <P>Lighting lanterns, such as the "Lantern of Light, " "Safety Lantern, " and
"Education Lantern, " are thought to bring health, honor, and a brighter future.</P>
      <P>Worshipers need only use their mobile phones to log on to the Internet and enter
their name, birth date, and address to pacify Taishuei or light a lantern.
Fending off the rage of Taishuei costs NT$600 while the cost of lighting
lanterns depends on the temple. The Mazu temple in Lugang charges NT$600 to
light a "Lantern of Light."</P>
      <P>Customers of Far Eastern International Bank and Chinatrust Commercial Bank can
use the companies' Web sites or ATM machines to perform the ritual, while others
can fill out the appropriate forms available at convenience stores and submit
them by fax or via the Internet.</P>
      <P>Lu Ming Sen, chairman of the Feng-Tien, said that technology enables people from
all over the world to worship the gods and pray for good luck, and it is just as
effective as visiting the temple in person.</P>
      <P>"No matter where you are, hold to your faith and the gods will bless you," he
said.</P>
      <P>For most traditionalists, going to temples to experience the entire process of
pacifying Taishuei or lighting a lantern are very important events.</P>
      <P>Ting Feng-chun, a worshiper at the famous Longshan Temple, located in Taipei's
Wanhua district, said she came to pacify Taishuei on behalf of her son and
herself.</P>
      <P>"I have faith in the effectiveness of the Bodhisattva enshrined here, " Ting
said, explaining that her son experienced the power of divine intervention by
surviving a gunshot wound while serving in the army.</P>
      <P>Longshan Temple, a well-established Buddhist temple founded in 1738, is the most
popular place for pacifying Taishuei in Taipei as well as a local cultural
landmark. The government designated the temple as a second grade historical site
in 1985 to ensure that it would be permanently preserved.</P>
      <P>The temple is not offering online services, however, not because it feels
virtual worship is not legitimate, but because of the fear that the temple is
not equipped to cope with the demand.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsue-lin, the director of Longshan Temple affairs, said that the temple
had to limit applications to pacify Taishuei to 1,000 per day due to the
difficulties of processing the massive number of applications.</P>
      <P>"Although the temple considered launching a Web site for people to apply online,
concerns about the security and accuracy of personal information made us dismiss
the idea," she said.</P>
      <P>"Besides, if we allowed people to pacify Taishuei by applying through the
Internet, all of the openings might be fully booked within one day, which is not
fair for those who come to the temple personally, " she added.</P>
      <P>Chang said Longshan Temple's 100,000 lanterns of light have all been sold to
devotees, but for those who still want to light a lamp, the temple will set up
two colossal Safety Lanterns on Chinese New Year Eve open to the general public.</P>
      <P>The service is free and will last from Feb. 6 to March 26, Kuan Yin
Bodhisattva's birthday, she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Local airlines seek expansion of cross-strait charter services</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  5  (CNA)
02/05/08  14:05:48

    <TEXT>
      <P>Representatives of Taiwan's airlines industry  proposed Tuesday that the
government  further expand cross-Taiwan Strait charter services, which they said
have already proven successful in previous limited runs with passenger load
factors of up to 80 percent.</P>
      <P>The representatives suggested that the frequency of cross-strait passenger and
cargo charters and the destinations they serve be expanded to serve more
customers.</P>
      <P>The Ministry  of Transportation  and Communications  (MOTC) officials responded
to the proposal by noting that any plan to augment service would need to be
arranged through negotiations with Chinese authorities.</P>
      <P>The ministry said it would work out the technical details involved if the
Cabinet arrives at a policy to expand the services.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait passenger charter flights were first launched in 2003 to transport
China-based Taiwanese businesspeople and their families home for the Chinese New
Year holiday and back to China after that.</P>
      <P>The services were expanded in 2006 to cover the Mid Autumn Festival and further
in 2007 to cover two more holidays, the Tomb Sweeping Festival and the Dragon
Boat Festival.</P>
      <P>Expanding the number of non-stop flights between Taiwan and China has been a
major point of emphasis of the local business community.</P>
      <P>Local airlines, facing declining passenger numbers at home with the advent of
the high-speed railway, are looking for new lucrative routes, while
businesspeople would like to avoid the extra time and expense of traveling to
China on business through a third point, usually Hong Kong or Macau.</P>
      <P>There have been no regularly scheduled non-stop flights between Taiwan and China
in nearly 60 years.</P>
      <P>According to MOTC figures, a total of 192 flights carried 37,445 passengers
during the 2007 Chinese New Year period from Feb. 5 to March 5, with a passenger
load factor of 81.06 percent.</P>
      <P>For the Tomb Sweeping Festival period that ran from March 29 to April 12, there
were a total of 42 flights with a total of 7,000 passengers, with the passenger
load factor reaching 75 percent.</P>
      <P>For the Dragon Boat Festival period that ran from June 15 to June 22, a total of
42 flights carried 6,500 passengers, with a load factor of 74 percent.</P>
      <P>The Mid Autumn Festival charter period, from Sept. 21 to Sept. 30, saw a total
of 48 flights carry 8,500 passengers, with a passenger load factor of 78
percent.</P>
      <P>In terms of cross-strait cargo charters, Taiwan's China Airlines operated a
total of five flights last year on Dec. 12, Dec. 18, Dec. 24, Dec. 27 and Dec.
29.</P>
      <P>As for emergency charter services, Taiwan's TransAsia Airways and China's Deer
Jet provided 20 flights and four flights, respectively, to deliver Taiwanese
patients from China back to Taiwan for medical treatment.</P>

      <P>Far East University ranked first among all universities and colleges in the
nation in terms of number of patent applications and patent approvals for 2007,
according to the latest statistics released by the Ministry of Economic Affairs'
Intellectual Property Office (IPO).</P>
      <P>It marked the fifth straight year that the Taipei County-based university
finished at the top of the list in both categories.</P>
      <P>Far East University applied for a total of 258 patents in 2007, ranking it first
among all institutions of higher learning and 11th among all organizations,
including companies, in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The university received a total of 78 patent approvals, ranking first  among

      <P>A total of 19 universities and colleges finished on the top 100 list in Taiwan
in terms of patent applications, up from just 13 the previous year, according to
the IPO figures.</P>
      <P>Far East University officials said that the school's strong performance in terms
of patent applications and approvals is in large part the result of efforts to
promote innovation made by university President Wang Yuan-jen, Vice President
Chung Ming-chi, as well as Chen Yu-gang, head of the school's Innovation and
Creativity Center.</P>
      <P>The officials added that thanks to their efforts, the university was even able
to outpace several of the nation's top high-tech companies, including Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., United Microelectronics and Advanced
Semiconductor Enginnering, in total number of patent applications and patent
approvals for the year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GPS devices susceptible to interference in thunderstorms: research</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  5  (CNA)
02/05/08  14:51:11
(By Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Researchers have proved that global positioning systems (GPS) are susceptible to
interference from thunderstorms and warned against their use in extreme weather
conditions because they may provide inaccurate information, the local media
reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chien-Hung, an assistant professor at the Plasma and Space Sciences Center
of National Cheng Kung University, said the strong atmospheric convections in a
thunderstorm can create atmospheric oscillations, or tides, that rise to 90-120
kilometers above ground, just under the ionosphere.</P>
      <P>Ions from the tides accumulate at that level and can potentially interfere with
electromagnetic waves.</P>
      <P>When the transmission of electromagnetic wave is impeded, Lin explained, signals
from GPS satellites to GPS devices on the ground will be distorted, causing a
phenomenon dubbed "GPS confusion, " in which the device shows inaccurate
directions instead.</P>
      <P>"Some of my friends told me weird stories of using the GPS guiding devices in
thunderstorms, " Lin said. "They hoped the machine could lead them out of the
mountain areas under heavy rain. But in the end, even though they followed
exactly the directions given by GPS devices, they found themselves trapped in
the middle of nowhere."</P>
      <P>Lin said such stories inspired him to do further research into the reasons
behind the strange phenomemon.</P>
      <P>Using the data collected by FORMOSAT-3, a climate satellite launched and
operated by the government-funded  National Space Organization and its academic
partners in the United States, Lin analyzed atmospheric variations during
thunderstorms and observed how atmospheric tides created disruptions in
electromagnetic waves.</P>
      <P>Lin said that based on the data gathered by an IMAGE satellite in 2002, the U.S.
National Aeronautics and Space Administration has listed four areas on the Earth
as equatorial regions with anomalies in ionospheric activities, including the
Amazon valley in South America, the Congo River valley in Africa, tropical rain
forests in Indonesia, and mid-Pacific regions where most tropical storms form.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is in the mid-Pacific region, where a thunderstorm near the ground will
disturb the upper atmosphere and later the functions of GPS," Lin said.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and the  Taiwan  International
Cooperation  and  Development  Fund (TaiwanICDF) will jointly organize 11
workshops to help the country's diplomatic allies in developing their human
resources, a MOFA official announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"This plan aims at sharing the experience of Taiwan, helping our allies and
other friends cultivate the human resources necessary for developing a country's
domestic infrastructure, economy, and society, " said Paul Lee, first secretary
of MOFA's Department of Economic and Trade Affairs.</P>
      <P>Topics  for the 11 workshops  will include  "World  Trade Organization Trade
Facilitation, " "Narrowing the Digital Divide, " "Taiwan's Experience in
Environmental Protection, " and "Women's Development."</P>
      <P>"The women's development workshop, a continuation of previous programs, is one
of eight Millennium Development Goals of the United Nations, while the workshop
on environmental protection, which has become a global issue, is a new

      <P>The International Cooperation and Development Fund, a nonprofit organization
under the direction of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs founded in 1996,  has
launched  many workshops  to strengthen international cooperation and enhance
Taiwan's foreign relations by promoting economic development, social progress

      <P>Lee said estimates indicate that 300 government officials and professionals from

      <P>At the press briefing, Lee also noted that Taiwan's booths in the "2008 African

      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) said Tuesday that it plans to appropriate NT$200
million (US$5.05 million) over the next three years to install lockers in
elementary schools as part of its "lighter schoolbag" campaign.</P>
      <P>Without access to lockers or other storage space, some local elementary
students generally take all their books and other possessions home with them
every day. The overloaded bookbags have been found to harm the spines of young
students.</P>
      <P>Compounding the problem, information collected from various cities and counties
in 2005 showed that the lower the levels of elementary students, the less likely
they were to use bookbags that met applicable standards, the officials said.</P>
      <P>As a result, the ministry plans to appropriate NT$50 million each year between
2008 and 2011 to install lockers for the first- and second-graders in city and
county schools.</P>
      <P>In addition, the ministry will promote its "lighter schoolbag" campaign by
asking city and county governments to urge parents to check the bags of their
children regularly and encourage their children to make good use of the lockers
in schools so that the bags are not weighed down by unnecessary items.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's executive branch of government has pledged to intensify it efforts to
bid for a contract to develop an industrial zone in Saudi Arab as part of a new
push to tap business opportunities in the Middle E, a top economics official
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"A work plan for the project is slated to be completed by the end of February, "
said Fadah Hsieh, vice minister of the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Economic
Affairs, while giving a briefing about his recent fact-finding trip to the
country.</P>
      <P>The government will collaborate with Taiwanese companies to jointly bid for the
multimillion dollar project.</P>
      <P>In late January,  Hsieh  led a delegation  comprising  of representatives from
11 local companies to Saudi Arabia to attend the 20th Session of the Saudi-
Taiwan Joint Committee for Economic and Technical Cooperation.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, the oil rich country which is trying to diversify its
economy showed great interest in Taiwan's photovoltaic, nano and information
technologies and medical and health care industries.  Saudi Arabia also
expressed hope in strengthening bilateral technology exchanges and intensifying
existing vocational training programs between the two countries, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>While the delegation invited Saudi Arabia to invest in Taiwan, it also urged the
wealthy Middle East country to increase imports of Taiwanese products to bridge
Taiwan's trade deficit.</P>
      <P>After the session, Hsieh made an inspection tour of the King Abdullah Economic
City, the first completed city of the six economic cities which Saudi Arabia
wants to build in coming years.</P>
      <P>The King Abdullah Economic City is located about 170 km north of the commercial
hub of Jeddah, which will be developed based on the division of industrial,
residential, recreational and harbor zones, Hsieh noted.</P>
      <P>"Most of the development projects in the economic city have already been
assigned to contractors, " Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>"What Taiwan is eying is a development deal of the economic city's industrial
zone, but the investment scale of the project has yet been confirmed, " Hsieh
added.</P>
      <P>Saudi Arab plans to use the industrial zone to house firms engaging in middle
and downstream petrochemical production , according to Hsieh.</P>
      <P>To tap into the Middle East market, the Taiwan International Development Corp--.
invested by the government-controlled National Development Fund and local
businesses -- has originally planned to raise a NT$2 billion investment fund,
but is now considering expanding it because of a warm response from Taiwan's
private sector, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>He added that the investment fund raising will soon be completed.</P>
      <P>The delegation  was comprised of representatives  from the state-owned China
Steel Corp, CTCI Corp, Taiwan Fertilizer Co, Ltd, the state-run CPC Corp, UPC
Group, China Man-Made Fiber Corp, Taiwan Chunghwa Telecom Co, CECI Engineering

      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) urged the public Tuesday to
purchase legally processed poultry ahead of the Lunar New Year which falls on
Feb. 7.</P>
      <P>The COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine issued the
call asking consumers to pay extra attention when purchasing poultry products
for the Chinese New Year holiday season that begins Wednesday and runs through
Feb. 11.</P>
      <P>According to bureau officials, consumers may be assured that their health will
be fully protected if they purchase poultry processed  in licensed
slaughterhouses.  There are 90 licensed abattoirs currently around Taiwan, where
poultry must be scrutinized by vets before being slaughtered, they noted.</P>
      <P>A total of some 180 million chickens, ducks and geese as well as 8.7 million
pigs,  cattle and lambs were killed in licensed slaughterhouses last year, with
all of their substandard parts being disposed of by vets in accordance with the
law, relevant statistics showed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Rebar founder's family unable to post bail: lawyer</HEADLINE>

      <P>Four members of the family of Wang You-theng, the fugitive founder of the Rebar
Asia Pacific Group, may not be able to leave detention for the Chinese New Year
holiday, which begins Wednesday, a lawyer for the family said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lawyer Chen Feng-fu made the remarks one day after Taipei District Court granted
bail of NT$150 million (US$4.55 million) for each member of the Wang family --
Frank Wang, Wang's younger brother, and his three sons, China Rebar Co. Vice
Chairman Wang Lin-tai, Asia Pacific Broadband Telecom Co. President Wang Lin-i
and Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber Co. Chairman Wang Lin-chiao.</P>
      <P>The court set the high bail for the Wangs because they are believed to have
embezzled large sum of money from the Rebar Group and to have played key roles
in the scam.</P>
      <P>But court granted release on bail in the amount of millions for six other Rebar
executives, including NT$6 million for Wang Chin-chang, deputy chief of the
accounting department of China Rebar.</P>
      <P>Chen, after meeting with his clients in detention in Tucheng, Taipei County
Tuesday morning, said that the bail set by the court is excessive.</P>
      <P>In addition, the nation will soon enter the Chinese New Year holiday, which
means that it will be more difficult to collect the large sum, he added.</P>
      <P>"Wangs are not expected to be able to collect the money to post bail before the
Chinese New Year," he added.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he will appeal to the court later in the day to request that the
required bail be lower and an extension to the deadline from Feb. 8 to Feb. 15.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors indicted the Wangs and top officials of the Rebar group last March,
saying that the family had benefited by setting up numerous dummy corporations
through which they engaged in insider trading, accounting fraud and
embezzlement.</P>
      <P>The Rebar scandal came to light in January 2007 after the group's China Rebar
Co. and Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber Co. applied for insolvency
restructuring, triggering a run on the Chinese Bank, another Rebar affiliate.</P>
      <P>Wang You-theng and his wife, Wang Chin She-ying, are currently on the run in the
United States. Taiwan prosecutors are seeking a 30-year prison sentence for Wang
plus a record high fine of NT$1.71 billion (US$52.13 million).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's retailers to lure consumers with big prizes during new year</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 5 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Six automobiles and over tens of thousands of prizes, including scooters,
designer bags, laptop computers, airline tickets and watches, await lucky
shoppers in Taipei's major department stores during the upcoming Lunar New Year
as retailers seek recovery from a past year of declining consumer spending.</P>
      <P>To lure Taiwanese consumers to open up their wallets, stores have teamed up this
year to launch what they are billing as an exciting "Fortune Bags" promotion on
the Lunar New Year Holiday, which begins on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Shoppers visiting the department stores in Taipei on Thursday and Friday may
spend as little as NT$ 1,000 (US$ 30) for a "Fortune Bag", a New Year tradition
adopted from Japan. Inside the bag, all customers will be designated a gift with
a guaranteed minimum value of NT$ 1,000. The luckiest could be rewarded the top
prize -- an automobile.</P>
      <P>It seems to be a sure-win deal, but shoppers must first purchase the bag, which
may take over 24 hours of standing in line.</P>
      <P>Taipei's department stores, including the Living Mall, the Breeze Center, the
Shin Kong Mitsukoshi, and the Pacific SOGO will each launch its own "Fortune
Bag" scheme with a limited number of bags.</P>
      <P>"On New Year's Day, we provide customers with two Suzuki sedans as top prizes,
one more than the previous year," said Josephine Chou, a public relations
specialist at the Living Mall, which will offer 4,000 fortune bags.</P>
      <P>She further emphasized that in addition to the top prizes, other commodities,
such as iPods, digital cameras, laptop computers and TVs are also up for grabs,
adding that "it is worth spending NT$1,000 for a chance to win one of these
products."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a Mazda 3 car worth NT$ 565,000 (US$ 17,650) is listed as the top
prize by the Breeze Center, which will sell 5,000 fortune bags, so the odds of
winning the top prize is one in 5,000.</P>
      <P>"We wish to give our customers more valuable and better prizes, " stressed Wu
Ching-hua, a public relations specialist at the Breeze Center,  adding that "a
fortune's favorite" can even win the opportunity  to have dinner with Taiwan's
supermodel "Liz" on Valentine's Day, which falls on Feb. 14 this year.</P>
      <P>The "Fortune Bags" program is not only a chance for shoppers to win big prizes.
For the department stores, it also helps boost consumer spending amid stagnating
incomes, the constantly increasing consumer prices and the weak stock market in
Taiwan in recent years.</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted by MasterCard, Taiwan's consumer confidence in
2007 measured 29.7 on its index, which was 1.1 less than the previous year and
was the lowest among the Asia Pacific nations.</P>
      <P>"We infuse an amount of NT$ 10 million to prepare the Fortune Bag prizes this
year, " said Chou with a hope that "it may attract more customers to shop at the
Living Mall during the holiday."</P>
      <P>The Shin Kong Mitsukoshi department store, however, has no automobile to offer
this year.</P>
      <P>According to Liu Pin-chou, chief of the Mitsukoshi's advertising and promotion
section, the top prize of this year in its four branches in Taipei's Xin-yi
district will be a four-day free trip to Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>"We don't give a super big prize this year, but we provide more and better
gifts, " Liu said, noting that 1,500 fortune bags will be available.</P>
      <P>Another leading department store in Taipei, the Pacific SOGO, does not have a
mall-wide fortune bags program, but individual shops in the shopping center will
have their own promotion plans.</P>
      <P>"This enables our customers to choose the commodities they like," Carol Wang, a
pubic relations specialist at SOGO, stressed.</P>
      <P>"You will never know what is in a fortune bag, but here you can purchase the
products you really like, " she said, adding that every SOGO customer who spends
money on the special offers may also receive a chance to win a Suzuki Swift car.</P>

      <P>The Taipei International Book Fair (TIBF) will sign an agreement with the

      <P>The IPA's chairwoman Ana Maria Cabanallas is scheduled to sign the agreement

    <TEXT>
      <P>After a first half of the season full of good and not-so-good surprises, Taiwans
domestic basketball league SBL (Super Basketball League) is looking forward to a
prosperous second half on the eve of a two-week lunar new year break.</P>
      <P>The semi-pro league, which is in the middle of its fifth season, consists of
seven teams and adopts a 30-game regular season format. The regular season will
be suspended briefly before resuming Feb. 15 after a two-week break for the new
year.</P>
      <P>Before the 2007-08 season opened last December, the league was expected to be
top heavy as perennial power Yulon Dinos, defending champion Taiwan Beer and
Dacin Tigers were all loaded with talented players while the remaining team were
either inexperienced or under-budgeted to compete with the big boys.</P>
      <P>The prediction is partially true as Yulon, which won three titles in the SBL's
first four years, is currently leading the league at 16 wins and 4 losses.
Taiwan Beer is not far behind at 15-6.</P>
      <P>What surprised everyone was that Dacin is barely clinging on to its fourth place
ranking with a sub-.500 record of nine wins and 11 losses. Dmedia Numen, which
hires the only foreign player in the league, became a dark horse with a third-
place 13-7 record.</P>
      <P>Pure Youth Construction Corp., a bottom dweller during the previous four
seasons, was another surprise at 9-12. The young team is making a strong push to
the top four with the momentum of a five-game winning streak under the guidance
of young head coach Hsu Chin-che.</P>
      <P>Yulon forward Chen Hsin-an, the first Taiwanese player to play in the U.S. NBA
team training camp in 2002, regained his top form and is leading the league in
scoring with a 20.6 points per game to go with 8.8 rebounds. Dmedia import
Jonathan Sanders has been dominating at both ends of the court, averaging 19.2
points, 16.6 rebounds and 5.7 assists per game.</P>
      <P>Sanders was not alone. Ouyang Ching-hen, a 28-year-old Dmedia guard, is enjoying
a breakout season as the league's third best scorer with an 18.7 scoring
average.</P>
      <P>However, the image of the league has been taking hits from numerous incidents on
and off the court. Two on-court brawls have led to a number of player
suspensions. Taiwan Beer head coach Yen Chia-hua and the team manager Lin Chieh-
ho are in the middle of a 10-game suspension as well. Both were reprimanded as
Yen kicked a referee and Lin punched another after a controversial game.</P>
      <P>Three Demdia players were released from the team after being involved in a
stabbing incident outside a Taipei nightclub last month.</P>
      <P>The SBL, the brainchild of the Sports Affairs Council and the Chinese Taipei
Basketball Association, in hope of reviving local basketball,  was established
in 2003,  four years  after the professional league Chinese Basketball Alliance
(CBA) folded.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The core consumer price index recorded a year-on-year growth of 2.71 percent in
January, representing the highest level since March 1999 and a monthly growth of
over 2 percent for four months in a row, according to official statistics
released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The index is produced after deducting fluctuations in consumer prices of fresh
food products such as vegetables, fruit and seafood, as well as energy products.
It reflects long-term trends of a country's consumer prices.</P>
      <P>The tallies compiled by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting, and
Statistics (DGBAS) show that the consumer price index (CPI) recorded 102.93 in
January, representing a slight drop of 0.57 percent compared with the previous
month, but registering a rise of 2.96 percent compared with the same month of
the previous year.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS said in a news release that the decline was mainly caused by a drop in
prices for winter vegetables thanks to a bumper harvest. A seasonal discount in
ready-to-wear garments was also attributed to the CPI drop.</P>
      <P>Referring to the year-on-year growth of 2.96 percent, DGBAS officials said that
an overall growth in all major indices for the CPI was the reason for the surge,
particularly a year-on-year increase of 5.29 percent in prices of food products
and of 4.56 percent in transport costs.</P>
      <P>The wholesale price index (WPI) registered at 111.38 in January, up by 0.81
percent from the previous month and up 10.21 percent from the same month of the
previous year, according to the DGBAS statistics.</P>
      <P>Wu Chao-ming, chief of the DGBAS third section, attributed the 10.21-percent
rise --  the largest since November 2004 -- to fluctuations in raw materials and
crude oil prices.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the import price index increased by 16.94 percent in January from the
year-earlier level when counted based on the new Taiwan dollar value, while the
export price index posted a year-on-year growth of 3.1 percent, the tallies
show.</P>

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Fu Kun-chi said at a news conference
Tuesday that he has donated his election subsidies to social welfare groups, so
his creditors would not be able to seize it as part of his debt repayment.</P>
      <P>Fu said he bought rice and olive oil with all election subsidies and gave the
goods to a total of 18 social welfare groups charged with helping the
disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>The election subsidy is given by the government to candidates who win a certain
proportion of votes cast in elections. Each vote is worth NT$30. Fu received
NT$1.87 million (US$58,396) for wining over 60,000 votes in the legislative
elections last month.</P>
      <P>Fu's creditors had asked the Central Election Commission (CEC) via adistrict
court to detain Fu's election subsidies, but the CEC replied to the court that
the request should be delivered to the Hualien County Election Commission, as it
is the subsidy issuer for Fu.</P>
      <P>Fu, meanwhile, said that the unpaid debts of NT$17.5 million in his name are due
to his agreeing to act as a guarantor for other people.</P>
      <P>Fu said he will not let the subsidy money be used to pay his debts. The donation
to social welfare groups is aimed at returning the money to where it came from,
he said, adding that he will give part of his salary to the disadvantaged every
three months in the future.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung City Government urged local fishermen Tuesday not to sell their
diesel oil rationed by the government and announced a plan to crack down on the
illegal trade.</P>
      <P>According to officials at the Kaohsiung City Government's ocean affairs bureau,
the bureau will work jointly with the cabinet-level Council of Agriculture and
the Coast Guard Administration in pursuit of that end.</P>
      <P>The municipal bureau has worked out a comprehensive program to wipe out the
illegal trade in fishing boat fuel, both on land and offshore, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>To prevent fishermen from forging documents on the distance sailed  in  order
to  make  an  illegal  profit  by selling government-rationed fishing boat oil,
a task force composed of officials from the three units boarded a coast patrol
boat to carry out inspections off the coast of Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials called on fishermen to rigorously abide by the law and warned that
anyone and any ship caught engaging in the unlawful business will be dealt with
by the book harshly.</P>
      <P>They also urged the public to report to the Fisheries Agency if they become
aware of such cases.</P>
      <P>The illegal trade in government-rationed fishing boat diesel oil among local
fishermen has grown rapidly since petroleum and fuel prices surged by folds in
the middle of last year.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung is the largest port city in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Release of reporter highlights Beijing's `carrot-stick' ploy: MAC</HEADLINE>

      <P>China's release ahead of the Chinese New Year festival of a Hong Kong reporter
convicted of spying for Taiwan signifies its "carrot-and-stick" strategy toward
Taiwan, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said in a press statement Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The country's top China policy planning agency issued the statement after Ching
Cheong, a Hong Kong-based correspondent for Singapore's The Straits Times
newspaper, was released on parole earlier in the day after having served more
than half of a five-year prison term.</P>
      <P>Ching, 58, was sentenced to five years in August 2006 on charges of spying for
Taiwan. He was detained during a visit to the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou
in April 2005 and sentenced in a one-day trial 16 months later. A Chinese court
rejected his appeal in November 2006.</P>
      <P>The MAC said it was delighted to see Ching regain his freedom and return to Hong
Kong to be reunited with his family during the festive season.</P>
      <P>Describing Ching's imprisonment as an example of Beijing's suppression of press
freedom, the MAC expressed hope that similar cases will not happen again.</P>
      <P>Like Ching, the MAC statement said, many other people have been put under
surveillance and house arrest or detained by the Chinese authorities for
covering news or seeking freedom of speech.</P>
      <P>Noting that China hopes to nurture an image corresponding with that of a rising
power, the MAC statement said it hopes the international community can push the
Chinese authorities to remove their control of news and freedom of speech at an
early date.</P>
      <P>It also rebutted China's accusation that Ching spied in China for Taiwan,
describing the allegation as totally unfounded.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a senior MAC official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, analyzed
that Ching's release, which followed the release of another alleged Taiwanese
spy -- Lin Cheng-cheng, a former chairman of the Japanese language department at
Tunghai University in central Taiwan -- is an effective application of its
"carrot and stick" approach toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As recently as last Saturday, the official said, China's two top agencies
dealing with Taiwan affairs -- the Central Office for Taiwan Affairs under the
Communist Party of China and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council --
issued a joint statement condemning Taiwan's planned referendum on its U.N.
membership bid.</P>
      <P>"China, while on the one hand relentlessly and mercilessly suppressing Taiwan
diplomatically, has on the other hand released the two alleged Taiwanese spies
ahead of the most important Chinese festival in an attempt to gain good press
and win the goodwill of the Taiwanese people," the official said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the official went on, China has released Ching at a significant
moment in an effort to shift international attention from its "inept crisis
management" as shown in its response to its recent snowstorms.</P>
      <P>"Ching's release will bring positive media coverage,  thus mitigating media
focus and scrutiny of China's new generation of leadership's administrative
incompetence," the official added.</P>
      <P>According to China's official Xinhua News Agency, Ching was convicted of selling
unspecified "state secrets and intelligence" to a Taiwanese foundation that it
claimed was a front for Taiwanese espionage activities in China.</P>
      <P>The National Security Bureau has denied using the organization, known as the
Foundation for International and Cross Strait Studies, for spying, saying it
only commissioned the group to conduct academic research.</P>

      <P>Local stainless steel foundries were calm Tuesday in the face of a recent
announcement by the European Union (EU) that it would launch a probe into
Taiwan's alleged dumping of stainless cold-rolled steel plates.</P>
      <P>The European Commission, the EU's executive branch, posted a bulletin last
Friday announcing its intention to launch an investigation into the alleged
dumping of cold-rolled steel plates by Taiwan, China and South Korea, the Bureau
of Foreign Trade said in a news release.</P>
      <P>The anti-dumping measure was adopted after European steel makers filed a
complaint over exports by their competitors from China, South Korea and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under the complaint, it is claimed that Taiwan's exports of steel products to
the EU grew to 22.94 percent of total EU imports of this kind in September 2007,
up from 18.89 percent in 2006 and 17.51 percent in 2005, according to the news
release.</P>
      <P>The bureau urged local businesses, which have been targeted by the probe, to
cooperate with the investigation.</P>
      <P>However, the Kaohsiung-based Tang Eng Iron Works Co. Ltd., one of Taiwan's major
steel foundries, said the probe, won't threaten its operations even if the EU
decides to levy punishing tariffs on Taiwan's steel products because the EU has
never been a major market for the company's goods.</P>
      <P>The Yulin County-based Froch Enterprise Co., one of the world's leading
manufacturers of stainless steel tubes and pipes, and the Taipei County-based
Hsin Kuang Steel Co., have both opined that the probe won't pose as a threat to
their exports.</P>
      <P>The companies stated that their exports to the European market have been limited
because EU demand for steel products differs from that of other foreign markets
in terms of kind and size, executives of the companies said.</P>
      <P>The companies went on to say that they have a wealth of experience handling
anti-dumping accusations and see little reason for concern.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Fisheries Agency has urged the Coast Guard Administration (CGA) and local
customs officials to reinforce a crackdown on elver smuggling many times but has
not received any reports on the issue from the relevant organizations, an agency
official complained Monday.</P>
      <P>The remarks came after the Mainichi Shimbun, a major Japanese daily, reported
earlier in the day that some Taiwanese companies are still smuggling elvers to
Japan though Hong Kong, despite the Taiwanese government's ban on the export of
elvers imposed last November.</P>
      <P>The five-month ban is part of the government's efforts to preserve dwindling eel
resources, said Tsao Hong-cheng, a deputy chief of the agency's fishery
facilities and aquaculture section.</P>
      <P>The falling stocks of elvers has resulted in prices soaring to NT$42 (US$1.3)
each now from NT$5-NT$10 in 1990, when Taiwan netted up to 40 tonnes of the
fish, Tsao went on.</P>
      <P>The Mainichi Shimbun also cited agency tallies compiled as of late January and
said the agency had reported a total of 3.5 tonnes of elvers caught so far this
year, but that it had lost track of the whereabouts of 3 tonnes of the elvers.</P>
      <P>In response, Tsao said that based on data collected from local fishery
cooperatives, approximately 0.6 tonnes-1 tonne of bigger elvers have been put
into aquaculture ponds, while smaller ones are still being kept in nursery
ponds.</P>
      <P>In addition, Tsao pointed out that the peak periods for netting elvers are
December and January and that Taiwan has only caught a mere 3.5 tonnes this
year. He also predicted that eel prices will continue to rise.</P>
      <P>According to Tsao, Taiwan caught 6 tonnes of elvers in 2005, 16 tonnes in 2006
and 7 tonnes in 2007.</P>
      <P>China and Japan also caught fewer elvers this year, with 9 tonnes and 3.5
tonnes, respectively, Tsao added.</P>

      <P>Acute upper respiratory tract infection has been the top cause of medical
emergencies reported during previous Lunar New Year holiday, a health official
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The remarks came one day before this year's Lunar New Year holiday, which will
end next Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Yu-min, an official of the Bureau of National Health Insurance, attributed
the cause to people visiting their relatives and friends in different parts of
Taiwan during the holiday.</P>
      <P>Chen said that during the holiday period last year, more than 241,500 emergency
cases were reported.</P>
      <P>Of these,  over 33,200 were acute upper respiratory tract infections, including
symptoms of fever, headache and runny nose, followed by 27,800 enterogastritis
cases and 16,000 acute abdominal pain cases, Chen added.</P>
      <P>During the holidays, most hospitals in Taiwan will only receive emergency cases.</P>
      <P>In terms of the different regions in Taiwan, Chen said most of the reported
emergency cases in northern Taiwan were enterogastritis, while in other parts of
Taiwan, most of the cases were acute upper respiratory tract infections.</P>
      <P>Some 10 percent of the reported cases were related to traffic accidents or
accidental injuries, Chen added.</P>

      <P>A large-scale march from the country's south to the north will begin Wednesday
to seek more support for Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential

      <P>Hsieh is trailing his rival Ma Ying-jeou of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
in the runup to the March 22 election, according to recent opinion polls.</P>
      <P>In addition, the DPP suffered a huge blow in last month's legislative  polls,
winning a mere 27 seats in the 113-seat legislature compared with 81 seats
clinched by the KMT.</P>
      <P>The march will start from Eluanbi, the southernmost tip of Taiwan, and end in
the capital Taipei, Lee Ying-yuan, Hsieh's campaign executive secretary-general,
told a press conference.</P>
      <P>It will be organized by the DPP and several civic groups, including the U.N. for
Taiwan Alliance and the Hand-in-Hand to Safeguard Taiwan Alliance, according to
Lee.</P>
      <P>From Feb. 10, the marchers will organize a series of campaign rallies in
Kaohsiung City, Tainan City, Chiayi City, Taichung City, Hsinchu City, Taoyuan
City and Taipei County along the way.</P>
      <P>The DPP will hold another rally in Taipei City Feb. 28 to conclude the march.</P>
      <P>For her part, Cheng Li-chun, head of the DPP's youth department, said at the
press conference that the DPP sincerely accepts the legislative outcome and has
reflected on its mistakes.</P>
      <P>However, the DPP is also worried that the KMT will abuse its power, as it now
occupies three-quarters of the legislature, Cheng went on, calling on the public
to take part in the march.</P>
      <P>The DPP has repeatedly appealed to voters to elect Hsieh president  to ensure a

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) has doubled its budget for the promotion of
elderly education to NT$46.54 million (US$1.45 million) for 2008 as Taiwan's
senior population continues to increase, ministry officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The amount compares with NT$25.75 million earmarked for 2006 and NT$22.25
million for 2007, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The program targeting seniors is in line with a white paper released by the
ministry in 2006 to outline the government's education policy to deal with a
greying society. Unveiled in the document are four major visions that the
government aims to achieve: enhancing life-long learning, health and happiness,
independence and self-esteem, and social participation among senior citizens.</P>
      <P>In addition to working out a five-year plan to implement the policy, the
ministry has also set up a task force consisting of government, academic and
civic representatives to assist with the policy's implementation, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>To increase the country's  citizens' understanding  of the difficulties faced by
seniors and the positive value of the group, the ministry is planning to add
elements aimed at fostering knowledge about aging to the compulsory education
curriculum, they said.</P>
      <P>In a bid to promote the utility of senior human resources, the ministry is
encouraging its affiliated agencies to recruit retired personnel and senior
volunteers to help promote education programs for the elderly, they said, adding
that such a method will help inspire their peers to take part in community
service and interact more with society.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ministry will set up an "elderly education guidance centers" in
the northern, central, southern and eastern regions, which will be tasked with
developing teaching materials, training tutors, and supervising and guiding the
implementation of elderly education.</P>
      <P>Also, the ministry has proposed that a special unit be set up under the
education bureau of each local government to take charge of promoting elderly
education and that "grey-haired learning centers" and "life-long learning
centers" be established in local communities, MOE officials said.</P>
      <P>According to Interior Ministry tallies, the number of Taiwan people aged 65 and
above amounted to 2,337,932 as of November 2007, accounting for 10.19 percent of
the country's total population.</P>
      <P>In 10 counties and cities, the ratios of senior citizens were higher than the
average, accounting for 12-15 percent of the localities' population. They
included Yilan County, Miaoli County, Nantou County, Yunlin County, Chiayi
County, Tainan County, Taitung County, Hualien County, Penghu County and Kinmen
County.</P>
      <P>It has been forecast that 10 years from now, the number of people aged 65 and
above in Taiwan will have reached 3.02 million, accounting for 13 percent of the
country's total population and outnumbering people aged below 14 who are
expected to account for only 12.72 percent of the population by then.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's three operating nuclear power plants generated a total of 38.96 billion
kilowatt-hours (kwh) of electricity in 2007, with the capacity factor reaching
90.28 percent, according to tallies released Wednesday by the Atomic Energy
Council (AEC).</P>
      <P>Both figures are the highest ever recorded by the power plants, AEC officials
said.</P>
      <P>In 2007, there were a total of 14 reportable events at the six reactor units
belonging to the three power plants, including two trips, the officials said,
adding that all these events were within "level 0, " meaning "no safety
significance" on the international nuclear event scale introduced by the
International Energy Agency.</P>
      <P>They noted that after a measurement uncertainty recapture power uprate last
year, power generation by the two reactor units at the second power plant
increased by 20 megawatts.</P>
      <P>Based on a capacity factor of 90 percent, the increment means power supply will
increase by 158 million kwh per year, the officials said, adding that if the
thermo-power generation were reduced by the same amount, carbon dioxide
emissions in the country would decrease by 118,000 metric tons per year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, they pointed out that automatic seismic scram devices installed at
the three power plants officially began operating in November 2007.</P>
      <P>According to the AEC, such a device immediately sends out a signal to the safety
protection system of the nuclear power unit whenever the seismic sensor detects
earthquake tremors exceeding the nuclear plant's Operating Basis Earthquake
(OBE) . This signal causes a reactor trip and ensures that the reactor is safely
shutdown in the event of a strong earthquake.</P>
      <P>As to the fourth nuclear power plant that is still under construction, the AEC
has assigned a committee consisting of civic and academic representatives to
supervise the quality and safety of the project, AEC officials said, adding that
as of the end of 2007, the project had been 75 percent completed.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian sent his Chinese New Year greetings in a pre-recorded
video Wednesday, expressing his appreciation to all of Taiwan's citizens for
their contribution to the country.</P>
      <P>The video, intended for broadcast by domestic television networks on Chinese New
Year's Eve, begins with footage of people from various walks of life working
diligently, including police officers, bus drivers, freeway toll collectors,
hair salon assistants, street cleaners, telecom maintenance workers, marketplace
cleaners, grocery retailers, factory operators, farmers and fishermen.</P>
      <P>The president said he would like to express his thanks to everyone in the
country for their day-to-day contribution and devotion to Taiwan in the past and
in the future.</P>
      <P>Chen said he has always considered himself lucky to be able to stand by the side
of such kind, passionate and hard-working people in going through difficult
times and striving to uphold their dignity and change their destiny.</P>
      <P>"It proves heaven is fair that Taiwan, lacking in natural resources, has such a
precious group of people who have not only created  an economic  miracle but
also attained  the proudest achievements -- freedom and democracy," he said.</P>

      <P>People can make use of the recently launched "Northeast Coast Railway One Day
Pass, " which covers all scenic spots and tourist attractions along the
northeast coast of Taiwan, to travel during the Lunar New Year holidays, an
official of the Northeast and Yilan Coast National Scenic Area said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"With the pass, which costs only NT$130 (US$ 4) , people can easily travel
through the northeast coast area without being stuck in the holiday traffic
jams, " said Chen Mei Kang, director of the Northeast and Yilan Coast National
Scenic Area.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation  and Communication
cooperated with the Taiwan Railways Administration to launch the Northeast Coast
Railway One Day Pass last November to promote tourism.</P>
      <P>Chen said that tourists can look far into the distance to see the Pacific Ocean
when taking the northeast coast railway line and that there is a mountain view
as well.</P>
      <P>"The openness and beautiful scenery can definitely cheer people up," he added.</P>
      <P>Also, there are lots of tourist attractions near the stations of the Northeast
Coast Line, including the Caoling Historic Trail, the Fulong beach area, the
Dali Tian-gong Temple, and Kueishan Island, located 10 kilometer off the coast
of Yilan.</P>
      <P>Other tourist spots, such as the Chinguashi-Chiou-fen mining town and the
Shuang-hsi flower garden, can easily reached by using the line, Chen said,
adding that "recreation can be integrated with cultural and ecological tourism
resources and together form a convenient, comfortable and safe way of travel."</P>
      <P>He added that the one day pass also covers the Pingsi Branch Line, which people
can make use of to visit all the scenic places along the line.</P>
      <P>The "Northeast Coast Railway One Day Pass" are available at the Taipei Main
Station or stations along the North-Link Line with a free brochure introducing
information  on tourist spots,  food and accommodations, Chen said, adding that
people can receive discount at certain shops by showing the pass.</P>
      <P>Tourists can find itineraries recommended by the Northeast and Yilan Coast
National Scenic Area at http: //www.necoast-nsa.gov.tw. For more information

      <P>World no. 22 Lleyton Hewitt gave Australia a 1-0 lead in its Asia/Oceania Zone
Group I first round Davis Cup tie against Taiwan Friday at Kaohsiung's Yangming
Tennis Center with a 6-4, 6-0, 6-3 win over Chen Ti, in a match that was more

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, Feb. 8 (CNA)
02/08/08  21:37:18</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan had hoped this would be the year it could finally achieve its long-
anticipated Davis Cup breakthrough and at least reach a playoff round to enter
the World Group of tennis' top international team competition, but Australia is
now likely to derail its plans.</P>
      <P>Led by world number 22 Lleyton Hewitt, Australia took a 2-0 lead against Taiwan
on the first day of their best-of-five Asia/Oceania Zone Group I tie Friday, and
needs only a win in Saturday's doubles or either of Sunday's reverse singles to
advance to the second round.</P>
      <P>On a court that Hewitt described as "strange", the former Wimbledon champion put
away the much lower ranked Chen Ti, 6-4, 6-0, 6-3 in a 2 hour 19 minute match
that was more tightly contested than the score would indicate.</P>
      <P>Hard-serving Chris Guccione then used 21 aces to edge past Taiwan no. 1 Lu Yen-
hsun 7-6 (5), 6-4, 7-6 (9) in a 2-hour 55 minute match that had only one break
of serve.</P>
      <P>The arrival of Hewitt, the highest ranked player to ever perform here in a
competitive event, had its positive side, sparking unprecedented interest in a
local tennis event.</P>
      <P>Although tickets were being sold for a local Davis Cup tie for the first time in
Taiwan --at NT$399 for the day and NT$1,000 for a three-day pass--5,500 tennis
fans filled Yangming Tennis Center's center court to capacity.</P>
      <P>But neither Lu nor Chen could find the inspiration needed to pick up a much
needed point on the opening day of the tie, even if it was always going to be a
major challenge to defeat an Australian team that was relegated from the World
Group to Asia/Oceania Zone Group 1 at the end of last year for the first time
since 1996.</P>
      <P>Lu had defeated Guccione in their only previous encounter, but the powerful
6-foot-7 left-hander was not deterred in a high-quality match that turned on his
serve.</P>
      <P>"I spent the entire match thinking how I could get close to his serve," said Lu,
who only had five break-point opportunities the entire match.</P>
      <P>"I was hoping he would make a few mistakes but he didn't. I only had a few
opportunities and couldn't take advantage of them."</P>
      <P>While Guccione's serve made an impression, Lu credited the 22- year-old
Australian's victory to his improved volleys and movement at the net.</P>
      <P>"I really took note when I hit some really good crosscourt returns and he got
them back in really tough spots. That made it even tougher because I couldn't
just return his serve, but had to put it in a place that would give him
trouble," Lu said.</P>
      <P>That Guccione was on was never more obvious than at 9-9 in the third set
tiebreaker when the Australian stuck a kick serve in the corner that nearly
bounced into the courtside seats, giving Lu no chance.</P>
      <P>That set up his fifth match point in the tiebreaker, converted when Lu sent a
lunging forehand long.</P>
      <P>"The reason I served well is because I needed to," Guccione said. " (Lu) is a
great player and he returns serve very well."</P>
      <P>In the first match of the day, Taiwan's Chen was not expected to win, but he
actually moved up a break in the first set at 3-2 against his far more
celebrated opponent, and was the more consistent of the two players in the
sloppily played first eight games.</P>
      <P>Hewitt's class eventually held, though.</P>
      <P>"I felt good at the beginning and had a shot at the first set, but then I got a
little too conservative," said Chen, chosen to play singles ahead of Taiwan's
No. 2 Wang Yeu-tzuoo, who is still nursing a wrist injury. "He started moving me
around and ran me a lot side to side in long rallies, and I had trouble keeping
up."</P>
      <P>Chen, ranked 248 positions lower than Hewitt, never let the highly regarded
Australian off easily, pushing three of the six games in the second set to deuce
and fighting off a total of 11 breaks points in the fourth and sixth games of
the final set to hold serve before succumbing.</P>
      <P>But the 24-year-old Chen, whose goal this year is to break into the top 200 for
the first time in his career, acknowledged the gap between him and Hewitt.</P>
      <P>"From a physical point of view, I'm not at Hewitt's level. If I had been, I
could have given more in the third set," said Chen, who called for a trainer to
treat a pulled left thigh midway through the third set. "I'm also missing a
weapon that can get me easy points. I didn't serve as well as I would have liked
today and that made a difference."</P>
      <P>Chen only managed to get in 52 percent of first serves, while Hewitt often found
a big serve when he needed it.</P>
      <P>Hewitt, playing in his 43rd Davis Cup match since his debut in 1999 and known
for his commitment to an event that many top players shun, admitted that playing
in a Zonal Group tie was a new experience.</P>
      <P>"It's easy to get up to play big Davis Cup matches at home in front of 15,000
people, playing finals and semifinals. It's very easy to play those ties. These
are the tough ones to get motivated for," said Hewitt, who noted nonetheless
that he never gets tired of Davis Cup, calling putting on the "golden jacket of
Australia" the greatest honor there is.</P>
      <P>Hewitt did get a special taste of playing in a zonal event, playing on a court
that has not seen too many big events. When asked to describe its speed, the 26
-year-old Australian could only call it "skiddy" and "dirty" with a coating of
dust that made bounces tricky.</P>
      <P>A defeat in the tie would send Taiwan into a relegation round, but more
importantly will keep it out of a World Group playoff that seemed likely in 2003
when the country made it into Asia/Oceania Group I behind Lu and Wang.</P>
      <P>Since then, injuries and organizational flaps have held Taiwan back, but on
Friday, the Australians were simply too good.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to send Lu and Wang in the doubles Saturday against
Australia's Paul Hanley and Hewitt to keep the tie alive into Sunday. (Luke

and comes to me for advice, I accept his present reformation without inquiring
what his past life has been. I am satisfied if I find that, for the present, he
has really reformed, without being able to guarantee that he will not relapse
again. But why should one be too severe?"</TEXT>

      <P>Newly elected young members of Taiwan's Legislative Yuan will be focusing on the
economy and education when the first session of the lawmaking body opens on Feb.
22, hoping to set a new tone in an arena known more recently for partisan
rancor.</P>
      <P>One of the new faces, 33-year-old Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator
Chen Ting-fei representing a district in Tainan City, said she felt she could
make a contribution to the economy.</P>
      <P>"A nation's economic problems cannot be solved solely by a legislator, but I
will use my educational background in business administration to monitor the
government's economic policies, " she said.</P>
      <P>She also promised to devote some of her time to education issues and help ease
parents' fears and worries in this area of widespread concern.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Chiang Lin-chun, 33, who represents Kaohsiung
County, criticized the government's education policy as being hamstrung by
uncertainty, which has seriously impaired the rights of parents and students.</P>
      <P>"They have no idea which policy to follow," Chiang said, pledging to supervise
the government as it makes education-related decisions.</P>
      <P>Chiang also promised to be more engaged in economic issues because of the high
unemployment rate plaguing southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The youngest lawmaker in the newly elected assembly, 27-year-old KMT Legislator
Chang Chia-chun representing Yunlin County, said the economy would be her
priority because of her county's special nature.</P>
      <P>"Yunlin is an agriculture-based county and is more heavily influenced by the
nation's economic situation than other cities or counties, " said Chang, the
daughter of one of the county's more powerful political figures, former
magistrate Chang Jung-wei.</P>
      <P>As the only legislator who was born in the 1980s, Chang promised to voice the
opinions of people her own age in the new legislative body.</P>

      <P>The newly elected legislature should be more transparent and open to help the
public better understand its internal operations and its opaque inter-party
negotiating system, local civic groups said Friday.</P>
      <P>Contending that the new legislature should be more concerned about citizens'
right to be informed, Ku called on the body, which begins its first session on
Feb. 22, to make legislative negotiations open to the public.</P>
      <P>"More open hearings or debates should be held to help people understand the
advantages and disadvantages of legislation, " said Ku Chung-hwa,  president  of
the Citizen Congress  Watch.  "Every interpellation should be televised live and
inter-party negotiations must be recorded."</P>
      <P>Many groups have complained about the previous legislature's tendency to resolve
contentious legislation behind closed doors, leading to suspicions of deal-
making  based on the lawmakers' individual interests.</P>
      <P>Other basic information, such as bills pending or attendance records, have not
always been readily available.</P>
      <P>"In the past, the public couldn't get access to the body's internal rules and
real-time information on its activities, which is not typical of a true
democracy, " said Ku.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Legislative Yuan is well equipped with advanced communication
facilities, Peng Jin-peng, secretary-general of the Taiwan Competitiveness
Forum, said the legislature could make a greater effort to improve its
transparency.</P>
      <P>"People also need to know about the attendance of the lawmakers and the voting
process within the Legislative Yuan," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Chien Hsi-chieh,  chief executive officer of the Peacetime Foundation of Taiwan,
said the Legislative Yuan should set up or rent a television channel to publicly
broadcast every session.</P>
      <P>"This will help people supervise our legislature and prevent corruption," Chien
stressed.</P>

      <P>Launching more international charter flights and cooperating with travel
agencies to create attractive tour packages could be remedies for declining
passenger traffic and revenues at local airports that serve only domestic
routes, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)  said in a statement released
Saturday.</P>
      <P>The development of local overland transportation infrastructure has taken its
toll on domestic routes -- and consequently airports serving those routes.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's 18 airports generated NT$15.7 billion (US$490.62 million) in revenue in
2006, but the only two that made money that year were its two international
gateways, the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and Kaohsiung International
Airport.</P>
      <P>To improve the finances of the 16 money-losing airports, domestic airlines
should break with routes that are already well served by ground transportation
and look abroad, the CAA said.</P>
      <P>"For airports in areas like Taichung, Kinmen and Hualien, which are locations
fit for international airlines, launching international charter flights could
revitalize business," the statement said.</P>
      <P>Three local airlines, Uni Air, Far Eastern Air Transport and Mandarin Airlines,
all benefited from such a strategy last year, the CAA said, citing Uni Air's
profitable flights from Taichung to Japan, Hong Kong and Vietnam.</P>
      <P>Special packages to popular tourist destinations in Taiwan's eastern counties
and outlying islands could also spark business, the CAA said.</P>
      <P>"Airlines could take advantage of the areas' natural beauty in combination with
support from local governments and travel agencies to provide packages that spur
demand," the statement said.</P>
      <P>Another way to create business for the underused airports, the CAA suggested,
was to organize aeronautics exhibitions or festivals.</P>
      <P>"This could produce a twofold benefit -- raising profit while enticing more
public attention to the development of the airline industry," the statement
said.</P>
      <P>Business at airports serving primarily domestic routes has been ravaged by the
high-speed north-south railway connecting Taipei and Kaohsiung, two major north-
south freeways, and other expressways making travel around the island faster and
more convenient.</P>
      <P>The number of domestic flights in Taiwan declined at an average rate of 7.7
percent from 2001 to 2007, and passenger load factors fell 25.3 percent between
January and October 2007 after the high-speed railway was launched at the
beginning of the year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kaohsiung doctor warns of fatal bacteria in seafood</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Feb. 9 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A doctor at a Kaohsiung hospital warned people Saturday to be especially
cautious when eating or cooking raw seafood to avoid being infected by a flesh
eating bacteria in the food.</P>
      <P>Chou Chih-kang, chief of the plastic surgery division at Yuan's General Hospital
in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, issued the warning after a 60-year-old
woman lost the function of part of her body and almost died after getting
pricked by live shrimps as she was preparing a shrimp dish.</P>
      <P>"The woman did not pay much attention when her fingers were pricked by a shrimp
shell until they became red and swollen. She was rushed to the hospital a day
later due to signs of fever and shock, " Chou said.</P>
      <P>The bacteria that attacked the woman hits people with weakened immune systems
particularly hard. Chou said the woman, who suffers from cirrhosis of the liver,
was such a case. The flesh-eating bacteria affected half of her body, and she
has had to undergo skin grafts during her 10-week hospital stay.</P>
      <P>Chou said the woman was affected by marine vibrio, a potentially deadly marine
bacterium that usually lives in warm sea water.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is surrounded by sea and seafood is one of the main food  sources  for
people  on the island,  outbreaks  of the seafood-related illness have been
reported on occasion, and Chou cautioned that a number of people were killed or
had to have limbs amputated because of vibrio wound infections.</P>
      <P>"The illness, normally transmitted through raw or uncooked seafood, is usually
characterized by abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, fever and shivers,
" Chou said.</P>
      <P>Some of those infected by the bacteria recover quickly because of healthy immune
systems, but others without the ability to fight the infection can go into shock
and even die if they do not receive medical treatment in time.</P>
      <P>Adding that the infections can also be spread by skin contact, Chou reminded
oyster farmers, fishermen, food preparers or water sports enthusiaststs to
confirm they do not have cuts, scratches, or abrasions on their skin when they
come into contact with fish fins, shrimp shell, oyster shells or sea water.</P>
      <P>Because the infection spreads unusually quickly and is difficult to treat, it
has a mortality rate of between 55 percent and 57 percent.</P>
      <P>Chou said diabetics, kidney disease patients and those who take prednisolone, an
anti-inflammation drug, are at 80-times higher risk of being infected than
ordinary people if they come into contact with the bacteria.</P>

after the Chinese New Year, a CLA official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lai Shu-li, an official of CLA's Bureau of Employment and Vocational Training,
noted that Many Taiwanese hunt for new jobs after the New Year holiday, up to
three times as many as during other times of the year, and employers also tend

      <P>To help with their search, job seekers can take advantage of the bureau's
consulting service at 351 career centers islandwide, said Lai. The bureau helps
job hunters find their most suitable career paths by evaluating the professional
attributes and interests of the respondent.</P>
      <P>The service also includes an online platform providing Internet users with a
personalized career checklist that steers job seekers toward careers in which
they might have a better chance to prosper, Lai noted.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  9 (CNA)
02/09/08  19:55:23

    <TEXT>
      <P>An anti-tobacco organization said Friday that Taiwan's government should make
more concrete efforts to control the use of tobacco, after a World Health
Organization (WHO) report released Thursday said tobacco use kills 5.4 million
people a year.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan was once a model in the area of tobacco control. But in recent years,
other countries have reached Taiwan's level by carrying out anti-tobacco
policies efficiently while the Taiwanese government seems to hesitate, " said
Lin Ching-li, the director of the tobacco control section of the John Tung
Foundation (JTF) , in a phone interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>The JTF, one of the most prominent nongovernmental organizations in Taiwan, was
founded in 1984 to promote the public's interest in the areas of tobacco control
and mental health.</P>
      <P>The WHO's first report on global tobacco use and control efforts released
Thursday in New York said tobacco use has become one of the biggest public
health threats the world has ever faced, killing 5.4 million people a year at
present and likely to kill 8 million by 2030.</P>
      <P>About 20,000 people die annually from tobacco-related diseases in Taiwan, where
about 5 million people, or 22 percent of the total population, smoke, according
to foundation statistics.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is not a WHO member state, it has made efforts to reduce tobacco
use. In late January, the Department of Health (DOH) proposed raising the health
tax on cigarettes to NT$45 a pack instead of the current NT$10.</P>
      <P>An amendment to the Tobacco Hazard Control Act approved by the Legislative Yuan
will also be implemented in early 2009.</P>
      <P>"But Taiwan can do much better, " Lin said, arguing that the government should
raise the tobacco commodity tax from 50 percent to at least 70 percent like most
European countries, because "high prices are the most effective way to reduce
tobacco use."</P>
      <P>Lin added that surface area of warnings on cigarette packaging should be
enlarged from 35 percent to 60 percent of the pack's total area, citing Canada's
experience in which that country's young smoking population has dropped by 11
percent since big surface area graphic warnings were mandated in 2001.</P>
      <P>"We hope that Taiwan come up with more resolute anti-tobacco policies, and
establishes a smoke-free environment, " Lin stressed.</P>

Taiwan-France Science &amp; Technology Awards" to the two laureates at an
awarding ceremony to be held in Paris on Feb. 11, officials at the Taipei
Representative Office in France said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The awards -- established in 1999 based on an agreement between the cabinet-
level NSC and Academie des Sciences, Institut de France (French Academy
Institute) -- are issued to one or two distinguished scientists in Taiwan or
France to honor their achievements in specific scientific areas designated for
the year by the review board.</P>
      <P>Biology and chemistry were the areas designated for 2007, while mathematics,
physics,  chemistry,  astronomy,  geoscience,  and engineering were the main
categories for 2008, according to the NSC liaison office stationed in France.</P>
      <P>The office said that the 2007 award winners are Hsing Yue-ie -- a research
fellow at Academia Sinica's Institute of Plant and Microbial Biology -- and
Michel Delseny -- a research fellow at University of Perpignan/CNRS in France.</P>
      <P>According to Academia Sinica, Delseny and Hsing have been friends for 20 years
and collaborated on seed research ever since. The duo's research led to major
advances in rice genomics and functional genomics.</P>
      <P>They analyzed  a group of unique  seeds laced  with late embryogenesis abundant
proteins -- which are essential to the desiccation tolerance in seed -- and
their study of the protein's structure and potential functions has paved the way
for many other valuable research results.</P>

      <P>Recent air pollution index readings from monitoring stations in Taipei City
showed that air quality in the city during the first four days of the Chinese
New Year holiday has been better than usual, an Environmental Protection
Administration official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The official attributed the improvement to a significant decrease in vehicle
exhaust fumes, as many commuters have either left the city to return to their
hometowns in central and southern Taiwan for the New Year break, or simply
stayed at home to enjoy the break.</P>
      <P>Taipei's gain, however, came at the expense of central and southern Taiwan,
where the vehicles heading south contributed to pollution in those areas.</P>
      <P>Central and southern Taiwan benefited from the closure of polluting factories
for the holidays, but the added exhaust fumes have kept pollution readings in
the area at pre-holiday levels, the official said.</P>

      <P>The Tourism Bureau of the Lienchiang County government wants to develop new
local merchandise with a distinct local flavor that can spark business expansion
and promote tourism in the area.</P>
      <P>Lienchiang County is the administrative name for the outlying Matsu Islands,
located 211 kilometers northeast of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The county attracts more than 100,000 visitors a year, a number that is still
growing, who spend about NT$750 million (US$23.43 million) a year while visiting
the county's islands. Because at least 40 percent of that is spent on local
specialties, the bureau estimated that a market of at least NT$300 million
exists for special products from the region.</P>
      <P>The government has given financial support to the development of local products
over the years, and believes that more investment from the private  sector  will
boost  the attractiveness  of local merchandise.</P>
      <P>With tourism the key engine of local economic growth, Matsu is known for its
local liquors, fish noodles and bakeries. In the past goods from China were
often seen on the shelves of local gift shops because of the direct transport
links between the islands and China, but these products were later withdrawn
because of their low-quality.</P>
      <P>According to local tour guides, visitors in recent years have begun to complain
about local products for their plainness and lack of choice.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Australia downs Taiwan in Davis Cup</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Feb.9 (CNA)
02/09/08  20:49:49
(By Luke Sabatier)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>For a while on Saturday, it appeared that Taiwan would pull off an unlikely
upset in the doubles of its Asia/Oceania Zone Group I tie against Australia to
keep its hopes alive, but the experience of the visitors and some unappreciated
trash talking helped them prevail in five sets and clinch victory in the tie.</P>
      <P>Trailing 2-0 after Friday's singles, Taiwan needed Lu Yen-hsun and Wang Yeu-
tzuoo, who had not played together since the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, to beat
doubles specialist Paul Hanley and Lleyton Hewitt, an accomplished doubles
player in his own right, to make Sunday's reverse singles matches matter.</P>
      <P>But after winning the first two sets, Taiwan became slightly deflated after Wang
was broken early in the third set and eventually succumbed 4-6, 6-7 (4), 6-4,
6-2, 6-2, a defeat that gave Australia an insurmountable 3-0 lead in the tie.</P>
      <P>With the victory, Australia advances to the second round of the group to face
the winner of the tie between Thailand and Kazakhstan, which Thailand led 2-1
after Saturday's doubles. The winner of that battle will enter a World Group
playoff that would give Australia a chance to get back into the elite 16-country
World Group in which it has held a spot every year since 1981 except for 1996.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, on the other hand, will enter a relegation playoff to keep its spot in
Asia/Oceania Group I, where it has been since 2004. If it beats the loser of
Thailand/Kazakhstan, its 2008 campaign will come to an end.</P>
      <P>Although the arrival of Australia propped up local tennis, at least for a
weekend, by drawing record crowds and media attention, it was also likely to
extend Taiwan's Davis Cup frustration of never having a World Group playoff,
despite having two of Asia's best players.</P>
      <P>Hewitt beat Taiwan's Chen Ti in straight sets in the opening singles on Friday
and Chris Guccione edged Taiwan no. 1 Lu in a match that Taiwan needed to have a
chance on the weekend to give Australia a decisive advantage.</P>
      <P>For the first two sets on Saturday, however, Lu and Wang were extremely sharp,
and after Wang smashed a gorgeous crosscourt backhand to pass Hewitt to win the
second set tiebreaker, an upset appeared possible.</P>
      <P>But the Australians picked up the quality of their service returns and when they
broke Wang's serve in the third game of the third set to go up 2-1, Taiwan was
always on the defensive after that, being broken in the first games of the
fourth and fifth sets.</P>
      <P>After the match, Lu called the weekend "disappointing" but felt the matches had
been played at a high level. More disconcerting to both Lu and Wang, however,
was Hewitt's apparent expletive- and insult-laced trash talking during the
doubles.</P>
      <P>"They may have won the match, but they didn't win our respect, " Lu said, with
both players chiding Hewitt for a lack of class.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's team captain Lien Yu-hui, who ironically played doubles on Taiwan's
last team that last a Davis Cup tie to Australia in 1996, protested to the chair
umpire but said he didn't want to make a big deal of it on the court.</P>
      <P>The Davis Cup is the world's most prestigious men's team tennis competition,
with 16 countries in the World Group playing for the Cup every year. Below the
elite level are regional zones, with Group I the highest level.</P>

      <P>The  Shang  Yi  Airport  on the Taiwan-controlled outlying island of Kinmen
began in the early hours of Sunday to host crowds of travelers bound for Taiwan
proper.</P>
      <P>Despite the Lunar New Year holiday still having a full day to run people flocked
to the airport, keen to fly back to their residences in Taiwan's cities.</P>
      <P>Although a joint ticket counter opened by four domestic airlines operating
Taiwan-Kinmen flights did not open until 7 a.m., people without reserved flights
began to form a queue in front of the counter at 4 a.m.</P>
      <P>As of 11: 30 a.m., there were more than 400 travelers on the waiting list,
nearly 300 of whom were trying to get to Taipei, with only 60 people having
obtained seats.</P>
      <P>Airport Director Hung Nien-tsi said the number of passengers on the waiting list
recorded a decline of nearly 50 percent in comparison  with the level of the
same period of last year, speculating that this might be a result of the shorter
holiday this year.</P>
      <P>The 2007 Lunar New Year festival ran from Feb. 17-22, but most people enjoyed a
holiday spanning  nine days after a workday adjustment. This year, the festival
took place Feb. 6-11.</P>
      <P>On Sunday, there were a total of 64 planned Kinmen-Taiwan flights and 30 extra
flights, for a total of around 5,000 available seats, according to the airport.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Sunday that it is worth waiting in line in the
cold to take the Maokong Gondola and see the sights along the cable car line in
the city's Muzha district.</P>
      <P>Like most places in Taiwan, Taipei was affected by a cold snap that arrived on
Chinese New Year's Eve and continued on through the national holiday, bringing
the mercury down to as low as 10 degrees.</P>
      <P>Despite the cold,  however,  the gondola passenger numbers increased by 10
percent-20 percent, causing inevitable waits, Hau noted.</P>
      <P>"Many passengers said the 40-minute ride was worth the one-hour wait," Hau
added.</P>
      <P>Hau was visiting the gondola system's Maokong Station and the Taipei Zoo, which
is included on the line, to extend New Year's greetings to tourists and staff
members.</P>
      <P>The cable car system had about 22,000 passengers Feb. 7, 24,000 Feb. 8 and
25,000 Feb. 9, according to the Taipei Rapid Transport Corp., which operates the
gondola. The system usually has about 20,000 passengers per day.</P>
      <P>The gondola was closed Feb. 4-6 for maintenance, and was slated to remain open
for 11 consecutive days from Feb. 7-17.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the number of visitors to the Taipei Zoo during the holiday dropped
by nearly half from last year's figure owing to the cold and rain, Taipei Zoo
Director Chen Pao-chung said, adding however that an exhibition on rodents --
echoing the theme of the Year of the Rat -- was gaining popularity.</P>

      <P>Nearly 700 Chinese tourists are expected to make port Monday in Taiwan aboard
the Rhapsody of the Sea -- Asia's largest ocean liner -- making them the largest
Chinese tourist group ever to be allowed to visit Taiwan, a local daily reported
Sunday.</P>
      <P>To welcome the tourists, the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) has
decided to relax the government's "no more than 1,000 visitors per day"
restriction and to offer the tourists rapid customs clearance, the Chinese-
language United Daily News reported.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the MAC is "torn between loving and fearing" the visit
by such a large number of Chinese travelers -- anticipating that the visits will
provide a shot in the arm to the administration's "doubling the number of
foreign tourists" plan, while fearing that some of them might abscond in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to MAC regulations, the two Taiwan travel agencies authorized to
sponsor the visits will be fined NT$200,000 (US$6,211) for each Chinese tourist
who runs away.</P>
      <P>The Rhapsody of the Sea is scheduled to berth at Keelung Harbor in northern
Taiwan Monday -- the last day of the six-day Chinese New Year holiday -- and at
Kaohsiung Harbor in the south the following day.</P>
      <P>The tourists are scheduled to be bused into Taipei City Monday for a half-day
tour, with another half-day tour of Kaohsiung City the following day. The
visitors are expected to generate business worth over NT$10 million in the two
largest cities in Taiwan, according to the travel agencies.</P>
      <P>The Rhapsody of the Sea is the first ocean liner to be given the green light by
the MAC to bring Chinese tourists to Taiwan via a third country or area.</P>
      <P>With over 2,000 holidaymakers aboard, including those from Southeast Asia,
Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong, the Rhapsody of the Sea is scheduled to
leave Kaohsiung late Tuesday for a return voyage to Hong Kong.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'Baby Boss City' provides children with taste of adulthood</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>"Baby Boss City, " a theme park for children aged between 3 and 15 years old to
"get a taste of adult working life, " opened in the Taipei Living Mall over the
Lunar New Year holiday, allowing children to "try out their dreams jobs, explor
e career aptitudes and learn about the value of money, " according to its
creative director.</P>
      <P>"Baby Boss City is the first of its kind in the Greater China Area, " said
Richard Tsai, who added that the project took a year of preparation and an
investment of NT$400 million (US$12.4 million) by the SECOM Group, a local
security company.</P>
      <P>He said the concept came from a similar theme park called "Kidzania" in Mexico
and other derivations such as "Wannado City" in the United States.</P>
      <P>Kidzania, which opened in Mexico City in 1999, has turned out to be a huge
success, receiving about 800,000 visitors annually. Japan and Indonesia also
opened similar theme parks in 2006 and 2007, respectively.</P>
      <P>"Kids like hands-on experiences where they can learn about an occupation by
talking about it or better yet experiencing it through `job shadowing,'" Tsai
said.</P>
      <P>The 7613-square-meter Baby Boss City is a unique indoor family entertainment
center, a micro-city replicating a real city with streets, buildings, retail
outlets and vehicles.</P>
      <P>Children can play adult roles in over 70 professions and occupations in this
"real world replica, " according to Tsai, who added that it is a "safe,
interactive and educational center where children actually perform the roles
they are playing. "</P>
      <P>Chu Han-kuang, marketing manager of the SECOM Group, said that led by a highly
qualified team, "children will learn about the complexities of the adult world,
its infrastructure, occupations and the value of money, just as in real life."</P>
      <P>Designed to have children work independently without their parents around, the
children will spend 35-45 minutes at every job, which the organizers claimed
will allow them to "learn about the professional knowledge and experience the
entire process" of working a job.</P>
      <P>"Kids cannot focus on their work, think independently and choose what they
really want to do with parents intervening, " Chu said, adding that parents can
nevertheless take pictures from outside the huge glass windows.</P>
      <P>Children begin the game with 20 "Baby Bucks, " the official currency of the
"Baby Boss City," and will earn 10 "Baby Bucks" after finishing every job. They
can use the money to buy goods and services or deposit it in a bank.</P>
      <P>"Kids need to know that they are here to work. Therefore they are not supposed
to take home the products but can buy them with special discounts, " Chu
explained.</P>
      <P>Liu Yang-hsin, mother of an 11-year-old, said the concept "is really good. Kids
can learn and find out their interests from the games, which may help them
decide what they want to do when they grow up. So I will definitely bring my kid
again."</P>
      <P>However she complained that since there were too many people, her child could
only experience three jobs in three hours. Liang Hsiu-fen, mother of a six-year-
old, added that the tickets are also too expensive.</P>
      <P>"Parents need to pay NT$500 per person while a child's ticket costs NT$900," she
pointed out.</P>
      <P>Tsai said tickets bought online are 15 percent cheaper and reservations can be
made up to three months in advance.</P>
      <P>"Baby Boss City" has received sponsorship from multinational brands like Coca-
Cola, Sony and Epson to leading domestic enterprises such as Kuang Chuan Dairy
Co., TransAsia Airways, and I-mei Foods Co. Visitors learn how to operate
different retail and service facilities according to these sponsors' standards.</P>
      <P>"Commercial partners are key to 'Baby Boss City,' as they provide realism to the
concept by sharing their brands and products in each pavilion. They enhance the
activity by sharing their processes and technologies," Chu said.</P>
      <P>The facility attracted more than 80,000 visitors during its Jan. 28-Feb. 6 trial
period, Tsai said, adding that the turnover in the first year is estimated to
reach NT$300 million with an estimated 700,000 visitors and that the SECOM Group
is also planning to launch a similar project in China later this year.</P>

      <P>The TTC-CCS laboratory,  which is co-sponsored by the government and a private
company, has been accredited by the WiMAX Forum to provide both fixed and mobile
WiMAX certification services to manufacturers in the Asia-Pacific region,
according to a statement released by the lab Sunday.</P>
      <P>The WiMAX Forum is an industry-led, nonprofit organization initiated  to
certify  and  promote  the  compatibility  and interoperability of products
using the Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access, or WiMAX technology.</P>
      <P>The forum presently has six certification testing labs worldwide -- four of them
located in the United States, Europe, China and South Korea. The other two, both
in Taiwan, are operated by ADT Corp. and the TTC-CCS Laboratory. The
organization is now mulling whether to establish an additional lab in India
later this year.</P>
      <P>ADT was accredited to offer mobile WiMAX certification late last year, and TTC-
CCS is the first in Taiwan that can also accredit fixed WiMAX products, said the
statement.</P>
      <P>TTC-CCS Lab, a joint venture of the government-funded Telecom Technology Center
(TTC) in Kaohsiung and the Taipei-based Compliance Certification Services Inc.,
Taiwan (CCS), is said to integrate both parent institutions' long experience in
testing the compatibility of various electronic products to provide a better
service in the additional category of WiMAX.</P>
      <P>In addition, Spain's AT4 wireless -- the first WiMAX Forum accredited lab in the
world -- will also provide all necessary technical assistance to perfect the
procedure, TTC staff said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the lab, WiMAX Forum President Ron Resnick said in the statement
that it is a positive step toward ensuring capacity to answer the demand for
WiMAX Forum Certified testing of Taiwanese industry and manufacturers in the
Asian market.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, TTC Chairman Chien Jen-ter said the lab will provide excellent
services to all forum members, while CCS Chairman Rock Hsu said the TTC-CCS is
capable of satisfying the needs of both Taiwanese and global WiMAX manufacturers
in terms of WiMAX certification.</P>

      <P>More than 1,000 tourist-packed automobiles drove up to the snow-capped Hehuan
mountain in central Taiwan Sunday as sunlight warmed the bitterly cold air that
has been chilling the island since Thursday.</P>
      <P>Since Lunar New Year's Day Thursday, the whole country has been covered by an
arctic air mass packing frigid winds. In the early hours of that day, Hehuan
mountain, situated on the border of Nantou and Hualien counties, received the
largest snowfall of this winter, according to a manager of the Hehuan Hostel,
situated at over 3,100 meters.</P>
      <P>Temperatures around the hostel were down to minus 3 degrees Celsius, the manager
said, noting that the road over the mountain -- the highest highway in Taiwan at
3,275 meters -- was covered by around 6cm of snow.</P>
      <P>The frigid weather, however, did not keep the tourists away, the hostel manager
added.</P>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau reported that the cold front was weakening, with the
temperatures expected to increase by 1-2 degrees Celsius Monday to 11-15 degrees
in northern Taiwan, 11-19 degrees in the central region, and 13-24 degrees in
the south, with showers expected in northern, northeastern and eastern areas the
following day, according to the bureau's weather forecast report issued Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chang-nan, a police officer stationed at Jenai township, Nantou County,
warned visitors to Hehuan mountain to beware of icy road conditions in the
mountain area and he suggested that drivers use snow chains on their tires.</P>

      <P>A government-run laboratory has initiated a project to produce cellulose alcohol
from rice straw with the aim of expanding the sources of raw materials for
biofuel, government sources reported Saturday.</P>
      <P>Researchers of the project, sponsored by the Institute of Nuclear Energy
Research (INER) under the Cabinet-level Atomic Energy Council, have completed
testing a prototype system of cellulose alcohol production and expect to
establish a pilot plant with a daily alcohol output of 200 liters by late 2009.</P>
      <P>Straw is mainly composed of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, Project
Director Wang Chia-pao explained, adding that xylose and glucose,  both
ingredients for alcohol, can be extracted from cellulose and hemicellulose.</P>
      <P>"Our refining techniques can turn xylose and glucose into alcohol with 99.5
percent purity, which is suitable for gasohol production, " Wand noted.</P>
      <P>Compared to using cane or corn, there are several inherent benefits in using
straw, Wang pointed out, adding that one of them is that the straw is
essentially agricultural by-product, which means the demands of the food market
will not be threatened by the demands of biofuel, which could bring higher
profits for farmers and wholesalers.</P>
      <P>"However, " Wang continued, "the only downside at the present stage is that the
production cost is still far higher than the acceptable range." Citing U.S.
tallies, Wang said one liter of cellulose alcohol would cost NT$21.5 (about
US$0.67).</P>
      <P>Wang said once the cost is brought to below NT$10 per liter, the price will
become competitive and the straw techniques will be worth putting into mass
production.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu took a ride on the Red Line of the city's mass rapid
transit (MRT) system Sunday, the third day the system was open for free test

      <P>Accompanied by several municipal officials during her ride from station R8 in
the bustling Sando commercial district to Kaihsuan station R5, Chen lauded the
coziness and convenience of the mass rapid transit service.</P>
      <P>"Although the train carriages swing mildly, the ride is generally comfortable

preparatory work to get the system ready for formal commercial operations as
early as possible.</P>
      <P>The Red Line opened for free test rides Feb. 8 as part of the city's Lunar New

      <P>Vietnam has become an important production base for Taiwan's  textile  industry,
with many Vietnam-bound investments seeing growth in output value and profits,
an industry representative said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Many of Taiwan's textile enterprises that have invested in China have
transferred their investments or moved their investment focus from China to
Vietnam to diversify operational risk and reduce production costs due to
operational difficulties stemming from China's increasing labor costs, the
rising renminbi exchange rate, and the more and more strict environmental laws
and regulations in China.</P>
      <P>Compared with China, Vietnam is attractive for investors because of its large
population, abundant labor force, highly skilled workers, and relatively low
labor costs. Its entry into the World Trade Organization last year has made the
country a preferred investment destination for foreign investors.</P>
      <P>An executive of the Eclat Textile Co., a Taiwan-based fabric and garment
manufacturer, said the company started investing in Vietnam several years ago
because of its good location, low labor costs and high market potential.</P>
      <P>The company first set up a garment manufacturing plant in Vietnam and plans to
also establish a fabric manufacturing plant there, producing 800,000 kg per
month, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The company has production bases in Taiwan, China, Cambodia, Africa and Vietnam,
with the Vietnamese plant gradually gaining more and more important status.</P>
      <P>Another Taiwan-based company, Tainan Spinning Co. headquartered in Tainan City,
southern Taiwan, started investing in Vietnam more than a decade ago.</P>
      <P>It has recently expanded its production capacity in Vietnam, hoping to increase
capacity to 520,000 spindles this year and make it Vietnam's leading spinning
manufacturer, the industry representative said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Number of China-based Taiwanese companies heading home rising</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  10  (CNA)
02/10/08  19:32:34
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of China-based Taiwanese companies  heading home due to changing
Chinese business  and investment conditions has risen to a record high, Ministry
of Economic Affairs (MOEA) officials said Sunday.</P>
      <P>As of the end of 2007, the MOEA's Industrial Development and Investment  Center
had  received  102 applications  filed  by overseas-based Taiwanese companies to
return to Taiwan for fresh investment projects, center officials said.</P>
      <P>Of these applications, 60 were filed by China-based Taiwanese companies,
followed by 28 filed by Taiwanese companies based in Canada and the United
States, nine from Southeast Asia and five from other areas of the world, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials attributed the increasing number of China-based Taiwanese
companies relocating their investments from China back to Taiwan mainly to the
facts that China has begun to implement a new business tax law, a new labor
contract law and lower export tax rebates from Jan. 1 -- factors that will
inevitably push up business and investment costs there.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese businessman who spoke to CNA on condition of anonymity and who has
ended his operations in China only recently, said he was forced to terminate his
operations by "wavering Chinese laws, uncertainties involving investment and
lower-than-expected profit margins."</P>
      <P>"Going home is the best and warmest option," he said, adding that the Executive
Yuan's moves to improve Taiwan's investment climate is another factor that
caused him to decide to retreat from China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the officials said, China's implementation of its new labor contract
law and other harsher business laws, plus the incessantly rising Chinese
currency have pushed up business and investment costs, causing unprecedented
pressure for Taiwanese firms with operations in China.</P>
      <P>They added that the MOEA's Bureau of Foreign Trade has become aware of the
problems facing Taiwanese companies and has moved to address  the issue,
including  collecting  trade and business information from Japan and South Korea
to learn how and whether the governments  of those countries help tide Japanese
and Korean companies operating in China over their difficulties coping with the
new investment conditions.</P>
      <P>Officials from the MOEA's Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) said the bureau
requires the Executive Yuan to increase allocation of IDB funds for industrial
development this year to help accommodate recently returned Taiwanese
manufacturers.</P>
      <P>They said the allocation should be increased from the original NT$50 billion
(US$1.55 billion) to NT$70 billion to help facilitate the relocation of newly
returned Taiwanese companies.</P>
      <P>Industrial zones targeted as ideal host locations include the Litse Industrial
Zone in the eastern county of Yilan, an industrial zone in Kangshan in the
southern county of Kaohsiung, Taipei County's Wuku, Liuying in the southern
county of Tainan and an industrial zone in the eastern county of Hualien, they
added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Industrial Development and Investment Center officials  said that
not all China-based  Taiwanese investment operations are suitable or even
welcome to return to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Officials from the MOEA and the Taiwan External Trade Development Council will
travel to South Asia and Southeast Asia more often this year to better
understand the investment climates there so as to help relocate such unwelcome
Taiwanese manufacturing companies to overseas locations other than China, they
went on.</P>
      <P>Those companies deemed unwelcome involve manufacturing industries that demand
high levels of energy consumption, produce high levels of pollution and are
highly labor-intensive, the officials said.</P>

Sunday for all members and followers of I-Kuan Tao -- a Taiwan-headquartered
school of Taoists -- residing around the world to demonstrate the strength of
"religion diplomacy" to contribute to the benefit of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsieh traveled to an I-Kuan Tao temple run by the Bao Guang Jian De (BGJD)

      <P>The Dasyueshan National Forest Recreation Area in central Taiwan entered its
birdwatching season, with the fruit of the idesia polycarpa tree, a large
deciduous tree, drawing a variety of rare bird species, an official of the
Executive Yuan's Forestry Bureau said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Situated on the backside of the southwest-facing main ridge of the Syueshan
range, the area is world-renowned for birdwatching during the December-February
period when the idesia polycarpa is in fruit.</P>
      <P>The glittering red fruit attract rarely seen birds such as the vivid niltava,
the white-eared sibia, the green-backed tit, the black-browed barbet, the brown
thrush, the island thrush, Swinhoe's pheasant and the mikado pheasant.</P>
      <P>Birdwatchers might be able to see rare species like Swinhoe's pheasant or mikado
pheasant right beside them on Trail 210 in the area in the afternoon in summer
or in winter when a cold snap hits Taiwan, the official said, adding that
birdwatchers come from as far afield as the U.K., the U.S. and Sweden.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President calls for regional cooperation on visit to Dongsha Island</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian landed Sunday on the Taiwan-held Dongsha Island in the
South China Sea for a visit to military personnel stationed there, whom he
wished a happy Lunar New Year.</P>
      <P>It was Chen's third visit to the remote atoll since he assumed office in 2000.
During his visit, he again brought up his "Spratly Initiative, " which he first
made public the previous week in a call for regional cooperation aimed at
developing the South China Sea into a huge marine conservation zone.</P>
      <P>According to a news release from the Presidential Office, Chen stated in his
address that the establishment of the Dongsha Atoll Marine National Park last
year was the first step by Taiwan to carry out the eco-friendly development
proposal.</P>
      <P>All countries  surrounding  the South China Sea have been increasing their
claims over sovereignty of the islands in the area over the past several years
in an attempt to control the abundant energy sources believed to be under the
seabed in the area, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"As an oceanic people, we always assert that the ocean is not the end of our
footsteps but an endless extension of our horizons. The ocean should not be a
barrier and blockade among competitors, but a passageway for exchanges," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>In his proposed initiative, Chen went on, he made clear that "only peace,
biology and cooperation are the future of the South China Sea."</P>
      <P>With this in mind, he urged all the surrounding countries to give priority to
his proposal to develop the South China Sea into a marine conservation zone in a
joint effort to preserve valuable marine and natural resources.</P>
      <P>The Dongsha Atoll Marine National Park, formally established Jan. 17, 2007 by
the Taiwanese government on the Dongsha Island and its surrounding waters, is
part of the country's efforts to practice conservation, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The park is the seventh national park of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the Dongsha Island, a coral atoll with a land area of 2.38 sq. km. that forms
the Pratas Islands along with two coral reefs, Chen inspected a weather
monitoring station and visited a local temple before meeting with military and
coast guard personnel stationed there.</P>
      <P>Chen was accompanied by Minister of National Defense Lee Tien-yu, Chief of the
General Staff Hou Shou-yeh, Minister of the Coast Guard Administration  Wang
Ginn-wang  and  Lin  Chia-lung,  deputy secretary-general of the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>Chen originally intended to visit the Dongsha Island Feb. 2 following a visit to
Taiping Island in the Spratly archipelago, also in the South China Sea, but the
plan was canceled due to bad weather, the news release said. The Dongsha Island
is located 444 km southwest of the southern Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh
renewed his call Monday for his Kuomintang (KMT) rival, Ma Ying-jeou, not to
splurge on campaign advertisements  but rather  donate  those  campaign  funds
to disadvantaged children.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, accompanied by Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu and his top aides, repeated his
appeal after visiting temples in the southern port city of Kaohsiung earlier the
same day.</P>
      <P>Claiming that a week-long advertising campaign could cost more than NT$20
million (US$625,000) , Hsieh said that Ma should cut back on campaign spending
and donate the funds saved to local orphans or for providing free lunches to
schoolchildren of low-income families.</P>
      <P>Hsieh renewed his appeal to get Ma to agree to his recent proposal to have "more
debates and fewer advertisements" and "more facts and fewer smears" in the run-
up to the March 22 elections.</P>
      <P>In response, Ma only said on the campaign trail in the southern city of Chiayi
that he "respects Hsieh's opinion."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, both Hsieh and Ma have agreed to attend debates or platform
presentations to be organized by local media organizations and the Central
Election Commission, respectively, later this month and next month, though Hsieh
called for more debates between the two candidates.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also promised that if elected president, he will boost the economy and
help China-based Taiwanese business people resolve problems relating to capital,
technology, and labor.</P>
      <P>Hsieh added that he will prevent a China-bound investment craze from hollowing
out Taiwan's industries.</P>
      <P>He also stressed the need to check and balance the powers of the future
government and urged voters not to hand the presidency to the KMT as it now
dominates the country's legislature.</P>
      <P>The KMT secured 81 seats, nearly three-quarters of the total in the new 113-seat
legislature, in last month's legislative elections, while the DPP only took 27
seats.</P>

      <P>The Citizen Congress Watch (CCW), a private watchdog dedicated to scrutinizing
Taiwan's parliament, will pay close attention to the newly-elected legislature
in which the opposition Kuomintang-led "pan-blue" camp holds three-quarters of
the seats, the group's head said Monday.</P>
      <P>CCW Chairman Ku Chung-hua said that the watchdog group will evaluate the
performance of legislators "based on their attendance records and speeches
during the current legislative session that began Feb. 1."</P>
      <P>The watchdog will also request the right to observe committee meetings relating
to the rights of citizens, hold a forum in mid-February to draw up a white paper
on parliamentary reform and organize a parade March 15 demanding greater
legislative transparency and openness, Ku said.</P>
      <P>Former  Legislator  Joanna  Lei suggested that  the watchdog organization use
three tools to supervise the legislature: the Legislative Yuan's Gazette, the
property declarations of public servants and the Lobbying Act.</P>
      <P>Lei noted that four dimensions should be given particular attention in
supervising legislative operations: whether legislators hold positions in
private companies, whether they offend the rules regarding conflicts of
interest, whether inter-party negotiations in the legislature are transparent
and whether legislative meetings and data are open to citizens.</P>
      <P>Hsu Yung-ming, an assistant professor of political science at Soochow
University, said that as the Kuomintang now holds an absolutely dominant
position in the Legislative Yuan, it will be hard for it to avoid responsibility
if it fails to meet popular expectations.</P>

prohibited goods, stressing that a dozen sniffer dogs are on duty at airports
and harbors to safeguard Taiwan's environment.</P>
      <P>According to the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and
Quarantine (BAPHIQ), there are about a dozen of dogs, mostly beagles, on duty at
major gateways around the country, inspecting travelers' baggage around the
clock, especially those returning from Southeast Asian countries, Hong Kong and
Macau.</P>
      <P>A BAPHIQ official explained that many migrant workers from Southeast Asia return
to Taiwan after a visit to their native countries bearing hometown specialties,
such as tropical fruits, spices, even seeds and plants, which may carry
contagious viruses.</P>
      <P>"All banned goods will be discovered by the dogs and be destroyed", the official
said.</P>
      <P>In order to prevent Taiwan's environment from being compromised by foreign
species and contagious diseases such as avian influenza, the BAPHIQ official
reiterated that travelers carrying contraband goods, including fruits, meat
products, plants and endangered species, risk prosecution and may even be

"immeasurable" losses, according to the dance company's founder.</P>
      <P>"Everything was destroyed, " said Lin Hwai-min, the dance company's founder and
choreographer. "We lost our costumes, props and production archives tracking
back to 1975."</P>
      <P>Describing the fire as a "test from the God, " Lin added that the Cloud Gate
suffered "immeasurable" losses from the fire.</P>
      <P>Lin said he was grateful for firefighters' dedicated work that helped bring the
fire under control quickly. Firefighters said the fire that broke out at around
2 a.m. could have been caused by an electrical short-circuit.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the tour schedule of the Cloud Gate will not be affected even
though the 1,324-square-meter rehearsal studio was consumed in the fire. "None

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's exports will grow by at least 8 percent this year despite a slowing
global economy, a Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-peng, director-general of the MOEA's Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) ,
said he believes that the bureau's efforts to expand exports and the
inauguration of the Nankang exhibition hall in Taipei, slated for mid-March,
will help propel the country's export growth this year, which he said might even
hit 10 percent.</P>
      <P>Huang said that Taiwan reported a 10.1-percent export growth last year despite
the impact of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis and soaring prices of oil and
raw material.</P>
      <P>He added that the figure represented an all-time high and refuted forecasts that
Taiwan's export growth would slow over the year.</P>
      <P>Therefore, although the Cabinet-level Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting
and Statistics (DGBAS) is predicting that Taiwan will report an export growth
rate of 6.3 percent this year, Huang said the BOFT is still looking to realize
8-percent growth.</P>
      <P>Responding to a recent report released by the United Nations predicting that the
world's economic growth rate will fall to 3.4 percent and attributing the drop
to the U.S.'s credit crunch, Huang admitted that a slowing U.S. economy will
have a negative impact on Taiwan's economy, but added that the impact will not
be devastating.</P>
      <P>The United States is Taiwan's second largest export market, according to Huang.</P>
      <P>Huang is also confident that Taiwan's total trade this year will reach US$500
billion and that the trade surplus will increase to US$30.5 billion.</P>
      <P>To reach those export goals, the bureau will continue to focus on Taiwan's top
10 export markets, Huang said.</P>
      <P>He explained that the bureau's efforts last year helped to increase exports to
the country's top 10 export markets by an average of 25.6 percent, which was
twice the overall rate for the year.</P>
      <P>In addition, the bureau will collaborate with local industry associations to
increase exports to emerging markets in Asia and Africa and to oil producing
countries in the Middle East, Huang went on.</P>
      <P>The bureau will strive to help the country maintain a certain degree of trade
surplus with China, Taiwan's largest export market, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau's statistics, Taiwan last year posted double-digit
growth in exports to China,  Singapore,  Vietnam, Thailand, Australia,
Indonesia, India, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait.</P>

      <P>Mini notebook computers have become the hottest computer,  communications and
consumer electronics (3C) products, with major electronics producers planning to
present consumers with at least 10 new mini notebook models in 2008.</P>
      <P>ASUSTeck Computer Inc., Taiwan's largest PC manufacturer and the world's largest
maker of computer motherboards, scored a huge early victory in that worldwide
marketing battle with its new Eee PCs -- a mini notebook series with a seven-
inch display priced between US$200 and US$400.</P>
      <P>The company sold 350,000 units in less than three months between mid-October and
the end of 2007 and expects to sell another 5 million units in 2008.</P>
      <P>The success of ASUS's "two-pound wonder" -- so named as it weighs less than one
kilogram -- has caught the attention of major PC makers, including Acer Inc.,
Hewlett-Packard Co. and Micro-Star International Co., all of which have sped up
production of their own mini laptops to grab a slice of the notebook market pie,
estimated at more than 1 billion users.</P>
      <P>Acer, Taiwan's third-largest computer company by sales and the world's fourth-
largest personal computer maker, has indicated that it plans to launch an
8.9-inch, low-priced notebook in the second quarter.</P>
      <P>Dennis Chen, the Taiwan vice president of HP, said his company will release a
mini laptop with a 8.5-inch display priced at about NT$15,000 (US$468). The unit
will be loaded with Microsoft software.</P>
      <P>Hsu Hsiang, chairman of Micro-Star, said that his company will bring out "a
better model" than the Eee PC in March.</P>
      <P>BenQ, Taiwan's top maker of computer gear and mobile phones, is also considering
whether to launch its own version of the mini laptop.</P>
      <P>The success of the ASUS Eee PC shows that Taiwan's electronics producers have
the ability to launch their own products under new brand-names instead of merely
supplying parts and components to foreign computer companies.</P>
      <P>The shock-proof Eee PC units, pre-installed with Microsoft Windows, have over 40
built-in applications to enable users to learn, work and play.</P>
      <P>According to market analysts, the Eee PC has captured the attention of consumers
-- selling one unit every five seconds during its initial launch worldwide --
mainly because it is an excellent secondary computer for households with
children. It is also a good primary computer for novice PC users who have never
had the time or patience to master an operating system.</P>
      <P>The interface is easy to use, with novice users able to check online
transactions, order groceries, and keep in touch with friends and family members
without difficulty.</P>
      <P>The Eee PC has also gained a foothold in the U.S. education market because the
lightweight laptop enables teachers to access, display and transfer video and
music with ease, and to assign work to students, which can answered using the
Eee PC.</P>
      <P>ASUS shipped  its first major batch of 1,300 Eee PCs to California's fourth
largest school district -- the Fresno Unified School District -- for use as
training aids by both students and teachers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT)  vice presidential candidate Vincent Siew claimed
Monday that his frequent visits to temples around the country during the Lunar
New Year holidays are not aimed at wooing voters but at demonstrating respect
for religion.</P>
      <P>Siew was responding to criticism that politicians from both the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-led "pan-green" camp and the KMT-led "pan-
blue" alliance ) attend religious events during the Lunar New Year festival
mainly for political purposes.</P>
      <P>"The criticism is not fair," Siew said, adding he believes that temple visits by
politicians from both camps are aimed at expressing respect for religion and
praying for public and personal well-being.</P>
      <P>"It is good for people to go to temples or attend religious activities as this
signifies that Taiwan is a diverse society that respects religious freedom, "
said Siew, suggesting that people visit temples to worship Buddha or attend
activities organized by Christian and Catholic churches during the Chinese New
Year holiday.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks after attending the traditional ritual of "welcoming the
God of Wealth" at the Wusheng Monastery of the Ling Jiou Mountain Buddhist
Society located in Taipei County's Gungliau Township, some 60 kilometer from
Taipei.</P>
      <P>He also joined Dharma Master Hsin Tao, head of the Wusheng Monastery, to light
lanterns and pray for blessings.</P>
      <P>Siew said although they have known each other for a long time, Master Hsin Tao
did not pray for his election but for a brighter future for the country. He said
he expects himself to live up to Master Hsin Tao's virtues of respect, tolerance
and philanthropy, and to bring hope to the country.</P>

      <P>Taiwan outperformed South Korea in the display panel industry for the first time
in 2007, shipping a greater number of display panels and realizing greater
profits and turnover, according to annual financial reports released recently by
major manufacturers in the two countries.</P>
      <P>Four largest Taiwanese TFT-LCD display panel manufacturers -- Chimei Corp., AU
Optronics Corp., Chunghwa Picture Tubes, LTD. and HannStar Display Corp. --
registered a total of NT$1.011 trillion (US$31.4 billion) in turnover last year,
compared to NT$1.001 trillion recorded by two Korean leading display panel
brands, Samsung Electronics Co. and LG. Philips LCD.</P>
      <P>In 2006, the four Taiwanese manufacturers saw a collective turnover of NT$650
billion, while Samsung and LG. Philips LCD together earned NT$770 billion.</P>
      <P>The TFT-LCDs (thin film transistor liquid crystal displays), are a variant of
liquid crystal displays producing a fine quality image but consuming little
electricity.</P>
      <P>As to profits, the four Taiwanese manufacturers earned total profits of NT$132.4
billion, exceeding their Korean counterparts by NT$13.2 billion.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the four Taiwanese companies realized an operating profit rate of 13
percent in 2007, outpacing the 11.9 percent of the two Korean manufacturers.</P>
      <P>A company's operating profit is the profit remaining after direct and indirect
costs are deducted.</P>
      <P>According to statistics published by DisplaySearch, a market survey company,
175.5 million large display panels were shipped by the four Taiwanese
manufacturers last year, while Samsung and LG. Philips LCD shipped 158.6 million
units.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was the leading player in the display panel market in 2007, capturing
44.2 percent of the TFT-LCD display global market, compared with the 40 percent
held by the Korean manufacturers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Sixty-seven Taiwanese-American groups have called on the U.S. government and
ordinary American citizens to support Taiwan's upcoming referendum aimed at
promoting the country's bid to enter the United Nations under the name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The referendum is slated to be held alongside the country's March 22
presidential election.</P>
      <P>The groups  made the joint appeal Sunday  in a half-page advertisement published
in the Washington Post's "Outlook" section, described by U.S.-based lobbying
group Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA) as "the must-read section
for political pundits and for readers interested in foreign policy."</P>
      <P>The ad came after several U.S. high-ranking officials voiced opposition to
Taiwan's planned U.N. referendum, which has triggered widespread dissatisfaction
among the Taiwanese American associations, the FAPA said in an earlier
statement.</P>
      <P>The associations decided to appeal to the U.S. public and seek popular support
for the referendum, the FAPA statement noted.</P>
      <P>The ad stated that due to China's long-term oppression and intimidation, "Taiwan
has become an international orphan."</P>
      <P>The ad called on U.S.  President George W. Bush and his administration to
support Taiwan's acceptance as a full and equal member of the international
community and to back Taiwan's democratic referendum.</P>
      <P>"As leaders of the Taiwanese-American organizations, we ask the United States
administration and Congress to stand up for the principles of human rights and
self-determination," the ad reads.</P>
      <P>The ad quotes remarks from Bush's second inaugural address in 2004, that "it is
the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic
movements and institutions in every nation and culture."</P>
      <P>The ad also quoted Bush in his last State of the Union Address, delivered Jan.
28, that "our foreign policy is based on a clear premise: We trust that people,
when given the chance, will choose a future of freedom and peace."</P>
      <P>Noting that "there can be no double standard when it comes to supporting
democracy, " the ad wrote that Bush should "trust the people of Taiwan to choose
a future of freedom and peace " by supporting Taiwan's planned U.N.-membership
poll.</P>
      <P>FAPA President Bob Yang said in the statement that "we believe that U.S.'s
repeated high-volume opposition to the referendum casts doubt upon the U.S.
willingness to stand up for democracy, and undermines the U.S. position as a
champion of democracy in East Asia."</P>
      <P>He said, "We ask that the U.S. support Taiwan's upcoming referendum. And if, for
whatever reason, they are unable to support it, we ask that they at least keep
quiet and let Taiwan's democratic process run its course."</P>

      <P>Alliance members stressed that private individuals are welcome to take part in
the "Life Watch" project and to serve as long-term observers to prevent the
judicial system from taking the lives of innocent people.</P>
      <P>Citing U.S. research, alliance members said that the courts might have arrived
at an incorrect verdict in some 7 percent of cases involving the death penalty.
A similar group, dubbed the "Innocence Project", is active in the U.S., they
noted.</P>
      <P>According to a 1994 publication of the Cabinet-level Research, Development and
Evaluation Commission (RDEC), 482 Taiwanese prisoners were executed during the

provided by the "Innocence Project", some 34 persons might have been wrongly put
to death.</P>
      <P>The RDEC publication shows that most of the 482 executed persons were drawn from
the lower-ranks of society, being unemployed or low-income workers, poorly

      <P>Taiwan will hopefully open to Chinese tourists in the near future no matter who
wins the March 22 presidential election, local tourism sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>Many in the domestic industry believe that Taiwan and China will immediately
step up the pace of bilateral tourism talks after a new president takes office
May 20, no matter whether ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential
candidate Frank Hsieh or main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) candidate Ma Ying-jeou
is victorious in the coming race, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Although cross-Taiwan Strait private exchanges have been authorized for the past
20 years, the sources said Taiwan and China have both failed to make a full
opening to Chinese tourists to sightsee in Taiwan possible as a result of
political concerns.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that Taiwan has made some efforts over the past three years to
clear the way for a full opening, political barriers remain, they said.</P>
      <P>Currently, only Chinese people holding foreign passports or those proceeding
from a third country or area are allowed to enter Taiwan on pleasure trips.</P>
      <P>However, in a stark contrast to the very small number of Chinese people that
have visited Taiwan, local people are presently making more than 3 million
visits per year to China after the Taiwan authorities lifted a ban on cross-
strait grassroots exchanges in 1987.</P>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait did not begin two-way negotiations on a full
opening to Chinese tourists until 2007.</P>
      <P>Local tourism sources ascribed the slow pace of negotiations to unbending
political wrangling between the two sides, saying that political elements have
successfully blocked progress in the area. They went on to express hope that a
new era of cross-strait relations will be inaugurated with a new president in
May.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Mixed views of 40 percent ceiling on China-bound investments</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  11 (CNA)
02/11/08  20:29:07
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While local trade and industry groups continue to urge the government to ease
restrictions on the 40 percent cap on China-bound investment, academics are
expressing a different view.</P>
      <P>According to a survey by the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD), only 37 Taiwan companies, or 6.1 percent of the local
companies listed in the Taiwan Stock Exchange that responded to the survey,
admitted that their China investments have reached or even exceeded the 40
percent limit of the value of their net assets in their China-bound investments.</P>
      <P>While another 24 companies said that their China-bound investments already hit
more than 90 percent of their investment ceilings set by the government, 35
Taiwan businesses said that their investments in China are in the range between
80 percent and 90 percent in proportion to their full investment levels allowed
by the the government.</P>
      <P>That means that some 85 percent of Taiwan-based companies investing in China
have not yet reached 80 percent of the maximum amount allowed by the government,
according to the CEPD report.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Thinktank Chairman Chen Po-chih, who proposed the "no haste, be patient"
China investment policy to the previous Kuomintang government to restrain Taiwan
enterprises from making excessive investments in China, said it is clear that
the vast majority of Taiwan businesses would not invest more than 40 percent of
their net asset value in investment projects in China.</P>
      <P>"It is obvious that the 40 percent cap on China-bound investments does not pose
a barrier to Taiwan companies' investments in China, " Chen stated.</P>
      <P>"If people continue rehashing the issue and demanding that the government lift
the 40 percent restriction, it could be termed as a politically charged move, "
Chen said while blaming government officials for failing to provide the public
with a clear explanation of the situation.</P>
      <P>Arguing that the government cannot use its one-sided judgment to craft its China
investment policy, he said, it imposed the 40 precent cap in Taiwan businesses'
investment in China to prevent them from "putting all their eggs in a single
basket."</P>
      <P>Chen, however, admitted that the cap might be adjusted on a case-by-case basis
as China has becomes a manufacturing base for most Taiwan corporations.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the 40 percent investment ceiling can be eased for branded
Taiwanese enterprises which enjoy a noticeable market share in China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Institute of Economic Research Vice President  Kung Ming-shin echoed
Chen's view, saying that statistics compiled by the Taiwan Stock Exchange
reflected a similar finding as the CEPD report.</P>
      <P>"The rhetoric pinning the future of all Taiwanese companies to their investments
in China has been exaggerated," Kung contended.</P>
      <P>"Even if the government were to soften or lift the existing 40 percent
investment limit, it would not necessarily be helpful to Taiwanese enterprises
hoping to invest in China in light of the prevailing globalization trends among
ambitious corporations, " he said.</P>
      <P>Ho Yu, a standing board member of the Chinese National Federation of Industries
(CNFI) , said he was surprised by the findings of the two reports, which he
described as "a far cry from the genuine situation."</P>
      <P>"It is the government's 40 percent investment ceiling which has driven many
Taiwan companies to pursue their investment projects in China through third
countries or areas, misleading the public to believe that the restriction raises
no problems for most Taiwan enterprises," he said.</P>
      <P>"Actually,  the government has imposed many restraints  on China-bound
investments by local companies and Taiwan's economic policy must be further
liberalized," he said.</P>
      <P>The CNFI is one of the leading industrial associations in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>A total of 659 Chinese tourists arrived at the northern Taiwan port of Keelung
via a luxury ocean liner Monday, receiving a warm welcome from local harbor and
administrative officials.</P>
      <P>The Chinese visitors, who came along with 1,541 other foreign tourists aboard
the British-registered ocean liner "Rhapsody of the Seas, " formed the largest
Chinese tour group ever to visit Taiwan. The cruise ship set out from Hong Kong
for a pleasure voyage that will also make a port call at Kaohsiung in southern
Taiwan Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Keelung Mayor Chang Tung-jung, Keelung Harbor Bureau Director Hsiao Ting-hsun
and other local officials greeted the Chinese and other foreign visitors upon
their arrival at around 11 a.m.</P>
      <P>The harbor bureau rolled out red carpet to welcome the Chinese and foreign
tourists who walked from the port onto a fleet of buses for sightseeing in
nearby Taipei City. Major destinations included Taipei 101, the National Taiwan
Democracy Memorial Hall which was formerly known as the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial
Hall and Lungshan Temple. Some Chinese tourists didn't join the Taipei journey
and instead toured noted scenic spots in Keelung and Jioufen.</P>
      <P>Chang said it's a new arrangement for Chinese people to come by ocean liner.
According to Chang, the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council changed the rule
before the Lunar New Year holiday to allow for entry of Chinese holidaymakers
via ship from ports outside China.</P>
      <P>Granted double-entry visas for the first time, the tourists departed Keelung
Monday evening and are scheduled to reach the southern port of Kaohsiung Tuesday
for a half-day tour before heading back to Hong Kong the same day.</P>
      <P>The large tourist group is expected to bring an extra bonanza for local travel
industry.</P>
      <P>A Keelung harbor official said the five-star Rhapsody of the Seas is scheduled
to make four more port calls in Taiwan in the coming weeks, scheduled for Feb.
24, March 5, March 15, and March 25, respectively.</P>
      <P>"The cruise liner will take some 10,000 Chinese and foreign tourists to Taiwan,

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian claimed credit for the entry of a large Chinese tour
group into Taiwan Monday, saying he personally endorsed taking an exception to
the existing rules to make possible the arrival of the Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after 659 Chinese tourists arrived at Keelung Harbor
aboard a luxury cruise liner around Monday noon for a half-day sightseeing tour
in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time that Chinese tourists have come via a cruise ship. It
was also the largest Chinese tour group ever to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan blocks most Chinese travelers for security reasons or fear of visitors
overstaying their visa. It sets a daily limit on the number of Chinese tourists
at 1,000. Given the group's large number, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC),
wthe thich charts Taiwan's China policy, faced a dilemma on whether to approve
its entry application late last year. The MAC presented the case to the
president.</P>
      <P>Chen said while visiting Tienhsien Temple in Keelung Monday afternoon that he
approved the case on a trial basis.</P>
      <P>"On my way to the temple, I saw the large ocean liner that took the Chinese
tourists to Keelung earlier in the day. I thought I had made a rightful decision
to approve their entry for sightseeing purposes. We took an exception to our
existing rules in an effort to promote goodwill exchanges across the Taiwan
Strait," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The presdient said he has also approved another case in which a cruise liner
will take Chinese holidaymakers to Taiwan via Hong Kong in the near future.</P>
      <P>If all these trial cases proceed smoothly, Chen said, more similar cases will
follow. Noting that he has confidence in Taiwan's prosperity and stability, Chen
said his administration will keep the door open for Chinese citizens intending
to sightsee in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>More Chinese tourists to arrive by cruise liners: President</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian claimed credit for the entry of a large Chinese tour
group into Taiwan Monday, saying he personally  endorsed making an exception to
existing rules to facilitate the group's visit.</P>
      <P>The 659 Chinese tourists, the largest Chinese group ever to visit Taiwan,
arrived at Keelung Harbor around Monday at noon along with 1,541 other foreign
tourists aboard the British-registered ocean liner "Rhapsody of the Seas" for a
half-day of sightseeing in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The group, which departed from Hong Kong Sunday and was scheduled to make a stop
in Kaohsiung Tuesday before returning home, was also the first composed of
Chinese nationals to come to Taiwan via a cruise ship.</P>
      <P>Taiwan blocks most Chinese travelers for security reasons or fear of visitors
overstaying their visa and sets a daily limit on the number of Chinese tourists
at 1,000.</P>
      <P>Given the group's large number, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), which
coordinates Taiwan's China policy, faced a dilemma over whether to approve its
application for entry late last year and presented the case to the president.</P>
      <P>Chen said while visiting Tienhsien Temple in Keelung Monday afternoon that he
approved the case on a trial basis.</P>
      <P>"On my way to the temple, I saw the large ocean liner that took the Chinese
tourists to Keelung earlier in the day. I thought I made the right decision to
approve their entry for sightseeing purposes. We made an exception to our
existing rules in an effort to promote goodwill exchanges across the Taiwan
Strait," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president said he has also approved another visit by a cruise liner that
will take Chinese vacationers to Taiwan via Hong Kong in the near future.</P>
      <P>If these trials proceed smoothly, the president said, more similar visits will
follow.  Expressing confidence in Taiwan's prosperity and stability, Chen said
his administration will keep the door open for Chinese citizens intending to
sightsee in Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Visitor arrivals to the southern Taiwan mountain resort of Alishan saw a sharp
decrease during this year's Chinese New Year holiday, probably because of the
chilly weather, officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Only 30,156 people visited Alishan during the six-day holiday that ran from Feb.
6 to Feb. 11, a sharp decline from the 53,000 in 2007 and 51,000 in 2006 who
spent some of their New Year's break at the mountain resort, according to
officials at the Forestry Bureau's Chiayi Forest District Office.</P>
      <P>The arrivals included 950 recorded on Chinese New Year's Eve, 4,485 on the first
day of Chinese New Year, 6,808 on the second day, 8,267 on the third day, 7,037
on the fourth day, and 2,609 on the fifth day, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The scenic mountain, located in the southern county of Chiayi, is one of the
most popular tourist attractions in Taiwan, famous for its breathtaking sunrise,
serene mountain landscape and ancient trees.</P>
      <P>The park draws approximately 700,000 visitors per year, or an average of more
than 1,900 visitors per day, according to figures compiled by the Alishan
National Scenic Area Administration.</P>
      <P>During peak periods such as the Chinese New Year holiday, the cherry blossom
season between March and April and summer vacation, the number of visitors can
exceed 10,000 per day, the figures show.</P>

      <P>Tom Lantos (D-Calif.), a senior member of the U.S. House of Representatives who
was one of the staunchest supporters of Taiwan, died Monday of esophageal
cancer. He was 80.</P>
      <P>Members of Taiwan's diplomatic corps in the United States, the Formosan
Association of Public Affairs, and Taiwanese friends of Lantos around the U.S.
all sent letters of condolence to Lantos' family over his death.</P>
      <P>Lantos died early Monday at the Bethesda Naval Medical Center in suburban
Maryland. He was surrounded by his wife, Annette, two daughters,  and  many  of
his  18  grandchildren  and  two great-grandchildren.</P>
      <P>Lantos, who had been a congressman since 1980, said last month after being
diagnosed with esophageal cancer that he would serve out his 14th term but would
not seek re-election.</P>
      <P>A teenager twice escaped from a Nazi-run forced labor camp in Hungary and a
friend to all those around the world who fought for democracy and human rights,
Lantos spared no effort in supporting Taiwan and Tibet.</P>
      <P>He was largely instrumental in facilitating the 1995 visit by then President Lee
Teng-hui to the United States and made a speech at Lee's Alma Mater, Cornell
University.</P>
      <P>When Lee visited Washington, D.C. in 2005 after he retired, he met with Lantos
personally for a private conversation.</P>
      <P>Lantos pushed numerous bills in the House of Representatives that supported
Taiwan's participation in the international community, including U.S.
congressional support for Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations and the World
Health Organization.</P>
      <P>In 2005, he spoke publicly in Congress to oppose the European Union's plans to
lift its arms embargo against China.</P>
      <P>In his capacity as chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Lantos saw
to it that a non-binding resolution, HCR136, was adopted June 25, 2007 urging
the Bush administration to lift restrictions on visits to the United States by
high-level elected and appointed officials of Taiwan, including the president.</P>
      <P>Before Christmas, Lantos and Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Letinen (R-Fla.) jointly
submitted a resolution, HCR278, calling for stronger support for Taiwan's
democratization and its security.</P>
      <P>The resolution also urged the international community to send observers to
Taiwan in March to witness the presidential election slated for March 22.</P>

    <HEADLINE>More opportunities than job seekers in 2007: DGBAS</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Public employment service centers posted more job openings than there were job
seekers in 2007, with each person looking for a job having an average of 1.3
opportunities, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The centers posted 1.17 million job openings in 2007 for the 905,000 people who
sought work during the year, but the average of 1.3 job opportunities per job
seeker was down from the 1.4 averaged in 2006, the DGBAS said.</P>
      <P>In a year when the average unemployment rate in 2007 stayed steady at 3.91
percent, the number of jobs posted increased by 11.6 percent from the previous
year while the number of job-seekers rose by 18.9 percent.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS said 202,000 individuals in the 25-29 age bracket sought jobs in 2007,
the most of any age group. Some 172,000 of those looking for jobs were over the
age of 45, indicating that a sizable number of people were also looking to
change their careers.</P>
      <P>In terms of education background, the number of university graduates or those
with more advanced degrees seeking jobs totaled 200,000, a 34 percent year-on-
year rise, reflecting a growing unemployment or underemployment problem among
the best educated in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS said, however, that those with better educations tend to demand higher
compensation and change jobs more frequently. Their joblessness tends to be
voluntary and short-term, unlike for other groups in which unemployment is more
prevalent.</P>

      <P>Junior high school students in the southern city of Tainan have shown a heavy
reliance on the Internet to find dates and gain knowledge about sex, according
to the results of a survey released Tuesday by the Tainan City Family Education
Center.</P>
      <P>The survey revealed that 58 percent of respondents sought to meet someone of the
opposite sex online and 71 percent were in favor of using the Internet to meet
friends, either of the opposite sex or the same sex.</P>
      <P>Among the most common methods adopted by the respondents to meet friends online,
73 percent did so through instant messengers, 55 percent through online games
and 23 percent through blogs.</P>
      <P>While 35 percent of respondents said they would have the first real meeting with
the friends they met online within one month, 39 percent would do so between one
and three months.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 48 percent of respondents  obtained knowledge about sex
through the Internet and that 63 percent had visited a pornographic Web site or
looked at pornographic magazines, films, comics or photos.</P>
      <P>Some 48 percent obtained information about pornographic Web sites through search
engines while 22 percent did so through e-mails forward to them by others.</P>
      <P>Despite the high acceptance of modern cyber technology among the respondents,
the survey showed that their attitude toward sex was rather traditional.</P>
      <P>Approximately 80 percent of respondents said they cannot accept one-night
stands, for example, and 56 percent said they were against pre-marital sex.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, nearly 90 percent of respondents objected to having sex without using
a condom, 62 percent were against the idea of having kids while still in school,
and 40 percent did not think having a shotgun marriage would be responsible
behavior.</P>
      <P>While 90 percent of respondents considered it important for them to receive
education  on ways to prevent  sexual harrassment, approximately 90 percent did
not agree with the notion that boys have no need to receive education on sexual
assault prevention.</P>
      <P>Thirty-nine percent of respondents had never discussed gender issues with their
parents, and if they have any problems concerning relationships, 68 percent said
they would seek help over the Internet.</P>

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh
said Tuesday that there should be more than two televised presidential debates
between him and his Kuomintang rival, Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>"Such major issues as national identity, sovereignty and economic policies
should be debated. But one's personality as well as integrity should also be
open to challenges, " he said, saying that was why he felt the number of
televised debates should be increased.</P>
      <P>He noted that a prospective leader of the nation should be one with integrity,
or else, his words cannot be trusted.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's camp has recently challenged Ma's loyalty and integrity over his
possession of permanent residency status, or a "green card," from the United
States.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the green card, which he obtained while studying in the United
States in the late 1970s, had lost its validity in the mid-'80s after he
returned to Taiwan to live and obtained a non-immigration tourist visa for
travel to the U.S.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the ability of a future leader to carry through his policies is also
essential.</P>
      <P>"One's performance in the past could also be debated," the former premier and
Kaohsiung mayor suggested.</P>
      <P>Two debates between the two candidates are slated to take place Feb. 24 and
March 9, according to organizers.</P>
      <P>During the first debate, the candidates will answer questions from local

      <P>With millions of Taiwanese heading back to school or work Tuesday after the
extended Chinese New Year break, a local psychiatrist offered tips on how to
overcome "post-holiday syndrome."</P>
      <P>Yang Tsung-tsai, director of Cardinal Tien Hospital's Department of Psychiatry,
said that many workers and students may experience a lack of energy and
motivation as well as difficulty concentrating when they head back to the
classroom or office following the holidays.</P>
      <P>"Many may be wishing that the holidays could be even longer, but everyone has to
face up to reality and get back to their regular routine," Yang said.</P>
      <P>"During the holidays, a lot of people overindulge in eating, drinking, and
merrymaking, and adjusting to their regular work schedule after the holidays can
be difficult," he said.</P>
      <P>To overcome post-holiday syndrome, Yang suggested that people eat a healthy and
balanced diet that includes less spicy and oily foods and more foods that are

    <HEADLINE>MOFA to launch 'guide dog diplomacy' activities</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Taiwan Guide Dog Association will
jointly launch a series of "guide dog diplomacy" activities at the end of this
month that will include obtaining guide dogs and technical support from other
countries, a MOFA official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The ministry's  NGO Affairs Committee Vice Chairman Chiang Kuo-chiang  said
that  besides  establishing  links  with the international community, the
activities would also raise awareness in Taiwan about the needs of its visually-
impaired citizens and the serious shortage of guide dogs in the country.</P>
      <P>There are currently about 50,000 blind people in Taiwan but only 20 trained
guide dogs, he said.</P>
      <P>As part of the "animal diplomacy" activities, the committee will work with the
Taiwan Guide Dog Association and the Animal Protection Association of the
Republic of China in seeking assistance from several countries, including Japan,
South Korea, the United States, England, Denmark and Norway, to provide guide
dogs to Taiwan and introduce advanced guide dog training techniques.</P>
      <P>"It is hoped that this will help in efforts to increase the number and quality
of guide dogs in Taiwan for the benefit of the country's visually-impaired
citizens," he said.</P>
      <P>Chiang indicated that the activities were being patterned after the successful
"animal diplomacy" activities held last year based on the theme of bird ecology.</P>
      <P>He said the NGO Affairs Committee will hold a news conference to explain the
"guide dog diplomacy" plan in more detail near the end of the month and will
invite Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang as well as foreign diplomats
stationed in Taiwan to participate in order to raise awareness of the guide dog
shortage in the country.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite having only three months left in office, President Chen Shui-bian on
Tuesday called for bipartisan support to downsize the government into a leaner,
more efficient administration.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a ceremony held at the Presidential Office to mark the beginning
of the lunar Year of the Rat, Chen expressed hope that legislators from the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) can reach agreement on restructuring  the government before the March 22
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chen said he hopes the two parties will consult with each other and agree to
pass an amendment to the Executive Yuan Organization Act to overhaul the
executive branch of government.</P>
      <P>Noting that running "lean and mean" governments is now a world trend, Chen said
he hopes the amendment could be passed into law soon,  paving  the way for an
administration  downsizing  and restructuring.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan-initiated proposal calls for legislation to legally cut the
number of Cabinet-level agencies from the current 39 to around 22.</P>
      <P>Chen further said passage of such an amendment would be the first of his "three
wishes" as the head of the state for the Year of the Rat.</P>
      <P>His second wish, Chen said, is to see the upcoming presidential race be held
smoothly and successfully, irrespective of whether the candidate from the DPP or
the KMT wins.</P>
      <P>Chen said his third wish is to see Taiwan be admitted into the United Nations as
a full member -- either joining the world body under the name Taiwan or "re-
entering" it under the name of the Republic of China on Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislative bigwig of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) categorically
denied Tuesday that there was a "third referendum proposal" regarding Taiwan's
bid to enter the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Lin Yi-shih, a KMT legislator who doubles as director of the KMT's Central
Policy Committee, said neither the KMT nor the legislature has plans on a "third
UN-bid referendum."</P>
      <P>The Central Election Commission decided late last year to hold two referendums,
seeking public opinion on Taiwan's quest to enter the United Nations, alongside
the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>One of the referendums, proposed by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party,
tests public approval for Taiwan to attempt to enter the U.N. under the name
Taiwan. The other referendum, proposed by the opposition KMT, calls for Taiwan's
entry into the U.N. under the name of the Republic of China, or whatever
feasible name.</P>
      <P>The ROC was expelled  from the U.N.  in 1971 after  the international
organization awarded the China seat to the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Lin also said that it was clear the two referendums will be held, despite
disapproval from Washington and pressure from Beijing to scrap the plans.</P>
      <P>The holding of two referendums on Taiwan's U.N. bid alongside the March 22
presidential election is now a "closed and non-negotiable matter," Lin said.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan -- in which the KMT now holds an absolute majority
following its landslide victory in the Jan. 12 legislative elections -- is
unable to say no to the referendums except for blessing them, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin would not comment on news reports Tuesday that the Executive Yuan
plans to put an amendment to the Executive Yuan Organization Act as one of the
priority bills to be debated and screened by the new legislature, which was
sworn in on Feb. 1, but has yet to begin its first plenary session.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan-proposed amendment calls for cutting the number of Cabinet-
level agencies from the current 39 to around 26, including only 14 ministries,
seven councils and five independent agencies.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Lottery Co. (TLC) has donated NT$1.8 billion (US$56 million) from its
public lottery ticket sales in December to various public welfare projects, a
TLC spokesman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The contribution for the month of December has raised the company's total
contribution in 2007 to NT$15.5 billion,  the spokesman noted.</P>
      <P>Of the December donation, NT$908 million, or 50 percent, goes to local
governments to fund their social welfare and charity events, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Taipei County in northern Taiwan received the largest share of NT$140 million,
followed by the capital Taipei's NT$123 million.</P>
      <P>Another NT$817 million, or 45 percent of the December total, is used to sponsor
the national pension scheme, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>The remaining NT$90.8 million, or 5 percent, is allocated as reserve funds for
the national health insurance program,  the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>In related news, no winner of the TLC's Super Lotto jackpot prize -- NT$470
million -- was produced Monday for the sixth time in a row. If no one wins the
top prize, the jackpot will continue to grow until someone wins it.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's water supply is expected to remain normal through the end of April,
Taiwan Water Corp. (TWC) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The country's main water supplier said that last year's typhoon season brought
rainfall that filled Taiwan's major reservoirs to well over 70 percent of their
capacity.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) has forecast that rainfall during
the first quarter of the year will be normal or slightly on the low side for
most of the country's reservoirs, with only Penghu likely to experience a
meaningful shortage of rain during the period.</P>
      <P>As a result, Taiwan's water supply should remain stable through the end of
April, the water company said.</P>
      <P>The water supply situation in Penghu should return to normal by mid-June with
the implementation of first-phase water conservation measures, the company
added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Water Corp. has been actively pushing for the construction of two
seawater desalination plants in Penghu, and the company believed the water
supply situation in the county would be more stable when the facilities were

      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang said Tuesday that the Ministry will soon
make major changes to the deployment of mission chiefs stationed abroad to
improve Taiwan's position given "harsh" diplomatic conditions.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the MOFA's Lunar New Year reception, Huang said the adjustments,
which will include chiefs of embassies, and representative offices in Europe and
the United States, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Kansas City, will
target those whose terms are expiring, the aged, and those who have health
problems.</P>
      <P>The deployment adjustments will be finalized at the end of February, with the
appointment of the deputy representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Representative Office in the U.S. to be announced soon.</P>
      <P>Huang said he wrote a letter on the Lunar New Year's Eve expressing his sincere
appreciation to the front-line diplomats for their hard work. He noted that
besides facing constant pressure due to the Chinese diplomatic offense,
diplomats must also deal with harsh challenges such as difficult living
environments, education problems facing those with children, and health
concerns.</P>
      <P>"People see diplomats as well-paid, with a high public profile. But beneath the
rosy picture it is, in fact, a job full of difficulties and hardships unknown to
the public," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Without going into detail, the minister revealed that "a chief of mission in a
South American country" and his wife faced armed robbers just before the Chinese
New Year. Fortunately, they were not harmed, but psychologically both the head
and his wife have suffered tremendous trauma, he added.</P>
      <P>Also, as tuition fees in some foreign countries have almost doubled over the
past decade and continue to rise, some diplomats have had to sell their homes in
Taiwan in order to support their children's studies.</P>
      <P>Huang has promised to increase the education allowance extended to diplomats
with children this year so that they will not have to worry about the future of
their children while fighting Taiwan's diplomatic battles.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu called on citizens Tuesday to actively participate  in
the two upcoming referendums on the country's U.N. bid to make sure that they
are passed.</P>
      <P>Claiming the move would be important to ensuring that Taiwan's voices are heard
around the world, Lu expressed concern that Taiwan would have no chance to join
the United Nations if the referendums were to fail.</P>
      <P>"If less than half of voters take part in the referendums and less than half of
participating voters vote in favor of the referendums, how will the
international community interpret the outcome?" Lu asked.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks during a ceremony held at the Presidential Office to mark
the beginning of the Year of the Rat. She was referring to the referendums to be
held alongside the March 22 presidential election:  one initiated by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party on joining the United Nations under the name Taiwan
and another sponsored by the opposition Kuomintang on regaining U.N. membership
under the name "Republic of China" or any other "suitable" name.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, these two referendums are more important and would have a more
profound impact than the two referendums held alongside the Jan. 12 legislative
elections, which failed to pass because the turnout rates did not reach the
required 50 percent.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that most of Taiwan's diplomatic allies, including Nauru, the Marshall
Islands and the Solomon Islands, achieved independence after World War II and
have gained membership in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Lu said Taiwan lacks dignity and U.N. membership and that the country must not
continue to be denied dignity.</P>

      <P>Boutique hotels and florists in the Taipei area are gearing up for Feb. 14
Valentine's Day, indicating that the Taiwanese fever for this Western tradition
is not affected by the slowing economy and cold weather.</P>
      <P>"Business on Valentine's Day is expected to rise by 25 percent over other days,"
said Zhuang Bo-hong, deputy manager of the business administration department of
Wego Taipei, the first boutique hotel in Taiwan, opened in 2000 with 86
luxuriously decorated rooms in various themes such as "Bali" or "European"
style.</P>
      <P>According to Zhuang, an estimated 450 couples will visit the Wego Taipei for a
euphemistically named "two-hour rest" on Valentine's Day, at NT$1,500 (US$48)
per session.</P>
      <P>"Going to a hotel to celebrate special days like Valentine's Day has become very
popular in recent years," Zhuang said, adding that he "expects to see a long
line in front of our hotel waiting for rooms."</P>
      <P>Noting that the Wego Taipei has not raised its tariffs, although the cost of
living in Taiwan has continued to increase, Zhuang added that the hotel even
gives away special gifts -- underwear for both males and females -- for the
amorous couples.</P>
      <P>Lee Shu-feng, executive assistant to the chairman of another boutique hotel, the
Isis Taipei, also said he expects scores of couples coming for a two-hour stay.</P>
      <P>Neither the Wego Taipei nor the Isis Taipei accept reservations, forcing
customers to stand in line to be allocated a room on a first come, first served
basis.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Isis Taipei will not increase charges for Valentine's Day, Lee
said the hotel gives away condoms, mugs and scented gifts to customers.</P>
      <P>Florists, meanwhile, are also looking forward to brisk business.</P>
      <P>Jing Yu-juan, owner of the Hua Hsin Florist, said while arranging bouquets that
"sending flowers to loved ones will never become outmoded."</P>
      <P>Unaffected by the weak economy, she noted that "on special occasions, such as
Valentine's Day, males always want to present the best to their female friends."</P>
      <P>"There is a trend in recent years that more and more gay people also order
flowers for their partners, " Jing said, adding that "some office ladies even
order flowers for themselves."</P>
      <P>In order to deal with the rush of orders, Jing said she has also hired 20 taxis
as couriers to deliver bouquets.</P>

      <P>The blaze destroyed rehearsal studios, props, costumes and production archives
among other things of the 35-year-old troupe.</P>
      <P>"There is no time for tears," Lin Hwai-min, the troupe's founder and
choreographer, told the dancers, encouraging them to "practice as usual" so that
they can perform well in all 121 performances scheduled for this year.</P>
      <P>Lin on Tuesday also went to inspect three possible sites offered by Taipei
County Government as a replacement facility for the dance troupe. He was
accompanied by Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei, Panchiao City Mayor Chiang
Huei-cheng as well as Taipei City Government Department of Culture Director Lee
Yung-ping.</P>
      <P>Lee said the city will offer land lots in Neihu and Mujha districts in suburban
Taipei for the dance company's use.</P>
      <P>Both Chou and Lee were vying for Cloud Gate to make its home in their respective
city or county so as to "help upgrade the cultural level" of their area.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the Cloud Gate will not need a site that will require a great deal
of renovations for the time being, as the dance group is scheduled to perform
overseas and in southern Taiwan next month.</P>
      <P>But he said that he is still "looking for a place where the Cloud Gate could
settle permanently."</P>
      <P>The props and costumes of the "Nine Song, " and "White Serpent Legend," two of
the best known works by the troupe, were damaged, Lin said, but as they will not
be performed this year, the company will take time to repair and recover the
damaged or ruined items.</P>
      <P>But the destroyed costume of the "Water Moon," which is scheduled to be
performed in this year's tour, will have to be reproduced soon.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) called for the government Tuesday to take the
initiative in assisting the Cloud Gate Dance Theater to overcome its crisis.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislators Lin Yi-shih, Alex Fai, and Chu Feng-chih made the appeal when
they met with the officials of the Ministry of Education and the Council for
Cultural Affairs (CCA) to discuss possible measures to help the Cloud Gate.</P>
      <P>"Cloud Gate is the jewel of Taiwan and the pride of its people," Chu said,
requesting the government take the initiative to provide assistance for funds
and a rehearsal site in the short term and a substantial reconstruction plan for
the burned-down rehearsal studio in the mid- and long-term.</P>
      <P>CCA Tzou Hung-tao said that the council has contacted Lin Hwai-min to inquire if
he needs assistance in personnel support or damaged materials.</P>
      <P>The CCA has also offered Huashan Culture Park and the Ching-mei Human Rights
Memorial Park for use during the transitional period until a more long-term site
for dance rehearsal can be found, Tzou added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taichung City Mayor Jason Hu donated NT$200,000 (US$6,250) to the
Cloud Gate Tuesday, saying that he is willing to chip in to help the dance
troupe and hope others will do the same. Former Taichung City Mayor Lin Po-jung
also donated NT$50,000.</P>
      <P>The company will launch its latest repertoire in Taipei in March, and is slated
to perform in New York's Guggenheim Museum in April before embarking on a seven-
week European performance tour.</P>
      <P>The world-famous dance troupe, known for its blend of Asian mythology, folklore
and aesthetics with a modern sensibility, was founded in 1973. Among its latest
works are the "Cursive" trilogy inspired by Chinese brush calligraphy.</P>

      <P>Although a cold front covered Taiwan during the Lunar New Year holidays from
Feb. 7-11, millions of visitors still flocked to tourist attractions around the
country, officials of the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of Transportation
and Communications said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to official estimates, Taiwan's people made a total of 5.9 million
visits to tourist attractions or resorts during the five-day period.</P>
      <P>There were also some 2.85 million visits to tourist destinations in central
Taiwan, marking a rise of more than 60 percent, or over 1 million visits,
compared to the figure posted in the same period of the previous year, Tourism
Bureau estimates showed.</P>
      <P>Tourism officials attributed the growth in the central region to its fine
weather, many large-scale theme parks, scenic spots, such as Sun Moon Lake in
Nantou County -- one of the most famous tourist spots across Taiwan, and the
celebrations of several seasonal flower festivals.</P>
      <P>During the same five-day period, tourist and resort facilities in northern
Taiwan embraced 1.26 million arrivals, down slightly from the year-earlier level
of 1.3 million, while in southern Taiwan, people made 1.95 million visits to
local tourist or recreational parks, up by 500,000 visits from the 2007 level.</P>
      <P>In eastern counties of Taitung and Hualien, people made a total of 690,000
pleasure trips to the region's recreational establishments Feb. 7 - 11, up by
10,000 over the 2007 figure.</P>
      <P>In Taitung County, however, the number of tourist arrivals to the Chipen Hot
Spring area and tourist destinations along its coasts fell by around 30 percent
over the same period year on year. The East Rift Valley and the Southern Cross-
island Highway saw their tourist arrivals drop by some 50 percent, according to
local business people.</P>

      <P>The founder of Taiwan's celebrated Cloud Gate Dance Theater lashed out at the
government Tuesday for what he described as "the pittance" it invests in
culture.</P>
      <P>Lin Hwai-min, also the dance troupe's choreographer, made the remarks when he
inspected several possible sites for the group in Taipei County after an
electrical fire destroyed the rehearsal studio, costumes, props and production
archives of the 35-year-old company based in Bali, Taipei County, a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the government's funding for culture is "simply too low, " citing
the Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) as an example, saying that its subsidies
for performing groups is a meager NT$100 million (US$3.13 million) a year.</P>
      <P>"With a large number of performing groups on this small island, we just don't
see any vision, or ambition, or determination by the government when it
appropriates such small amounts of money, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>The fire in Bali was put out in hours, but the fire within Lin raged even more
fiercely.</P>
      <P>Lin said that society "extended a warm hand to us after the fire, "but he
pointed out that if the government had a sound mechanism, the matter could have
been "dealt with easily."</P>
      <P>He lamented that the CCA has a dearth of emergency relief measures and that its
cultural policy has not improved.</P>
      <P>"The population and the size of Taiwan are small, but it has high density and
quality of performance groups, " Lin said, noting that in addition to Cloud
Gate, there are the Han Tang Yuefu, the Contemporary Legend Theater and the
Performance Workshop Theater.</P>
      <P>"The phenomenon is astonishing, but the government's investment in culture is
only a fraction of what is needed," he said.</P>
      <P>Lin said that in the wake of the fire "there is no time for tears" and he urged
his dancers to start practicing Tuesday after the Chinese New Year holiday so
that they can perform well in 121 local and overseas performances this year.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet will pass a draft package of amendments to the Organic Act of the
Executive Yuan, with the aim of restructuring the executive branch of the
government to better cope with contemporary social changes and meet new
challenges, an official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the draft package, the number of agencies under Executive Yuan will
be cut from 39 to 26, including 14 ministries, seven councils, and another five
independent organizations, the official said.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will also draft amendments to the Basic Organizational Code
of the Central Government, which currently stipulates a ceiling of 13 government
ministries and four councils to smooth the legislative process, the official
said.</P>
      <P>The draft amendments will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for approval
after being passed by the Executive Yuan, the official said. However, he added
that winning agreement from the legislature may not be easy as the amendments --
versions of which have been proposed many times -- touch on many entrenched
interests.</P>
      <P>The streamlining is intended to increase the Executive Yuan's operational
efficiency, with many overlapping duties being cut or integrated, the official
said, adding that many of the reforms were previously proposed in 2005.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendments designate 14 ministries for the future Executive Yuan,
with a new ministry on veterans' affairs being added to the 13 proposed in 2005.
It will also increase the number of councils from four to seven.</P>
      <P>The five independent organizations designated in the draft amendments are the
Central Bank, the Central Election Commission, the Fair Trade Commission, the
National Communications Commission, and the Financial Supervisory Commission,
the official said.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)  presidential candidate Frank
Hsieh and opposition Kuomintang (KMT) presidential candidate  Ma Ying-jeou  have
both made reform  of government administration a part of their political
platforms, the official said.</P>
      <P>After listening to a report on the planned reforms by Shih Neng-chieh, chairman
of the Research, Development and Evaluation Commission under the Executive Yuan,
earlier this month, Premire Chang Chun-hsiung  indicated  that the Cabinet would
push the legislature to pass the amendment package during its current session,
the official said.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Minister Shieh Jhy-wey said the proposed Executive
Yuan restructuring plan is consistent with the DPP administration's  promotion
of government  reform,  but is not particularly associated with the presidential
election slated for March 22.</P>
      <P>Shieh made the remarks to reporters as he joined the Lunar New Year's greeting
activities at the Chinese Television System.</P>
      <P>Shieh expressed the hope that the package would be passed by the new
legislature, which is dominated by the KMT, as early as possible. The new
legislature will open its first plenary session Feb. 22.</P>

      <P>Controversial opposition Legislator Yen Ching-piao was convicted on charges of
corruption and possession of firearms during his tenure as speaker of the
Taichung County Council by the Taiwan High Court Tuesday, upholding previous
court rulings.</P>
      <P>The High Court again found Yen guilty of possessing firearms and illegally using
up to NT$20.6 million in public funds to entertain guests at night clubs during
his stint as Taichung County Council speaker from Oct. 1998 to Dec. 2000.</P>
      <P>The Taichung branch of the Taiwan High Court sentenced Yen to a combined 11
years in prison, with eight years for the corruption charges and three years and
six months for the firearm possession conviction. The sentence is two years
shorter than that handed down by the same court in a previous trial.</P>
      <P>According to Tuesday's verdict, Yen will also be stripped of his civil rights
for six years after serving his prison term.</P>
      <P>Protesting his innocence, Yen, who was re-elected with a high proportion of the
vote in the hotly contested Jan. 12 legislative elections, said he will
definitely again appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>Taichung County Council Speaker Chang Ching-tang, who was deputy speaker when
Yen led the body, was also convicted for his role in the corruption case and
sentenced to eight years and four months in jail. Another accomplice in the
case, Tsai Wen-hsiung, a former chief secretary of the council, was given a
sentence of eight years and two months.</P>
      <P>The three were found guilty of the charges by the Taichung District Court and
then by the High Court in the case's first retrial. After the High Court
verdict, the defendents appealed to the ruling to the Supreme Court, which sent
the cases back to the High Court for a new trial that concluded with Tuesday's
guilty verdicts.</P>
      <P>Yen, Chang and Tsai can all file another appeal with the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) candidate Ma Ying-jeou urged the public Tuesday
to support his presidential bid in the March 22 race, saying that giving the
KMT's full power in the legislative and executive branches will bring progress
for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma issued the call while addressing a Lunar New Year gathering of KMT members at
the party's headquarters, in which KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung, Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, Legislative Yuan Deputy Speaker Tseng Yung-chuan and KMT
Secretary-General Wu Duen-yih also were present.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside widespread speculation that Taiwan would return to an
authoritarian rule if the KMT succeeds in seizing the presidency after its
avalanche victory in the Jan. 12 legislative polls, Ma reiterated that the
country would make remarkable progress should the KMT win the presidency while
fully in control of the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>"If the Presidential Office and the Legislative Yuan could work in tandem, it
would improve the welfare of the people and lead to the advancement of the
country," Ma asserted.</P>
      <P>"If the KMT controls the legislature and the central government, the party must
be fully held accountable for its performance in ruling the country, " he said,
adding that "Taiwan's people have had enough with political wrangling."</P>
      <P>Ma also blamed the incumbent Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration
for what he calls Taiwan's lackluster performance in recent years, arguing that
the government is responsible for the people's current difficulties.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's problem lies in the government sector, and now is the time for the
people to have a new government, particularly as the DPP administration has
impeded Taiwan's advancement over the past eight years," he went on to claim.</P>
      <P>The KMT presidential candidate also expressed confidence of winning the March 22
race, in which he will face DPP rival Frank Hsieh.</P>

      <P>A township head in Taipei County and two of his subordinates were indicted
Wednesday on charges of helping wealthy individuals evade taxes in 2005.</P>
      <P>The Public Prosecutors Office of the Taipei District Court is seeking a sentence
of 10 years in prison for Shihding township head Yeh Jung-hua, plus a fine of
NT$10 million (US$313,795).</P>
      <P>The prosecutors are also asking a sentence of six-and-a-half years for Yeh's
secretary, Huang Chao-chin, and a sentence of five-and-a-half years for Chiu
Chien-liang, head of the township government's public construction department.</P>
      <P>According to the prosecution, the trio helped about 180 wealthy people,
including well-known doctors, to evade taxes of NT$260 million by accepting
large tax-deductible donations from them in the name of aiding the township's
green project while actually giving 80 percent of the donations back to the
donors.</P>
      <P>Although the national tax authorities tried to contact the township government

Yeh and his two subordinates ignored them.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors and agents from the Investigation Bureau under the Ministry of
Justice questioned Yeh, Huang and Chiu, as well as some 190 suspected tax
dodgers in April last year. Yeh was taken into custody but was later released on
NT$1 million bail.</P>
      <P>Most of the tax dodgers received suspended sentences after paying all the taxes

      <P>Most domestic and foreign think tanks forecast that Taiwan's economic growth for
2008 can be maintained at a minimum of 4 percent despite a possible economic
downturn in the United States.</P>
      <P>Thomas M.f. Yeh, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development's (CEPD), said Tuesday that despite a gloomy economic
outlook in the U.S., Taiwan's foreign trade will still grow stably due largely
to local manufacturers' successful export deployment in emerging markets.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's exports to the Asian region have accounted for more than 60 percent of
its total exports, while the global demand for the island's electronic and panel
display products is still strong, " Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER) Chairman David S. Hong shared Yeh's
view, predicting that the island's exports may grow by 9.38 percent this year,
while its imports may increase by 10.33 percent.</P>
      <P>The council and the institute forecast Taiwan's economic growth for this year at
4.8 percent and 4.29 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>However, the Taiwan-based Polaris Research Institute's President Liang Kuo-yuan
showed a more pessimistic view on Taiwan's foreign trade, stressing that the
growth in Taiwan's exports may be offset by the economic downfall in the United
States.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's exports will just register a moderate growth in 2008, which will be
lower than that of last year as most of the major economies around the world
will suffer a slowdown in their economic growth this year," Liang added at a
recent press conference.</P>
      <P>U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke acknowledged recently that "U.S.
economic outlooks are deteriorating" due to rising oil prices and the slumping
housing market, with former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan echoing
Bernanke's view by saying recently that the U.S. economy has shown "signs of
recession."</P>

Feb. 7 election and that its leader, Dean Barrow, was inaugurated Feb. 8 as the

      <P>Taiwan appreciates the staunch support of Belize and wishes to continue with
bilateral cooperation projects in the areas of culture, agriculture, education

      <P>The Center of Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of Health called on the
public Tuesday to maintain good personal hygiene to prevent cluster infections
of enterovirus after the start of the new school semester.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director-General Lin Ting pointed out that the country already has
had 30 reported serious cases of enterovirus infection since the beginning of
this year. Among them, 13 were confirmed, with 10 in southern Taiwan, one in
central Taiwan and two in northern Taiwan, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The 13th confirmed case was that of an 18-month baby in Pingtung County in
southern Taiwan, Lin went on.</P>
      <P>"It is not the peak season for the disease yet and the high number of serious
cases is an abnormal situation," Lin said. The peak season for enterovirus
disease is usually summer.</P>
      <P>There were only two reported serious cases and non-confirmed cases during the
same period of last year. A total of 49 cases were reported throughout last
year, with 12 confirmed and two fatalities, Lin continued.</P>
      <P>The enterovirus epidemic curve of the past three weeks showed a drop of 39.5
percent from when the previous semester was still in session, but the percentage
might rise again after the new semester begins because the disease tends to
become epidemic among people with intensive contacts, such as schoolchildren,
Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin reminded parents to be alert to symptoms of high fever, lapses in
consciousness and muscle spasms in their children and to seek early treatment.</P>

      <P>The International Publishers Association (IPA) awarded the Taipei International
Book Exhibition (TIBE) the privilege  of being the world's first to join its
book fair partnership program, thanks to Taiwan's well-developed freedom of
speech and publication, Government Information Office (GIO) Minister Shieh Jhy-
wey said Tuesday at a press conference.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the GIO -- the book fair's major sponsor -- Shieh signed a
partnership program agreement with IPA President Ana Maria Cabanellas,
finalizing what Shieh hailed as a historic step for Taiwan's publishing
industry.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is a small island, so it is important for the country to boost its image
overseas as much as possible," he said.</P>
      <P>Shieh also noted the IPA's preference of Taiwan over China. "Taiwan's
publication industry has two major prevalences -- free publication and free
speech, " Shieh pointed out, referring to the partnership program that places
high value on these two basic rights, still under strict control by the
government in China.</P>
      <P>The  partnership  program,  which  allows  non-  publisher organizations like
TIBE to take part in the IPA, aims to improve the operation of the book fair and
make sure the process is in line with the IPA's chief principals such as
respecting copyright laws, Cabanellas said, adding that there are also training
sessions provided to help further develop local publishers.</P>
      <P>Although the rights enjoyed by an IPA member and a book fair program participant
are largely the same, book fair partners do not have the right to vote in the
IPA General Assembly, according to Cabanellas.</P>
      <P>The IPA initiated the book fair partnership program in 2006, with the aim of
helping promote book fairs around the world. At the Frankfurt Book Fair last
October, the association offered the program's first invitation to TIBE, which
also participated in the German book fair to promote Taiwanese books and
writers.</P>
      <P>Cabanellas also expressed anticipation for the IPA Publishers Congress in May in
Seoul, saying the organization is very interested in this year's congress
"because the Asian delegates will help us learn more about the publishing
industry in the region."</P>
      <P>Linden Lin, chairman of Taipei Book Fair Foundation, will deliver a speech at
the congress to discuss the status and prospects of Taiwan's publishing
industry. The foundation is the organizer of the TIBE.</P>
      <P>China, despite its infamous record on freedom of speech, is also invited to the
congress. Although China is not an IPA member, Cabanallas noted, a Chinese
delegate will give a speech discussing publishing freedom in China.</P>
      <P>The congress is held every four years for global publishers to review the
international publishing industry, covering a range of topics including
marketing and censorship issues.</P>
      <P>At present, seven of the 50-plus IPA member states are in Asia -- India,
Indonesia, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.</P>
      <P>The Taipei book fair will be held for six days from Feb. 13-18 at the Taipei
World Trade Center's Halls 1, 2 and 3, with the Australian Pavilion as its
centerpiece.</P>

      <P>The Taipei Fubon Bank is expected to launch a sports lottery in May at the
latest, which will pose a major threat to the Taiwan Lottery Co. (TLC) , which
is currently the official operator of various public welfare lotteries in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the bank said Tuesday that 20 percent of the respondents to a
recent survey carried out by the bank said they will buy sports lottery tickets.</P>
      <P>Sports lottery ticket buyers will have greater odds of winning the lottery if
they have a better understanding of the rules of the games and the participating
teams, according to Fubon Vice President Richard Yang.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage, the sports lottery will focus on games of the U.S. NBA
basketball, Major League Baseball and the Union of European Football
Associations, Yang noted.</P>
      <P>He further predicted that 400 games will be played on a monthly basis, with a
maximum of 6,000 games held annually.</P>
      <P>Overall, the compound annual growth rate of the world's sports lottery market
has hit 13 percent, while that of the world's lottery market only registers 9
percent.</P>
      <P>According to Yang, public welfare lottery ticket buyers in Taiwan are aged
between 18 and 65, with equal numbers of males and females.</P>
      <P>In contrast, in other countries, sports lottery ticket buyers are aged between
25 and 45, mostly white-collar males and male computer users who have strong
interest in sport.</P>
      <P>To counter the possible strong competition from the sports lottery, the Taiwan
Lottery Co. (TLC) -- which suffered losses in lottery sales last year -- will
launch new products every season, said company Chairman Oliver Shang.</P>
      <P>The TLC, a subsidiary of the Chinatrust Financial Holding Co., beat the Taipei
Fubon Bank in 2006 to become the authorized runner of public welfare lotteries
from 2007 to 2013.</P>
      <P>The following year, the Taipei Fubon Bank defeated other bidders, including the
Chinatrust Financial Holding Co., to win the right to operate the sports lottery
from 2008 to 2013.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) has been offering tuition subsidies to
underprivileged children and is hoping that local governments will help
distribute the subsidies to elementary and junior high students from poor
families, a ministry official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Pan Wen-chung, director of the MOE's Department of Elementary Education, noted
that the ministry has established a three-level protection net since 2005 aimed
at offering financial help of NT$2,000 annually to children from underprivileged
families, provided by schools, local governments and the central government.</P>
      <P>According to Pan, some 40,000 elementary and junior high school children cannot
afford annual school tuition fees.</P>
      <P>He called on teachers to check on the financial situation of their students and
for local governments to assign budget for the tuition subsidies, adding that
the MOE will help collect funds to ensure that students do not drop out of
school due to financial factors.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is likely to face rising inflationary pressure this year due to soaring
core consumer prices and rising grain prices and commodity costs, according to
official statistics released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Core consumer prices, which exclude vegetables, fruits and fish, as well as food
and energy costs, registered a year-on-year growth of 1.35 percent last year,
the highest level since 1997, due to skyrocketing grain prices on the
international market, according to the tallies compiled by the Directorate-
General of Budget, Accounting, and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>A DGBAS official said core consumer prices will drive overall commodity prices
up.</P>
      <P>Between 2006-2007, the price surge of agricultural products was the most
noticeable, with the price of Chinese herbs hiking the most at 43.75 percent,
followed by that of tomatoes at 38.7 percent, corn at 22.84 percent, cabbages at
18.13 percent and Chinese cabbages at 16 percent, according to the tallies.</P>
      <P>Prices on the vegetable index in 2007 rose by 9.52 percent year-on-year which
contributed to an increase of 1. 8 percent in the year's CPI, the report
revealed.</P>
      <P>The official attributed the soaring consumer-price inflation mainly to the
unrelenting rise of grain prices which he said pushed commodity suppliers to
adjust prices upward to shift costs to consumers.</P>
      <P>Citing the tallies, the official said that as a result, prices of a wide range
of products posted a year-on-year growth, such as the price of salad oils, which
went up 14.44 percent, that of raw milk up 7.31 percent, bread 6.12 percent,
adult milk powder 5.61 percent, cereals 4.87 percent, Western fast food 2.77
percent, and instant noodles 2.64 percent.</P>
      <P>The official expected that core consumer prices will drive overall commodity
prices up.</P>
      <P>In the face of the rising costs of raw materials and high oil prices this year,
Taiwan is expected to face greater inflationary pressures than last year,
according to the officials.</P>
      <P>DGBAS forecast Taiwan's economic growth rate for 2008 will be 1.84 percent, the
official said. The figures correspond to the results of several local and
international forecasts, such as Global Insight Inc's 2.3 percent, compared with
2.01 percent by Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research, 1.95 percent by
Polaris Research Institute, 1.93 percent by Academia Sinica and 1.86 percent by
Taiwan Research Institute.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's January exports totaled US$22.1 billion and imports registered US$20.6
billion, the fourth- and third-highest  single-month  values  in the country's
history, respectively, a Ministry of Finance (MOF) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>January exports and imports saw year-on-year rises of 11.9 percent and 14.8
percent, respectively, said Hsu Ray-lin, deputy director of the ministry's
statistics department.</P>
      <P>Hsu attributed  the export growth to an increase of over 14-percent in exports
to Hong Kong, China, South Korea and the six member countries of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) -- Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.</P>
      <P>On the import growth, Hsu explained that Taiwan's imports from Hong Kong, China,
the United States, Japan and Europe grew more than 13 percent in the month.</P>
      <P>He further said that Taiwan reported a trade surplus of US$1.53 billion in
January, marking the 23rd trade surplus month in a row since March 2006.</P>
      <P>The figures indicate that Taiwan's foreign trade is continuing to expand
steadily, Hsu noted.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, exports of chemical, machinery and precision instrument
products rose greatly in January,  while those of traditional products dropped.</P>
      <P>Imports of mineral and machinery products saw the largest growths of the total
January imports, Hsu said, adding that it was still too early to determine if

    <HEADLINE>MND to check if alleged spy got information on defense system</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 12 (CNA)
02/12/08  23:48:30

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) has formed a task force to determine if
an alleged Chinese spy arrested in the United States offered Beijing information
about a new air defense system that it intends to purchase from Washington, the
ministry said Tuesday in a news release.</P>
      <P>The press statement was issued after the U.S. Department of Justice announced
Monday that four individuals suspected of spying for China had been arrested.
Among them is a Taiwanese-American identified as Kuo Tai-sheng.</P>
      <P>According to a United Evening News report, the leaked classified information was
mostly related to a C4ISR system that Taiwan intends to  procure  to  integrate
its  military  command,  control, communications,  computers,  intelligence,
surveillance  and reconnaissance systems.</P>
      <P>The MND statement said the ministry has consistently communicated with the U.S.
Department of Defense through arms purchase channels concerning weaponry
systems. Noting that the U.S. has imposed internal controls on all related
information, the statement said the MND will voice concern as to whether any
information about the C4ISR system has been leaked, and will adopt response
measures.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an Associated Press report said Kuo Tai-sheng, 58, was arrested for
allegedly providing Beijing with information obtained from Pentagon weapons
systems policy analyst Gregg W. Bergersen, 51.</P>
      <P>The U.S. Justice Department said Monday that Bergersen sold classified defense
information to Kuo, whom it identified as a New Orleans furniture salesman. In
return, Kuo, a Taiwanese native and naturalized U.S. citizen, forwarded the
information to the Chinese government, it said.</P>
      <P>In an affidavit, the department said that Bergersen worked for the Arlington,
Virginia-based Defense Security Cooperation Agency, and that he had discussed
with Kuo the sophisticated command, control and communications system that
Taiwan is purchasing from U.S. defense contractor Lockheed Martin.</P>
      <P>An unidentified MND official was quoted as having told Associated Press that the
ministry was trying to ascertain if the information Kuo allegedly supplied was
related to the C4ISR system, formally known as Automated Air Defense System.</P>
      <P>"We understand Kuo was not awarded any contracts connected with the command
system, " the official said. "The U.S. Defense Department is handling our
weapons purchases, and we are trying to understand it."</P>
      <P>According to a Lockheed Martin company statement, its Automated Air Defense
System "will significantly increase operational command and control, as well as
ensure system survivability."</P>

      <P>Taiwan's January exports totaled US$22.1 billion and imports registered US$20.6
billion, the fourth- and third-highest  single-month  values  in the country's
history, respectively, a Ministry of Finance (MOF) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>January exports and imports saw year-on-year rises of 11.9 percent and 14.8
percent, respectively, said Hsu Ray-lin, deputy director of the ministry's
statistics department.</P>
      <P>Hsu attributed  the export growth to an increase of over 14-percent in exports
to Hong Kong, China, South Korea and the six member countries of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) -- Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.</P>
      <P>On the import growth, Hsu explained that Taiwan's imports from Hong Kong, China,
the United States, Japan and Europe grew more than 13 percent in the month.</P>
      <P>He further said that Taiwan reported a trade surplus of US$1.53 billion in
January, marking the 23rd trade surplus month in a row since March 2006.</P>
      <P>The figures indicate that Taiwan's foreign trade is continuing to expand
steadily, Hsu noted.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, exports of chemical, machinery and precision instrument
products rose greatly in January,  while those of traditional products dropped.</P>
      <P>Imports of mineral and machinery products saw the largest growths of the total
January imports, Hsu said, adding that it was still too early to determine if
domestic investment is improving.</P>

      <P>The Hualien Blood Center appealed to the public Tuesday to donate blood to help
relieve a blood shortage that has troubled the center since before the Lunar New
Year holiday.</P>
      <P>Center staff said the current stockpile of various types of blood is dangerously
low, with a shortfall of about 1,000 bags.</P>
      <P>They pointed out that the center has only 23 bags of Type A blood left, although
235 bags are needed to maintain a safe storage level to meet demand for seven
days.</P>
      <P>The stock of Type B blood is down to 51 bags, far lower than the safe level of
200 bags. The center should also have 380 bags of Type O blood, but the
stockpile has dropped to 111 bags, while Type AB blood, usually maintained at 60
bags, is down to only 11 bags.</P>
      <P>Workers at the center urged members of the public aged between 17 and 65 to
donate blood generously to help resolve the shortage if they are in good
physical condition and meet the requirements of a minimum 50 kg in weight for
males and 45 kg for females.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Election unlikely to affect ties with China: official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>There is unlikely to be any progress in cross-Taiwan Strait relations whatever
the outcome of the March 22 presidential election, a Taiwan official said at a
seminar in Brussels Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Liu Shih-chung, deputy chief of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Research and
Planning Committee, contended that even if Ma Ying-jeou from the pro-unification
Kuomintang (KMT)  were to be elected president, it is unlikely Beijing would
allow Taiwan more space in the international arena.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar held by the European Institute for Asian Studies in the
Belgian capital, Liu said that whoever is elected to lead Taiwan  will still
have to deal with China's  continued intimidation and suppression of the
country.</P>
      <P>The next president's most important duty, he asserted, will be to protect
Taiwan's security and sovereignty and uphold the people's right to determine
Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the official argued that the KMT's landslide win in the Jan. 12
legislative elections, in which it won 81 of the 113 seats contested, does not
mean the party will definitely emerge victorious on March 22.</P>
      <P>But the victory did allow Beijing to breathe a sigh of relief, Liu said, because
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) repeated calls to re-engineer
the Constitution was nightmarish for China.</P>
      <P>The KMT's dominance of the legislature, which must approve constitutional
amendments by a three-quarters majority before they are voted on by the people,
means that initiatives to change the Constitution to formalize Taiwan's
independence are likely to be blocked in the next four years.</P>
      <P>On the two referendums on Taiwan's U.N. bid to be held alongside the
presidential elections, Liu said Beijing opposes both questions, whether the
DPP's version on joining the United Nations under the name "Taiwan" or the KMT's
initiative to regain U.N. membership under the name "Republic of China" or any
other "suitable" name.</P>
      <P>With China increasing its deployment of missiles targeting Taiwan and stepping
up its policy of isolating Taiwan diplomatically, the referendums were simply a
measure to counter Beijing's attempt to change the cross-strait status quo, Liu
argued.</P>

      <P>With couples around Taiwan set to enjoy a romantic Valentine's Day, the
Department of Health (DOH) reminded lovers Wednesday to use condoms to prevent
turning their romance into regret.</P>
      <P>Yang Ching-hui, a section chief at the DOH's Centers for Disease Control,
stressed that condoms are effective in preventing the spread of AIDS and other
sexually transmitted diseases.</P>
      <P>He cautioned couples not to see AIDS as a threat only to homosexuals, citing
statistics which show that over 20 percent of new AIDS cases in Taiwan are the
result of heterosexual intercourse.</P>
      <P>Couples should also use condoms when engaging in oral sex, Yang said, noting
that research has revealed that HIV can also be transmitted orally.</P>
      <P>Yang further said that couples should avoid using oil-based lubricants on
condoms as such lubricants increase the likelihood of condoms breaking during
intercourse.</P>
      <P>If couples decide to use lubricants, they should use safer water-based ones
instead, he advised.</P>
      <P>Noting that sexual intercourse is the main way that AIDS is transmitted in
Taiwan, Yang urged couples to not let their passion get the better of them and
to be sure to use a condom to avoid a tragedy.</P>

      <P>The New Taiwan dollar's rate of appreciation against the U.S. dollar has been
the second highest among all Asian currencies so far this year, according to
figures released Wednesday by a Singapore-based asset management company.</P>
      <P>The NT dollar has risen 2.58 percent against the greenback since the start of
the year, trailing only the Malaysian ringgit, which has appreciated 2.65
percent, according to the UOB Investment Advisor (Taiwan) Ltd.</P>
      <P>Most Asian currencies have appreciated against the U.S. dollar so far this year,
with the Indonesian rupiah gaining 2.48 percent, the Singapore dollar rising
1.89 percent, the Philippine peso up 1.38 percent, and the Chinese yuan gaining
1.07 percent, the figures showed.</P>
      <P>The Indian rupee and Hong Kong dollar have also made slight gains, at 0.35
percent and 0.33 percent, respectively, while the Thai baht and South Korean won
have slid by 6.74 percent and 0.43 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Although the NT dollar has performed well among Asian currencies so far this
year, the local currency placed near the bottom of the list in 2007, rising just
2.58 percent against the greenback, well behind the Thai baht's 25.49 percent,
the Philippine peso's 25.12 percent, the Indian rupee's 22.65 percent and the

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet on Wednesday postponed approving measures that would streamline the
executive branch of Taiwan's government, but Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said he
would try to push the revisions through next week.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet was considering a draft package of amendments to the Organization
Act of the Executive Yuan that would cut the number of agencies under the
Executive Yuan from 39 to 26.</P>
      <P>Chang said the amendments have taken longer to iron out than any other bills
considered during his second term as premier, which began in May 2007. He noted
that he had asked Vice Premier Chiou I-jen to hold discussions with related
ministries and councils to try and make progress on the issue before the
Executive Yuan's meeting next week.</P>
      <P>Chang is treating the measures with some urgency because of what he said is the
"profound influence" the government reform package would have in increasing the
Executive Yuan's operational efficiency, with many overlapping duties being cut
or integrated.</P>
      <P>Based on a 2005 proposal that called for the Executive Yuan to be composed of 13
ministries and four councils, the draft amendments currently under consideration
propose a structure of 14 ministries, seven councils and five independent
organizations.</P>
      <P>The new measures would add a ministry for veterans' affairs and three other
councils -- the National Science Council, the Gender Equality Commission, and
the Oceans Commission -- to the 2005 proposal.</P>
      <P>The draft amendments will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for approval
after being passed by the Executive Yuan, but achieving a consensus in the
legislature could be even more difficult because the amendments touch on many
entrenched interests with support in the lawmaking body.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan exports about 23,000 tons of frozen soybeans each year, making it the top
foreign reserve earner among all agricultural produce exported, the Council of
Agriculture (COA) reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan last year produced some 43,000 tons of frozen soybeans -- a major source
of vegetarian protein -- with more than half, or about 23,000 tons, being
exported, officials from the COA Food and Agriculture Agency said.</P>
      <P>Based on an average export price of US$1.75 per kilogram, the export of frozen
soybeans generated about US$50 million last year in forex revenues. That far
exceeded Taiwan's second most valuable export crop -- ginger -- which had an
export value of US$5.08 million in 2007, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The biggest market for Taiwan's frozen soybeans is Japan, where Taiwan's
soybeans have a 35 percent share of the frozen soybean market, they noted.</P>
      <P>The officials said that to secure stable supplies of soybeans and lower
production costs, the COA began last year to assist the Taiwan Regional
Association of Frozen Vegetable and Fruit to develop an exclusive soybean
plantation zone in the Kaohsiung-Pingtung area in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>About 6 tons of soybeans can be harvested two to three times a year from each
hectare of the exclusive zone -- an area of 2,497 hectares -- ensuring
production of about 30,000 tons a year, according to the officials.</P>

      <P>A group of Taiwanese students studying at a Belgian university launched a drive
Tuesday to rally support for Taiwan's bid to enter the United Nations as a full
member.</P>
      <P>The drive is aimed not only at letting Taiwan know that Taiwanese students in
Belgium are supportive of U.N. membership for the country, but also at
soliciting support for the bid from other foreign students studying in Belgium
and members of the international community, said campaign spokeswoman Shen Yi-
ling.</P>
      <P>In a written statement from the Taiwanese student association at the French-
language Universite Catholique de Louvain in Belgium, the group said Taiwan has
an independent constitutional system under which its people enjoy free and
dynamic political lives.</P>
      <P>Arguing that the international community has not fully understood the
"collective mindset" of the Taiwanese people, the group said Taiwan's U.N. bid
is a first, critical step in getting the world to better learn about Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's people, whether they live in Taiwan or abroad and irrespective of their
political persuasions, should say out loud with one single voice that "Taiwan
and its 23 million people deserve U.N. membership," the statement urged.</P>
      <P>As the Republic of China, Taiwan lost its seat in the world body to the People's
Republic of China in 1971, and has reapplied unsuccessfully for membership in
the body every year since 1993. Last year was the first time Taiwan tried to
apply for a U.N. seat under the name "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Two referendums will be held alongside the March 22 presidential election on the
U.N. bid -- one proposed by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on
joining the U.N. under the name "Taiwan, " the other proposed by the Kuomintang
on rejoining the U.N. under the name "Republic of China" or any other "suitable"
name.</P>
      <P>The group urged Taiwanese voters to participate in the polls to help the world
realize the importance U.N. membership for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Should the referendums fail -- and they would be defeated if 50 percent of
eligible voters do not cast ballots on the questions -- it would send a message
to the world that Taiwan's people do not want to enter the U.N. and even worse,
that they "want to be ruled by the People's Republic of China government," the
group said.</P>
      <P>While some foreign governments do not support Taiwan's holding of the
referendums, "many foreign friends here in Brussels support the idea of Taiwan's
being admitted into the U.N.," the statement said.</P>
      <P>The Louvain student group printed handouts of "U.N. membership for Taiwan" in
Chinese, English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Vietnamese
and Malaysian to solicit global support for Taiwan's U.N. bid.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) has initiated a renewed drive to
promote the planting of trees with the aim of encouraging every citizen to plant
at least one tree in his or her lifetime, COA senior officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The officials said that in the wake of drastic climate changes caused by global
warming, Taiwan should contribute to alleviate the burden on the environment as
a responsible member of the global village.</P>
      <P>"Tree planting is an important first step to achieve that goal, " they added.</P>
      <P>The drive -- officially titled "One Life, One Tree, for a Motherland of Green"
-- is using 12 species of tree corresponding to the 12 signs of the zodiac to
induce people to sow the tree seed corresponding to their sign on their
birthday, in the hope that at least half of the population will have been
persuaded to plant their own trees within five years.</P>
      <P>COA Minister Su Jia-chyuan estimated that if all 23 million Taiwanese follow the
call, it will raise the nation's forest coverage by 59.09 percent, reducing
carbon emissions, producing oxygen and retaining water that could be worth
billions of dollars.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA)  will step up efforts to
help Taiwan's food manufacturers penetrate the Japanese market after dumplings
made in China found to contain a toxic pesticide called into question the
reliability of China-made products.</P>
      <P>Japan relies on imports for 60 percent of its food supply, and China is the
country's largest source of food imports, but with China's reputation tainted,
Japanese buyers have been forced to adjust their purchasing habits, TAITRA
officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials said they will invite Japanese buyers and media to visit Taiwan's
local frozen food manufacturers and see for themselves the strict food safety
criteria Taiwanese suppliers have put in place.</P>
      <P>"This will boost Japanese buyers' confidence in Taiwan products," they said.</P>
      <P>The semi-official trade promotion organization is also planning to organize
groups of local businesses to take part in two major Japanese food expositions,
the Super Market Trade Show, Japan's biggest supermarket trade show that takes
place in Tokyo later this month, and FOODDEX Japan, to be held in Tokyo in
March.</P>
      <P>At least 2,000 people in 46 prefectures reportedly got sick after eating the
pesticide-contaminated dumplings from China. Japanese food companies recalled
the toxic dumplings, and some high-end department stores have even removed all
Chinese frozen foods from their shelves.</P>
      <P>As a result, Japanese consumers' faith in China-made food has plunged. A poll
conducted by the Kyodo News Agency Feb. 9-10 found that 75.9 percent of Japanese
say they will no longer use food products made in China.</P>
      <P>TAITRA Deputy Secretary-General Yeh Ming-shui recently invited officials from
the Taiwan Frozen Food Processors Association and three big frozen food
producers -- Chi Mei, I Mei and Taiwan Sugar -- to discuss possible trade

      <P>Only 24.6 percent of Taiwan's residences are insured against earthquakes, a low
coverage rate compared to that found in other countries, a Financial Supervisory
Commission (FSC) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Earthquake insurance coverage rates for residential buildings abroad range
between 40 percent and 50 percent, with the rate in New Zealand surpassing  80
percent,  said FSC Administrative  Vice Chairwoman Susan Chang.</P>
      <P>Although many local residents still do not buy earthquake insurance for their
homes, earthquake policies have grown more popular in the wake of destructive
temblors that have hit Taiwan over the past 10 years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's earthquake insurance coverage rate stood at a mere 0.2 percent when a
major quake of magnitude 7.3 devastated central Taiwan in September 1999,
leaving over 2,400 people dead and more than 8,000 injured, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>The government implemented a residential earthquake insurance system in 2002,
and since then, more than 1.87 million residential quake insurance polices,
worth NT$2.53 trillion (US$79.4 billion) , have been purchased, according to the
commission's Insurance Bureau.</P>
      <P>Despite the constant  threat from earthquakes,  most local homeowners do not
ensure their homes or apartments against damage from earthquakes until they need
to apply for housing loans, said Chang, who added that her commission will step
up its efforts to raise local citizens' awareness of controlling  risk to their
properties.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is frequently hit by earthquakes, with 51 active faults around the
island.</P>

      <P>The semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) will sponsor a Lunar New
Year meeting Thursday with China-based Taiwanese businessmen to swap opinions on
issues of key concern to them, including direct transportation links across the
Taiwan Strait, a government official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Chen Ming-tong said the main purpose of
the gathering is to explore different views regarding the establishment of
direct shipping and air links and the opening of charter flight services across
the strait, among other major China investment policies.</P>
      <P>In addition, the annual meeting is also aimed at gaining a better understanding
of how the government can provide assistance to Taiwanese businessmen who have
sustained losses following the recent snowstorms in China -- the worst in 50
years.</P>
      <P>The MAC oversees the operations of the SEF, which is in charge of dealing with
Taiwan-China private exchanges in the absence of government-to-government
contacts.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will also take part in the gathering and give his best
wishes to the nearly 200 businessmen expected to attend, the MAC chairman said.</P>
      <P>In a bid to avoid political implications, he said that ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh and his main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) rival, Ma Ying-jeou, have not been invited to the
meeting.</P>
      <P>Both Hsieh and Ma have proclaimed that if elected in the March 22 race, they
will relax restrictions on China-bound investment by Taiwanese businesses.</P>
      <P>According  to Chen,  SEF Chairman Hung Chi-chang  and SEF Secretary-General You
Ying-lung were scheduled Wednesday to first explain the government's recent
cross-strait investment polices of key interest to a dozen chiefs of China-based
Taiwanese businessmen's associations in a closed- door preparatory meeting to

    <HEADLINE>KMT shrugs off DPP candidate's suggestions on U.N. referendums</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) shrugged off Wednesday a suggestion by
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh
that he ask President Chen Shui-bian to call a bipartisan meeting on the
referendums to be held on Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Huang Yu-chen said it is "absolutely unnecessary" for Hsieh to ask
the president to call a meeting over whether one of the two U.N.-bid referendums
scheduled to be held alongside the March 22 presidential election should be
forgone or whether a new, more viable U.N.-bid referendum should be worked out.</P>
      <P>Huang said no DPP-KMT negotiations over the U.N.-bid referendums are necessary,
as both sides know each other's stance over the issue very well, adding that
politicians of all persuasions should now focus their energy and attention on
the presidential election and try to put forward clear campaign platforms.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China lost its seat in the world body to the People's Republic
of China in 1971 and has re-applied unsuccessfully for membership in the body
every year since 1993. Last year was the first time Taiwan had tried to apply
for a U.N. seat under the name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Two referendums will be held alongside the presidential election on the U.N. bid
-- one proposed by the DPP on joining the U.N. under the name Taiwan, the other
proposed by the KMT on rejoining the U.N. under the name Republic of China or
any other "suitable" name.</P>
      <P>Hsieh reiterated  earlier Wednesday  that he supports both referendums and said
he will meet the president shortly, during which he will "suggest to Chen that
he call a meeting between the DPP and KMT decision-makers to work out the best
solution to the DPP-KMT bickering on the issue."</P>
      <P>Huang said that as Hsieh expressed support for the KMT-initiated referendum, he
and his campaign staff must know that the first referendum, proposed by the DPP,
is a dead end in the country's U.N. efforts.</P>
      <P>Huang urged Hsieh and the DPP to forgo the DPP referendum once and for all.</P>
      <P>He added that the KMT has never opposed the holding of any referendum on major
issues, but said the party -- which now holds an absolute majority in the
legislature after winning a landslide victory in the Jan. 12 legislative polls
-- is firmly opposed to the plan of holding the referendums alongside the
presidential election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP, KMT should cooperate to have referendums passed: Hsieh</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 13 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh
suggested Wednesday that his party seeks to cooperate with the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) to push for the passage of two U.N. bid referendums promoted
respectively by the parties.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who is also chairman of the DPP, said he will officially present the
proposal to President Chen Shui-bian during his planned meeting with Chen in the
next couple of days, in the hope that the president will call a meeting that
brings together leaders or representatives of the two parties to find a
resolution that is best for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The two referendums are set to be held alongside the March 22 presidential
election. While the DPP's version advocates joining the United Nations under the
name "Taiwan, " the KMT's initiative calls for regaining U.N. membership under
the name "Republic of China" or any other "suitable" name.</P>
      <P>However, following the failure of the two referendums held alongside the Jan. 12
legislative elections because the turnout rates did not reach the required 50
percent, there have been concerns that the upcoming referendums would fail to
pass as well for the same reason, especially when voters who opt to take part in
the DPP-backed referendum are likely to skip the KMT-initiated referendum, and
vice versa.</P>
      <P>Reiterating his support for both referendums, Hsieh said he does not wish to see
the KMT launch any drive to boycott the referendums like it did in January and
cause them to fail, because such an outcome would mislead the world into
doubting Taiwan's determination to join the United Nations and Taiwan's status
as a country independent of China.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, the two parties should support instead of compete with each
other because the two referendums  are not necessarily mutually exclusive, given
that the KMT initiative is ambiguous compared with the DPP's and does not rule
out the name "Taiwan" as a possible option.</P>
      <P>"Joining the United Nations has been a humble desire of the Taiwan people for
many years. Don't destroy Taiwan's common interests for election rivalry," Hsieh
said.</P>
      <P>Also Wednesday,  Cabinet spokesman  Shieh Jyh-wey said the government's
publicity on the U.N. bid referendums will focus on the two parties' common
ground, rather than their differences, pointing out that the most important
purpose of the two referendums is to declare to the world the 23 million
Taiwanese people's desire to participate in the United Nations and to see the
end of the "international apartheid" against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As the number of people signing the DPP and KMT referendum petitions totaled
approximately 4 million, Hsieh said he believes if the referendums are passed,
they will produce a "world-shattering" effect in the international community.</P>
      <P>However, the KMT appeared disinterested in the DPP's gesture.</P>
      <P>KMT presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou said the DPP should give up its
referendum bid now that it is willing to support the KMT's initiative, which he
claimed is the correct approach for Taiwan to participate in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Although the DPP initiative is intended to help Taiwan break through the
isolation imposed by China, it has instead brought about much disaster to Taiwan
over the past six months, with major countries including the United States and
Japan as well as the European Union having openly expressed their opposition to
the bid, Ma contended.</P>

A new battleground looms in a state where picnickers still flock to venerated
fields of Confederate glory. The campaigns of Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack
Obama are gearing up for today's presidential primary in Virginia, a key
Southern state rife with knotty demographics and shifting party loyalties. Both
camps view the Democratic vote in Virginia as their toughest matchup in the so-
called Potomac primaries, a stretch of contests that also includes Maryland and
the District of Columbia, where large and passionate constituencies among black

    <TEXT>
      <P>A French cartoonist who published a comic book on Taiwan seven years ago says
Taiwan remains a place full of wonder and surprises, with its "joy of living"
its best asset.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is a country living constantly in the present, " said the cartoonist
known as Golo in an interview with the Central News Agency. "Working, investing,
succeeding, claiming independence and enjoying life seem to represent the
attitudes of most Taiwanese people."</P>
      <P>In his book "Made in Taiwan" published in 2001, Golo paints a humorous and
incisive picture of Taiwan through its lively night markets, ubiquitous
convenience stores, and people's obsession with karaoke.</P>
      <P>His memories of Taiwan from his visit back then are all positive, he says, but
he did find some surprises.</P>
      <P>"I was shocked by the quantity of motorcycles in Taipei, but Taiwanese people's
hospitality and kindness impressed me most, " he said. "So I was surprised that
there were not many foreign tourists in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Born in Bayonne in southern France and a resident of Egypt for the past 15
years, Golo has traveled all over the world. He said that these multicultural
experiences "are really an advantage in my drawing. Contacts with people from
different cultures warrant an open-minded vision."</P>
      <P>Golo,  who once worked for a news agency in Egypt as a caricaturist,
incorporates  his  social  observations  in  his illustrations. In his eyes,
"Taipei is a modern city, but what is good is that it is not just a copy of
other occidental cities."</P>
      <P>Golo is in Taiwan for a month at the invitation of Le Pigeonnier, a French
publisher, to coincide with the Taipei International Book Exhibition (TIBE). He
is promoting "Made in Taiwan, " and collecting information and observations for
a second "Made in Taiwan" book of cartoons.</P>
      <P>The TIBE, considered to be the largest book fair in Asia, is being held from
Feb. 13-18 at the Taipei World Trade Center. Golo will meet his readers at a
special event Feb. 17.</P>

      <P>Government spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey said Wednesday that the Executive Yuan will
present its list of candidates for the National Communications Commission (NCC)
to the seventh Legislative Yuan for confirmation before the legislative session
formally begins Feb. 22.</P>
      <P>However, Shieh did not divulge if some of the current NCC members will be
retained, stressing that the selection of the candidates will be based on
consideration of their qualifications. He added that the Cabinet might recruit
talent from the academic and industrial sectors to the media watchdog.</P>
      <P>The current NCC commissioners were originally scheduled to step down Jan. 31
together with the sixth Legislative Yuan after the Council of Grand Justices
ruled last July that the way the NCC was formed violated the Constitution as it
infringed upon the power of the administrative branch.</P>
      <P>According to an amendment to the NCC Organic Law approved last December, the
Cabinet should have presented the nomination list by Jan. 31. However, the plan
was upset as the Cabinet led by Premier Chang Chun-hsiung advanced its
resignation to Jan. 24, although the Cabinet members were later retained by
President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>NCC Chairman Su Yeong-chin said Jan. 31 that the media regulatory body should
maintain its normal functions until the new commissioners assume their posts.</P>
      <P>Under the amended law, the number of NCC members should be cut to seven from the
existing 13 and the candidates should be nominated by the premier rather than
being recommended by major political parties in proportion to the number of
seats they hold in the legislature, as is the case at present. The term of
office is also extended to four years from the original three under the amended

    <HEADLINE>Executive Yuan ratifies two U.N. human rights treaties</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan ratified two U.N. human rights treaties Wednesday, 31 years
after signing them while the Republic of China in Taiwan was still a member of
the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said after his Cabinet ratified the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) that once the domestic
ratification process is completed, including the legislature's approval and the
president's signature, the ratification document will be sent to the U.N.
secretary-general for depositing.</P>
      <P>However, Chang said it will be a tough challenge to persuade the top U.N.
executive official to take over the ratification instrument to allow Taiwan to
complete the entire process of adopting the treaties given that the ROC is no
longer a U.N. member.</P>
      <P>The U.N. gave the China seat to the People's Republic of China at the expense of
Taiwan in 1971.</P>
      <P>Despite the challenge, the premier instructed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to
still seek completion of the ratification process "based on the general
international political climate."</P>
      <P>Under normal circumstances, the covenants come into force for the state
ratifying them three months after the date of deposit with the U.N.</P>
      <P>The ROC government did not complete the domestic ratification process after
signing the two covenants in 1967 because of the sea change in the international
situation that led to the 1971 transfer of the ROC's seat in the United Nations
to China.</P>
      <P>Ratifying these treaties now would be acting in accordance with President Chen
Shui-bian's call for Taiwan to become a part of the international human rights
community, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang indicated that President Chen has continually called on the Cabinet to
urge the legislature to ratify the International Bill of Human Rights, which
contains the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the two treaties, to
allow it to serve as the formal legal basis of human rights in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' taking active efforts to push for the
treaties' ratification is of great meaning in demonstrating Taiwan's concrete
efforts to protect human rights and to fulfill the duty as a member of the
international community, " Chang said.</P>
      <P>As the ratification has to happen at the same time when a draft bill regulating
the treaties' implementation is passed at the Legislative Yuan, Chang said, they
will be delivered together to the legislature for review. All relevant
government agencies will be expected to actively communicate with political
parties to seek the bill and the treaties' passage.</P>
      <P>The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, created in 1966 and
entered into force on March 23, 1976, recognizes the basic right of all
individuals in the world to freedom, justice and peace. It condemns slavery,
genocide, torture, cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment, and capital
punishment for pregnant women or persons below 18 years of age.</P>
      <P>The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is a
multilateral treaty which was adopted by the U.N. General Assembly on Dec. 16,
1966, and went into effect from Jan. 3, 1976. It recognizes that all people have
the right to freely determine their political status and freely pursue their
economic, social and cultural development. It also recognizes the right to
establish trade unions and go on strike.</P>

      <P>The barge, the Hsiang Jung No. 102, left Hualien a day earlier carrying 8,600
metric tons of gravel on its way to meet with its mother ship, the Hai Peng No.

      <P>Upon receiving its distress signal, the CGA's Hualien office dispatched three
boats to the scene, but they were unable to get close to the barge because the
sea was too rough.</P>
      <P>CGA workers had to throw lifesavers to the barge, coax the 12 crewmen to jump
into the freezing water, and pull them up one by one to safety. The rescue
mission took about two hours.</P>

university's Department of Bioenvironmental Systems Engineering, who was praised
for his long devotion to taking care of students, including paying tuitions for
financially-strained ones.</P>
      <P>For more than 10 years, Chang quietly paid the tuitions for students whose
family could not afford to pay, enabling them to complete their studies.</P>
      <P>One of his techniques in ensuring no student fell through the cracks, was what
he calls "one-on-one challenge" in which he would challenge his students who are
about to flunk his classes to table tennis matches. If the students beat him,
they pass.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, he advised teachers, particularly tutors, to be more tolerant and
understanding of today's students. He said they are under greater social
pressure than their predecessors.</P>
      <P>Another professor recognized was Chen Tsung-fu, who teaches at NTU's law school.</P>
      <P>Last year, after learning that the student had not attended school for more than
one month as a result of a burn, which led to an amputation of his leg, Chen
volunteered to tutor the student at his home for several months. Afterwards, the
student passed the tests to enter NTU's graduate school of law and passed the
national lawyer examination as a top scorer.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the ceremony, NTU President Lee Si-chen expressed hope that the
professors can serve as examples to other lecturers.</P>
      <P>Lee encouraged all NTU lecturers to pay closer attention to and show greater
care for their students, in addition to simplifying their teaching methods.</P>

      <P>The Metal Industries Research and Development Center (MIRDC), a non-profit
organization, plans to help Taiwan's electronic  and auto parts industries
transform into value-added businesses, manufacturing novel materials instead of
depending on imports, the organization announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Co-operating with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the MIRDC said that it has
already fostered two novel industries -- "hyperfine pipeline material" and "roll
bonding material" -- which are expected to "reduce the import figure of
materials for the electronic and auto parts industries by NT$1.6 billion (US$5
million) , as well as mobilize  the upgrading  and transformation  of several
other traditional industries."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's electronic and auto parts industries have to import most of the
materials they need as the metal materials they use are mostly complex alloys of
which the technology to design and manufacture are in the hands of major
American  and Japanese companies,  the organization said, adding that other
materials such as metal fine wire and high purity fine wire and rods also have
to be imported.</P>
      <P>In order to cut operating costs and help these industries upgrade and transform,
the MIRDC has also developed several advanced manufacturing technologies such as
continued casting of fine material and roll bonding technology, according to the
organization.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT hopes to convene more legislative meetings to review bills</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is considering convening more legislative
floor meetings in addition to the regularly scheduled ones, prior to the March
22 presidential election, a KMT official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Yi-shih, a KMT legislator and executive director of the party's Policy
Committee, said the move is aimed at addressing public dissatisfaction over
stalled bills in recent years, adding that he supports "wasting no time" after
the legislature opens its first session on Feb. 22.</P>
      <P>In addition to Tuesday and Friday when the legislature regularly holds its floor
meetings, other weekdays and "even Saturday could be used to convene extra floor
meetings," Lin said.</P>
      <P>But the idea still awaits approval by the KMT caucus in the legislature, said
Lin.</P>
      <P>After the conveners of eight legislative committees are elected on March 3, the
legislature can start to review bills, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Another purpose of the KMT's proposed plan to work overtime now that it holds a
large majority in the legislature is to not give the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) any chance to complain about the KMT ahead of the
crucial presidential race.</P>
      <P>Lin accused the DPP of continuing to try to heap blame on the KMT for the
stalled bill review in order to cast the party in a negative light.</P>
      <P>For this reason, the KMT will shoulder its responsibility to "convene floor
meetings even seven days a week until the end of the March 22 presidential
election," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the previous legislature had left a large number of major bills
unattended to, he said that the newly elected legislature will need to "give the
legislature a new image so that the public will sense the efficiency of the new
legislature."</P>
      <P>He also said that the party will not rule out the possibility of publishing the
attendance rates of KMT caucus members and the number of them speaking in the
legislature, and even publish the progress of bills under review.</P>
      <P>Lin said this will show that the KMT, with 81 seats in the 113-member
legislature, is willing to serve as a "responsible" party.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) held a news conference Tuesday to honor
designers of a new Web site for winning prizes at an international competition
in San Francisco in January, and to celebrate the success of an incubation
program set up by the MOEA.</P>
      <P>The competition, called DEMO '08, is an annual conference that serves as a
launch platform for new products, technology and Web sites. It is held twice a
year, with one around February and the other in September. This year's first
competition was held from Jan. 28-30.</P>
      <P>The competition is organized by the International Data Group, the world's
leading technology media, research, and event company, now in its 18th year.
Famous online service companies such as Google and the Skype Group, as well as
Trend Micro Taiwan, an anti-virus software company, have all made presentations
for their products at the competition in the past.</P>
      <P>According to an MOEA official, the award-winning Web site, Atlaspost, won
DEMOgod Award--the jury's favorite--along with other 10 projects from foreign
teams. The Web site is an innovative map-based social network that lets users
network on a global map.</P>
      <P>Atlaspost also won the People's Choice Award, which was voted on by over 500
venture companies and more than 100 international media organizations. The award
was given to a non-American team for the first time.</P>
      <P>The Web site was established last April by brothers Jerry and Andy Kuo and has
over 150,000 visitors per day. Their awards have paved the way for raising
capital in the future, the official said.</P>
      <P>The designers said the capital will be used to promote the Web site's overseas
market, with numbers of members at the end of this year projected at 200,000 in
Taiwan and 500,000 in the United States.</P>
      <P>The team was among 12 Taiwanese Web site design groups that took part in DEMO
'08. It was the first time Taiwan had sent a delegation to DEMO.</P>
      <P>These groups are under an incubation program on Web 2.0, or next generation
network, a trend in which reciprocity between Web site providers and users is
emphasized.  The MOEA commissioned the Institute for Information Industry to
assist in the incubation program.</P>
      <P>A total of 77 teams were selected from among nearly 700 applications this year
to give presentations at the competition, including two Taiwanese teams
representing Atlaspost and Citiport, and DEMOgods awards were given to the
outstanding presentations. Taiwan was the only Asian country with teams selected
to give presentations, indicating the success of the incubation program, the
official said.</P>
      <P>The official said other Taiwanese teams such as Webi, VooEasy and Globeme also
won high evaluation from the jury and might win the chance to give presentations
at the DEMOfall '08 in September.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Preferential measure aims to lure traditional businesses back home</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan approved Wednesday the prolongation of a preferential measure
to help promote a three-year renovation plan for Taiwan's industrial zones to
help persuade Taiwan traditional businesses that have invested overseas to
return home, according to Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) Director-General
Chen Chao-yih.</P>
      <P>In line with the prolonged preferential measure, the Executive Yuan will
increase the level of available funds to about NT$20 billion (US$635 million) to
help carry out the plan until Dec. 31 this year, Chen told a news conference
after an Executive Yuan weekly meeting.</P>
      <P>Along with about NT$10 billion in funding left over from the first stage, the
Executive Yuan will earmark a total of NT$11.7 billion over the coming two
decades, or NT$600 million every year, to reach the NT$20 billion level, Chen
explained.</P>
      <P>The second-phase preferential measure is expected to attract NT$100 billion
worth of investment capital and generate tax revenue of some NT$1.8 billion per
year for the national coffers, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>The preferential measure allows companies to rent land free of charge in
Taiwan's industrial zones for the first two years and offers different levels of
discount on rentals starting from the third year.</P>
      <P>"The measure will be very helpful in wooing overseas Taiwanese enterprises --
most of which are traditional businesses -- to come back and invest in the
domestic market," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Concerning the industrial zones renewal plan, Chen said that such investment by
returning Taiwanese businessmen through cooperation with the central and local
governments will also help achieve the aim.</P>
      <P>"The IDB will select two industrial zones in the initial stage to gradually
implement the renovation plan through 2010," Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to the IDB chief,  of the 61 industrial  zones administered by his
bureau, 51 have been established for more than 20 years and most of them lack
sufficient infrastructure and day-to-day conveniences.</P>

      <P>Lin Hwai-min, founder and artistic director of Taiwan's celebrated Cloud Gate
Dance Theater, said Wednesday that although Monday's fire destroyed its
rehearsal studio, the group will not allow the tragedy to hold it back.</P>
      <P>Lin stressed that the 35-year-old Cloud Gate Dance will rise from the ashes to
"stage a comeback" and that the company will not delay the year's tour schedule.</P>
      <P>A fire destroyed the 1,324 square-meter  rehearsal studio, costumes, props and
production archives of the world-famous dance theater early Monday morning,
causing "immeasurable losses."</P>
      <P>Lin shared his favorite tea -- and the story behind its creation --  with
reporters  Wednesday afternoon while introducing  the organization's domestic
and foreign tour schedule in 2008.</P>
      <P>Taitea No. 18, also known as the "Red Jade, " is a kind of tea grown by Nantou
County's Yuchih Township, located in middle of Taiwan and a disaster area
suffered from the September 21 Earthquake in 1999.</P>
      <P>"People in Yuchih Township came through grief and applied their wisdom and
efforts to develop their own tea industry with local features. That is something
worth emulating by the Cloud Gate Dance Theatre," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin also mentioned that he happened to find and recover masks used in the
organization's 20 anniversary repertoire "Nine Songs, " from the fire scene.</P>
      <P>"Everybody was astonished seeing these masks intact as the box holding them was
destroyed, " he said, adding that "these masks will continue to fly on the
stage."</P>
      <P>Since the Cloud Gate Dance Theatre is slated for a series of performances in the
United States and Europe starting in April, Lin said the most urgent matter is
to find a place to rehearse their new work.</P>
      <P>"We are lucky to be allowed to rehearse in places provided by the Taipei
National University of the Arts and in the Shih-ming Hall of the Taiwan Cement
Building, " Lin said, adding that "we still need to find a permanent studio for
the long term."</P>
      <P>Lin said that he hopes to locate a suitable place before March.</P>
      <P>Sympathy has been expressed from all circles of Taiwanese society since the
fire, including presidential candidates, Frank Hsieh and Ma Ying-jeou, Taipei
Mayor Hau lung-bin, Taipei Country Magistrate Chou His-wei, as well as Hao Ming-
yi, chairman of the Locus publishing Company, and Jimmy Lia, Taiwan's famous
illustrator.</P>
      <P>Wang Touh, chairman of the Council for Cultural Affairs, was dispatched by
President Chen Shui-bian to provide assistance to this "national treasure" of
Taiwan. Wang promised to help the Cloud Gate find new rehearsal studio and
suggested establishing a disaster relief fund for art groups.</P>
      <P>The world-famous dance organization, know for blending Asian mythology, folklore
and aesthetics with a modern sensibility, was founded in 1973. Among its best
known works are "Nine Songs, "Moon Water" and the "Cursive"  trilogy  inspired
by Chinese brush calligraphy.</P>

create business opportunities and broaden the vision of Taiwanese but will also
encourage Taiwanese publishers to play a more important role in the world."</P>
      <P>Zhang Yin-tai was awarded in the category of fiction for her mystery story which
inspires a passion for the nature in its readers and which features a bear able

      <P>Chiang Hsun, a well-known writer in the field of esthetics, was awarded in the
non-fiction category. His book, titled "On Solitude," explores six different
types of solitude in modern society.</P>
      <P>The TIBE Prize, the first of its kind in the TIBE, is designed to "encourage
Taiwanese publishers and authors and to promote Taiwanese literature on the
international market," said TIBE Board Chairman Lin Tsai-chueh, who expressed
hope that the prize will become a focus of the annual exhibition, like the
prizes awarded at other major book fairs in Frankfurt, Leipzig and Bologna.</P>

      <P>An Iranian publisher of the only Middle Eastern  publishing  company  taking
part in the 2008 Taipei International Book Exhibition commended Taiwan's readers
Wednesday as "educated and civilized people", saying they are very interested in
Iranian books.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the first day of the book fair, Farideh Khalatbaree, chairman and
managing director of Shabaviz Publishing Company, said when Taiwanese see the
books from Iran, "they are shouting and screaming and I can see their
excitement."</P>
      <P>Although the books, all of which are illustrations for children, are written in
Farsi, the ancient Persian language widely spoken in Iran, Afghanistan,
Tajikistan, and the Pamir Mountain region, 4,000 titles displayed by the
Shabaviz received great attention from industry professionals on the first day
of the fair.</P>
      <P>Farideh  believes  that Iranian publications  can introduce Taiwanese readers to
a different culture. So far three Taiwan's publishers,  including the Joy
Enterprises  Organization,  have published Chinese version books of the Shabaviz
Publishing Company.</P>
      <P>Despite facing great competition with 360 foreign publishers as well as 332
local publishing houses, Farideh said confidently that "I have good things to
offer."</P>
      <P>"We publish children's books, and we think from children's (perspective)," she
stressed.</P>
      <P>The is the third year for the Shabaviz Publishing Company to participate in the
Taipei International Book Exhibition. Farideh said she hopes that through
frequent interactions with Taiwan's readers and publishers from the region, more
and more Taiwanese readers will appreciate the beauty and value of Iranian
publications.</P>
      <P>The 2008 Taipei International Book Exhibition opened Wednesday at the Taipei
World Trade Center and is expected to attract over 400, 000 visitors from around

      <P>The recent series of cold fronts that have swept Taiwan have caused a massive
fish die-off in Penghu County, resulting in losses of nearly NT$100 million for
the aquaculture industry in the outlying island county, a county official said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Numerous fish and fry -- apart from some freeze-resistant species -- cultivated
in net-cage fish farms around the county perished as a result of the cold. "The
damage is more serious than we expected, " said Cheng Ming-yuan, chief of the
county's Agriculture and Fisheries Bureau.</P>
      <P>Cobia, one of the most important species reared in the county because of its
high economic value, suffered the most severe damage, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>While the dead fish can still be eaten, the bureau has been in contact with the
frozen seafood industry to have the dead fish quickly frozen and sent to Taiwan
proper for further processing, Cheng noted.</P>
      <P>He added that the bureau is also making all-out efforts to rescue other at-risk
fish and deal with the aftermath in order to reduce losses.</P>
      <P>Cheng made the report while accompanying Legislator Lin Bing-kun, officials of
the Council of Agriculture's Fisheries Agency and the chief of a local
fishermen's association on an inspection tour of Hsiyu township, the worst-
affected area of the county.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that the Fisheries Agency raise the maximum amount of
compensation for damage caused by natural disaster from NT$150,000 to NT$500,000
and earmark an additional NT$18 million to subsidize fishermen to buy fry so
they can continue their business.</P>
      <P>Also expressing  his discontent  with existing compensation regulations, Lin
said that as fishery information such as stock levels and prices are listed and
made public, the Fisheries Agency should provide compensation for fishermen
based on the listing information rather than using households or acreages as a
basis for compensation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan draws attention in Tokyo's nanotechnology exhibition</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Feb. 13 (CNA)

(By Mike Chang and T.C. Jiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has drawn widespread attention from other countries as it showcases the
results of years of nanotechnology research and applications in an international
nanotechnology exhibition and conference that opened Wednesday in Tokyo, Japan.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, now in its seventh year and is the largest event of its kind,
will run through Feb. 15.</P>
      <P>Each year, Taiwan mainly sends its research institutes that are involved in a
national nanotechnology program to participate in the event, said Soong Ching-
tan, chief executive officer of Taiwan's national nanotechnology program.</P>
      <P>This year, Taiwanese participants also include government agencies,
universities, and companies.</P>
      <P>And the 25-booth theme hall Taiwan set up for this year's event is a relatively
large number compared with those set up by the other 22 countries, which took
part in the 520-booth exhibition.</P>
      <P>Nanotechnology attempts to change structures at the atomic level and could
assist industries to make new and better products as well as avoid animal
testing.</P>
      <P>Scientists around the world are trying to do research into how to apply the
technology for commercial use in various fields, including the cosmetics,
pharmaceutical and environmental industries.</P>
      <P>This year, Taiwan's hall stands near that of the United Kingdom, Germany,
Sweden, and South Korea, offering Taiwan exhibitors a good opportunity to
introduce to them Taiwan's latest research results in the field and to learn
about these countries' developments, Soong noted.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan will look for opportunities to establish exchanges and
collaboration with many countries at the exhibition, Soong added.</P>
      <P>According to Soong, Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) has
greatly assisted Taiwan's traditional industry and opto-electronics industry to
develop value-added services through the application of nanotechnology.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Soong pointed out that the Taiwan government has begun to implement a
six-year nanotechnology program in 2003, which he said has achieved fruitful
results.</P>
      <P>For her part, Su Tsung-tsan, head of the ITRI's Nanotechnology Research Center,
said that at the exhibition, Taiwan is displaying the results of its efforts to
apply nanotechnology to daily life in the hope that it can get a share of the
Japanese market.</P>
      <P>Su noted that Taiwan's efforts to industrialize nanotechnology has won global
recognition and that the exhibition will further help other countries understand
Taiwan's basic research efforts in the field.</P>
      <P>Su added that the national program has effectively boosted the research and
development of nanotechnology in Taiwan, citing as examples a rising number of
research papers published by Taiwanese scholars on the new technology over the
years and an increasing amount of investment made by Taiwanese companies in the
technology.</P>
      <P>Wu Tzong-ming, a professor of National Chung Hsing University who introduces
Taiwan's  nanotechnology  training  program  at the exhibition, said that Taiwan
has a good model of educating young students about nanotechnology, which only
developed within the past few years.</P>
      <P>Exhibitors from Japan, South Korea, and Thailand have all expressed strong
interest in Taiwan's educational program that have successfully  raised primary
and junior high school students' awareness of nanotechnology, Wu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Number of outbound Taiwanese during Chinese New Year holiday down</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of outbound Taiwanese passengers during this year's Chinese New Year
holiday was down by an average of between 10 percent and 15 percent compared
with last year, the National Immigration Agency (NIA) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to NIA statistics, the number of people entering and leaving Taiwan
totaled 385,829 during the Feb. 6-11 Chinese New Year holiday this year, with
the number of people leaving Taiwan during the period totaling 193,223.</P>
      <P>During the last Chinese New Year, which ran from Feb. 17-25, the number of
people leaving and entering Taiwan totaled 403,187, with the number leaving
Taiwan totaling 240,248. That translates to nearly 10,000 fewer outbound
passengers per day during this year's holiday.</P>
      <P>Tourism and aviation operators attributed the decrease mainly to the weather,
noting that major tourism destinations for Taiwanese in the past -- such as
China, Japan and South Korea -- were suffering cold spells, with China struck by
its worst snowstorms in years.</P>
      <P>Nearly 10,000 people who had planned to travel overseas for sightseeing canceled
their trips. This, coupled with family members of China-based Taiwanese
businessmen who dropped plans to travel to China, also contributed to the
decrease.</P>
      <P>The fact that the new school semester opened right after the holiday, along with
the shorter length of this year's holiday, also dampened many people's interest
in making a family trip.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the performance of the stock market in January was dismal, causing
still more people to cancel their travel plans.</P>

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung called Wednesday for a central government-level anti-
corruption unit to be set up soon in order to effectively wipe out graft and
build clean and efficient governance in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang made the call during the weekly Cabinet meeting, in which the Executive
Yuan approved a package of draft amendments, including one to set up an anti-
corruption bureau under the Ministry of Justice.</P>
      <P>"The public and all political parties are keen to see an anti-corruption bureau
established in the central government, as several high-profile corruption
scandals which occurred in recent years have seriously tainted the government's
image and its credibility," Chang said.</P>
      <P>The premier expressed hope that the newly elected Legislative Yuan could pass
the draft amendment concerning setting up the central anti-corruption bureau as
soon as possible after it opens its first session later this month.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, similar bills failed to clear the legislative floors in
2000, 2002 and 2005, due to the adjournment of the legislative sessions.</P>
      <P>Combating corruption is one the major concerns for Taiwan's voters in this
election year, with presidential candidates of both the ruling and opposition
camps proclaiming that they will try to root out graft if elected in the March
22 race.</P>

elections filed a suit against his winning rival Wednesday to invalidate his
electoral victory.</P>
      <P>Wu Cherng-dean, a two-time legislator of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
who lost in his re-election bid to Chen Fu-hai by a mere 74 votes, said he
decided to take the legal action after the Kinmen Prosecutors Office indicted
Chen on charges of alleged vote-buying during the campaign period.</P>
      <P>Chen protested that he had engaged in a clean campaign and said that his
indictment was only a result of different views on the part of the prosecutors.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH), alerted by a measles epidemic in Japan, advised
travelers Wednesday not to take infants under 12 months old to that country, or,
if they must, to have their infants inoculated against the disease.</P>
      <P>According to Japan's National Institute of Infectious Diseases, reports from
hospitals and medical clinics around Japan show that as of Feb. 3 this year,
1,164 people have been infected with measles, mostly in and around Tokyo.</P>
      <P>The second largest group was found in Fukuoka Prefecture, followed by a group in
Hokkaido.</P>
      <P>Lin Ting, deputy director-general of the DOH Center for Disease Control, said
they are monitoring the developing epidemic in the neighboring country, but
believe that most Taiwanese people above one year of age should enjoy immunity
against the disease.</P>
      <P>Citing Taiwan's inoculation system, Lin explained that Taiwan began to carry out
mandatory inoculation against measles in 1978. Since 1992, all children have
been inoculated with two doses of MMR, a combined vaccine for rubella, measles
and mumps, he noted.</P>
      <P>Lin went on that more than 95 percent of local people under the age of 31 have
been inoculated.</P>
      <P>In comparison, Lin said Japan has adopted a more "conservative" policy in the
inoculation, with people "recommended, " instead "obliged," to be inoculated
against measles.</P>
      <P>Japan also provided only one shot of MMR until April 2006, Lin said, adding that
the practice was widely considered a major factor contributing to the epidemic
in eastern Japan last year.</P>
      <P>Symptoms of measles include fever, coughing, runny nose and conjunctivitis.
Patients are prone to otitis media, pneumonia and encephalitis, according to
Lin.</P>
      <P>According to the original CDC-recommended immunization schedule for infants in
Taiwan, children at or above the age of 12 months should receive a chicken pox
vaccine, and those at or above 15 months should receive a MMR vaccine.</P>
      <P>On that basis, Lin suggested that parents of infants under one year old not
travel with their children to Japan. If they must travel, he advised those with
infants above nine months old take one shot of MMR vaccine two weeks before
traveling to Japan, to allow the body time to develop immunity.</P>

      <P>The government may ease restrictions on the entry of Chinese citizens for
medical purposes, an official of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning
and Development (CEPD) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According  to the  official,  the government  launched  an experimental program
last July for foreign nationals to apply for medical visas in an effort to speed
up the globalization of Taiwan's medical services industry. Chinese citizens are
also eligible to apply for such visas on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>As of the end of last year, the official said, 50 foreign and seven Chinese
passport holders had applied for visas for medical purposes.</P>
      <P>The seven Chinese applicants intended to visit Taiwan to receive various kinds
of medical treatment, including live liver transplants, joint replacement,
cochlear implants and treatment for post-cervical surgery complications and
osteogenesis imperfecta, also known as brittle bone disease, the official said.</P>
      <P>So far, only four of the Chinese applicants have actually come to Taiwan, the
official said, adding that two have completed medical treatment.</P>
      <P>Under current regulations, only Chinese citizens who fall victim to diseases
that China cannot treat will be allowed to come to Taiwan for treatment.</P>
      <P>Noting that this restriction might have discouraged prospective medical visitors
from China, the official said the CEPD will invite representatives from other
relevant government agencies, including the Mainland affairs Council and the
Department of Health, to discuss the feasibility of canceling or revising this
regulation so that more Chinese people will be able to enter Taiwan for medical
treatment.</P>
      <P>"As China could be a major source of medical visitors to Taiwan, we belive that
easing restrictions on Chinese applicants will help facilitate the expansion of
Taiwan's medical services industry, " the official added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Travelers advised to be on guard against measles epidemic in Japan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 13 (CNA)
02/14/08  10:34:24
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH), alerted by a measles epidemic in Japan, advised
travelers Wednesday not to take infants under 12 months old to that country, or,
if they must, to have their infants inoculated against the disease.</P>
      <P>According to Japan's National Institute of Infectious Diseases, reports from
hospitals and medical clinics around Japan show that as of Feb. 3 this year,
1,164 people have been infected with measles, mostly in and around Tokyo.</P>
      <P>The second largest group was found in Fukuoka Prefecture, followed by a group in
Hokkaido.</P>
      <P>Lin Ting, deputy director-general of the DOH Center for Disease Control, said
they are monitoring the developing epidemic in the neighboring country, but
believe that most Taiwanese people above one year of age should enjoy immunity
against the disease.</P>
      <P>Citing Taiwan's inoculation system, Lin explained that Taiwan began to carry out
mandatory inoculation against measles in 1978. Since 1992, all children have
been inoculated with two doses of MMR, a combined vaccine for rubella, measles
and mumps, he noted.</P>
      <P>Lin went on that more than 95 percent of local people under the age of 31 have
been inoculated.</P>
      <P>In comparison, Lin said Japan has adopted a more "conservative" policy in the
inoculation, with people "recommended, " instead "obliged," to be inoculated
against measles.</P>
      <P>Japan also provided only one shot of MMR until April 2006, Lin said, adding that
the practice was widely considered a major factor contributing to the epidemic
in eastern Japan last year.</P>
      <P>Symptoms of measles include fever, coughing, runny nose and conjunctivitis.
Patients are prone to otitis media, pneumonia and encephalitis, according to
Lin.</P>
      <P>According to the original CDC-recommended immunization schedule for infants in
Taiwan, children at or above the age of 12 months should receive a chicken pox
vaccine, and those at or above 15 months should receive a MMR vaccine.</P>
      <P>On that basis, Lin suggested that parents of infants under one year old not
travel with their children to Japan. If they must travel, he advised those with
infants above nine months old take one shot of MMR vaccine two weeks before
traveling to Japan, to allow the body time to develop immunity.</P>

    <TEXT>Today is Thursday, Feb. 14, or the eighth day of the first month of the Year of
the Rat according to the lunar calendar. Following is a list of important events
that have occurred on this date in the past:

1766: Thomas R. Malthus, the British economist who wrote "An Essay on the
Principle of Population," is born. His 1798 work argues that populations tend to
increase faster than food supplies unless the increase is checked by moral
restraints or by war, famine, or disease.

1779: Captain James Cook, the British navigator and explorer who commanded three
major voyages of "discovery," charting and "naming" many islands in the Pacific
Ocean, is killed by a native's spear in Hawaii.

1797: British naval forces under Admiral John Jervis and Captain Horatio Nelson
defeat the Spanish fleet off Portugal's Cape St. Vincent.

1859: Oregon becomes the 33rd state of the United States.

1893: Hawaii is annexed to the United States by a treaty.

of a company that later becomes International Business Machines Corporation
(IBM).

1933: The League of Nations refuses to recognize the Japanese puppet regime
known as "Manchukuo." To deflect world condemnation of their hegemony, the
Japanese invaders of northern China installed the Manchukuo regime in 1932. This
"land of the Manchu" proved to be no more than another stepping stone for the
extension of Japanese aggression.

1939: The German battleship Bismarck is launched.

1950: The Chinese communist regime and the Soviet Union sign the "Sino-Soviet
Friendly Alliance and Mutual Assistance Treaty" in Moscow.

1956: Soviet President Nikita Khrushchev denounces the policies of Joseph Stalin
at the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party.

1962: General Hu Chung-nan, strategic adviser to President Chiang Kai-shek, dies
in Taipei at the age of 68.

1972: Mexico establishes diplomatic relations with mainland China.

1972: The Soviet Union launches its Luna 20 spacecraft to the moon.

1972: Washington relaxes trade restrictions against Beijing, putting it on the
same basis as Moscow.

1973: Walter Benche Medina, newly-appointed ambassador of El Salvador, arrives
in Taipei to assume his post.

1974: A six-member Jordanian trade mission led by S.A. Matouk, president of the
Amman Chamber of Commerce, arrives in Taipei for a weeklong visit.

1974: Commissioner W. Stanley Cottrill, international secretary of the Salvation
Army International Headquarters, leaves Taipei after a three-day visit.

1975: The Marinas Islands in the Pacific becomes a territory of the United
States.

1977: Shih Wei-liang, a noted Republic of China musician, dies in Taipei at the
age of 54.

1989: Ayatollah Khomeini, Iran's religious leader, issues a "fatwa," or death
sentence, against British writer Salman Rushdie for what he deemed to be
blasphemy in the author's book "The Satanic Verses," sending him into years of
hiding.

1999: Former Nixon White House aide John Ehrlichman dies at the age of 73. He
served 18 months in prison for his role in the Watergate cover-up.

2000: President Lee Teng-hui confers the Order of the Brilliant Star with Grand
Cordon on Cor Boonstra, president of Royal Philips Electronics, in recognition
of his company's contribution to Taiwan's economic development.

2000: Democratic Progressive Party presidential candidate Chen Shui-bian says
that he will visit Beijing and invite mainland Chinese leaders to visit Taipei
if he wins the March 18 election.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "Earnestness without judgment becomes pedantry;
caution without judgment becomes timidity; courage without judgment leads to
crime; uprightness without judgment makes men tyrannical."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Companies in the United States and Britain are trying to blunt Cupid's arrows by
imposing "love contracts" on office love affairs, though the idea appears
undesirable among workers in Taiwan, according to the results of a survey
released Thursday to mark Valentine's Day.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the online employment service provider 1111 Job Bank
among 1,403 office workers, revealed that 70.42 percent of respondents oppose
the signing of "love contracts," mainly because they think such a move is
meaningless and that it is improper to make relationships "contractual".</P>
      <P>The "consensual relationship agreements" were first introduced in the United
States to protect companies from sexual harassment suits should an office
romance end badly. Such agreements have become more and more common in British
workplaces in recent years,  with approximately one-quarter of U.K. corporations
requiring that their staff sign the documents, according to foreign media
reports.</P>
      <P>In addition to setting the ground rules for office behavior, such agreements
also require workers to disclose any romantic relations with colleagues to
confirm that the relationship is voluntary, the reports said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan survey found that only 3 percent of respondents work for a company
where office affairs are strictly prohibited.</P>
      <P>Among respondents who have dated a co-worker, 66.8 percent did not make the
affair public because they did not want to become a subject for gossip.</P>
      <P>In the event of a breakdown of an office relationship, 56 percent of respondents
said they would quit or move to another department to avoid embarrassment.</P>
      <P>A total of 51.39 percent of respondents agreed that the neglect of work is the
most negative  effect of office romances  on corporations, and 67 percent
admitted that office relationships undermined their job performance.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The greater number of tourists traveling between Taiwan and Japan in 2007
indicates that bilateral exchanges are growing ever closer, an official of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the MOFA's regularly scheduled press briefing, Peter Tsai, deputy
executive director of the ministry's Committee on Japanese Affairs, said that in
2007 the number of travelers between Taiwan and Japan reached 2.545 million --
1,165,000 going from Taiwan to Japan, and 1,380,000 passing in the other
direction.</P>
      <P>Both numbers were up slightly over the 2006 totals, with an additional 5,000
Taiwanese tourists and 170,000 Japanese travelers, respectively, he said, adding
that these statistics, which were released  by Taiwan's  Tourism  Bureau under
the Ministry  of Transportation  and Communications  and Japan National  Tourist
Organization, are relatively accurate.</P>
      <P>"Bilateral exchanges between the two countries are believed to be occurring even
more frequently this year, " Tsai said, as by mid-February there have been 13
civil and government groups visiting their counterparts.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that among the 8,340,000 travelers and the NT$1 trillion (US$31.6
billion) in tourism income Japan received in 2007, Taiwanese tourists alone
contributed NT$300 billion.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese tourists are very generous and usually spend a lot because they enjoy
the kindness of the Japanese people and appreciate made in Japan products," Tsai
said.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the MOFA has extended the visa-free period for Japanese
tourists to stay from 30 to 90 days in hopes of attracting more Japanese to
visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Japan are among each other's  favorite  travel destinations. Citizens
of the two countries can travel without visas between the two, and an accord was
signed last August for mutual recognition of the driver's license issued by the
other's government.</P>

      <P>A recent incident involving contaminated dumplings in Japan has proven that the
two countries' food safety notification mechanisms work well, an official of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Peter Tsai, deputy executive director of the ministry's Committee on Japanese
Affairs, said that after the food scare involving contaminated dumplings
imported from China by Japan's Mitsuke Co. was exposed, Japan's Interchange
Association Taipei Office immediately notified the MOFA to inform them that
Taiwan may have, in turn, imported the toxic dumplings from Japan.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan and Japan have established a very good notification mechanism to ensure
the safety of food for both countries' citizens," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Some 48 packages of dumplings from the company in question were imported last
October and sold at a food fair in Taipei's SOGO Department. However, these were
manufactured at a different time from the problematic dumplings in Japan and no
one was reported ill. .</P>
      <P>The contaminated food has caused at least 2,000 people in 46 prefectures to fall
ill after eating the pesticide-contaminated dumplings from Tianyan Food in
China's Hebei Province.</P>
      <P>Japan relies on imports for 60 percent of its food supply, with China being the
country's largest source of food imports.</P>

      <P>Two civic leaders asked for the opportunity to speak out against two referendums
on Taiwan's bid for U.N. membership in public debates Thursday, the deadline set
by the Central Election Commission (CEC) for such requests.</P>
      <P>Wu Jung-yuan, chairman of the little-known Labor Party, and Huang Kuang-kuo,
convener of the Democratic Action Alliance, filed an application with the
commission for a chance to air their views in opposition to the referendums in
five televised debates organized by the CEC between Feb. 27 and March 8.</P>
      <P>The two referendums, which will be held alongside the March 22 presidential
election, include one initiated by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
to join the United Nations under the name of Taiwan, and another initiated by
the Kuomintang (KMT) on returning to the world body under the nation's official
name, the Republic of China, or any other practical names.</P>
      <P>Wu  and  Huang  called  themselves  representatives  of an Anti-Referendum-
to-U.N. Alliance formed last year by 10 civic groups.</P>
      <P>After filing their applications, the two and their followers unfurled banners
reading "Oppose referendum on U.N. bid and say no to referendum ballots, " and
"Oppose using referendums to disrupt election."</P>
      <P>They urged the public not to claim referendum ballots next month, saying that
the two referendums are "fake issues" manipulated by the DPP and the KMT in the
hope of boosting support for their respective parties in the upcoming election.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the referendums have not been accepted by the international
community, noting that the United States said the referendum on the U.N. bid is
causing unnecessary provocation and tension.</P>
      <P>Huang said "political figures have manipulated the referendums for political
gains."</P>
      <P>"Both Wu and I are ready for the debates, and the DPP and the KMT have to make
clear their stance on referendums, " he continued. Huang will represent  the
opposite  views only to the DPP-initiated referendum,  while Wu will represent
those opposing  to both referendums.</P>
      <P>The CEC will sponsor five presentations or debates for the referendums, which
will be held Feb. 27, March 1, 2, 5 and 8, respectively.</P>
      <P>CEC officials have said that the leading initiators of the two referendums will
argue in favor of their proposals, while the Legislative Yuan, the Executive
Yuan and civic groups may represent the opposite view.</P>
      <P>Those who are interested in becoming representatives of the side opposed to the
referendum should apply to the CEC before Feb. 14, they said. So far, the
Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan have not applied to the CEC to represent
the opposite view, and the alliance is the only civic group to do so.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has set 2008 as a year in which it will promote the globalization
of Taiwan's medical services, as the level of its medical care is competitive
with that available worldwide, a Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's medical industry has tremendous potential given its competitive prices
and service quality, " the official said, adding that the island's medical
service sector is playing a leading role in Asia.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital,
during the period 1997-2005, the five-year survival rate following liver
transplantation in Taiwan was 90 percent, far outstripping the 60 percent
registered in the United States.</P>
      <P>In addition, a surgical team from National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) has
helped a Vietnamese hospital in completing that country's first successful adult
liver transplant from living donor last month, reflecting Taiwan's standard of
medical care.</P>
      <P>However, "there have been only 50 visa applications with Taiwan's representative
offices abroad for medical care in the country since the Cabinet first presented
its flagship plan for the globalization of medical services in the second half
of last year, " the official said.</P>
      <P>To further elevate Taiwan's image of providing a high level of medical care, the
CEPD will offer subsidies for the Department of Health (DOH) to publish a book
to help local hospitals organize service packages to attract foreign patients.</P>
      <P>The DOH is also soliciting support from the Overseas Compatriot Affairs
Commission  to use the cultural  centers of Taiwan's representative offices
abroad as medical consultation centers.</P>

      <P>Members of the "Anti-Referendum-to-U.N. Alliance" headed to the Kuomintang's
(KMT's) headquarters in Taipei City Thursday to petition the main opposition
party to support their cause.</P>
      <P>Carrying banners and placards bearing such slogans as "Boycott the Referendum"
and "Vote for Democracy, Replace the Government," the alliance members urged the
KMT to show courage by openly opposing the U.N. bid referendums to be held
alongside the Mar. 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>On Feb. 1, the Central Election Commission announced that two referendums -- one
initiated by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on the country
applying to join the United Nations under the name "Taiwan," and the other
launched by the KMT on "The Republic of China" applying to return to the world
body -- would be held in tandem with the presidential poll.</P>
      <P>In a press statement released Thursday, the alliance pointed out that the KMT
has an overwhelming majority in the new legislature, and calling on the party to
"not be kidnapped by the DPP's deceptive U.N.-bid referendum trick" and to
"uphold the hope of Taiwan's people of living and working in peace."</P>
      <P>The alliance urged the KMT to "not succumb to the DPP's spell" and to show
wisdom and courage by boycotting the referendums and "casting a ballot for
democracy and rescuing the economy for the Taiwan people."</P>
      <P>Tu Chien-teh, vice chairman of the KMT's Organization and Development Committee,
who greeted the alliance members and accepted their petition, said that the KMT
has "heard their voice, " adding that he would ask the party's high-ranking
members to issue a clear and definite decision on the referendum  after
assessing  the situation.</P>
      <P>Many observers  view the DPP's move to hold the U.N.-bid referendum alongside
the presidential election as a bid to garner more votes for its candidate, Frank
Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Tu told the alliance members that KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung met with President
Chen Shui-bian shortly after the Jan. 22 legislative elections and expressed to
the president his concerns over the referendum issue as well as the importance
of the CEC remaining impartial.</P>
      <P>Tu echoed the KMT chairman's words, uttered earlier this month, that the KMT is
not opposed to the holding of referendums, but rather to "hijacking elections
with referendums."</P>
      <P>Also earlier this month, KMT legislative caucus whip Kuo Su-chun said the party
was in the process of mapping out countermeasures to the CEC's move to hold the
referendums and presidential poll together and that it would make a final
decision on the matter before the first session of the new legislature opens
Feb. 22.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cardinal Tien Hospital Yung Ho Branch and Taipei Fubon Bank Charitable
Foundation are teaming up to provide remote health monitoring services for 60
middle or low-income seniors living alone in the Greater Taipei Region.</P>
      <P>According to Interior Ministry figures, there are over 320,000 seniors living
alone in Taiwan, with over half of them suffering from ailments that limit their
ability to care for themselves.</P>
      <P>Many of these seniors pass away alone in their homes without anyone discovering
their bodies for several days after they have died, indicating that the
country's care system is inadequate.</P>
      <P>To help address the problem, the Cardinal Tien Hospital Yung Ho Branch and
Taipei Fubon Bank Charitable Foundation have decided to cooperate to fund a
remote health monitoring system for poor elderly citizens living alone.</P>
      <P>Two communities will be selected under the program, with the homes of 30 low-
income seniors in each community to be fitted with medical equipment to monitor
their health via the Internet.</P>
      <P>Health monitoring equipment will also be set up at two community centers in the
selected areas for seniors to receive health checkups.</P>
      <P>Under the program, doctors, nurses, nutritionists, physical therapists, social
workers and pharmacists will be on hand to provide 24-hour health services to
the seniors.</P>
      <P>The Cardinal Tien Hospital Yung Ho Branch and the Taipei Fubon Bank Charitable
Foundation will provide subsidies to allow the 60 seniors to take part in the
program free of charge.</P>
      <P>The hospital and foundation said they are making the move in hopes that other
businesses will follow suit by offering funds to help provide health monitoring
services to elderly people living alone.</P>
      <P>Hospital officials said that anyone over 65 years of age living on a low income
or suffering from a chronic disease can apply to join the program.</P>
      <P>They further said the hospital will assist those who are not selected for the
program by finding alternative funding from social welfare organizations.</P>
      <P>Teng Shi-hsiung, head of the Cardinal Tien Hospital Yung Ho Branch, said that
the program will not only help disadvantaged seniors living alone, it will also
be of benefit to seniors living with relatives who work during the day and are
unable to care for them.</P>
      <P>The health care management program's monitoring system will help these families
keep on top of the health condition of their elderly loved ones without having
to worry, Teng said.</P>
      <P>Those interested in applying to join the program can contact the Cardinal Tien
Hospital Yung Ho Branch at (02)-2982-6060, ext. 20755, or visit the hospital's
Web site at org.tw/news.act/act970124.htm for an application form.</P>

      <P>Traveling overseas with one's lover is the Valentine's gift most desired by
large numbers of Taiwan's consumers, but few are actually planning to spend much
money celebrating the occasion, according to the results of a survey released
Thursday to mark Valentine's Day.</P>
      <P>The survey revealed that overseas travel was cited by 31.2 percent of
respondents as the Valentine's Day gift they most wished to receive, followed by
a date with a dream lover, mentioned by 19.5 percent of respondents, and a
romantic dinner, favored by 17 percent of respondents.</P>
      <P>However, when asked how they planned to celebrate the day, a majority -- 39
percent -- of respondents said they will simply have an intimate dinner.</P>
      <P>While 24.2 percent of respondents will buy something as a gift for their lovers,
18.5 percent will stay home to enjoy time alone with each other. Another 17
percent of respondents said that they will not celebrate in any way.</P>
      <P>The survey found that the respondents planned to spend an average of NT$2,050
celebrating Valentine's Day.</P>
      <P>By gender, men seem to be more generous than women in terms of Valentine's Day
spending, with men planning to spending NT$2,478 on average, compared with the
average of NT$1,639 among women.</P>
      <P>Compared with 25.2 percent of respondents planning to spend no more than
NT$1,000 on Valentine's Day celebration, 18.9 percent plan to spend over
NT$3,000 and 9.4 percent plan to celebrate the occasion in creative ways that do
not require money.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted Jan. 16-22 among 3,074 consumers by MiniJob.com.tw, an
employment brokerage Web site launched by 104 Job Bank to serve small- and
medium-sized businesses. It has a margin of error of 1.77 percent.</P>

      <P>A special center aimed at helping Taiwanese students in the United States find
jobs was officially opened Wednesday by the Cultural Division of the Taipei

      <P>Taiwan-based China Steel Corp. (CSC), in which the government has a stake of
more than 20 percent, will push for the establishment of a research and
development alliance with local companies to enhance the competitiveness of the
country's steel industry, a company spokesman said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The announcement comes as Taiwan's steel industry faces strong, low-cost rivals
from China, India, and the Southeast Asia, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>To stand out among the competition, Taiwan's steel industry must upgrade its
technologies and the quality of their products, the spokesman noted.</P>
      <P>In addition, the industry needs to create more added value to differentiate
itself  from an increasing  number  of low-cost competitors in the market, the
spokesman went on.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, Taiwan's steel-related industries are supported by
many small and medium enterprises, which lack the resources to develop basic
research abilities and expand their production scale.</P>
      <P>These enterprises do not have the ability to enter the supply chains of
international  companies or increase their marketing channels, the spokesman
said.</P>
      <P>As the leading company in the local steel industry, China Steel Corp. --
headquartered in the southern port city of Kaohsiung -- has decided to
collaborate with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Metal Industries
Research and Development Center to promote the alliance project, the spokesman
pointed out.</P>
      <P>The project  will focus  on developing  new products  and technologies to boost
the production of high-grade steel,  he remarked.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan produces some 3.5 million metric tons of high-grade steel
every year.</P>
      <P>China Steel Corp. aims to raise production to over 4.6 million metric tons by
2012, which the company predicts will help increase the production value of
Taiwan's steel-related industries by more than NT$300 billion (US$ 9.5 billion)
annually.</P>

      <P>The Consumers Foundation (CF) said Thursday that counterfeit sea cucumber, a
popular Chinese delicacy, was reported in traditional marketplaces and even a
noted hypermarket.</P>
      <P>Foundation officials questioned whether the RT-Mart, the nation's second-largest
hypermarket operator, has been involved in cheating consumers, although the
latter said it was a victim itself.</P>
      <P>CF officials noted that consumers had recently complained to the Taipei County
government that they bought counterfeit sea cucumber for NT$460 per kilo in a
traditional marketplace.</P>
      <P>They then received complaints from consumers that they bought counterfeit sea
cucumber from the RT-Mart.</P>
      <P>The consumers told the CF officials that they bought the sea cucumber at NT$700
(US$21.87) per kilo from RT-Mart's Chunglun outlet in downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>The officials said genuine sea cucumber normally sells for around NT$1,000 per
kilo. The RT-Mart, selling the substandard sea cucumber at a price higher than
that sold in the traditional marketplaces, could mislead the consumers into
thinking that they were purchasing the genuine product.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the RT-Mart "has failed to do its share" to safeguard
the quality of its products, and that such dishonesty could make officials
subject to imprisonment or fines.</P>
      <P>An RT-Mart executive said the company will get to the bottom of the substandard
products and compensate the consumers.</P>
      <P>The executive condemned the provider of the "kongyaku jelly" sea cucumber,
saying that it will no longer do business with the supplier in question.</P>

      <P>The Chinese Taipei Billiards and Snooker Association -- Taiwan's umbrella
organization for billiards -- will work to make the game a must-have event at
Taiwan's three major athletic games, the top executive of the association said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Tu Yung-hui, president of the association, told reporters that a meeting of the
association's Board of Directors and the Board of Supervisors earlier this week
had reached a consensus that the three billiard sports -- carom, pool and
snooker -- should be included in the National Athletic Games, the National
College Games and the National High School Athletic Games.</P>
      <P>Tu said the association will make a formal request to the Cabinet-level National
Council on Physical Fitness and Sports to realize this goal.</P>
      <P>He said that billiards has long been neglected in Taiwan, as all of the athletic
events have placed it in the optional category.</P>
      <P>Tu also said that his association will hire a carom coach and a snooker coach
from abroad to help train Taiwan's billiard players for the 2009 World Games to
be held in the southern Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Billiards made its debut at the 2001 World Games in Akita, Japan. The 2009 World
Games in Kaohsiung will feature billiards for the third consecutive time. It is
expected to draw record crowds to watch the world's best players in action.</P>
      <P>Pool enjoys enormous popularity in Taiwan, and quite a few Taiwanese
professional pool players, both men and women, have achieved celebrity status by
participating in world tournaments.</P>
      <P>Carom, pool and snooker are all derived from the same game, but have developed
distinct identities, with each having its own rules and world governing body.</P>
      <P>Billiards are played in about 150 countries, with the number of registered
players estimated at more than 100 million. The games' world tournaments enjoy a
broad based, global television audience.</P>

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung confirmed Thursday that a defense company has been
established with investment from various government agencies and state-owned
corporations, but stressed that it was a private company.</P>
      <P>Chang confirmed a local newspaper report about the company named "Taiwan Goal"
on the sidelines of a Lunar New Year meeting with China-based Taiwanese business
people, but did not elaborate on the company's objectives.</P>
      <P>The Chinese-language China Times reported Thursday that Taiwan Goal, charged
with integrating local and international military equipment manufacturers and
various military services, has been established and that Wu Nai-jen has been
named as president.</P>
      <P>Also on Thursday, National Defense Minister Lee Tien-yu said that an investment
of 45 percent of the initial Taiwan Goal's capital came from the Ministry of
National Defense (MND), adding that the MND will hold a press conference Friday
to elaborate on the functions of the company.</P>
      <P>Wu Nai-jen said in a statement issued Thursday that Taiwan Goal was established
as a platform to integrate international military equipment suppliers and
competent local companies to work on military system maintenance and components
manufacture.</P>
      <P>Wu said he took the role as a voluntary president without compensation, adding
that he will resign after the next president is inaugurated May 20. He went on
to say that Taiwan Goal will not be able to sign any contracts before May 20.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cruise tourist arrivals in 2007 hit nearly five-year high</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of tourist arrivals aboard cruise liners calling at Taiwan's
international ports hit a nearly five-year high of more than 426,000 last year,
the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the most recent statistics compiled by the MOTC, the 2007 figure
marked an increase of about 111,000 over the 2006 level, or a 35.3 percent
growth year on year.</P>
      <P>MOTC officials predicted that the number for 2008 will further climb as Taiwan's
international ports will step up efforts to attract more arrivals. For instance,
Hualien Port in eastern Taiwan is making efforts in this regard, they noted.</P>
      <P>Last year, Keelung Port in northern Taiwan saw the largest number of 272,000
cruise liner tourist arrivals, or 63.8 percent of the total.</P>
      <P>MOTC officials attributed the large growth at Keelung Port to the embarkation of
the Super Star Libra -- the leading cruise liner in the Asia-Pacific -- from
late June through November last year.</P>
      <P>According to Star Cruises officials, the company's cruises are slated to call at
Taiwanese ports this summer.</P>
      <P>The British-registered Rhapsody of the Seas was the most recent ocean liner to
visit Keelung, mooring for half a day Feb. 11 and for another half-day at
Kaohsiung Port in southern Taiwan the following day.</P>
      <P>There were more than 2,000 passengers aboard the cruise ship, nearly 700 of whom
were Chinese.</P>

      <P>Police in Yunlin County said Thursday that they caught 10 drug traffickers the
previous night in various southern counties in Taiwan, with four of the suspects
from the same family.</P>
      <P>The four men, led by a 49-year-old suspect named Lin Chien-hung, were uncle and
cousins, Yunlin County Police Station chief Tai Tien-yueh said.</P>
      <P>According to Tai, more than 60 policemen, tracking the suspects for more than
three months on a tip, rushed to 17 recreational spots and playgrounds in
Yunlin, Chiayi and Pingtung counties where they arrested the 10 men who were
caught trying to sell a variety of illegal narcotics to customers. One
accomplice is still at large, Tai added.</P>
      <P>Police officers also seized 459.2 grams of heroine, 56.8 grams of amphetamine,
0.68 grams of FM2, 0.4 grams of ecstasy powder and two electronic scales, as
well as small distribution bags and pipes for smoking marijuana or other drugs.</P>
      <P>Police  authorities  will continue  cracking  down on drug traffickers in their
current spring raid against drug-related crimes, as police records show that as
many as 85 percent of burglaries in Yunlin County were committed by repeat drug
addicts, Tai said. Many local farmers in the largely rural county therefore fell
victim to this type of crime, he noted.</P>
      <P>The 10 men have been turned over to the Yunlin Prosecutors Office for further
investigation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Researchers make breakthrough on key flat display component</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Researchers at the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) have
developed a new production technology involving flexible optical film, reducing
manufacturing costs by 50 percent and dependency on a key material monopolized
by Japanese enterprises, officials at the Hsinchu-based institute said Thursday.</P>
      <P>They explained that the flexible optical film is a key component in the
polarizer, protecting the panel-like unit by adhering to its surface, while a
polarizer is essential to controlling the light emitted by the flat panel
display.</P>
      <P>"However, the primary material for the protection film -- Triacetyl cellulose,
or TAC -- is monopolized by Japanese enterprises who hold the production and
related patents, " they continued, adding that the global production value of
TAC is expected to reach NT$47 billion (about US$1.48 billion).</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan is to upgrade and expand its FPD industry, we have to find the way
bypassing the TAC barrier and obtain self-sufficiency in upstream material and
component production, " they noted.</P>
      <P>To facilitate that goal, the Ministry of Economic Affairs commissioned the ITRI
to pursue refinements of the protective film's production processes; the new
flexible optical film was developed as a result of those refinements.</P>
      <P>ITRI experts in optoelectronics said the new techniques have lowered local
industry's dependence on TAC by combining a mixture of organic and inorganic
materials and new procedures to produce the flexible optical film.</P>
      <P>"The new film is better than TAC film in terms of hardness, moisture-resistance,
and stability in dimensions," they said.</P>
      <P>The new techniques can also provide a simpler, eco-friendly production process,
thus reducing production and capital costs, they pointed out, adding that the
cost of the new film is only half that of TAC film.</P>
      <P>According to ITRI, at least five patents are held by the institute  in related
fields and the technologies  have been transferred to a local manufacturer for
pilot production. ITRI estimated the annual production value of the new film
could reach NT$5 billion.</P>

      <P>Agricultural losses caused by the recent spate of cold weather have increased to
NT$113.65 million (US$3.55 million) across Taiwan, with crops and fish farms
suffering the greatest damage, according to the latest tallies released Thursday
by the Council of Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>That total covers NT$77.31 million in damage to cobia farmed in Paisha and Hsiyu
townships, Penghu County, affecting a total of 28.8 hectares of fish farms.</P>
      <P>Crop damage amounts to NT$36.34 million, mainly reported to have affected pear,
grape, peach and bell fruit crops planted in Yilan, Taichung, Kaohsiung and
Hsinchu Counties.</P>
      <P>A total of 197 hectares, or 32 percent of these counties' farmland, have been
damaged, with another 62 hectares of crops being entirely destroyed, according
to the COA.</P>
      <P>Also Thursday, an estimated 70,000 to 100,000 milkfish farmed in the coastal
townships of Taihsi and Mailiao in Yunlin County were killed by the cold
weather, fish farmers said.</P>
      <P>Most of the affected fish were raised in shallow ponds no deeper than one meter
that were designed for the cohabitation of milkfish and hard clams. These
shallow ponds tend to offer less protection against cold snaps, the farmers
said.</P>

      <P>Three hundred foreign dignitaries and students,  at the invitation  of the
Environmental  Protection Administration (EPA) , planted trees on Valentine's
Day Thursday to "show their love for nature and for Taiwan."</P>
      <P>In cold and rainy weather, the foreign residents participated in the activity
titled "Plant a Tree, Leave your Roots in Taiwan" organized by the EPA on the
Linkou campus of National Taiwan Normal University in Taipei County, as a symbol
of fighting against the effects of global warming.</P>
      <P>"I'm glad to plant a tree to enhance Taiwan's sustainable development and help
reduce air pollution, " said Ao Jallow, a 42-year-old student from Gambia.</P>
      <P>According to EPA calculations, the 300 saplings planted will have absorbed up to
360 tons of CO2 after two decades.</P>
      <P>But Taiwan is expected to do more. Guy Ledoux, head of the European Economic and
Trade Office, encouraged Taiwan to set a higher target of carbon reduction,
adding that the European Union has vowed to reduce carbon emissions in Europe by
20 percent by 2020.</P>
      <P>Excited to be participating in the activity, Low Sang Thoi from Singapore, said
she hopes to see more and more greenery in Taiwan, adding that "in Singapore,
the number of trees is double that of the population."</P>
      <P>The activity was not held on Valentine's Day by chance. The EPA launched the
slogan "leave roots in Taiwan" by inviting foreign residents to "turn their
personal love into love for the land." Each tree is tagged with the planter's
name, the planting date and the species name.</P>
      <P>"I'll remember that I have a baby tree in Taiwan, " said Santos Daniel from
Belize, who studies environmental sustainable development at National Central
University. Photos of the trees will be uploaded on the EPA Web site, as well as
other information, such as the quantity of CO2 absorbed and the carbon offset by
each tree.</P>
      <P>According to Santos, "planting a tree is a symbolic way of showing that humans
care for nature. But what is really important is to apply environmental
protection ideas to daily life."</P>

      <P>Noting that Taichung City always invites it sister cities to take part in its
big events or festivals, Hsiao said "this kind of cultural exchanges will help
strengthen ties between Taichung and its allies, making Taichung more
internationalized."</P>
      <P>As Taichung's sister cities are mostly located in America and Africa, Hsiao also
disclosed a future plan for the city to form sister city relationships with

      <P>Taiwan's top design center and government agency in charge of developing trade
will team up at the upcoming Taipei International Furniture Show to promote
local furniture designs infused with oriental and traditional art, in a bid to
revitalize Taiwan's ailing furniture industry.</P>
      <P>To help transform local furniture designs into better sales around the world,
the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) will cooperate with the
Taiwan Design Center (TDC) to hold a theme exhibition "Taiwan Design: Oriental
Attitude" during the four-day fair from Feb. 28 to March 2.</P>
      <P>The exhibition will display 29 Taiwanese artists' furniture works.</P>
      <P>Pai Teh-hsiung, a council official, told CNA Thursday that combining Taiwan's
local art and creative designs could be the key to popularizing Taiwan's
furniture goods worldwide.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's  furniture exports have been damaged by low-cost manufacturers in
China and Southeast Asian countries; therefore launching our own brands powered
by local creative designs could be a remedy to the slumping industry," Pai said.</P>
      <P>The design center, a non-official agency supported by the Industrial Development
Bureau under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, has been working with trade shows
to promote Taiwan's local creative power.</P>
      <P>A design center official who works on the furniture fair said it was important
to blend the unique mix of Taiwanese art into furniture products. He said that
at last year's Masion &amp; Objects, a Paris-based furniture trade show, the
locally-featured designs of Taiwan's glass products attracted many buyers.</P>
      <P>"The creative works in this year's main exhibition are inspired by Taiwan's
traditional (wooden) stools, of which you can only spot in the countryside
nowadays," he went on.</P>
      <P>In addition to the exhibition, the design center also organizes four seminars
during the four-day trade show to hold discussions about the industry's emerging
challenges,  including developing eco-friendly products and making brands that
cope with future lifestyles.</P>
      <P>The seminars will be convened by world-renowned designers and brand makers,
including a General Electric manager. The US- based company recently proposed a
plan, the Ecomagination, to further improve "green", or environmentally
friendly, designs with a more creative approach.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's furniture exports amounted to US$1.25 billion (NT$40 billion) in 2006,
posing only 0.44 percent in year-on-year growth, according to the Taiwan
Furniture Manufacturer Association.</P>
      <P>More than 270 domestic and foreign furniture manufacturers are expected to
participate in this year's trade show. The attendees will occupy about 1,100
booths, an increase from last year's 226 companies which filled 1,083 booths,

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged the Legislative Yuan Thursday to pass into law a
draft bill governing indigenous  autonomy  to help preserve aboriginal  culture
and traditions  and boost social movement  and sustainable  tribal development.</P>
      <P>Chen urged members of the 7th legislature to "put aside political prejudice" and
pass the draft bill as soon as possible, given that the Executive Yuan referred
the bill twice to the Legislative Yuan, in 2003 and 2007, but it had been
returned without review on both occasions.</P>
      <P>He made the call during a meeting at the Presidential Office with a group of
representatives of the newly formed tribal assembly of the Saisiat tribe.</P>
      <P>The president offered his congratulations to the Saisiat people -- the smallest
of Taiwan's 13 officially recognized indigenous groups with a population of
around 4,600 -- for having recently had 35 members of the tribe's lower house
elected to form Taiwan's first aboriginal bicameral assembly body.</P>
      <P>The Saisiat people -- based in the mountainous areas in the northern counties of
Hsinchu and Miaoli -- elected the 35 lower house members Feb. 3 before merging
members of an upper house into a Saisiat aboriginal assembly that same day. The
upper house was formed in January by tribal elders and chieftains recommended by
different Saisiat families.</P>
      <P>Chen called for the other 12 indigenous groups around Taiwan to emulate the
Saisiat people by forming their respective tribal assemblies based on the spirit
of a yet-to-be-enacted indigenous autonomy act.</P>
      <P>He added that the legislation of an indigenous autonomy act would not only echo
the spirit of the United Nations' Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
Peoples adopted last September, it also reflects the nation's determination to
allow aboriginal people to be their own masters.</P>
      <P>In recent related news, the Pinuyumayan aborigines based in the eastern county
of Taitung announced the establishment of a tribal assembly Jan. 27 after two
years of preparation.</P>
      <P>The assembly will push for a new partnership between the central government and
indigenous tribal groups, according to an initiator of the Pinuyumayan bicameral
tribal assembly.</P>

      <P>Minister of National Defense Lee Tien-yu was quoted as having confirmed Thursday
the administration of outgoing President Chen Shui-bian recently created a
company to handle arms purchases, beyond the control of the defense ministry.</P>
      <P>Lee was quoted as having told opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers that the
ministry will contribute 45 percent of the capital to form the company, which is
commissioned to integrate resources to boost the country's national defense
industry and facilitate arms procurement.</P>
      <P>According to KMT lawmakers, Lee made the remarks during a closed-door meeting
hosted by the party's legislative caucus earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Lee declined to make any comments after the meeting, but he promised to hold a
news conference Friday to brief the media on the matter.</P>
      <P>A report in the Thursday edition of the Taipei-based newspaper China Times said
that the government secretly set up the company to serve as a platform to deal
with foreign arms suppliers. The company was formed with a founding capital of
NT$1 billion (US$31.15 million).</P>
      <P>The new company, known as Taiwan Goal, was established to strike deals on arms,
weaponry systems and military industrial exchanges with companies abroad, the
report said, citing "reliable military sources."</P>
      <P>The China Times reported that the company was born under the promotion of Vice
Premier Chiou I-jen, and that Wu Nai-jen, a veteran member of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , has been appointed chairman of the
company's board of directors.</P>
      <P>Wu stated in a press statement issued the same day that Taiwan Goal was founded
in late January to handle relations between foreign weapon procurement and
supply traders and skilled local manufacturers in the hopes of promoting
development and technology upgrade of the domestic national defense industry.</P>
      <P>Wu indicated that he has been working as a volunteer chairman, receiving no
wages and that he will resign after the new president assumes office May 20 to
allow the new government to fully control the company's personnel arrangement.</P>
      <P>He has rejected the offers of wages and any other treatments from the company
including  a personal driver and automobile,  the heavyweight of the former New
Tide Faction in the DPP noted.</P>
      <P>Wu also revealed that the company has contacted many foreign weapon suppliers
since its founding last month in an effort to bring them in alliance with
Taiwanese enterprises in logistic services. No business contract is likely to be
signed before May 20.</P>
      <P>"Although Taiwan Goal is a private company, there's no individual stockholders
in the company," he noted in the statement.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lin Yu-fang on Thursday lashed out at the government's move,
claiming Taiwan Goal is a "political deal designed to rig money bills and
election votes."</P>
      <P>Lin claimed that the company was established with taxpayers' money and that its
bills are footed by public agencies and state-run firms, including Chunghua
Telecom and the defense ministry, the ministry holds only three of the seven
seats on the board, with the remaining four controlled by Chiou, Wu and two
people from the private sector.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Medical University (KMU) in the southern port city of Kaohsiung forged
sisterhood relations Thursday with Poland's Medical University of Lodz, paving
the way for future academic cooperation, according to a KMU spokesman.</P>
      <P>The agreement was signed in Kaohsiung by KMU President Yu Hsing-su and Studies
in English Language Dean Kan Wilczynski of Lodz. The signing was the result of
frequent contact and visits between the two schools since last year and a mutual
interest in academic cooperation.</P>
      <P>Lodz was inaugurated in 2002 as a merger of the Medical Academy of Lodz, founded
in 1950, and the Military Medical Academy of Lodz, established in 1958.</P>
      <P>Enjoying resources from the two academies, the school is one of the leading
research institutes in Central Europe. It has six research institutes and seven
teaching hospitals.</P>
      <P>Like many medical schools in Poland, Lodz provides all-English teaching courses
for international students. Taiwanese students who want to study in Poland do
not need to learn Polish before entering schools there, the spokesman noted.</P>
      <P>Poland's educational system requires six years of study for medical science,
five years for dentistry and four years for postgraduate medical sciences, and
Polish medical diplomas are accepted in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>KMU students will be able to take courses at Lodz and to do their internships in
Europe as a result of the signing of the sisterhood agreement, and students at
Lodz will have opportunities to learn medical sciences in Taiwan, the spokesman
said.</P>
      <P>"If faculty at Lodz agree to give short-term tutorials at KMU, it will be of
great benefit for the school's improvement in terms of gaining international
standards of teaching and research, " the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>KMU also expects that through the sisterhood ties, the European Union will
recognize KMU diplomas. The EU already recognizes Lodz diplomas but not those
issued by KMU, the spokesman said.</P>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) legislative caucus Thursday
recognized the government's efforts in establishing a company to boost the
development of Taiwan's defense industry and facilitate its arms procurement.</P>
      <P>Caucus whip Lai Ching-te made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan in response to
media inquiries on a newspaper report, saying that the DPP administration,
pushed by Vice Premier Chiou I-jen, organized a company, named Taiwan Goal, in
secret to integrate the production resources of the country's defense industry.</P>
      <P>The government has also appointed DPP veteran member Wu Nai-jen -- who no longer
holds any governmental position -- to serve as chairman of the company, the
report said, citing "reliable military sources."</P>
      <P>Lai said that in the past the government managed to purchase armaments for
national defense but did not work to establish a defense industry in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>To correct the lack and safeguard the country, the government planned and
established the company to take charge of the integration of the country's
national defense resources and the development of the defense industry.</P>
      <P>Lai went on to urge people around the country to support the project.</P>
      <P>The lawmaker also indicated that under the National Defense Law, the government
has the right to establish a company to take charge of the integration of the
country's productive resources to improve the country's national defense.</P>
      <P>"No matter which party wins power in the future, it has to continue operations
of the company," Lai claimed.</P>
      <P>However, Legislator Chang Hsien-Yao of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said
Taiwan Goal was founded, under instructions from the Executive Yuan, as a
private company "in an attempt to avoid the Legislative Yuan's supervision."</P>
      <P>In this regard, Chang pledged "all KMT members in the legislative committee of
national defense will boycott the company until a new government is formed May

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's celebrated Cloud Gate Dance Theater has decided to use a temporary
rehearsal studio offered by the Cabinet-level Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA)
after the theater's old one was recently destroyed by a blaze, CCA Chairman Wang
Tuoh said Thursday.</P>
      <P>A fire burned down early Monday the world famous dance theater's 1,324 square-
meter rehearsal studio, as well as costumes, props and production archives.</P>
      <P>The dance theater -- known for blending Asian mythology, folklore and aesthetics
with a modern sensibility -- is slated for a series of performances in the
United States and Europe starting in April.</P>
      <P>Wang made the announcement at a press conference after meeting with Lin Hwai-
min, founder and choreographer of the 35-year-old dance troupe, earlier in the
day.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Lin told Wang that he has decided to choose the Ching-mei
Human Rights Memorial Park in the northern county of Taipei as a mid-term
rehearsal venue and will start to use it from March.</P>
      <P>The Taipei city and county government have also offered sites for Lin to use as
rehearsal studios.</P>
      <P>Wang said that in the past, the council only provided emergency assistance to
individual artists instead of groups. He added that the council will formulate a
package of measures to offer emergency relief for art groups.</P>
      <P>To further expand its help for local cultural groups, the council will provide
23 idle places for performing arts groups to use to reduce their financial
burdens, Wang said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Wang said that he agreed with Lin that the council and the
government should increase its funds to promote culture and art.</P>
      <P>This year, the government allocated only 1.34 percent of its total funds --
NT$1.6 trillion (US$50.6 billion) -- for cultural development and 0.36 percent
for the council, according to Wang.</P>
      <P>He said he hopes that in the future, the cultural funds could be raised to
account for 3 percent or 4 percent of the total government funds, while the
council's funds could rise to 1.5 percent or 2 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang said that he will also push for upgrading the council into a
ministry.</P>
      <P>Among Cloud Gate's best known works are "Nine Songs," "Moon Water" and the
"Cursive" trilogy inspired by Chinese brush calligraphy.</P>

      <P>Participants in a recently launched national tree planting campaign will have a
chance to win prizes, a government agency organizing the event said Thursday, in
the latest effort to encourage tree planting in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The activity called "Green the World, " was launched Wednesday by the Council of
Agriculture (COA) , with the aim of encouraging every citizen to plant at least
one tree in his or her lifetime. Organizers estimate 10 million trees will be
planted within five years.</P>
      <P>As part of the program, the public is invited to plant trees on available land
and send photos and information of their tree plantings to the council via the
program's Web site at http: //greentheworld.gov.tw/.</P>
      <P>Each participant will receive a certificate from the council with the planting
time, place, planter's name, and serial numbers listed on it.</P>
      <P>Yen Jen-to, director-general of the council's Forestry Bureau, said the activity
is among a series of events for this year's tree planting month which began Feb.
4 and will run through March 12.</P>
      <P>Those who have serial numbers being 5,000, 10,000, or their multiples will win
free admission tickets for national forest recreation areas, Yen said.</P>
      <P>The council will present certificates of recognition to groups that plant over
5,000 trees or individuals who grow more than 1,000 trees, Yen said.</P>
      <P>The public may also join the tree planting activity in another way by designing
greeting cards on tree planting and submitting their designs to the council for
a competition.</P>
      <P>The council began accepting entries on Wednesday and will do so through Feb. 25.
Details can be accessed at the same Web site, Yen said, adding that the highest
prize money for the competition is NT$30, 000 (US$946).</P>
      <P>For those who have no idea about what trees to plant, Yen said the council has
selected 12 species of trees corresponding to the 12 months in a year, such as
the Taiwan cherry for January, camphor for April, and reetha tree for December.</P>
      <P>The list is to induce people to sow the tree seed corresponding to their birth
months, in the hope that at least half of the population will have been
persuaded to plant their own trees within five years.</P>

      <P>With over 70 percent of its outbound investment going to China and a stagnant
economy, the government is doing more to encourage Taiwanese businessmen to "re-
invest" in their homeland and vote in the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, Minister of Economic Affairs Steve Chen and Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) President Hung Chi-chang made the remarks at an annual
Lunar New Year gathering Thursday for more than 500 Taiwanese businessmen
operating in China, known locally as "taishang. "</P>
      <P>Facing the challenges of China's new labor laws and stricter taxation,
Taiwanese businessmen  should start considering  the deployment of "China plus
one, " which means increasing investment to a new country. That country could be
Vietnam or Taiwan, Hung said after describing the businessmen as Taiwan's
"invisible national power and national pride."</P>
      <P>He also urged China-based Taiwanese to vote in the presidential election and
make Taiwan's democracy an example for China and the Chinese community.  An
estimated 1 million taishang and their dependents reside in China.</P>
      <P>There will be more than 17 million eligible voters in the presidential election,
so that the 1 million votes of taishang represent almost 6 percent of the
electorate.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese businessmen need to cope with the changing investment environment in
China that is the result of a new labor law and new tax regulations, said Chen.</P>
      <P>A China with cheap land, cheap labor, tax incentives and low standards of
environmental protection -- the main reasons that has attracted Taiwanese
businessmen to China since the late 1980's -- is in the past, he said.</P>
      <P>This is why the government has created a project to attract investment back to
Taiwan with incentives on land lease and taxation, he noted, adding that the
government also encourages Taiwanese businesses to start the process of
enterprise transformation and focus on high value-added products.</P>
      <P>"Not all businesses are suitable for returning to Taiwan. We realize that. The
MOEA will also do its best to help Taiwanese businesses invest in various other
regions, including Central and South America, Central and Eastern Europe, India
and Vietnam, " Steve Chen said.</P>
      <P>To bring back the investment, the government has to first convince the
presidents of the 102 Taiwanese businessmen associations in China, who are seen
as highly influential among the taishang. A total of 82 incumbent or former
presidents of the associations attended the annual meeting.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's central bank appears ready to allow the New Taiwan dollar to continue
appreciating in an attempt to create a friendly environment for foreign
investment, a banking analyst said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The analyst made the remarks a day after the New Taiwan dollar rose NT$0.196 to
NT$31.688 against the U.S. dollar--the highest level in 21 months.</P>
      <P>As of Wednesday, the local currency had risen for eight trading days in a row
with a cumulative gain of NT$0.657, since Jan. 28 according to the analyst, who
said that the currency's rate of appreciation against the greenback has been the
second most rapid among all Asian currencies so far this year, only lagging
behind the Malaysian ringgit. The NT dollar lost a marginal NT$0.012 against the
greenback to close at NT$31.7 Thursday.</P>
      <P>The analyst said that the Central Bank of the Republic of China's move reflected
its worry that its monetary policy might be too tight in view of the fact that
the country's M2, the broadest measure of the nation's money supply, dropped to
a record low of 1.36 percent last December due to weakness in the stock market
and a massive outflow of capital as well as the slow growth of bank loans and
investment.</P>
      <P>Therefore,  the central  bank decided  to allow sufficient appreciation of
Taiwan's currency to attract inward remittance of foreign capital into Taiwan's
stock market to further stimulate domestic demand and facilitate local economic
development.</P>
      <P>The decision may also be interpreted as reflecting the central bank's intention
to ease restrictions on the capital market and create an environment more
favorable to investment, the analyst added.</P>
      <P>Noting that the central bank is expected to allow further appreciation of the
currency to offset inflationary pressures, the analyst said that when the
currency appreciates to a certain level, the bank will step in to maintain a
stable monetary policy.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is one of a small number of countries with the necessary conditions to
raise interest rates, " the analyst said, forecasting that the central bank will
later shift to a tighter monetary policy by means of raising interest rates in
March.</P>

National Defense, made the remarks at a press conference held by the ministry in
response to a local newspaper report that the government has secretly organized
a company, named Taiwan Goal, to handle arms deals with foreign traders.</P>
      <P>At the press conference, Wu delivered a report on the progress of a plan to
establish an institute to carry out the development of the nation's defense
industry, but did not mention any company by name.</P>
      <P>Wu said that Taiwan has been faced with many barriers in its arms procurement
from abroad. Even after it succeeds in a purchase, it has still to spend a lot
of money to maintain the armaments because the nation cannot join the foreign
production and maintenance line for the armaments  due to its sensitive
political status in the international community.</P>
      <P>In addition, "the country's failure to expand its international sales of locally
made weapons has also contributed to a waste of the country's scientific
research energy, "Wu added, claiming that establishing a national defense
management, production and trading company will solve all the problems.</P>
      <P>With such a company, Wu went on, the government will be able to integrate
reciprocal technology transfers between foreign contractors and local industries
and export locally developed technologies or weaponry components to overseas
arms producers.</P>
      <P>Citing a Singaporean private national defense company, Wu said it helped
Singapore purchase Lafayette frigates from France and at the same time win a big
portion of the contracts to assemble Lafayette hulls and combat systems on
Singapore soil.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan had a similar company, it would not only be able to facilitate arms
procurement  but could also work with foreign companies in technology sharing
and development, " Wu said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan could also join the global supply chain for armaments.
"There are limitless trade opportunities," Wu continued.</P>
      <P>Capital of NT$200 million has been underwritten for the planned company, NT$90
million of which will be from the MND, Wu said, adding that the project is still
in the planning stages and that no funds have been injected by the MND. If the
plan comes to fruition, the company will not begin operating before June, he
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan tries to win investment, votes from `taishang'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  14 (CNA)
02/15/08  10:56:33

    <TEXT>
      <P>With over 70 percent of its outbound investment going to China and a stagnant
economy, the government is doing more to encourage Taiwanese businessmen to "re-
invest" in their homeland and vote in the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, Minister of Economic Affairs Steve Chen and Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) President Hung Chi-chang made the remarks at an annual
Lunar New Year gathering Thursday for more than 500 Taiwanese businessmen
operating in China, known locally as "taishang. "</P>
      <P>Facing the challenges of China's new labor laws and stricter taxation,
Taiwanese businessmen  should start considering  the deployment of "China plus
one, " which means increasing investment to a new country. That country could be
Vietnam or Taiwan, Hung said after describing the businessmen as Taiwan's
"invisible national power and national pride."</P>
      <P>He also urged China-based Taiwanese to vote in the presidential election and
make Taiwan's democracy an example for China and the Chinese community.  An
estimated 1 million taishang and their dependents reside in China.</P>
      <P>There will be more than 17 million eligible voters in the presidential election,
so that the 1 million votes of taishang represent almost 6 percent of the
electorate.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese businessmen need to cope with the changing investment environment in
China that is the result of a new labor law and new tax regulations, said Chen.</P>
      <P>A China with cheap land, cheap labor, tax incentives and low standards of
environmental protection -- the main reasons that has attracted Taiwanese
businessmen to China since the late 1980's -- is in the past, he said.</P>
      <P>This is why the government has created a project to attract investment back to
Taiwan with incentives on land lease and taxation, he noted, adding that the
government also encourages Taiwanese businesses to start the process of
enterprise transformation and focus on high value-added products.</P>
      <P>"Not all businesses are suitable for returning to Taiwan. We realize that. The
MOEA will also do its best to help Taiwanese businesses invest in various other
regions, including Central and South America, Central and Eastern Europe, India
and Vietnam, " Steve Chen said.</P>
      <P>To bring back the investment, the government has to first convince the
presidents of the 102 Taiwanese businessmen associations in China, who are seen
as highly influential among the taishang. A total of 82 incumbent or former
presidents of the associations attended the annual meeting.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's central bank appears ready to allow the New Taiwan dollar to continue
appreciating in an attempt to create a friendly environment for foreign
investment, a banking analyst said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The analyst made the remarks a day after the New Taiwan dollar rose NT$0.196 to
NT$31.688 against the U.S. dollar--the highest level in 21 months.</P>
      <P>As of Wednesday, the local currency had risen for eight trading days in a row
with a cumulative gain of NT$0.657, since Jan. 28 according to the analyst, who
said that the currency's rate of appreciation against the greenback has been the
second most rapid among all Asian currencies so far this year, only lagging
behind the Malaysian ringgit. The NT dollar lost a marginal NT$0.012 against the
greenback to close at NT$31.7 Thursday.</P>
      <P>The analyst said that the Central Bank of the Republic of China's move reflected
its worry that its monetary policy might be too tight in view of the fact that
the country's M2, the broadest measure of the nation's money supply, dropped to
a record low of 1.36 percent last December due to weakness in the stock market
and a massive outflow of capital as well as the slow growth of bank loans and
investment.</P>
      <P>Therefore,  the central  bank decided  to allow sufficient appreciation of
Taiwan's currency to attract inward remittance of foreign capital into Taiwan's
stock market to further stimulate domestic demand and facilitate local economic
development.</P>
      <P>The decision may also be interpreted as reflecting the central bank's intention
to ease restrictions on the capital market and create an environment more
favorable to investment, the analyst added.</P>
      <P>Noting that the central bank is expected to allow further appreciation of the
currency to offset inflationary pressures, the analyst said that when the
currency appreciates to a certain level, the bank will step in to maintain a
stable monetary policy.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is one of a small number of countries with the necessary conditions to
raise interest rates, " the analyst said, forecasting that the central bank will
later shift to a tighter monetary policy by means of raising interest rates in
March.</P>

growth in U.S. exports to Taiwan mainly to the surge in overall U.S. export
trade that year.</P>
      <P>Growing Taiwan high tech investment in the United States and Taiwan's expanded
purchases of equipment for semiconductor and LCD flat display panel
manufacturing also played a role in shoring up U.S. exports to Taiwan in 2007,
Liang said.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that Taiwan welcomes growing U.S. exports to Taiwan, but added
that it is concerned over declining U.S. imports from Taiwan, citing the fact
that many Taiwanese companies received orders from the United States but had
their products delivered from China or Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>He stressed the importance of U.S.-Taiwan talks on the signing of a free trade
agreement between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the U.S. trade deficit with China hit a new record high in 2007, up
10.2 percent to the tune of US$256.3 billion.</P>
      <P>China, meanwhile, was also the largest source of the U.S. trade deficit last
year, followed by Japan, Mexico, Canada and Germany, in that order.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Friday that the opinions of the two
presidential candidates should be heeded while the administration makes plans to
overhaul the executive branch of the government.</P>
      <P>Noting that the presidential candidates of both the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and the Kuomintang (KMT) have put forth opinions
pertaining to Cabinet measures that would streamline the organization of the
Executive Yuan, Wang said that as soon as the Executive Yuan refers the
administration streamlining plan to the Legislative Yuan, he will make sure the
proposal is reviewed immediately.</P>
      <P>Wang expressed hope that the Cabinet will refer the draft package of amendments
to the Organic Act of the Executive Yuan to the Legislative Yuan soon so that
the package can be reviewed and passed into law prior to the March 22
presidential election.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet earlier in the week postponed approving measures that would
streamline the organization of the Executive Yuan and would cut the number of
agencies under the Executive Yuan from 39 to 26.</P>
      <P>Both Premier Chang Chun-hsiung and Vice Premier Chiou I-jen have said they will
try to push the revisions through next week.</P>
      <P>Based on a 2005 proposal that called for the Executive Yuan to be composed of 13
ministries and four councils, the draft amendments currently under consideration
propose a structure of 14 ministries, seven councils and five independent
organizations.</P>
      <P>The new measures would add a ministry for veterans affairs and two other
councils -- a gender equality commission and an oceans commission -- to the 2005
proposal.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a ministry of veterans affairs was at the center of heated
debate among Executive Yuan ministries and agencies Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Attempting to push through the new ministry, Chiou said it would not merely be a
"transplant" of the existing Veterans Affairs Commission but would actually be
crucial for the implementation of a volunteer military service system in the
future.</P>
      <P>The draft amendments will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for approval
after being passed by the Executive Yuan, but achieving a consensus in the
legislature could be very difficult because the amendments touch on many areas
in which various vested interests have support in the lawmaking body.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung reaffirmed Friday that the controversial establishment
of a private company to handle Taiwan's foreign arms transactions was
appropriate and necessary to "develop an independent defense industry."</P>
      <P>The premier contended that the company will serve as a platform to integrate
Taiwan's arms purchases and procurement projects, and will help upgrade both
Taiwan's domestic arms industry and the economy as a whole.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Goal's main targets, he said, would be "to give rise to Taiwan's arm
sales, upgrade Taiwan's defense industry and develop independent technologies."</P>
      <P>News of the formation of the company, called Taiwan Goal, emerged Wednesday and
was confirmed by the Ministry of National Defense, which will hold a 45 percent
stake in the venture with an NT$90 million investment.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT)  criticized the company as constituting a
political arrangement favoring the former New Tide faction of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)  and questioned the timing of the new
venture, launched less than two months before Taiwan's March 22 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Chang insisted, however, that the arms broker, which would include the
involvement of various government sectors, would be closely monitored by the
legislature, stressing "this is the essence of democracy."</P>
      <P>He dismissed reports that his Cabinet would receive a hefty commission for
setting up the firm, saying "the Executive Yuan is not as naive as that."</P>
      <P>"We should use a broader perspective to look at the case, " Chang stressed.</P>
      <P>Describing the establishment of Taiwan Goal as a beginning, Chang said the
government had an obligation to carry out its policies, regardless of when the
presidential election is held, and he believed the company would be seen through
by the new government and executives appointed by the new president.</P>
      <P>"The government must continue carrying out policies that benefit both the nation
and its people," Chang said.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese man contracted the measles after a recent visit to China, the first
overseas measles infection recorded this year, the Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The patient, a 27-year-old electronics engineer living in Taipei County, was
sent to China by his employer between mid-November 2007 and Jan. 26, 2008,
according to CDC Deputy Director-General Lin Ting.</P>
      <P>Shortly after his return to Taiwan, the man developed a cough and a runny nose
on Jan. 30, but did not seek medical treatment until a red rash appeared Feb. 4,
Lin said.</P>
      <P>The case was reported to health authorities as a possible case of the measles,
and test results released Friday confirmed  the diagnosis, Lin said, adding that
it is unclear if the man had previously been vaccinated against the disease.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, more than 95 percent of Taiwan's citizens aged 31 and below
have received measles inoculations, but some people might not develop an
immunity to the disease even after the inoculation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has not recorded any indigenous measles infections for many years,
although there have been some overseas infections, the largest number of which
originate in China, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Of the 10 overseas measles cases recorded last year, five were contracted in
China, four in Japan and one in the Philippines, he said.</P>
      <P>The 10 victims included two infants who had not reached the statutory age for
measles vaccines, four adults who had never received an inoculation, one who had
only received one vaccination dose, and three whose inoculation history was
unknown, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Many of the victims were foreign or Chinese spouses of Taiwan citizens, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>In  Taiwan,  children  are  given  a first  dose  of the measles-mumps-rubella
(MMR) vaccine when they are between 12-15 months old and the second dose during
their first year of elementary school.</P>
      <P>Lin advised people planning to travel overseas with infants below one year old
to make sure to have the children immunized at least two weeks prior to
departure.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Far Eastern Air Transport (FAT) , one of Taiwan's airlines that have been hit
hard by a downturn in domestic air travel, filed for reorganization Friday in an
attempt to work its way out of a financial crisis.</P>
      <P>The filing means the carrier, which reported debts of NT$9.99 billion (US$315
million) at the end of September 2007, will be able to protect its assets from
claims by creditors while its request is being considered by the Taipei District
Court and also if the request is granted.</P>
      <P>The news prompted FAT's main creditor banks -- Far Eastern International Bank,
Bank of Taiwan,  Ta Chong Bank and Mega International Commercial Bank -- to hold
an emergency meeting to discuss possible measures to collect payment on their
outstanding loans.</P>
      <P>The Commercial Times reported Friday that FAT has more than NT$5 billion in bank
debts, with Far Eastern International Bank being the airline's biggest creditor
and a major shareholder, with NT$862 million (US$26.94 million) in outstanding
loans to the company.</P>
      <P>Some of FAT's loans were secured with collateral, leaving those creditors in
better position to claim repayment, but according to the airline's financial
statement for the third quarter, it still had NT$600 million in unsecured loans.</P>
      <P>Industry insiders said that those financial institutions that made secured loans
could afford to give Far Eastern some time to get its business in order, but
suggested that those banks with unsecured loans might be less forgiving and be
unwilling to restructure the airline's servicing of its debts.</P>
      <P>That could worsen FAT's credit standing and trigger a vicious cycle by dealing a
further blow to the airline's credit rating and cash flow situation.</P>
      <P>Questions were first raised over FAT's financial status on Wednesday when it
bounced a check for NT$151 million for fuel and was also unable to meet its
landing fee obligations.</P>
      <P>On the same day, the International Air Transport Association's Clearing House
formally notified its members that it had suspended the airline temporarily for
running up US$848,000 (NT$27.14 million) in unpaid bills.</P>
      <P>The suspension threatened FAT's code sharing arrangements with other airlines,
but the airline stressed that service with its partners would continue despite
the crisis. FAT operates a number of flights to China via third countries, such
as South Korea, in cooperation with Chinese carriers.</P>
      <P>Trading of FAT's shares on the Gre Tai Securities Market was also restricted,

      <P>Taiwan's indigenous people totaled 484,000 at the end of 2007, accounting for
2.1 percent of the country's population, according to a report released Friday
by the Ministry of the Interior (MOI).</P>
      <P>The number marked an increase of 1.95 percent from 2006, much higher than the
growth rate of 0.36 percent for the total population, the report said.</P>
      <P>A total of 256,000, or 52.9 percent, of the indigenous people lived in
mountainous areas, according to the report.</P>
      <P>By ethnic origins, the Amis tribe accounted for the largest number at 173,000,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei County's Environmental Protection Bureau is promoting "online sky
lanterns" as an eco-friendly and safe alternative to traditional lanterns ahead
of the Lantern Festival, when rice paper lanterns are lit and sent into flight.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau, the kerosene and paper burned when releasing a single
sky lantern results in the release of about one kilogram of carbon dioxide into
the atmosphere.</P>
      <P>Chiang Pen-Chi, section chief of the bureau's "Low-Carbon Society Development
Center, " said at a press conference Friday that the online sky lanterns
provided by the county government have attracted over 10,000 Taiwan residents
over the past several years, resulting in a 10-ton reduction in carbon dioxide
emissions.</P>
      <P>Besides being better for the environment, the online sky lanterns offer a safer
alternative to the traditional lanterns, which cause several fires in Taiwan
each year.</P>
      <P>Yang Chi-hong, director of the center, also touted the online sky lantern
program, noting that all advanced countries have been making efforts to fight
global warming and reduce greenhouse gas emissions while at the same time
working to preserve traditional culture.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials invited all citizens to help in these efforts ahead  of  the
Lantern   Festival   by  choosing   the environmentally-friendly online sky
lantern alternative by visiting the bureau's Web site at
http://www.epb.tpc.gov.tw/.</P>
      <P>They said members of the public can choose from among nine sky lanterns offered
by the bureau -- namely lanterns that provide "peace, growth, business,
happiness, dreams, sweetness, love, wealth, and brightness" -- and pray to make
their wishes come true.</P>
      <P>For those not accustomed  to the idea of replacing their traditional sky lantern
custom with an online version, the county government's Tourism Bureau is
offering still another eco-friendly alternative free of charge.</P>
      <P>Those interested can send a letter with their name and wish to the county
government's tourism center in Pingsi, where the most popular lantern-lighting
activity is held annually.</P>
      <P>Staff members at the center will then write the names and wishes on selected
lanterns during the Pingsi Sky Lantern Festival and release them in order that
everyone can enjoy a new year full of hopes and aspirations.</P>
      <P>The high point of this year's Lantern Festival in Pingsi will be held on Feb.
21, the 15th day of the first month of the new lunar year.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung County government plans to expand the southern county's industrial
zones within two years as an increasing number of China-based Taiwanese business
people are returning to invest in Taiwan, Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Yang made the remarks at a commissioners' meeting on the development and
investment of the county's industrial and commerce industries at the county
government office earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Yang explained that some China-based Taiwan business people have started making
plans to return to Taiwan as China has introduced a law to better protect the
rights of its labors early this year, which has raised local labor costs.</P>
      <P>Beijing has also ended preferential tax treatment for foreign investors,
including Taiwanese companies and is putting more pressure on foreign-invested
factories to reduce pollution, further driving up the cost of doing business in
China.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks, dozens of China-based Taiwan business people have inquired
about how to set up factories in the county's industrial zones, Yang said.</P>
      <P>To meet the needs of more of these business people, the county government has
decided to expand the county's current industrial zones and establish new ones,
he said.</P>
      <P>On the results of county's industrial development efforts, Yang said that the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has listed the Southern  Taiwan Science
Park's  branch  in the county as a demonstration area for the solar energy
industry.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) plans to develop solar energy technology
in the county, which has attracted attention from major European companies, he
said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Kaohsiung Science Park has a special area for the manufacturing
of high value added biomedical equipment, which has already attracted five
companies to set up factories there, Yang noted.</P>
      <P>The county government also plans to work with National Cheng Kung University and
Kaohsiung Medical University to set up a research center, Yang added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Friday that it would be "more normal
and reasonable" if military procurement and related industries, which are
important to national security, can be overseen by the legislature.</P>
      <P>Wang was responding to news of the creation of a new private company  called
Taiwan  Goal that will handle overseas  arms transactions and exchanges.</P>
      <P>Although the Ministry of National Defense will have a 45 percent stake in the
company, it is unclear if it will be controlled by the ministry or subject to
legislative oversight.</P>
      <P>Wang said that if the government holds only a minority stake in the company,
then it is the concern of all members of the country. But should the government,
or the Ministry of National Defense, hold more than 50 percent of Taiwan Goal's
shares the Legislative Yuan would be legitimately able to monitor it, he
suggested.</P>
      <P>Wang said he only became aware of the company's existence Thursday after reading
about it in a local daily newspaper, and had no knowledge of Taiwan Goal's
operations and related matters.</P>
      <P>He said how Taiwan Goal will fare or whether it will continue to exist will
depend on the new administration elected in the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense confirmed on Thursday the creation of the
company, formed to boost the country's national defense industry and engage in
arms dealings with foreign suppliers that the government would have trouble
handling.</P>
      <P>Wu Nai-jen, a veteran member of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) ,
has been appointed as the unpaid chairman of the company's board of directors,
which sparked criticism of conflict of interest from opposition Kuomintang
lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Wu defended his role Thursday, stressing that he would step down from the post
after the new president assumes office May 20 to allow a new government to
control the company's leadership.</P>
      <P>The company has contacted many foreign weapons suppliers since its founding last
month in an effort to develop alliances with Taiwanese enterprises for logistics
services, but no contract is likely to be signed before May 20, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang Legislator Lin Yu-fang criticized the move Thursday, saying that
while the company was funded by public agencies and state-run firms, including
Chunghua Telecom and the defense ministry, the government held only three of the
seven seats on the board.</P>

      <P>An Internet afterschool program launched by the Ministry of Education (MOE) has
benefited more than 100 students across Taiwan, the ministry said Friday.</P>
      <P>The program, designed to enhance the education of underprivileged children
living in remote areas after school via the Internet, has benefited more than
100 primary and junior high school students from Taoyuan and Hsinchu counties in
northern Taiwan, Nantou County in central Taiwan and Kaohsiung County in the

      <P>Taiwan's safety industry is prospering and is expected to enjoy a 15 percent or
16 percent annual growth rate in the  next  few  years,  Industrial  Development
Bureau  (IDB) Director-General Chen Chao-yih said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during a press conference to illustrate advanced products
related to the safety industry developed by domestic companies.</P>
      <P>In exhibition at the press conference were safety equipment including video
phones,  WebCams, 3G cell phones (with global positioning system), radio-
frequency identification (RFID) apparatus, monitors for factories, carbon
monoxide monitors for households, as well as monitors for nursing homes.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the safety industry involves many aspects of daily life,
Chen said, there are still many people dying from preventable deaths due to lack
of safety alarms. He cited the example of numerous cases of people dying each
year from too much exposure to carbon monoxide because their windows were closed
and they did not have a detector for the poisonous gas.</P>
      <P>"This kind of thing can be prevented easily with a gas monitor, which is
generally cheap," Chen added.</P>
      <P>Safety monitoring equipment is also urgently needed in nursing homes and for
elderly people living alone, as well as in factories, sewage treatment plants
and other public enterprises involving water, electricity, gas and
telecommunications, Chen said.</P>
      <P>With an increasingly aging population, the demand for safety monitoring
apparatus will grow in Taiwan, Chen predicted, adding that he saw the safety
industry as a star industry in the future, following Taiwan's two flagship
industries -- semiconductor and panel display industries.</P>
      <P>The production value of Taiwan's safety industry is expected to reach NT$124.5
billion (US$3.9 billion) in 2007, according to Chen.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian author Tony Wheeler, founder of the world's best known travel guide
"Lonely Planet, on Thursday encouraged Taiwanese people to be brave travelers as
he unveiled his latest book "Badlands, " which is about his experience traveling
in so-called rogue states in the world.</P>
      <P>"The hardest part is deciding to go. Don't worry if your trip would work out.
Just go," Wheeler told an audience at a Taipei bookstore.</P>
      <P>Wheeler is visiting Taiwan at the invitation of the organizers of the 2008
Taipei International Book Exhibition. Australia is the theme country of this
year's book fair.</P>
      <P>Wheeler urged Taiwanese people, considered one of the most traveled people in
the world, to take risks and venture out to different countries. Many Taiwanese
tend to join tours when they travel, but more young people are beginning to plan
their own itineraries and explore a country on their own, using travel guides
such as Wheeler's.</P>
      <P>Showing slides at the book fair, Wheeler talked about all the nine "rogue
states" he visited which often made headlines in newspapers and have been
branded as the world's most autocratic and hazardous countries, including
Afghanistan, Albania, Burma, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea and Saudi
Arabia.</P>
      <P>Wheeler said that in his latest book, he tried to provoke readers into thinking
about "what makes a country evil? " and "how bad is really bad? " by sharing his
observations of each country's attitude toward human rights, terrorism and
foreign policy.</P>
      <P>The book also attempted to present colorful local landscapes and cultures and
provide a frank look at life in these countries, while revealing unknown history
and popular myths about the countries.</P>
      <P>Wheeler and his wife Maureen established "Lonely Planet, " one of the world's
most successful independent travel information companies, after they wrapped up
their journey across Asia and Australia in the early 1970s.</P>
      <P>The couple wrote "Across Asia on the Cheap" about the Asia overland trip soon
after they got married, Wheeler said.</P>
      <P>"The first book was totally unplanned. It was completed at the request of our
friends who were interested in the trip," he said.</P>
      <P>The book became the first tour guide published by "Lonely Planet," and proved
very popular.</P>
      <P>"We followed that with 'South-East Asia on a Shoestring' and it turned to be one
of the best selling books in history," said Wheeler.</P>
      <P>At present, the travel guide company has offices in London and Oakland,
California along with headquarters in Melbourne. It employs 500 staff and 300
on-the-road authors.</P>

      <P>There were 132 enterprises operating in five free trade zones (FTZs) around the
country as of the end of 2007, signifying that the zones are gradually drawing
interest from the private sector, the Council for Economic Planning and
Development said Friday.</P>
      <P>Logistics services providers DHL International  and Federal Express Corporation
set up facilities in August and December 2007 respectively in the Taoyuan Free
Trade Zone, the latest companies to establish up presences there, the CEPD said.</P>
      <P>FedEx believes that having a facility in the zone will help it expedite delivery
and help enterprises in the zone handle cargo and logistic-related problems, the
CEPD said.</P>
      <P>The five FTZs, located in Keelung Harbor, Taipei Harbor, Taichung Harbor and
Kaohsiung Harbor and Taoyuan Airport, allow companies to import and export
materials with only cursory customs procedures as long as they are processed
inside the zone.</P>
      <P>The Taoyuan zone, operated by the Far Glory Group, began operating on Jan. 1,
2001 and has so far attracted 80 enterprises, which is ahead of schedule
according to the CEPD.</P>
      <P>In an effort to boost the competitiveness of Taiwan's FTZs compared to those in

    <HEADLINE>Government helps goat farmers in Penghu to increase income</HEADLINE>

02/15/08  20:01:27
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has helped boost the income of goat farmers on the outlying
island of Penghu by teaching them to process and package the meat for sale to
consumers rather than sending live animals to Taiwan for processing,  a Council
of Agriculture (COA) official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Lu Ming-tsung, director of the Penghu Working Station of the COA's Livestock
Research Institute, said the institute and the Penghu County government have
helped the farmers slaughter, cut, season, freeze, and put the meat into
packages that can be sold to consumers around the country.</P>
      <P>Lu said 30 to 35 packages can be made from one goat, and 2,000 packages in 15
different flavors are produced every month. Seventy percent of the production is
sold in Penghu, with the rest going to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Goat meat is especially popular in Taiwan in the winter months for its health
properties, but the institute said it is preparing to teach farmers more
processing techniques to create a demand for the meat in the summer.</P>
      <P>Penghu has two main farmer groups, raising between 5,000 and 5,500 goats
annually. The animals are ready for slaughter when their weight reaches between
50 and 60 kilograms.</P>
      <P>In the past, these live goats from Penghu were sent to Taiwan proper to process,
with high transportation fees and the loss of weight or even deaths of the goats
during the voyage costing Penghu farmers dearly.</P>
      <P>Adding to their plights in 2007, Lu said, was that the wholesale price for goat
meat fell to about NT$120 per kilo, down from NT$200 per kg. the previous year.</P>
      <P>"For this reason, it is cheaper to have goats slaughtered, cut, processed and
packaged in Penghu," Lu said.</P>
      <P>To reduce the cost of raising goats,  the institute also introduced to Penghu
napier grass, an improved fodder grass that is a high in protein and allows
farmers to cut down on the use of corn as a feed.</P>
      <P>Farmers responded positively to the fodder grass, Lu said. Even though the
grass, also known as "elephant grass", "Sudan grass" or "king grass, " can't
grow in the winter, it can be stored in large volume ahead of the winter months.</P>
      <P>"The farmers estimated that they save about NT$60,000 per month using the
alternative grass," he said.</P>
      <P>According to the Goat Farmer Association of the ROC, goats are mostly raised in
areas south of Changhua. Sihu Township in the central Taiwan county is the
largest  goat meat auction  and consumption market.</P>
      <P>During the Chinese New Year holiday, Sihu Township reportedly slaughtered about
450 goats per day, association officials said.</P>
      <P>The COA estimates that about 134,000 goats will be slaughtered in Taiwan in
2008.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Consumer's rights should be top priority in FAT crisis: minister</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>As the financial crisis of Far Eastern Air Transport  (FAT)  unfolds,  Minister
of  Transportation  and Communications Tsai Duei stressed Friday that
"consumers' rights must remain the priority, " adding that "the ministry and the
Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) will continue to assist FAT in solving
its problems."</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks when reporters asked him about the Taiwanese airline's
financial woes, which were revealed this week, but the minister came short of
providing details of any government plan to deal with the crisis.</P>
      <P>FAT, one of Taiwan's major domestic airlines which celebrated its 50th
anniversary in November 2007, filed for bankruptcy protection Friday after
reporting debts of NT$9.99 billion (US$315 million) at the end of September
2007.</P>
      <P>The airline reported a loss of NT$ 3.3 billion as of Sept. 30 last year,
exceeding half of its capital. Like Taiwan's other carriers, FAT has been hit
hard by a downturn in domestic air travel, partly due to competition from a new
high speed rail service launched in January 2007.</P>
      <P>So far, the company's membership in the International Air Transport
Association's Clearing House (ICH) has been temporary suspended Wednesday due to
its US$ 848,000 (NT$27.14 million) in unpaid bills.</P>
      <P>Tsai Friday said the company had been a model for domestic airlines in the past
50 years, and that "FAT should now protect the rights of its customers and
maintain its safety record, as well as its service."</P>
      <P>"The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) has also instructed
the CAA to supervise FAT to meet the requirements in this regard, " Tsai added.
The minister further urged the airline's board of directors as well as its
management to make more efforts to tackle its problems, adding that "in the
short run, FAT should seek a satisfactory way to solve the problems caused by
its debts to the ICH."</P>
      <P>In the long run, Tsai said, he hoped that the airline will improve its financial
structure by learning a lesson from the crisis and rebuilding itself.</P>

      <P>The 417-year-old "Golden-Face Matsu" icon, enshrined at the Tien Hou Temple on
Taiwan's outlying island of Penghu, was brought to Taipei Friday, where the
Chinese Goddess of the Sea will take part in the traditional Lantern Festival
Feb. 21.</P>
      <P>Matsu is the most worshipped local goddess in Taiwan and the Lantern Festival
marks the 15th day of the Lunar New Year, which began on Feb. 7 this year.</P>
      <P>Penghu County Magistrate Wang Chien-fa and many Matsu believers, escorting the
icon, flew to Taipei earlier Friday before driving to the city hall where the
historic statue was settled on the main stage of the 2008 Taipei Lantern
Festival.</P>
      <P>The festival runs from Feb. 15 to 24.</P>
      <P>A series of traditional rituals were held at the city hall plaza Friday to mark
the arrival of the important statue of the goddess in Taiwan's  main island.
Vice President  Annette Lu and former Examination Yuan President Hsu Shui-teh
attended the ceremonies.</P>
      <P>One of the religious rituals saw the Penghu County chief drawing eyes on a huge
turtle-shaped statue made of rice to "open vision" for the symbolic "divine
turtle."</P>
      <P>The annual creation of the "divine rice turtle, " at the weight of over 2,000
kg, is part of a long tradition known in Penghu as "begging turtle for safety
and wellness," which is held before to the Lantern Festival each year, Wang
said.</P>
      <P>In ancient times, people from the Chinese mainland sailed across rough waters to
Penghu, struggling against high seas in search of a better life. Citing legends,
Wang said people were saved by sea turtles from drowning, and therefore created
icons modeled into turtles with rice and other food materials to pray to turtles
for a safe year, each year. The activity is known as "begging turtle."</P>
      <P>The activity has been held for more than 150 years on Penghu, an island off
southern Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>Wang said the Penghu county government is making efforts to promote the event as
one of the major Lantern Festival activities in the country, in a drive to boost
tourism in Penghu.</P>

      <P>National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) in Taiwan's southern city of Tainan will
confer honorary degrees on two outstanding foreign scientists this month for
their contribution to the school and to Taiwan's scientific development, a
university official said Friday.</P>
      <P>One of the professors is Aaron Ciechanover, who serves as a chair professor in
the university. He was awarded a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2004 for his co-
discovery of one of the most important cyclical processes in biochemistry.
Ciechanover is also a faculty member of the Vascular and Cancer Biology Research
Center, the Rappaport Faculty of Medicine and Research Institute, and the
Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, Israel.</P>
      <P>The other scientist to receive an honorary degree is Britton Chance, who is also
a chair professor of the Taiwan university. He received a Ph.D. in physical
chemistry in 1940 at the University of Pennsylvania, and the second Ph.D. in
physiology at Cambridge University in 1942.</P>
      <P>Chance's research interest focuses on the use of infrared light to characterize
the properties of various tissues and breast tumors.</P>
      <P>The two distinguished scientists will also be invited to attend two workshops
sponsored by NCKU's Institute of Innovation and Advanced Studies (IIAS) on
innovative technologies on Feb. 18.</P>

      <P>A team from Taiwan's top research institution, Academia Sinica, has found a way
to fight staphylococcus aureus, a bacterium that is a common cause of staph
infections which has grown resistant to many antibiotics.</P>
      <P>The finding was published  Friday in Science Express,  an internationally
renowned science publication.</P>
      <P>The team discovered that cholesterol-lowering medicines will effectively block
staphylococcus aureus from using a cartenoid pigment to turn itself into the
golden color that enables it to avoid being destroyed by white blood cells.</P>
      <P>Researchers expected that the research finding would soon result in the
development of a medication that could tackle the bacterium more effectively,
Academia Sinica said in a statement.</P>
      <P>Staphylococcus aureus, also known as golden staph, produces hospital and
community-acquired infections. When the bacterium is resistant to penicillins,
known formally as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, it poses a
serious threat to public health, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The bacterium can cause a range of illnesses, including minor skin infections,
boils, cellulitis, and more major problems such as pneumonia, meningitis, and
toxic shock syndrome.</P>
      <P>Staphylococcus aureus inside a human body uses a golden pigment, called
staphyloxanthin, to avoid being destroyed by white blood cells, or leukocytes,
which are the cells of the immune system defending the body against both
infectious disease and foreign materials, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The team that made the discovery, composed of several experts from Taiwan and
the United States, was led by Academia Sinica Vice President Andrew Wang.</P>

      <P>A local convenience store is joining with a Japanese partner to open a tearoom
in Taipei that will cater primarily to women to capitalize on the growing
purchasing power of female consumers, a company executive said Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-based President Chain Store Corp. which runs over 3,000 7-Elevens on the
island, has entered into a joint venture with Japan's Sazaby League, to
introduce Sazaby's "Afternoon Tea TEAROOM" franchise to Taiwan, said James
Hsieh, the company's chief of strategy.</P>
      <P>President will hold 51 percent of the venture's shares. Sazaby, involved in
fashion, lifestyle stores, and food franchises, will hold the remaining 49
percent. Their goal is to open 10 outlets in Taiwan by 2010.</P>
      <P>The two companies have already teamed up to introduce the tearoom brand in China
last year. Their first restaurant in Taiwan, to be located in Taipei, began
trial operations Thursday and is scheduled to be formally opened Feb. 21.</P>
      <P>"Afternoon Tea TEAROOM will be designed to appeal to female customers, serving
delicate and exquisite food and providing good service and a comfortable dining
environment for women, " Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Sazaby League sent three high-ranking executives from Japan to train personnel
in Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>The companies are betting that the spending power of women will grow
increasingly dominant in the future, with Hsieh estimating that women will
eventually guide 80 percent of the Taiwan's consumer market.</P>
      <P>The consumption power of women has already risen substantially in the past
decade, Hsieh said, with the income of females growing 1.6 times during that
period while that of males has only risen 1.4 times.</P>
      <P>To ensure the business has a feminine touch, The executive in charge of the
brand in Taiwan will also be a woman, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>The venture plans to open one more outlet in 2008 with locations along MRT lines
to be the first considered when opening new stores, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>The chain store also cooperates with Duskin, Japan's biggest doughnut retail

      <P>Taiwan will invest NT$1 billion (US$31.25 million) to boost the country's
tourism industry over the next two years, and has set a target of attracting 4
million foreign visitors to Taiwan in 2008, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung announced
Friday.</P>
      <P>Introducing the "Tour Taiwan 2008-2009 Plan, " Chang was upbeat over tourism

percent over the previous year.</P>
      <P>He said investing in the sector would help reach the target of 4 million
visitors in 2008 and pay substantial dividends.</P>
      <P>"We will strengthen Taiwan's international promotion activities and create a

      <P>China is expected to face intensified pressure from the international community
before the Beijing Olympics over its support for Sudan's government, but Taiwan
so far has no plans to boycott the Games, a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
official said Friday.</P>
      <P>"The Olympic Games have been given multiple meanings. As the host country, China
has been under tremendous pressure, but it should not shun its obligations as a
member of the international community either, " MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun
said in response to a question on American film director Steven Spielberg's
withdrawal as an artistic adviser to the Beijing Olympics.</P>
      <P>Spielberg made the announcement Tuesday after failing to prod China to do more
to end the conflict in Darfur in western Sudan that has left hundreds of
thousands dead and displaced more than 2 million people.</P>
      <P>Before Spielberg withdrew, a number of celebrities, international media
watchdogs and human rights organizations had been calling for a boycott of the
2008 Olympics because of China's support for the Sudanese government, which has
been blamed for most of the atrocities in the conflict and used Chinese-made
weapons against its enemies.</P>
      <P>Asked if Taiwan would consider boycotting the event, Liu said that "there have
been no substantial discussions on that matter from our side."</P>
      <P>China has been engaging in an intense competition for energy and mineral
products as part of its "peaceful rise, " which was why it had to develop close
diplomatic  relations  with a number of authoritarian regimes, Liu said.</P>
      <P>The United Nations and other international organizations are trying to pressure
China and ask it to play a more positive and responsible role in handling the
Darfur situation and domestic human rights protection, Liu said.</P>
      <P>"If China wants to assure the international community about its peaceful rise,
it should not merely sit by and watch -- or shield -- the injustice in front of
its face. For the international community, that would be ironic and reveal
China's anti-democratic attitude and lack of respect for human rights, " he
said.</P>

      <P>The annual Travel Tour Expo, the biggest annual event in the Philippines' travel
and tourism industry, kicked off Friday in Pasay City, a southern suburb of the
capital Manila.</P>
      <P>A total of 345 booths were set up at the venue by governmental tourism
departments, airlines, cruise lines and travel agencies from 23 countries,
according to the organizers, the Philippine Department of Tourism and the
Philippine Travel Agencies Association.</P>
      <P>Three companies had booths in the Taiwan pavilion: the Taiwan Visitors
Association (TVA) , Taipei-based China Airlines (CAL) and Jeron Travel and Tours
Co., run by Taiwanese businessmen operating in the Philippines.</P>
      <P>Attending the annual expo for the first time, the TVA's booth featured a
signboard reading "Tour Taiwan Years" and introduced visitors to Taiwan's scenic
tourist spots, cultural activities, food and fashion.</P>
      <P>TVA marketing manager Chou Huei-chin said 2008 and 2009 are the "Tour Taiwan
Years, " a government-initiated program aimed at attracting foreign tourists to
the country.</P>
      <P>Under the program, travelers visiting Taiwan on a holiday will enjoy many
special deals, including free tickets for rides on Taipei's MRT or Kaohsiung
cruise boats and entrance to amusement parks, Chou said.</P>
      <P>CAL also made special offers to spur new business, offering round trip tickets
between Taipei or Kaohsiung and Manila for US$280, about US$100 less than
normally charged.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Executive Yuan ratified the "Tour Taiwan Years" program in late 2007,
which aims to increase the number of foreign visitors to Taiwan to over 4
million this year.</P>
      <P>An average of 5,000 Filipinos a month applied for visas to Taiwan in 2007, most
of whom were migrant workers, according to figures from Taiwan's representative
office in the Philippines.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development has decided to continue a
subsidized program to provide free computer courses for women in rural areas
aimed at bridging the digital disparity between cities and rural areas.</P>
      <P>The council will earmark NT$30 million (US$94,518) from the Executive  Yuan's
Sino-American  Fund for Economic  and Social Development for the program, more
than doubling the its NT$14.5 million budget in 2007 when it trained over 10,000
women.</P>
      <P>This year's program is expected to benefit over 20,000 women, with NT$1,500 the
maximum amount participants in the program can receive, the CEPD said.</P>
      <P>Under the project,  the council will subsidize  non-profit organizations to
provide 24 hours of basic computer training to the course attendees. This year's
courses will be begin later this month at the earliest.</P>
      <P>The CEPD said most Taiwanese women, especially those in rural areas, dedicate
more time than men to taking care of children and family chores and thus have
little time to learn computer skills.</P>
      <P>The program offers them basic computer skills so that they can have access to
better job opportunities, improve their interpersonal relations and create more
communication channels with their children.</P>
      <P>With their computer skills, they can also acquire further education in many
fields, the council said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to give up 'quit and win' contest due to funding shortage</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan cannot participate in this year's "quit and win" contest, an activity
promoted by the World Health Organization to encourage people to quit smoking,
because of a shortage of funds, a foundation in charge of running the activity
in Taiwan said Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin Ching-li, the director of the tobacco section of the John Tung Foundation,
noted that more than 70 countries have responded to the drive to sponsor the
activities every second year, and Taiwan has held the contest three times since
2002.</P>
      <P>But with  this year's  activity  requiring  NT$10  million (US$312,500) in
funding, and the group having only raised NT$400,000 of NT$900,000 pledged so
far, it has had to abandon its plans, Lin said.</P>
      <P>"The foundation was forced to give up the contest. The limited amount of money
collected will be used on an anti-smoking campaign, ' she said, dismissing any
suggestions that the contest could be salvaged.</P>
      <P>"Even if we continued to solicit donations, there would not be enough time left,
" she added, noting that the foundation needed two months to prepare for the
contest scheduled for May.</P>
      <P>Lin said the sluggish economy has dampened the interest of businesses in
contributing to the activity and some state-owned enterprises said that they
could not make any contributions prior to the inauguration of the new president
May 20.</P>
      <P>The foundation has been the event's major sponsor the last three times it has
been held, but it stopped receiving official donations in 2006.</P>
      <P>The international smoking cessation competition is organized every second year
by the National Public Health Institute of Finland and supported by the World
Health Organization.</P>
      <P>Adult smokers who have smoked for at least one year can register for the
contest. The goal is to abstain from smoking for a specified period of four
weeks in May. At the end of this period, every country selects one winner who
receives a national prize.</P>

      <P>The Taipei city government's Bureau of Labor Affairs has designated 2008 as
"Worker Safety Year" and will impose strict guidelines to help companies prevent
their workers from suffering occupational injuries, a city official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chang Chi-yu, head of the bureau's Labor Standards Inspection Office, made the
pledge after the office staged a skit to show the city government's resolve to
fully protect workers' safety in partnership with private enterprises.</P>
      <P>Beginning this year, employers are required to report in detail to the
inspection office potential dangers their laborers might encounter when working
on large-scale renovation or construction projects or when operating dangerous
machinery or equipment, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Construction workers are the highest-risk group among all sectors in terms of
occupational casualties, said Chang,  citing 2007 statistics which showed that
28 workers were killed at their work places in Taipei City, 22 of whom were
construction workers.</P>
      <P>No major occupational casualty or death has occurred since the beginning of the
year, and the campaign, Chang said, hoped to keep the record clean.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that the number of tourist arrivals is
expected to break the 4 million mark this year thanks to concerted efforts by
the government and the travel service sector.</P>
      <P>On the day when Taiwan launched its "Tour Taiwan Years 2008-2009" campaign,
Chen said his administration had given priority to promoting the domestic
tourist industry, with the number of foreign visitors rising from 2.62 million
in 2000 to 3.71 million last year.</P>
      <P>Chen singled out the growth of Japanese tourists to Taiwan as a major
achievement. Although Japan suffered from a slumping economy and soaring
airfares that resulted in a decline in the number of overall Japanese outbound
travelers last year, the number of Japanese vacationers to Taiwan still
registered a rise from the 2006 level.</P>
      <P>"Japan was the largest source of visitors to Taiwan, accounting for 31.39
percent of total tourist arrivals for 2007, " said Chen, who was speaking to
foreign travel service executives invited to Taipei by the Tourism Bureau for
the contributions to the local tourist sector.</P>
      <P>He voiced his appreciation for the dedicated efforts of Taiwanese and Japanese
tour operators in organizing attractive holiday packages to lure more visitors
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, Chen said, the number of toruists from South Korea,
Singapore and Malaysia also posted large increases thanks to joint efforts of
tourist officials and travel agents at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>With the launch of the "Tour Taiwan Years" promotional campaign, Chen said the
government will assist local travel agents in offering a myriad of diverse
travel packages by fusing tradition with innovative sensibility.</P>
      <P>"Through the investment of up to NT$1 billion over the next two years, the
annual number of tourist arrivals will hopefully exceed 4 million to hit 4.25
million this year," Chen added.</P>

      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Steve Ruey-long Chen said Friday that he will make
a decision next week on whether to ban exports of reinforcing steel bars, or
rebars, in response to calls by property developers to stabilize domestic rebar
prices.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan exported 378,000 metric tons of rebars between January and
November 2007, but felt the amount would not have a big impact on local prices.</P>
      <P>"The quantity was not large, and even if a ban is imposed on rebar exports, it
would not help too much," he said.</P>
      <P>The request to ban exports of the bars was made by Lai Cheng-i, deputy chairman
of the federation  of real estate development associations around Taiwan because
rising prices of steel products in international  markets have had a negative

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) gave preliminary approval Friday to two
major China-bound investment projects at a review meeting Friday.</P>
      <P>Minister Steve Reuy-long Chen said the two projects "will have a positive effect
on Taiwan's economic development, " referring to Formosa Plastics Group's plan
to invest US$100 million in a specialty steel company in Zhangzhou, Fujian
province, and semiconductor packager and tester ASE's plan to increase its
investment in its Shanghai packaging plant by US$30 million.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after presiding over an interministerial conference on
whether the projects were in line with the government's "active management and
effective opening" policy regarding investment in China.</P>
      <P>"Now that the projects have passed policy-related screening, the Investment
Commission under the Ministry of Economic Affairs is expected to formally
approve them next week," Chen said.</P>
      <P>FPG Chairman Li Chih-chun, Formosa Heavy Industry Corp. President Wu Kuo-hsiung,
and ASE Chairman Jason Chang all attended the meeting to explain in detail their
investment plans and future business development blueprints.</P>
      <P>They reported on their financing plans, technology transfer and equipment
delivery as well as matching investment in Taiwan and their globalization plan.</P>
      <P>Chen said FPG pledged that its investment in Taiwan will reach NT$813.3 billion
(US$25.67 billion) in five years, and that related equipment will be produced in
Taiwan and delivered to China. The technical and management staff will be
recruited in Taiwan to create job opportunities.</P>
      <P>Chen said ASE has invested over NT$145 billion in Taiwan, and indicated it would
continue to increase investment  in Taiwan depending on market cicumstances.</P>
      <P>This is the third time that the ministry has convened a policy-related
screening meeting.  The ministry had previously approved investment projects by
semiconductor manufacturers  to relocate  their  old 8-inch-wafer  plants  using
a 0.25-micron manufacturing process to China.</P>
      <P>The  government  also  approved  an application  by Taiwan Semiconductor

rebars, in response to calls by property developers to stabilize domestic rebar
prices.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan exported 378,000 metric tons of rebars between January and
November 2007, but felt the amount would not have a big impact on local prices.</P>
      <P>"The quantity was not large, and even if a ban is imposed on rebar exports, it
would not help too much," he said.</P>
      <P>The request to ban exports of the bars was made by Lai Cheng-i, deputy chairman
of the federation  of real estate development associations around Taiwan because
rising prices of steel products in international  markets have had a negative
impact on Taiwan's construction industry.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) gave preliminary approval Friday to two
major China-bound investment projects at a review meeting Friday.</P>
      <P>Minister Steve Reuy-long Chen said the two projects "will have a positive effect
on Taiwan's economic development, " referring to Formosa Plastics Group's
(FPG's) plan to invest US$100 million in a specialty steel company in Zhangzhou,
Fujian province, and semiconductor packager and tester ASE's plan to increase
its investment in its Shanghai packaging plant by US$30 million.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after presiding over an interministerial conference on
whether the projects were in line with the government's "active management and
effective opening" policy regarding investment in China.</P>
      <P>"Now that the projects have passed policy-related screening, the Investment
Commission under the Ministry of Economic Affairs is expected to formally
approve them next week," Chen said.</P>
      <P>FPG Chairman Li Chih-chun, Formosa Heavy Industry Corp. President Wu Kuo-hsiung,
and ASE Chairman Jason Chang all attended the meeting to explain in detail their
investment plans and future business development blueprints.</P>
      <P>They reported on their financing plans, technology transfer and equipment
delivery as well as matching investment in Taiwan and their globalization plan.</P>
      <P>Chen said FPG pledged that its investment in Taiwan will reach NT$813.3 billion
(US$25.67 billion) in five years, and that related equipment will be produced in
Taiwan and delivered to China. The technical and management staff will be
recruited in Taiwan to create job opportunities.</P>
      <P>Chen said ASE has invested over NT$145 billion in Taiwan, and indicated it would
continue to increase investment  in Taiwan depending on market cicumstances.</P>
      <P>This is the third time that the ministry has convened a policy-related
screening meeting.  The ministry had previously approved investment projects by
semiconductor manufacturers  to relocate  their  old 8-inch-wafer  plants  using
a 0.25-micron manufacturing process to China.</P>
      <P>The  government  also  approved  an application  by Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co. to use 0.18-micro chip manufacturing technology at its wafer
foundry in China.</P>

      <P>Nearly 80 percent of low-cost fashion accessories available at stationery or
bookstores are substandard, and some even contain excessive amounts of toxic
substances, Taiwan's standards bureau said Friday.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection (BSMI) under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs recently tested 24 accessories randomly selected from local
bookstores and stationery shops that are popular with elementary and junior high
school students.</P>
      <P>The selected  items included bracelets,  wristbands,  ankle bracelets,
necklaces, earrings, rings, hair pins and medallions, with prices ranging
between NT$10 (US$0.31) and NT$99 apiece, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>Test results showed that 19 of the 24 items failed to meet specified standards,
a failure rate of 79.2 percent. A common defect found among the substandard
items was the tendancy for small components on the accessories to come loose
easily or break.</P>
      <P>More worrying, however, was that four of the articles were found to contain
excessive amounts of lead, with one even reaching 2,305 ppm, far higher than the
limit of 90 ppm, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>If the lead-contaminated items were swallowed accidentally by small children,
their nervous system could be harmed or they might fall victim to acute lead
poisoning, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>Based on the results, the bureau has ordered the immediate recall or destruction
of the items that were found to be substandard.</P>
      <P>The survey also discovered that product labeling was subpar. The Chinese-
language labels on 16 of the inspected items, or two-thirds of the total, failed
to meet government-established standards.</P>

      <P>Former lawmaker Lee Sen-zong, who lost his seat in January's legislative
elections, was shot in the chest early Saturday morning in Taipei County after
trying to get away from two men who had abducted him.</P>
      <P>Lee was walking to his car after attending a party at a friend's house at around
4:30 a.m. when two individuals jumped him and dragged him into their car.</P>
      <P>A little over 10 minutes into their journey, the driver of the car pulled to the
side of the road after spotting a police patrol car to avoid suspicion. Lee
jumped out of the vehicle to try and catch the attention of the policemen, but
was shot in the right side of the chest.</P>
      <P>He was rushed to National Taiwan University Hospital and is in stable condition,
according to NTUH Department of Traumatology doctor Han Yin-yi, who treated him.</P>
      <P>As of Saturday noon, Lee's assailants had yet to be apprehended and the motive
for the attack remained unclear.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian expressed deep concern over the shooting as soon as he
was informed of it and ordered police to immediately open an investigation into
the incident, the Presidential Office said.</P>
      <P>National Police Agency Director-General Hou Yu-ih, one of those who rushed to
the hospital after the shooting, said the police collected bullet shells and
other evidence left at the crime scene that they hoped would lead them to the
suspects.</P>
      <P>Hou expressed confidence that the case would be solved very soon.</P>
      <P>Lee was elected to two terms as a Taipei County councilor, and then served five
consecutive terms in Taiwan's legislature between 1993 and 2008 as a member of
the Kuomintang (KMT) representing Taipei County.</P>
      <P>When he failed to win a nomination as a KMT candidate in the Jan. 12 legislative
polls,  he defected  to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, becoming that
party's nominee in Taipei County's first district. The move proved unsuccessful
as he failed to win re-election, garnering just under 40 percent of the vote in
the district.</P>
      <P>Also expressing concern over the incident,  Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jyh-
wey said the Cabinet hopes the police will get to the bottom of the matter soon
and wishes Lee an early recovery.</P>
      <P>Others  who  visited  Lee at the hospital  were  Criminal Investigation Bureau
Commissioner Huang Mao-sui and incumbent KMT Legislator Lin Yu-fang.</P>

      <P>Business class tickets for travel on Taiwan's high speed railway will be
discounted by 20 percent starting March 1, an official of the Taiwan High Speed
Rail Corporation (THSRC) announced Friday.</P>
      <P>Senior citizens, passengers under 12 and groups, who already were eligible for a
5 percent discount on business class tickets, will now enjoy a 25 percent
discount for the higher class of service.</P>
      <P>Ted Chia, assistant manager of THSRC's Public Affairs Division, said business
class -- which usually occupies one of the 12 passenger cars on an average high
speed train -- has had low load factors because of the short travel times, and
he hoped the discount would fill up some of the many empty seats.</P>
      <P>"There is no deadline for this offer, " Chia said. "Senior citizens can take
advantage of this along with the original five percent discount to enjoy more
spacious seating, making the journey more pleasant."</P>
      <P>With the discount, the price of a one-way business class ticket for the 96
minute to two-hour trip between Taipei in the north and Zuoying in the south
would fall from the original NT$2,440 (US$76) to NT$1,950 (US$59), or just
NT$460 (US$14) more than the economy class fare, THSRC said in a statement.</P>
      <P>Touting the advantages of traveling business class, Chia said Taipei, Taichung,
and Zuoying all had ticket counters dedicated to business class passengers to
provide faster and more convenient service, and noted that riders in business
class received free coffee, tea, or bottled water and had access to personal
entertainment systems.</P>
      <P>The high-speed railway, which operates between Taipei and Zuoying and has
stations along the way in Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Taichung, Chiayi, and Tainan, was
officially launched on Jan. 5, 2007 and had served 1.5 million passengers as of

      <P>A festive celebration was held Saturday to mark the reopening of an organic
farmers' market on the campus of National Chung Hsing University (NCHU) in
Taichung City, central Taiwan, after a week-long break for the Lunar New Year
holiday.</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu, joined the festivities and visited stands displaying
various fresh, organic and locally-grown vegetables and fruits.</P>
      <P>"Promoting organic agriculture can help people eat in a healthy and safe manner,
" Hu said in recognizing NCHU's contributions to integrating agricultural
production and marketing and opening its campus to local communities.</P>
      <P>The NCHU Organic Farmers' Market was formed under the sponsorship of the NCHU
College of Agriculture and Natural Resources and formally opened last Sept. 8.</P>
      <P>Every Saturday since then, from 8 a.m. to noon, farmers from neighboring areas
and even eastern Taiwan have sold their produce at the market while happily
answering questions about their crops.</P>
      <P>All farmers selling their produce in the market have passed strict scientific
screening reviews by the university  before obtaining NCHU certification as
growers of organic produce, a requirement to set up a booth in the market.</P>
      <P>NCHU Department of Bio-Industry Extension and Management Director Tung Shin-jui,
who guided the creation of the market, said most of the produce sold there comes
from organic farmers based in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He believed this new marketing channel would facilitate sales of perishable and
nontoxic agricultural products from small local farms that might otherwise have
trouble finding commercial opportunities.</P>
      <P>In the market, farmers can directly explain to consumers how they grow and care
for their crops, establishing bonds of mutual trust between the two sides, Tung
said.</P>
      <P>Mayor Hu said that in hosting the farmers' market, the university was no longer
an "ivory tower" because students were able to learn something practical related
to real life. He also promise to push the city government to do more to boost
development of the country's organic agricultural sector.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Farmers' Party (TFP) Saturday declared its support for Kuomintang
(KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou and his running mate Vincent Siew in
the Mar.  22 presidential election and urged them to support a TFP proposal that
would restore a health insurance system for farmers.</P>
      <P>The endorsement came following a meeting Friday of the party's National Party
Affairs Development Committee at which the decision was made to support the KMT
ticket.</P>
      <P>The party is strongly opposed to the National Pension Act proposed by the
Democratic Progressive Party government because it would replace the farmers
health insurance system and potentially restrict the benefits that come with it.</P>
      <P>Party spokesman Hsieh Yung-huei said the Farmers Party protested the
cancellation of the farmers insurance plan with the government prior to the Jan.
12 legislative elections and has since submitted a proposal to both the DPP and
KMT to amend the National Pension Act.</P>
      <P>"Only the KMT responded positively to the appeals and showed its support, "
Hsieh said. "The TFP endorses candidates willing to take care of farmers' rights
as well as the development of agriculture."</P>
      <P>Under the National Pension Act that is slated to take effect on Oct. 1, 2008,
those aged between 25 and 65 who do not participate in the labor insurance
program and are not covered by civil servant, military or teachers insurance
programs are eligible to join the national pension fund program.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposed by the Farmers Party would include the existing farmer's
health insurance within the framework of the National Pension Act and remove
restrictions that the party says limits farmers' rights.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Farmers Party was only recently formed and has a limited following.
It garnered only 57,144 votes, or 0.58 percent of the total cast, in the vote
for political parties in the Jan. 12 legislative election.</P>

ability to work if they are exposed to an environment where the carbon monoxide
concentration reaches 50 ppm for 1.5-4 hours.</P>
      <P>They can get a severe headache if the concentration reaches 200 ppm and feel
weak and dizzy if the concentration increases to 400 ppm, Wang said.</P>
      <P>A concentration of 1,200 ppm can cause the heartbeat rate to increase and become
irregular, and a concentration of 2,000 ppm or higher can result in a loss of
consciousness and death, Wang said, adding that humans die within minutes if the
concentration reaches 5,000 ppm or above.</P>
      <P>Cheng advised consumers to leave immediately if they feel uncomfortable while
eating at a restaurant and not wait until they became too weak to move.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 16 (CNA)
02/16/08  20:33:58
(By Emmanuelle Tzeng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>French writer Gilles Lapouge, the producer of the most popular TV program on
literature in French broadcasting history, has had a life-long love of books and
literature and insisted Saturday that reading remained important and relevent.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan to promote his latest work, "L'Encre du voyage," at the Taipei
International Book Exhibition, the 85-year-old Lapouge looked back at his career
and had some advice for local students when it comes to reading in an interview
with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Lapouge was one of the creators of the famous French program "Apostrophes" that
ran from 1975 to 1990 and drew consistently high audience shares of 12 percent
in the '80s.</P>
      <P>The show's success stemmed from the popularity of its host, highly regarded
literary critic Bernard Pivot, who in his book "Le Metier de Lire, " or "The
Profession of Reading, " said he read eight hours a day.</P>
      <P>"Pivot's personal charisma and especially his professionalism" were essential to
the program's high ratings, Lapouge said. "After Pivot, it is difficult to see
another literary TV program of quality."</P>
      <P>Not that others haven't tried, including in Taiwan, where there have been many
programs that discuss books and literature and interviewed writers. Those that
did not serve as shameless promoters for local publishers, however, quickly
disappeared from TV screens because of low ratings, and today only one literary
show remains, on CTiTV.</P>
      <P>That doesn't mean, though, that reading is becoming a lost pleasure. On the
contrary, Lapouge is still optimistic about the book market in France.</P>
      <P>"Some people say that French people read less, but it is not true," he says,
noting that in 2007, about 800 novels were published there.</P>
      <P>Lapouge suggests that reading in France has almost become a feminine activity,
as women read a lot of romance novels translated from English. But while
bestsellers lists there are often dominated by foreign books, mostly from the UK
and U.S., he is confident that pure French literature will persist.</P>
      <P>"French people have a strongly  rooted tradition  in pure literature, " he
insisted.</P>
      <P>For Taiwanese youth who bear the constant pressure of exams, Lapouge encouraged
them to spend their time reading "useless" books for pleasure to avoid being
overwhelmed by "useful" books assigned in school.</P>
      <P>Lapouge also had praise for the exhibition, saying that compared to other book
exhibitions, the TIBE "is more lively and the promotion of sales is more
delicate, " as people buy without feeling pressured by vendors.</P>

      <P>The more than 500 Jersey cows introduced into Taiwan since June 2006 have
adapted to Taiwan and begun contributing milk to the local market, the Cabinet-
level Council of Agriculture (COA) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has worked to develop its dairy industry for over 50 years, relying
entirely on breeding Holstein cows until two years ago, when the COA agreed to
allow the import of Jersey cows as dairy cows to sharpen the domestic dairy
industry's competitive edge, according to the COA's Animal Industry Department.</P>
      <P>The  honey-brown  Jersey  cattle  grow  smaller  than  the black-and-white
Holstein, with the weight of an adult cow ranging from 400 kilograms to 450
kilograms, far lighter than the Holstein's 700 kg.</P>
      <P>Their smaller appetites and need for less land area because of their smaller
size, along with their adaptability to Taiwan's heat and food sources, are among
the reasons they are more economical to raise per unit of milk produced than
Holsteins, contributing to the breed's increasing popularity on the island, the
Animal Industry Department said.</P>
      <P>Another attribute of Jersey cows is that their milk has a higher percentage of
butterfat, about 6 percent, than the 3.7-3.8 percent of butterfat contained in
the Holstein cows' milk.</P>
      <P>The high butterfat and protein rates make the Jersey cows' milk more suitable
for making cheese and butter, and as a result local dairy farms are gearing up
to sell Jersey-milk-based products like fresh cream to the local market in the
near future, the Animal Industry Department indicated.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Facing a mature market at home, Taiwan's insurance companies are eyeing China's
underdeveloped insurance sector and its 20 percent annual growth rates for
expansion, a research report by local brokerage firm IBT Securities has
concluded.</P>
      <P>Insurers in Taiwan have become increasingly restless over the slow growth rates
in the domestic insurance market in recent years. The country's insurance
penetration rate -- the ratio of premium revenues to gross domestic product --
ranked third in the world at 14.5 percent in 2006, an indication of limited
growth potential in the future.</P>
      <P>In contrast, China's estimated insurance rate of 2.8 percent in 2006 and its per
capita insurance premium revenue of 493 Chinese yuan leave ample room for
growth, the report noted.</P>
      <P>China's insurance market expanded rapidly in the first half of the decade, with
life insurance premiums of 413.2 billion yuan at the end of 2006, 2.9 times
higher than in 2000, and property and casualty insurance premiums of 150.9
billion yuan, 2.2 times higher than in 2000.</P>
      <P>Chinese government estimates suggest that this growth should continue and even
accelerate in the second half of the decade.</P>
      <P>China's 11th five-year economic plan covering the insurance sector released in
October 2006 estimated that premium revenues in 2010 would be double those in
2005, exceeding 1 trillion yuan, and assets managed by the industry would reach
5 trillion yuan, well above the 1.97 trillion yuan in assets managed at the end
of 2006.</P>
      <P>The plan also expected the insurance penetration rate in China to reach 4
percent by 2010.</P>
      <P>Gaining a foothold in China's closed market, however, could be a major challenge
for local insurers, the report said. China's life insurance market is still
dominated by domestic players, with foreign operators having only a 6 percent
market share.</P>
      <P>And Taiwan's share of that is minimal,  the report said. Taipei-based Cathay
Life Insurance, Taiwan's biggest life insurer, had only 1.37 percent of the
foreign share of China's life insurance market at the end of 2006, the report
said.</P>
      <P>To make inroads into China, local insurers have sought out partners there.
Cathay Life has joined with China Eastern Airlines to set up a life insurance
company in Shanghai, and Taiwan's Shin Kong Life Insurance partnered with Hainan
Airlines to establish a life insurance firm based in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Life Insurance, meanwhile, is negotiating with Xiamen D&amp;D Inc. to set
up a life insurance venture in southern China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's insurers are being tempted by China's potential, even if they suffer
losses there in their first few years of operations, because of the prospect of
a stagnant market at home.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's insurance penetration rate grew only marginally in 2006 to 14.5
percent, from 14.1 percent in 2005 according to the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), and premium income grew only 5
percent to reach US$51.6 billion in 2006.</P>
      <P>The world's average penetration rate in 2006 was 7.5 percent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu expressed optimism Sunday that the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) will engage in negotiations with the ruling party on a proposal
that President Chen Shui-bian initiate a "defensive referendum" to resolve
doubts plaguing two referendums on the country's U.N. bid.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, some opposition "pan-blue" alliance politicians,
noting U.S. opposition to the referendums,  have suggested that Chen introduce
a"defensive  referendum"  or the Legislative Yuan come up with an alternative
referendum in place of the two referendums on Taiwan's U.N. bid to be held
alongside the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Under the Referendum Law, the president has the authority to launch referendums
on matters of national security, referred to as "defensive referendums, " when
the country faces an external threat.</P>
      <P>Speaking  in Kinmen where she was reviewing  several  BOT (build-operate-
transfer) projects proposed by the county government, Lu said that the KMT's
engaging in negotiations on the referendum issue  would  represent  "a real
start to reconciliation  and co-existence" between the ruling and opposition
parties.</P>
      <P>It would be "a critical turning point in the nation's development and help push
the country into a new era," she said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the KMT now controls a large majority in the new legislature, Lu
said that "if the party wants to express its respect and tolerance for
democracy, it should cordially invite President Chen to exercise his powers to
initiate a defensive referendum."</P>
      <P>She said that this would be a sign of goodwill, adding that she believes
President Chen would reciprocate by showing respect for the legislature.</P>
      <P>The vice president also noted that it is the hope of Taiwan's people that the
country gain membership in the United Nations as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, KMT presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou expressed his strong
opposition to the proposal that the president initiate a "defensive referendum"
over the U.N. bid issue, saying that it would represent an abuse of power.</P>
      <P>Ma also said his party supports the U.N.-bid referendums but is opposed to
holding them in tandem with the presidential election.</P>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) announced at the start of this month that
the two referendums -- one initiated by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) on the country joining the United Nations under the name "Taiwan," and the
other launched by the KMT on regaining membership under the name "Republic of
China" or any other "suitable" name -- would be held alongside the presidential
poll.</P>
      <P>Shortly after the announcement, KMT legislative caucus whip Kuo Su-chun  said
the party was in the process  of mapping  out countermeasures to the CEC's move
and that it would make a final decision  on the matter before the first session
of the new legislature opens Feb. 22.</P>

      <P>Nearly all motor vehicles in Taiwan are insured against third-party liability,
the Financial Supervisory Commission said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The commission,  Taiwan's chief financial regulatory  body, reported that as of
the end of 2007, all automobiles in Taiwan and 96 percent of motorcycle owners
were covered by third-party liability insurance.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Compulsory Automobile Liability Insurance Law went into effect in early
1998, requiring all car owners to be insured against legal claims that they
injured or caused damage to others, including passengers in the car or
individuals outside the car.</P>
      <P>A year later, motorcyclists were also required to do the same.</P>
      <P>Official statistics show that as of the end of 2007, a total of 16.62 million
motor vehicles in Taiwan were covered by third-party liability insurance,
comprising 7.19 million automobiles and 9.42 million motorcycles.</P>
      <P>The law was amended in 2005 to increase the amount payable to a killed or maimed
victim in a motor vehicle accident to NT$1.5 million (US$47,275).</P>
      <P>According to the amended law, if a motor vehicle is not covered by a third-party
liability insurance policy that is valid for at least 30 days, the owner is not
allowed to renew his vehicle's license plate, have the vehicle undergo
inspection, or change ownership of the vehicle. An insurance company is required
to notify its clients to renew their third-party liability insurance at least 30
days before their policies expire.</P>
      <P>Under the law, a policyholder's insurance company must provide compensation for
death or injuries to third-party victims, regardless of who may be at fault in a
road accident involving a policy holder.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) vice presidential candidate Vincent Siew
accused the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Sunday of dragging down
Taiwan's economy during its time in office.</P>
      <P>"While the global economy has experienced a high tide of growth over the past
eight years, Taiwan's economy has been at a low ebb during the same period,"
Siew said at a Lunar New Year's gathering of a local Lions Club chapter in
Chungho City.</P>
      <P>"The government, and not the people, is to blame for Taiwan's poor economic
performance during the last eight years," he said.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the administration's ideological polices have led to a flight of
capital and talent that has "bled the country, " and led China-based Taiwanese
businesspeople to think twice about sending capital back to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Siew said that he and KMT presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou will adopt
policies of economic liberalization, especially in terms of cross-strait trade,
that will provide a mechanism to allow for China-based Taiwanese companies to
re-invest in Taiwan and attract foreign capital to the country.</P>
      <P>"For those who are concerned that more liberal economic policies will lead to
even higher unemployment, there's no need to worry, because the companies that
were going to China have already gone," he said.</P>
      <P>Siew further argued that adopting more liberal policies, as championed by the
KMT ticket, is the only way to give Taiwan's economy the chance to develop after
years of failed DPP policies.</P>

      <P>Prices of vegetables have soared by an average of 30 percent to 50 percent after
the Lunar New Year holiday, and they are expected to remain high during the
coming week, according to a spokesman for Siluo Fruit and Vegetables Market in
central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tight supplies caused by reduced harvests during the recent weeks of cold and
rainy weather and increasing demand from schools are likely to keep vegetable
prices high for at least another week, predicted Chiang Li-yuan, an assistant
manager at the country's largest wholesale produce marketing company.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been hit by a cold front since the first day of the Lunar New Year
Feb. 7, causing losses to vegetable, fruit, and fish farmers.</P>
      <P>According to the Council of Agriculture's Agricultural and Food Agency (AFA) ,
the cold spell has led to losses of NT$85.4 million (US$2.67 million) in
aquaculture and NT$57.1 million (US$ 1.79 million) in fruit crops nationwide so
far, especially in the counties of Penghu, Hsinchu, Yilan, Taichung, Kaohsiung,
Miaoli and Yunlin.</P>
      <P>That does not include losses in some parts of the country that have yet to
report the damage, said Tsai Ching-chiang, deputy director of the agency.</P>

      <P>In an inspiring example of traditional Taiwanese culture spreading its influence
around the world, Taiwanese puppet theater has brought joy into the life of a
young American girl suffering from muscular dystrophy.</P>
      <P>A 9-year-old girl named Trisha Stanford fell in love with the artform when she
saw the Taiyuan Puppet Theater Company stage a performance last October at the
Salt Lake City children's hospital where she was being cared for.</P>
      <P>The troupe, led by Huang Wu-shan, a well-known student of Taiwanese puppeteer
master Li Tien-lu, performed at the hospital as part of the Taiwan Cultural
Festival held in Utah's largest city Oct. 15-20.</P>
      <P>The festival, sponsored by the Press Division of the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office in San Francisco and various Taiwan government agencies,
featured Taiwanese film showings, performances, music and culinary arts.</P>
      <P>Little Trisha, who had been in the hospital for three months awaiting spinal
surgery, was immediately drawn to the colorful puppets in the puppet theater
show.</P>
      <P>"The visit by the puppet troupe was one of the highlights in Trisha's young
life," her mother said.</P>
      <P>After the show, Huang taught Trisha some puppet manipulation techniques.
Although it was Trisha's first time handling a puppet, everyone in the troupe
felt she had a natural talent for the artform.</P>
      <P>Just recently, months after the troupe had left Salt Lake City, the U.S.
organizers of the Taiwan Cultural Festival received a package sent from Taiwan
by the troupe containing a DVD of a famous Taiwanese puppet theater film and a
full-sized puppet of the main character in the film that were meant as gifts for
Trisha.</P>
      <P>When the organizers sent the loving gift to the young girl, they learned some
wonderful and moving news. Trisha's surgery had been a success, and she had been
released from hospital in November.</P>
      <P>The nine-year-old was recovering well and was even able to walk short distances
on her own.</P>
      <P>Playing with the gift sent by the troupe, Trisha expressed her love for
Taiwanese puppetry and her wish to be able to visit Taiwan one day to see the
many puppet museums there and learn even more about the traditional Taiwanese
artform.</P>

    <HEADLINE>With Taiwan's help, Genghis Khan returns to Mongolia</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/17/08  20:08:28</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA staff reporter</P>
      <P>Taipei, Feb. 17 (CNA) A huge portrait of Mongolia's great emperor Genghis Khan
(1162-1227) composed of more than 430,000 crystal mosaic tiles will soon be
inaugurated at Ulan Bator's international airport, thanks to the help of several
Rotary Club members from Taipei.</P>
      <P>The installation of the nearly-three-story high Genghis Khan portrait -- made
with 437,000 crystal mosaic tiles by German workers based on a portrait of
Genghis Khan in the National Palace Museum's collection -- is expected to be
completed in April, said Chan Ming-chu, governor of Rotary International
District 3480.</P>
      <P>Already a landmark in Ulan Bator, the Genghis Khan portrait will be a place
where all Mongolian people can conveniently worship and remember their great
national founding father,  said Migeddorj Batchimeg, Mongolia's representative
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Batchimeg, who speaks fluent Mandarin Chinese and has been instrumental in
arranging the placement of the portrait at the Ulan Bator international airport,
expressed her gratitude to members of the Rotary International District 3480 and
National Palace Museum for the precious gift they gave to the Mongolian people.</P>
      <P>Describing Genghis Khan as "the major source of pride" for Mongolia's people,
Batchimeg said he created the foundation for the largest empire in world
history, which encompassed China, the Middle East, Russia and Central Asia at
its peak under Genghis Khan's grandson Kublai Khan, who ruled from 1260 to 1294
and founded the Yuan Dynasty in China.</P>
      <P>During the time Mongolia was closely aligned with the Soviet Union, the Russians
through their proxies in Ulan Bator tried to smear the image of Genghis Khan by
saying he and his army caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people,
Batchimeg asserted.</P>
      <P>After the fall of communism in Mongolia in 1990 and the adoption of new
constitution in 1992, however, Genghis Khan was recognized again as the
country's hero and founding father and has since been worshiped and commemorated
on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>Even the name of the capital city's airport was changed to Genghis Khan
International Airport three years ago, she said.</P>
      <P>To many historians, Genghis Khan remains a puzzle because few artifacts related
to him specifically have been left behind. As a consequence, Mongolians consider
the portrait of Genghis Khan in Taipei's National Palace Museum to be one of the
most precious treasures connecting them to their founding father.</P>
      <P>The 59.4 cm X 47 cm color portrait on a silk sheet is thought to be a likeness
of Genghis Khan in his sixties painted during the era of Kubilai Khan. It is
generally accepted as the most accurate depiction of Genghis Khan and considered
a "must see" by Mongolian officials or citizens whenever they visit Taiwan,
Batchimeg said.</P>
      <P>The mosaic reproduction of the portrait came to life because the Taipei-based
Rotary International District 3480, which had quietly sought to enhance
bilateral relations between Taiwan and Mongolia, knotted sisterhood ties with
the Niislel Rotary Club in Ulan Bator in 2004.</P>
      <P>After paying visits to Taipei and viewing Genghis Khan's portrait at the
National Palace Museum several times, the Niislel Rotary members expressed their
"dream" that the portrait would one day be returned to Mongolia.</P>
      <P>While that dream has yet to be fulfilled, the Rotary Club's Chan decided to do
the next best thing and offer Mongolia a large reproduction based on the
original. Chan's husband and fellow Rotary Club member Wang Chen-jung, who owns
a building materials company that imports Italian and Spanish mosaic tiles, took
the initiative in producing the giant portrait.</P>
      <P>He first approached National Palace Museum officials for their permission to
reproduce the painting, and after long negotiations, the museum finally agreed
to offer the Rotary Club a digitalized image of the portrait early last year.</P>
      <P>A thrilled Wang then ordered expensive 1 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm crystal mosaic tiles
from abroad and recruited mosaic experts from Germany to prepare to travel to
Ulan Bator to put together the portrait, which would stand 9 meters tall and 6
meters wide.</P>
      <P>The tiles were shipped to Ulan Bator in May last year, and the German workers
assembled the portrait in September. It will be the centerpiece of an 11 meter
by 7 meter monument to Genghis Khan when work is completed.</P>
      <P>To many historians and peoples around the world, Genghis Khan is viewed as a
destructive warlord capable of breathtaking cruelty, but Batchimeg said the man
revered by Mongolians was responsible for many positive developments.</P>
      <P>Genghis Khan's mounted Mongol army consolidated the Silk Road, laying a solid
foundation for trade, cultural and religious exchanges between East and West,
and he also laid down laws that were similar to Mongolia's existing
constitution, Batchimeg said.</P>
      <P>Diplomacy was developed in the Mongolian empire, where foreign envoys were
respected and well-treated, while "golden plates" -- similar to today's
passports -- were used to facilitate diplomatic exchanges among nations,
Batchimeg noted.</P>
      <P>And now Mongolians will be brought closer to their founding father through a
project made possible with the assistance of Batchimeg's Taipei Office, the Ulan
Bator mayor, an ad hoc committee organized by the Mongolian Civil Aeronautic
Administration and officials from the Genghis Khan International Airport, Chan
said.</P>
      <P>Chan said she and her husband as well as other Rotary Club members  will travel
to Ulan Bator in April to witness  the inauguration of the Genghis Khan
monument.</P>
      <P>The two have also decided to visit rural areas of Mongolia later this year to
inspect water-supply  systems and help with the construction of deep-water wells
around the drought-striken country.</P>
      <P>Batchimeg, who took graduate-level courses at Taipei's National Chengchi
University in 1997-1999, is a graduate of Beijing Language and Culture
University.</P>
      <P>One of the key figures in arranging the establishment of Taiwan and Mongolia
representative  offices in each other's country, Batchimeg said she is glad that
a result of increased bilateral ties Taiwanese friends no longer ask her
questions like "Did you ride a horse to work in Mongolia?"</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's textile industry revived by government efforts</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's textile industry is recovering from the impact of the 2005 removal of
textile quotas worldwide, thanks to government efforts to breathe new life into
the industry, according to the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's garment, towel and socks factories were hard-hit after January 2005
because international buyers shifted their orders to other countries where
production costs were lower.</P>
      <P>Most of these factories were initially forced to depend on the domestic market
for survival, but according to the IDB, many have since recovered, benefiting
from an NT$735 million IDB program that helped many small enterprises in the
textile industry upgrade themselves and secure 1,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>One example of the plan's success was sweater factories that made use of an IDB
plan to allow imports of wool yarn from China. They used the yarn to weave
patches that were then exported to other countries and sewn into sweaters.</P>
      <P>A total of 2.42 million sweaters have been exported in this manner since July
2005, according to bureau statistics, boosting average factory capacity
utilization rates in Taiwan's sweater industry from 20 percent in 2005 to 80
percent at present.</P>
      <P>Another program launched in April 2006 to help Taiwan's towel industry, coupled
with measures to impose anti-dumping duties on towel imports from China, has
helped Taiwan's towel factories increase their capacity utilization rate to 60
percent.</P>
      <P>As a result, output value increased by over 50 percent to NT$480 million in
2007, bureau figures show.</P>
      <P>The socks industry also has shown increased competitiveness, with its exports
between January and September 2007 reaching US$85.23 million, up US$2.5 million
from the same period of 2006.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's textile industry had been a major foreign exchange earner for five
decades. However, growing competition from other countries in recent years has
forced several textile plants to relocate to Southeast Asia, China, and Central
America, where production costs are lower.</P>
      <P>The industry has since shifted its export focus to midstream and upstream fiber
and yarn products. The primary destinations for Taiwan's textile exports are
Hong Kong, China, the United States, and Vietnam.</P>

      <P>A lukewarm response to the annual Taipei International Book Exhibition has many
publishers concerned that attendance and sales at this year's show will fall
short of levels attained in recent years.</P>
      <P>With the six-day book fair set to end on Feb. 18, many publishers are
attributing the lack of enthusiasm this year to the cold weather, declining
readership in Taiwan, fewer student visitors because of the early opening of
schools, and the lack of international interest.</P>
      <P>Declining  readership  and less foreign  participation  are particularly
troubling trends, observers say. The number of foreign publishers fell to 360
from last year's 370, while the total number of publishers also decreased to 687
from 711 year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Vincent Wei, project manager of the publisher Chiu Ko Publishing Co. said Sunday
that the sluggish sales are the result of slumping readership in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Our sales may be more or less the same as last year, but we are witnessing a
declining number of local readers who actually buy books at the fair," Wei said.</P>
      <P>Wei indicated that Chiu Ko, like other local publishers, are trying to save the
industry by creating more titles that cater to the public's tastes.</P>
      <P>The fair's licensing  business has also fallen off as an increasing number of
Taiwanese publishers no longer see the show as an important venue for book
licensing, said a senior worker of another major local publisher, who declined
to be identified.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's publishers can no longer rely on the fair for their licensing
business, adding that many companies would rather explore overseas opportunities
at other foreign international book fairs like the Frankfurt Book Fair.</P>
      <P>The thriving  Beijing  book fair also has hurt  licensing opportunities at the
Taipei book fair, said Amelie Sun, a marketing director of the French-language
publisher Librairie Le Pigeonnier, which represents French publishers at the
fair.</P>
      <P>"The international publishers are reducing their presence because they believe
the Beijing book fair is more lucrative as it helps them march into China's huge
book market," Sun explained.</P>
      <P>There are some exceptions to the trend, as the themed country of the fair,
Australia, which displayed more than 1,000 titles from 24 Australian publishers
in its pavilion, reached a broader readership through the show.</P>
      <P>"Unlike the local publishers, our books appeal to a different group of readers
who take a high interest in foreign cultures, " said Steve Chiu, the senior
manager of the Australian Commerce and Industry Office.</P>
      <P>Chiu said the sales and licensing business at the Australian Pavilion have
exceeded expectations, with children's books and non-fiction leading the way.</P>
      <P>"Compared with the status in previous years, we discovered that Taiwan readers'
capacity is improving, as they are now focusing on a more diverse array of
titles rather than just the English-learning publications," he added.</P>
      <P>About 400,000 people attended last year's book fair.  The organizer of the book
fair, the Taipei Book Fair Foundation predicted that attendance for this year
could remain about the same, with a record 100,000 visits recorded on Saturday,
when the weather turned warmer.</P>
      <P>The foundation will announce this year's overall attendance at the end of the
fair Monday.</P>

Tagesspiegel Readers' Prize in Berlin, the film's local producer said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The film, directed by Taiwanese director Singing Chen, was chosen from among the
36 movies from 33 countries competing in the 2008 Berlin International Film
Festival's Forum for New Cinema, which is aimed at honoring young filmmakers.</P>
      <P>By winning the award, Chen received 3,000 euros in prize money. The award marked
yet another recognition for Taiwanese films from the annual Berlin film fest
following a Teddy Bear Award won by "Spider Lilies" in 2007.</P>
      <P>According to a statement issued by the "God Man Dog" producer, the film has
attracted much attention since its premiere at the annual Berlin film festival
that began Feb. 7 and ran until Sunday.</P>
      <P>"The film consistently drew packed audience each time it was screened during the
festival, " the statement said, adding that major German newspapers,  including
Der Tagesspiegel,  a Berlin-based national daily that organizes the Tagesspiegel
Readers' Prize, have given prominent coverage and ran many reviews about the
film.</P>
      <P>Although the Tagesspiegel Readers' Prize is not a formal award presented by
Berlin film festival organizers, the German paper attached great importance to
the competition, the statement said. It invited nine professionals from various
fields to judge all entries competing in the Forum for New Cinema.</P>
      <P>The statement quoted reports from Berlin as saying that the nine members of the
jury unanimously agreed that "God Man Dog" was the most appealing. "They decided
to give the laurel to the film without even any discussion," the statement said.</P>
      <P>Chen was quoted as having said at the presentation that she feels honored and
excited to receive recognition from the most important German newspaper.</P>
      <P>Recalling that she overcame a lot of difficulties producing the film, Chen said
she takes great delight and comfort in winning the award. "The award vindicates
all the pains I endured during the production process," she added.</P>
      <P>The film tries to unite three disparate stories of unhappy people, touching on
emotional problems of urbanites, social problems of aborigines and
commodification of body. A fateful car accident brought together these three
group of people from different social classes, religions and ethnicity.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese medical doctors intending to practice medicine in China face many
hurdles,  including high thresholds for getting medical licenses and differences
in healthcare operations on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, medical sources
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>China allowed Taiwanese medical practitioners to take part in its accreditation
test for the first time last July, attracting 270 hopefuls from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to a Taiwanese medical educator who spoke on condition of anonymity,
more than half of the Taiwanese hopefuls have practiced medicine for more than
10 years, but about a quarter of them even failed to pass the first phase of the
test.</P>
      <P>"Three of the Taiwanese doctors who flunked the first phase of the test have
been practicing medicine for more than 30 years and 18 have a 20-year
seniority," he said.</P>
      <P>Quoting those who took part in that test, the medical educator said differences
in Chinese writing systems and languages used in medical records form the first
hurdles for Taiwanese hopefuls.</P>
      <P>"Many Taiwanese doctors were not familiar with simplified Chinese characters and
Chinese clinical terms," the educator said. In Taiwan, medical doctors use
traditional Chinese characters and usually write medical records in English.</P>
      <P>There  are also many differences  in practical  healthcare operations, he said.
For instance, protective garb worn by medical professionals in operating rooms
is disposable in Taiwan, but the article should be given back after one service
cycle in China. Chinese medical practitioners are also required to follow
established steps in wearing and recycling protective garb.</P>
      <P>As examination hopefuls had to face three examiners in the first phase of the
test, which focused on medical skills, the test results could also be affected
by the examiners' state of mind or personal preferences.  Some examiners were
quoted as having told young Taiwanese hopefuls that as they were still young,
they should tried later.</P>
      <P>"Given all these factors, it's hard for Taiwanese hopefuls to get high marks in
skill tests," the educator said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, both Taiwanese and Chinese manpower brokers said they were
surprised by the large number of Taiwanese participants in last year's medical
accreditation test in China.</P>
      <P>Even though getting China's medical license is not easy, market sources said,
China's opening of medical accreditation test for Taiwanese practitioners is
still a boon.</P>
      <P>"The measure opens a window of opportunity for Taiwanese medical professionals
as Taiwan's medical service system is mature and saturated, " said a Taiwanese
hospital operator familiar with medical market situation on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lin You-chun, a China-trained Taiwanese doctor at a general hospital invested by
a Taiwanese business group in the central Chinese province of Hunan, said
China's medical service industry is promising and has a strong growth potential.</P>
      <P>"Even though many problems exist in doctors-patients relations and hospital
management, there is still ample room for medical service and healthcare market
to grow in China, " Lin said, adding that it is why he and his brother had
traveled to China to study medicine many years ago.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's telecommunications equipment industry is expected to rebound from a low
ebb in 2007 and achieve production of NT$907.5 billion (US$28.595 billion) this
year, a research unit under the Ministry of Economic Affairs forecast Monday.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Technology Information Services (ITIS) forecast the industry's
production would increase by 24 percent over the figure of NT$732 billion for
2007.</P>
      <P>Growth in production value was a relatively low 4.6 percent for last year,
according to ITIS tallies.</P>
      <P>ITIS industry analyst Lin Yu-ru said that broadband Internet equipment demand
has been relatively stable, but due to the maturation of products, growth in
this area will be relatively small this year.</P>
      <P>She added that wireless telecommunications products will be the main driving
force behind growth in the industry's production value.</P>
      <P>In the area, domestic manufacturers are expected to continue to diversify their
source of customers and expand their orders, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Another driving force behind growth in production value of Taiwan's
telecommunications equipment industry will be GPS products, with the market for
portable navigation device products expected to continue to grow steadily as
demand in emerging economies increases, she said.</P>
      <P>Lin further said that these two driving forces are expected to see growth in
production of over 10 percent for 2008, which will allow Taiwan's
telecommunications equipment industry to rebound from a low point in 2007.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has better conditions and reasons for declaring independence than Kosovo,
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) vice presidential candidate Su Tseng-chang
claimed Monday.</P>
      <P>Su, running mate of presidential candidate Frank Hsieh, said that "Taiwan, the
hard-built ship of democracy with a polished deck, should never be sailed into
another country's harbor."</P>
      <P>Speaking at a rally marking the establishment of the Hsieh-Su campaign
headquarters in the southern county of Chiayi, Su said the Taiwan people were
allowed to directly elect their president only after a struggle lasting several
generations.</P>
      <P>By comparison, he said, Kosovo, with a population of 2 million, declared
independence from Serbia earlier Monday after losing some 200,000 people in
conflict. Despite an economy on the verge of collapse, the people of Kosovo
decided to be their own masters, courageously standing up to build a new country
of their own.</P>
      <P>Unlike Kosovo, which is "just beginning in terms of building a democratic
nation, " Taiwan is well-developed and now a full-fledged democracy, thanks to
decades of efforts by the Taiwanese people, according to Su.</P>
      <P>Calling for voters in the Chiayi area not to allow Taiwan's hard-earned
democracy to go down the drain, Su urged the Chiayi people to vote for the DPP
ticket in the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>According to Su, although the DPP suffered a humiliating loss in the Jan. 12
legislative elections, the voters should not allow the main opposition
Kuomintang -- which now holds an absolute majority in the legislature -- to
"turn Taiwan into a winner-take-all society."</P>
      <P>Describing the presidential election as a "last-ditch battle to defend Taiwan's
sovereignty, " Su claimed that the DPP ticket has the "only candidates" who can
protect Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Education denied Monday that the student loan default ratio has
surpassed 12 percent and that the amount of overdue student loans has risen to a
record high NT$4.41 billion (US$130.4  million)  as reported by the local
Chinese-language China Times Monday.</P>
      <P>"I don't know where the daily got its figures from," said Hou Chou-fei, head of
the ministry's Department of Higher Education, noting that the actual student
loan default ratio currently stands at under 3 percent.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference held to respond to the report, Hou said that no
banks or lending institutions have applied for repayment of any overdue student
loans by the Small and Medium Business Credit Guarantee Fund which serves as
guarantor for student loans at the request of the government.</P>
      <P>"There is no need to be concerned as the ministry has the student loan situation
completely under control," he said.</P>
      <P>According to the China Times report, over 900,000 students have received student
loans amounting to over NT$150 billion in total, with the loan default ratio
reaching 12.11 percent.</P>
      <P>Ho said that the actual number of students who have received loans is closer to
800,000 and that the loan default ratio stands at only 2.44 percent.</P>
      <P>He further said that the ministry has a mechanism in place for recovering
overdue student loans and that the success rate for recovering loans overdue for
less than one year is quite high.</P>

      <P>All but one of the traditional Lantern Festival food products recently tested by
Taipei City's Department of Health were found to be up to par in terms of safety
standards, bureau officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>In the survey conducted ahead of the festival which traditionally comes at the
end of the Lunar New Year holiday, on Feb. 21 this year, a total of 62 food
products, ranging from glutinous rice dumplings to red bean sweets, were tested
at retail food outlets and traditional markets around the city.</P>
      <P>The survey included tests on the levels of preservatives and artificial coloring
in the products.</P>
      <P>Only one sample, a glutinous rice ball snack, was found to have excess amounts
of the food preservative benzoic acid, which inhibits growth of mold and some
bacteria. The product contained 2.82 g/kg of the substance, well above the
maximum prescribed safety limit of 1.0 g/kg.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials said that according to law, food manufacturers can be fined
between NT$30,000 (US$937) and NT$50,000 for producing products with excess
amounts of preservatives, artificial coloring and other additives.</P>
      <P>Products found to contain excess amounts of such substances will also be pulled

    <TEXT>
      <P>The administration has continued to relax restrictions on cross-Taiwan Strait
exchanges and believes that procrastination should not be tolerated, a high-
ranking official said Monday, speaking on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>The government is not dragging its feet on pushing beneficial cross-strait
policies, including relaxing requirements for certain sectors to benefit from
the "mini links" and enlarging the sphere of the "mini links" application, as
well as considering an amnesty on Taiwanese businessmen who have invested in
China without informing the government, the official from the Presidential
Office said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the "mini links" -- initiated by Taiwan in January 2001 to allow
Fujian-based Taiwanese businessmen, or taishang, to travel directly between
China and Taiwan via the Taiwan-held outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu -- are
so far limited to Fujian-based taishang and certain other groups of people, the
administration is mulling whether to allow taishang based in other Chinese
provinces and areas to use the "mini links, " he noted.</P>
      <P>The official made the remarks in response to an Economic Daily News report that
same day speculating that President Chen Shui-bian is likely to adjust or relax
his China policies prior to the end of his term May 20.</P>
      <P>He confirmed that Chen met with a group of chairmen of Taiwan businessmen's
associations in China for a discussion Feb. 15 arranged by Hung Chi-chang,
chairman of the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation.</P>
      <P>During the discussion, according to the official, many taishang expressed their
intention to relocate their investments back to Taiwan owing to China's
deteriorating investment climate, including higher levels of taxation and
stricter government regulations on foreign-financed investment projects.</P>
      <P>But taishang,  who have skirted government regulations  on investing in China,
were quoted as having expressed worries that they could immediately face
penalties such as fines or the imposition of retroactive taxes should they
return to Taiwan with their investment capital.</P>
      <P>They expressed hope during the meeting with Chen that the government will build
a mechanism to facilitate the inflow of large amounts of funds from China, the
official said.</P>
      <P>The official claimed that the administration is doing what it should to take
better care of taishang but has not decided whether those policies should be
implemented before or after the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, main opposition Kuomintang presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou
expressed welcome to the notion that Chen will announce a relaxation on cross-
strait policies prior to May 20.</P>
      <P>Accusing Chen of failing to relax his China policies over the past nearly eight
years in office, Ma said the reported plan of a relaxation, "made on the eve of
his stepping down, " is still a welcome development.</P>

      <P>Finding ways for Taiwanese exporters to cope with rising raw material prices
while making their export deployments worldwide this year is an important topic
that needs to be addressed, a Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) official said
Monday.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by customs authorities, Taiwan's foreign trade
totaled US$42.75 billion in January, with exports registering an annual growth
of 11.9 percent and imports reaching a year-on-year increase of 14.8 percent.</P>
      <P>The increased imports resulted in a shrinkage in the nation's trade surplus in
January, which registered US$1.53 billion, a decrease of 16.5 percent over the
same month of last year.</P>
      <P>Due to surging global prices of oil and raw materials, Taiwan's imports of crude
oil reached US$2.52 billion in January, which represented a 27.1 percent growth
over the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, imports of steel products stood at US$1.18 billion in January, an
increase of 8.9 percent over the same month of last year, with imports of
cereals reaching US$444 million,  representing year-on-year growth of 29.4
percent.</P>
      <P>The BOFT official noted that with the rapid economic rise of China, India,
Brazil, Russia and Eastern Europe over the last few years, prices of
construction raw materials in world markets are also increasing.</P>
      <P>In addition, the official went on, the demand for construction projects spawned
by the approaching 2008 Beijing Olympics has caused surges in the prices of
cement, steel and other metals.</P>
      <P>"As Taiwan's exports focus on machinery, electrical products and basic metals,
with the exports of these products accounting for more than 50 percent of its
total, it is easy for its exports to be affected by global price hikes of raw
materials, " the official said.</P>
      <P>"Local exporters this year need to reduce the negative impact on them caused by
these price hikes," he added.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese student captured the top prize at a recent international circus
festival in Paris for his outstanding skills with the diabolo, a traditional
Chinese folk toy.</P>
      <P>Lin Wei-liang, a freshman at National Taipei University of Education, won the
President of the Republic of France Award, the top prize, for his diabolo
routine at the 29th Festival Modial du Cirque de Demain, Lin' s coach Tseng Wen-
hsiu said Monday in an interview with the CNA.</P>
      <P>Lin also won first prize in the "public choice" category at the festival, held
Jan.31 -Feb. 3 with the aim of providing a platform for new and up-and-coming
artists to showcase their innovations.</P>
      <P>The annual event, conducted every winter in Paris, is one of the four major
circus arts competitions along with China's Wuqiao International Circus Festival
and the Wuhan Acrobatic Festival, as well as the prestigious International
Circus Festival of Monte Carlo in Monaco, Tseng added.</P>
      <P>Noting that almost all the contestants were from professional acrobatic troupes
from China, the United States, Europe and Africa, Tseng said it was particularly
difficult for Lin, an amateur acrobat, to steal the show.</P>
      <P>"Lin is the first Taiwanese delegate eligible to compete in the event and the
first in Taiwan to win top prize in the festival's diabolo category," Tseng went
on.</P>
      <P>The Chinese embassy in Paris tried to interfere in Lin's participation by
insisting that event organizers ban him from wearing and carrying the Republic
of China flag and demanding that he use the name "Taiwan, China" to attend the
competition. Lin especially stressed that he was from Taiwan during the award
presentation ceremony.</P>
      <P>After the competition, Lin and Tseng traveled to Belgium to take part in a local

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that he has instructed the government to do
whatever it could to help the Cloud Gate Dance Theater recover after a fire
destroyed  the world-famous company's rehearsal studio a week ago.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a get-together with members of Taiwan's literati circles to mark
the beginning of the Year of the Rat, Chen said he phoned Lin Hwai-min --
founder and choreographer of the 35-year-old dance company -- "in real time" to
express his concern soon after Cloud Gate's 1,324 square-meter rehearsal studio,
costumes, props and production archives were burned down on Feb. 11.</P>
      <P>The fire is believed to have been caused by an electrical short circuit.</P>
      <P>Chen said he also immediately instructed the Cabinet-level Council for Cultural
Affairs to provide assistance to Lin and his dance company.</P>
      <P>The president said the blaze saddened him and he could hardly handle the
feelings of grief toward Cloud Gate's losses.</P>
      <P>"I was wondering why there were various investment or business deals worth over
NT$10 billion (US$312 million) under discussion in Taiwan everyday, but few
people were willing to invest in outstanding cultural groups like Cloud Gate,"
he said.</P>
      <P>"Is there anything wrong with the country's  policies  or regulatory systems?"
he asked, adding that the Cloud Gate fire could provide a chance for the entire
country to reflect.</P>
      <P>The Cloud Gate, known for blending Asian mythology, folklore and aesthetics with
a modern sensibility, was founded by Lin in 1973. Among its best known works are
"Nine Songs, "Moon Water" and the "Cursive" trilogy inspired by Chinese brush
calligraphy.</P>
      <P>Since the Cloud Gate Dance Theatre is slated for a series of performances in the
United States and Europe starting in April, Lin said the most urgent matter is
finding a place to rehearse.</P>
      <P>"We are lucky to be allowed to rehearse in places provided by the Taipei
National University of the Arts and in the Shih-ming Hall of the Taiwan Cement
Building, " Lin said, adding that "we still need to find a permanent studio for
the long term."</P>

      <P>A blaze that burned down the warehouse-like rehearsal studio of Taiwan's world-
famous dance troupe has placed it on local newspapers' front page for the first
time in its 35 year history, the founder said Sunday, lamenting the fact that it
took a disaster to raise the troupe's profile.</P>
      <P>The Cloud Gate Dance Theater -- known for blending Asian mythology, folklore and
aesthetics with a modern sensibility -- has staged over 1,500 shows locally and
globally over the years, with each attracting an average of 60,000 people.</P>
      <P>The theater is generally regarded as having made a major contribution to raising
Taiwan's global image.</P>
      <P>However, the theater's founder, Lin Hwai-min, complained that Cloud Gate's
performances had never been covered by local newspapers as a front-page story
until the fire early last Monday, which he said reflected a general lack of
understanding of the performing arts in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while addressing a group of audience at an international
book fair, held in the capital in Taipei on Feb. 13-18.</P>
      <P>Lin, also the troupe's choreographer, received flowers and cheers of
encouragement from dozens people in the audience.</P>
      <P>The fire, believed to be caused by an electrical short circuit, destroyed the
theater's 1,324 square-meter rehearsal studio in suburban Taipei County in
northern Taiwan, as well as costumes, props and production archives.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin admitted that the rehearsal studio was an illegal building.</P>
      <P>"Over the past 16 years, despite the blazing heat in the summer and freezing
cold in the winter at the illegal iron warehouse, we felt as if we were in
heaven, "he said.</P>
      <P>Lin explained that the troupe chose the place as a rehearsal studio due to a
lack of funds, a problem he stressed is faced by all performing groups in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the Cloud Gate began performing overseas from 1975. The
theater put on more than 50 shows in eight countries across the world's seven
continents last year, and is scheduled to stage 121 performances at home and
abroad this year.</P>
      <P>The troupe will depart for the United States and Europe for a series of
performances starting in April.</P>
      <P>When the theater returns to Taiwan in June, it will begin to use a site in
Taipei offered by the Cabinet-level Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) as a
temporary rehearsal studio, Lin said.</P>
      <P>At the event, Lin also criticized President Chen Shui-bian for failing to carry
out his campaign pledge to establish a culture ministry during his eight-year
term, which will end in May.</P>
      <P>"Of course. President Chen is not the first president in Taiwan who does not
attach importance to culture," Lin said.</P>
      <P>In the latest Feb. 14 issue of his e-paper, Chen expressed regret over the fire
and lauded the theater's contribution to Taiwan's art and cultural sector over
the years.</P>
      <P>Chen further urged local companies to give financial support to the Cloud Gate
and other local performing groups.</P>
      <P>He added that the government also needs to review its policy on the country's
cultural development.</P>
      <P>According to recent remarks made by Council for Cultural Affairs Chairman Wang
Tuoh, Lin has declined a proposal made by Chen that state-run enterprises offer
emergency relief funds to the theater.</P>
      <P>On Monday, Lin visited Taipei County's Fire Bureau and offered his appreciation
to 175 firefighters who were dispatched to put out the flame.</P>
      <P>As a Buddhist, Lin described the firefighters as "Bodhisattva," a Buddhist deity
who had vowed to come to the rescue of all beings who cry out for help.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is pushing for the establishment of a national research
repository system to increase global visibility of and ease access to local
academic institutes' research findings, an education ministry official said
Monday.</P>
      <P>The system -- an online platform for collecting, preserving, and disseminating
an education or research institute's intellectual output in digital form -- is
modeled after one created by Taiwan's top university, National Taiwan
University, in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Commissioned by the Ministry of Education in 2006, National Taiwan University
(NTU)  recently completed  establishing  its institutional repository, or IR.</P>
      <P>The repository allows an institute to preserve materials such as research
journal articles, conference papers, research reports, slides, and teaching
plans, as well as administrative documents, in digital files and to establish a
Web site for a full-text search.</P>
      <P>The education ministry official pointed out that the amount of research papers
generated by Taiwan's academia is no less than other developed countries';
however, the citation frequency of Taiwan's research papers was relatively low
compared with other countries owing to difficult access to and incomplete
preservation of Taiwan's material.  Having an institutional repository is
believed to be the solution to the problem, the official added.</P>
      <P>As part of a policy to promote the repository system among educational

    <HEADLINE>Opposition lawmakers demand disbanding of private defense company</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  18  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) demanded Monday
that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government immediately disband the
private defense company -- Taiwan Goal -- it set up last month to handle
Taiwan's arms deals with other countries.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kuo Su-chun, a whip of the KMT legislative caucus, warned at a press
conference that if Premier Chang Chung-hsiung does not disband the company, the
KMT-dominated new legislature will adopt a resolution after opening its first
session Feb. 22 to forbid the Ministry of National Defense from becoming a
founding shareholder of Taiwan Goal or from signing any contracts with the
company.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that if the defense ministry has already entered into contracts with
Taiwan Goal, the KMT caucus will boycott all related government budgets to
prevent public funds from being invested in the company.</P>
      <P>She added that if the KMT gets back into power in the March 22 presidential
election, the new KMT government will not ratify any contracts with Taiwan Goal
and will immediately disband the company.</P>
      <P>Last week, the premier confirmed the controversial establishment of the private
defense company with public funds from various government agencies and state-
owned corporations to handle Taiwan's foreign arms transactions. He defended the
move as necessary to help upgrade Taiwan's arms industry.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) also confirmed that Taiwan Goal
completed registration with the MOEA Jan. 28 as a private company, with capital
of NT$1 billion (US$31.15 million) and paid-in capital totaling NT$80 million,
and that Wu Nai-jen,  a DPP heavyweight and head of China Steel Machinery Corp.
-- a subsidiary of the formerly state-owned China Steel Corp. (CSC) -- serves as
chairman of the company.</P>
      <P>MOEA data shows that Taiwan Goal has a seven-member board of directors, with
three seats going to the defense ministry, which will contribute 45 percent of
Taiwan Goal's capital. The company's office is located in Taipei 101 -- one of
the world's tallest buildings.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Goal is registered to deal in a variety of businesses, including the
import and export of arms and weaponry systems; sales of garments and
accessories,  industrial explosives,  precision instruments,  and batteries of
all types; and product design, according to the MOEA.</P>
      <P>Minister of National Defense Lee Tien-yu has acknowledged that although the
defense ministry is the largest shareholder, the company will be beyond the
control of his ministry.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative caucus whip Lai Ching-te told the news media that the DPP
administration, pushed by Vice Premier Chiou I-jen, set up the company. Lai
contended that under the National Defense Law, the government has the right to
establish such a company, and that no matter which party wins power in the next
election, it should allow the company to continue operating.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmakers said they believe Taiwan Goal was founded as a private company in
an attempt to avoid legislative supervision over arms deals with other
countries.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that Taiwan's inclusion in international
organizations is in the mutual interest of Taiwan and Japan, and appealed to
pro-Taiwan Japanese lawmakers for their continuing support.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a ceremony in which he presented medals to Shinji Sato and Takeo
Hiranuma, the former and current heads of the Japan-ROC Diet Members'
Consultative Council, Chen thanked the two and the council for their efforts in
helping Taiwan join global organizations and hoped those efforts would continue
in the future.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has unsuccessfully sought membership in the United Nations for 15
consecutive years, thwarted by opposition from permanent Security Council member
China, and is seeking backing for its bid this year from non-allied friends such
as Japan.</P>
      <P>The president also commended the council for its efforts in promoting relations
between Taiwan and Japan, describing current ties between the two countries as
"the best in history."</P>
      <P>He cited bilateral trade exceeding US$60 billion in 2007 and Taiwanese and
Japanese making a combined 2.5 million visits to each other's countries as signs
of the strong ties.</P>
      <P>The council, better known as the Nikakon, consists of some 240 Japanese
lawmakers from across the political spectrum. It was established soon after
Japan switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1972 to maintain
unofficial ties with Taiwan and has actively promoted closer bilateral
exchanges.</P>
      <P>Chen specifically lauded Hiranuma for helping Taiwan gain full membership in the
World Trade Organization (WTO) in his capacity as Japan's minister of economy,
trade, and industry in 2001.</P>
      <P>In 2005, Chen said, Hiranuma was head of the lawmakers' council and successfully
appealed to the Japanese government to grant visa-free treatment to Taiwanese
tourists visiting Japan.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, due to Hiranuma's efforts in 2007, Japan and Taiwan decided to
recognize drivers' licenses issued by each other's government, the president
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Japan have close trade ties and commerce cooperation despite an
absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Promoting Taiwanese literature abroad difficult: Writer</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 18 (CNA)
02/18/08  21:32:49
(By Emmanuelle Tzeng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Li Ang, one of Taiwan's best known writers abroad, is pessimistic over Taiwanese
literature's future on the international market, saying "it is an inevitable
trend that writing is a sunset industry."</P>
      <P>"In past decades,  Taiwanese writers have made efforts to introduce their
creations to the world and have gained fruitful results, but as to the future, I
can only say that Taiwan will have a very rough road, " the outspoken Li said
Monday at a workshop organized by the Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA).</P>
      <P>The 56-year-old  Li has reportedly had more of her works translated into foreign
languages than any other Taiwanese writer. Her best known novel, "The Butcher's
Wife" (1983) , has been translated into a dozen languages, including English,
French and German.</P>
      <P>She attributed the retreat of Taiwanese literature to the government's lack of
ambition, international trends, and pressure on Taiwan from its giant neighbor,
China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan faced a particularly difficult challenge in the area of Chinese
literature, Li asserted, because writers from China are drawing the attention of
western publishers while Taiwan remains a distant island unnoticed by readers in
the West, especially those in Europe.</P>
      <P>"The Taiwanese government has no ambition and foresight in promoting culture,"
said Li in explaining Taiwan's inability to crack overseas literary markets.</P>
      <P>She believed that South Korea, which has organized conferences on cross-
continental literature in recent years, could be a model for the country in the
future.</P>
      <P>Not all observers at the workshop held on the sidelines of the Taipei
International Book Exhibition were as pessimistic as Li.</P>
      <P>Huang Ying-che,  professor of Chinese literature  at Aichi University in Japan,
and Liao Ping-hui, the director general of the National Science Council's
Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, said Taiwanese literature had
strengths that could appeal to foreign readers if technical obstacles could be
overcome.</P>
      <P>Liao acknowledged that Taiwanese literature faced a big challenge to gain
international attention, but not because of cultural gaps or competition with
China. The problem, Liao said, is a lack of translators who can faithfully and
elegantly translate Taiwanese novels into foreign languages, in part because
they are not paid enough.</P>
      <P>Huang said Taiwanese writers could develop followings because they are more
sophisticated on topics like national and gender identification than other Asian
writers.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese literature can attract foreign readers' attention with its multiple
cultures. That's our advantage, " Huang said.</P>
      <P>"What we need are good writers,  professional translators, publishers with broad
perspectives and aid from government, " said Huang in describing how to promote
local works abroad.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Domestic airlines must create new demand to survive: experts</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  18 (CNA)
02/18/08  21:33:19
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several air travel industry experts said Taiwan's domestic airlines must reduce
their supply or create new demand in order to weather challenges they face due
to increasing rail travel and rising fuel costs.</P>
      <P>Fang Chih-chiang, president of the Taipei Airlines Association, told a CNA
reporter in a telephone interview Sunday that all of Taiwan's four airlines
operating domestic flights have encountered financial difficulties in the last
few years due largely to the conveniences offered by land travel operators and
the rising oil prices.</P>
      <P>Among the four airlines -- Far Eastern Air Transport Co. (FAT) , TransAsia
Airways, Mandarin Airlines and UNI Air -- the FAT has applied recently for
bankruptcy protection after it reported debts of NT$9.99 billion (US$315
million) at the end of September 2007 and could no longer pay its bills. Like
Taiwan's other carriers, FAT has been hit hard by a downturn in domestic air
travel, partly due to competition from a new high speed rail service launched in
January 2007.</P>
      <P>The other three Taiwanese domestic airlines meanwhile were also struggling to
survive after they started to cut back on some domestic routes in the western
part of Taiwan last May.</P>
      <P>Fang admitted that the airlines were facing difficulties because of there has
been an excessive supply over demand during the last few years.</P>
      <P>He suggested that these airlines allow the market to decide their fate or create
new demand for the air traffic, including operating direct flights across the
Taiwan Strait to mainland China.</P>
      <P>"Although the direct air transport across Taiwan Strait is not a cure-all drug,
it will really create some business opportunities under the current situation, "
Fang said.</P>
      <P>But a political stalemate between Taipei and Beijing has made opening direct
flights impossible any time soon, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, National Cheng Kung University professor Tai Tzuo-min noted that
domestic air flights have its necessity and if all the airlines stop their
routes in the west part of Taiwan, it will create a monopoly by the Taiwan High-
Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) , which has already taken passengers from the airlines.</P>
      <P>The 345 km-long rail system links Taipei in the north and Kaohsiung in the
south, the two largest cities in Taiwan, shortening travel time by rail from the
original four-and-a-half hours to 90 minutes.</P>
      <P>When the high-speed rail system was under construction, the four airlines
already predicted trouble for the future and began expanding into Asian routes.</P>
      <P>Although the four airlines were allowed to open some charter flight routes to
other Asian regions, including South Korea, Hong Kong and Japan, their income
from those flights were unstable. Many of the airlines hoped that the government
could open direct transport between the two sides of Taiwan Strait, said an
aviation source who requested anonymity.</P>
      <P>Citing the example of Japan, whose Tokyo-Nagoya air routes had to be halted
after its high-speed rail Shinkansen was launched, a Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) official admitted that now the only way for the Taiwanese
domestic airlines to survive is to expand into international and cross-Strait
routes.</P>
      <P>According  to  statistics  released  by  the  Ministry  of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) last week, the number of domestic air traffic passengers
dropped to a 15-year low last year.</P>
      <P>During the 2001-2006 period, the number of domestic passengers declined each
year, with ridership on routes over western Taiwan registering a year-on-year
decrease of 49.6 percent during the first ten months of last year.</P>
      <P>The transportation  ministry's statistics  also showed that passengers made a
total of 12.71 million trips via domestic flights last year, a 26.8 decrease in
passenger travel from the 2006 level, despite of the discounts ranging from 20
percent to 50 percent offered by the airlines since the fourth quarter of last
year.</P>
      <P>Domestic travel reached its peak from 1997 to 1998, with more than 100 flights
flying the Taipei-Kaohsiung route daily during that period, compared to 22
flights operating currently, which will dwindle from March when more domestic
flight routes will be suspended.</P>

      <P>Some 80 percent of Taiwan's women hope to create their own businesses, although
only 4 percent have achieved this goal, according to the results of a survey
published Monday by a head hunting company.</P>
      <P>According to the poll conducted online by www.1111.com.tw, an absolute majority
of the remaining 76.2 percent of the women surveyed have not been able to start
their own businesses due to a lack of funds. Concerns over high investment risks
and market conditions were also citied by 57.9 percent and 48.1 percent of the
respondents, respectively.</P>
      <P>On average, the women questioned said they would need about NT$400,000 in funds
to begin their own businesses, with 55.8 percent saying that they would use
their investment returns or bank savings to start up their ventures and 33.6
percent saying they would apply for a government loan.</P>
      <P>Nearly 29.5 percent said they would form a joint venture with friends or
relatives, while 28.9 percent said they would seek a bank loan. More than 10.1

      <P>As to the question of to what kinds of businesses most women would be most
willing to get involved in, 31.6 percent pointed the restaurant sector, followed
by 20.7 percent who cited the boutique business and 10.5 percent who mentioned
the tourism sector, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Some 6.4 percent said they would like to have their own beauty care centers,
while 5.7 percent said they would like to own a day-care center or a cram
school, the survey indicated.</P>
      <P>As to the question of what kind of skills the respondents think they lack, 66.1
percent replied computing, while 62.8 percent contended that they would have to
improve their accounting skills, ahead of 58.9 percent who said they do not
possess marketing and sales distribution knowledge.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's government has begun surveying and analyzing the marine ecology of
several offshore islands, looking to turn them into marine national parks to
better conserve marine resources, an official at the Construction and Planning
Agency (CPA) under the Ministry of the Interior said Monday.</P>
      <P>The islands being studied by the government include Green Island, a small
volcanic island off the coast of southeastern Taiwan, the Penghu Archipelago,
which consists of nearly a hundred islets lying in the middle of the Taiwan
Strait, and the Three Northern Islands -- Pengjia Islet, Mianhua Islet, and
Huaping Islet -- off Taiwan's northern coast.</P>
      <P>The  agency  also  hopes  to strengthen  local  residents' understanding of
marine resources conservation and encourage them to participate in protecting
their environment.</P>
      <P>The goal is not only to gain their support for establishing marine national
parks on their homelands but also to develop a foundation for the creation of
conservation-related jobs in the future, said the official, who is involved in
planning marine natinal parks.</P>
      <P>The policy reflects the government's efforts to improve its protections of
nearby oceans and marine life to levels on a par with world standards.</P>
      <P>As part of the campaign, Taiwan inaugurated its first marine national park, the
Dongsha Marine National Park, last year. It covers Dongsha Island and two coral
reefs located in the South China Sea.</P>
      <P>Dongsha's coastal waters are known for their biodiversity, with 489 fish species
and about 200 coral strains documented, as well as numerous other marine
species.</P>
      <P>The park has not yet opened to the public because of conservation concerns, and
the focus in the near future will be on coral reef rehabilitation, the official
said.</P>
      <P>A Marine National Park Headquarters was established last year in the southern
port city of Kaohsiung to oversee operations related to the marine park.</P>
      <P>Over the next three years, it will remove foreign species of plants from Dongsha
Island and cultivate fauna and floral species endemic to the island in the hope
of restoring the land to its original look, the official said.</P>

      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has yet to make a final decision on whether
it should call on its backers not to participate in the two U.N. membership bid
referendums to be held along with the March 22 presidential race,  the party's
presidential hopeful Ma Ying-jeou said Monday.</P>
      <P>Ma said he favors holding the two referendums at another date to push for
Taiwan's membership in the United Nations, but added that he is opposed to
binding them to the presidential election.</P>
      <P>"The KMT has been consistent in its stance that it will act on the decision to
be made by the party's Central Standing Committee," Ma told reporters following
a visit to a local temple.</P>
      <P>"But to date, we have not made any final decision in this regard," he went on.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, speculation surfaced that some Taiwan businessmen based in China have
endorsed a pledge calling for a boycott of the two referendums.</P>
      <P>One of the two referendums was proposed by the KMT on re-entering the United
Nations in the name of the Republic of China or other feasible designations, and
the other was initiated by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on
seeking public endorsement to join the world body as Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Both the United States and China have expressed objections to the DPP's U.N. bid
referendum, and there have been reports that some politicians have suggested
that President Chen Shui-bian propose a "defensive referendum" on the issue as a
way to discard the two planned referendums. The current Referendum Law allows
the president to initiate a "defensive referendum" should the country face an
external threat.</P>
      <P>According to KMT Secretary-General Wu Duen-yih, the KMT hopes that the Central
Election Commission (CEC) will be unswayed by the DPP and will de-link the
presidential  election from the two referendums.</P>
      <P>"The KMT expects that the CEC will make such an announcement as soon as possible
with only a little more than a month to go before the March 22 presidential
election, " Wu said later the same day after attending a meeting at Ma's
campaign headquarters.</P>
      <P>Commenting on whether there will be a third initiative to push the KMT and the
DPP to stop their bickering over the U.N. membership bid,  Wu urged the DPP to
support the KMT's U.N. membership referendum, as conditions do not exist for the
holding of a defensive referendum.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's agricultural losses due to the recent cold spell have risen to NT$87.17
million (US$2.75 million), with high-grafted pears being the crop suffering the
heaviest damage, according to statistics released by agriculture authorities
Monday.</P>
      <P>The statistics also show that Taiwan's fishery losses as a result of the latest
cold weather amounted to NT$85.43 million, and that Penghu County alone suffered
losses totaling NT$84.81 million.</P>
      <P>The Agriculture and Food Agency under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA) said that a series of cold snaps in the past several weeks, with
temperatures dipping to as low as 7 degrees Celsius, have caused damage to at
least seven crop categories: high-grafted pears, rice seedlings, flowers,
grapes, wax apples, peaches and leafy vegetables.</P>
      <P>Statistics  compiled  by the agency  show that damage  to high-grafted pear buds

      <P>The high stem-grafting technique was developed to produce juicy and crispy pears
of high quality. The method took pear stems from high-altitude temperate zones
and had them grafted into cuts in stems of low-altitude Hengshan pears -- a

to four years.</P>
      <P>Currently four high-grafted pear varieties have been developed: the Feng-shui
pear, Hsin-hsing pear, the New Century pear, and the Hsing-shui pear.</P>
      <P>About 6,000 hectares of Taiwan's farmland has been devoted to growing high-
grafted pears, with some 300 million buds grafted each year, according to the

    <HEADLINE>DPP candidate wants Kinmen talks with Chinese president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Feb. 18 (CNA)
02/18/08  22:56:56
(By Sofia wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh
promised Monday that if elected, he will invite Chinese President Hu Jintao to
visit Taiwan and discuss bilateral ties on the Taiwan-held island of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the pledge during a campaign stop in Kinmen, which lies closer to
China's southeastern coastal province of Fujian than to Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>Addressing more than 500 supporters at a ceremony marking the inauguration of
his campaign office in Kinmen, Hsieh issued a "Kinmen Declaration" in which he
pledged to invite Hu to visit Taiwan and Kinmen if he wins the March 22
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Kinmen was once a main battleground during hostilities between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait in the late 1950s, and Hsieh said it would be historically
significant if the top leaders from both sides could hold peace talks on the
frontline outpost.</P>
      <P>"Cross-strait  talks  were  once held in a third  country (Singapore). It would
be meaningful if such talks could take place in Kinmen,  which would put our
defense outpost into the global spotlight," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging  the  existence  of  cross-strait  political differences, Hsieh
said the two sides should shelve such divergences for the time being.</P>
      <P>"We should not let unsolvable problems hinder possible progress in resolving
solvable issues," he noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China have not had official talks during the DPP's eight years in
power. China has insisted that Taiwan acknowledge it is part of "one China"
before talks can be held, a proposition the DPP administration has rejected.</P>
      <P>In his "Kinmen Declaration," Hsieh also promised to make Taiwan a war-free zone
and Kinmen a special peace zone. Moreover, he pledged to push for China's
democratization in addition to promoting Taiwan's sustainable development.</P>
      <P>On cross-strait talks, Hsieh said courage, resolve and wisdom are needed and
that Taiwan's sovereignty cannot be compromised.</P>
      <P>On Kinmen's development, Hsieh said if elected, he will see to it that Kinmen be
developed into a special economic zone that features peace, globalization and
tourism.</P>
      <P>"In addition to expanding the existing direct ferry services between Kinmen and
China's Fujian Province, cross-strait charter flights should also be opened to
facilitate travel by Taiwanese businessmen operating in China," Hsieh said,
adding that if elected, he will allow entry of international capital to speed up
Kinmen's development.</P>
      <P>Unused military-controlled land plots will also be opened for county government
management for commercial and tourism development, he added.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) congratulated Kosovo on gaining
independence Monday, saying Taiwan "is delighted  that the people of Kosovo have
the fruits of independence, democracy and freedom to look forward to."</P>
      <P>In a statement released Monday, the ministry expressed its admiration for the
determination of the people of Kosovo in pursuing the lofty ideal of
independence despite a multitude of barriers.</P>
      <P>"The people of Kosovo have insisted on an ideal that they believe in, which is
to peacefully pursue independence, without being threatened or scared away.
Their determination in achieving this lofty ideal is truly admirable," the
statement said.</P>
      <P>Kosovo, formerly a province of Serbia under United Nations administration,

      <P>The ministry noted that self-determination is a right recognized by the United

02/18/08  23:07:11
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Requests by three local airlines to suspend four domestic routes have been
approved by the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)  under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC).</P>
      <P>The CAA approved Monday Far East Air Transport Corp.'s (FAT) request to stop
flying the Taipei-Tainan and Kaohsiung-Hualien routes and Mandarin Airlines'
request to terminate its Taichung-Taitung route, both effective March 1.</P>
      <P>UNI Airways Corp. request to stop flying the Taipei-Kaohsiung route, also to
take effect March 1, was approved by the CAA prior to the Chinese New Year
holiday, the aviation agency said in a statement.</P>
      <P>The CAA decided to approve the carriers' applications to cease operations of the
routes based on the dwindling demand for the flights and the availability of
other carriers or alternate means of ground transportation to provide convenient
service between the destinations.</P>
      <P>The passenger load factor on the Taipei-Tainan route in January this year fell
by 64 percent compared to the previous year's level, while the passenger load
factors on the Kaohsiung-Hualien and Taichung-Taitung routes for all of last
year averaged only 38 percent and 36 percent, respectively, the CAA statement
said.</P>
      <P>FAT's pullout from the two routes are not expected to have a big impact on the
local aviation market, as TransAsia Airways and Mandarin Airlines will still
offer service on the Taipei-Tainan and Kaohsiung-Hualien routes respectively.</P>
      <P>Mandarin Airlines, however, was the only airline flying between Taichung and
Taitung, but the CAA expects rail services to pick up the slack, it said in the
statement.</P>
      <P>The termination of the routes are yet another sign of the distress facing local
carriers that primarily ply domestic routes.</P>
      <P>According to the CAA, the start of the north-south high speed railway launched
in the beginning of 2007 has dealt a heavy blow to the domestic air travel
market.</P>
      <P>Flights to eastern Taiwan have also been affected by the introduction of faster
trains and more convenient schedules by Taiwan's conventional rail system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Local institute pioneers system turning rice straws into biofuel</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A research institute in Taiwan has successfully developed the country's first
system that can turn rice straws into cellulosic ethanol, a type of biofuel, an
official at the institute said Monday.</P>
      <P>The Institute of Nuclear Energy Research under the Cabinet-level Atomic Energy
Council (AEC) plans to complete the construction of a system that can produce
200 liters of cellulosic ethanol on a daily basis by 2010, said Kuo Ming-chao,
one of the institute's three deputy directors.</P>
      <P>The process developed by the institute at present can transform a batch of 10
kilograms of rice straws into 2 liters of 99.5 percent-pure cellulosic ethanol,
and the institute plans to develop a system by 2010 that can process 1 ton of
rice straws per day.</P>
      <P>According to Kuo, Taiwan consumes 10 million kiloliters of fuel and produces 1.5
million tons of rice straws every year. He believes that the process will one
day provide 3 percent of Taiwan's fuel needs, but did not specify when such mass
production would begin.</P>
      <P>After the 2010 goal is achieved, Kuo said the institute will move on to build a
system that can manage 10 tons of rice straws on a daily basis, which would
still only serve as a "demonstration" model for local companies.</P>
      <P>In the end, Kuo said, the institute will transfer the processing technology to
local companies.</P>
      <P>The United States has also developed a process to produce ethanol with biomass
residues and plans to build a system that can handle 2,000 tons of residues by
2012.</P>
      <P>The U.S.' Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which was signed by U.S.
President George W. Bush late last year, requires an increased production of
biofuel, focusing mainly on cellulosic ethanol.</P>
      <P>Wang Chia-pao, the researcher responsible for the institute's cellulosic ethanol
research and application project, described the development of the fuel as a
necessary path to seeking an alternative source of energy for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The institute aims to cut down the future mass production cost to NT$25 (about
US$0.79) per liter, which he acknowledged is a "very challenging goal" based on
the institute's current transferring ability.</P>
      <P>At present, the institute will focus on developing the technology and will not
strive to lower production costs until the technology is mature, Wang said.</P>

kilograms of rice straws into 2 liters of 99.5 percent-pure cellulosic ethanol,
and the institute plans to develop a system by 2010 that can process 1 ton of
rice straws per day.</P>
      <P>According to Kuo, Taiwan consumes 10 million kiloliters of fuel and produces 1.5
million tons of rice straws every year. He believes that the process will one
day provide 3 percent of Taiwan's fuel needs, but did not specify when such mass
production would begin.</P>
      <P>After the 2010 goal is achieved, Kuo said the institute will move on to build a
system that can manage 10 tons of rice straws on a daily basis, which would
still only serve as a "demonstration" model for local companies.</P>
      <P>In the end, Kuo said, the institute will transfer the processing technology to
local companies.</P>
      <P>The United States has also developed a process to produce ethanol with biomass
residues and plans to build a system that can handle 2,000 tons of residues by
2012.</P>
      <P>The U.S.' Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which was signed by U.S.
President George W. Bush late last year, requires an increased production of
biofuel, focusing mainly on cellulosic ethanol.</P>
      <P>Wang Chia-pao, the researcher responsible for the institute's cellulosic ethanol
research and application project, described the development of the fuel as a
necessary path to seeking an alternative source of energy for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The institute aims to cut down the future mass production cost to NT$25 (about
US$0.79) per liter, which he acknowledged is a "very challenging goal" based on
the institute's current transferring ability.</P>
      <P>At present, the institute will focus on developing the technology and will not
strive to lower production costs until the technology is mature, Wang said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh
promised Monday that if elected, he will invite Chinese President Hu Jintao to
visit Taiwan and discuss bilateral ties on the Taiwan-held island of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the pledge during a campaign stop in Kinmen, which lies closer to
China's southeastern coastal province of Fujian than to Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>Addressing more than 500 supporters at a ceremony marking the inauguration of
his campaign office in Kinmen, Hsieh issued a "Kinmen Declaration" in which he
pledged to invite Hu to visit Taiwan and Kinmen if he wins the March 22
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Kinmen was once a main battleground during hostilities between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait in the late 1950s, and Hsieh said it would be historically
significant if the top leaders from both sides could hold peace talks on the
frontline outpost.</P>
      <P>"Cross-strait  talks  were  once held in a third  country (Singapore). It would
be meaningful if such talks could take place in Kinmen,  which would put our
defense outpost into the global spotlight," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging  the  existence  of  cross-strait  political differences, Hsieh
said the two sides should shelve such divergences for the time being.</P>
      <P>"We should not let unsolvable problems hinder possible progress in resolving
solvable issues," he noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China have not had official talks during the DPP's eight years in
power. China has insisted that Taiwan acknowledge it is part of "one China"
before talks can be held, a proposition the DPP administration has rejected.</P>
      <P>In his "Kinmen Declaration," Hsieh also promised to make Taiwan a war-free zone
and Kinmen a special peace zone. Moreover, he pledged to push for China's
democratization in addition to promoting Taiwan's sustainable development.</P>
      <P>On cross-strait talks, Hsieh said courage, resolve and wisdom are needed and
that Taiwan's sovereignty cannot be compromised.</P>
      <P>On Kinmen's development, Hsieh said if elected, he will see to it that Kinmen be
developed into a special economic zone that features peace, globalization and
tourism.</P>
      <P>"In addition to expanding the existing direct ferry services between Kinmen and
China's Fujian Province, cross-strait charter flights should also be opened to
facilitate travel by Taiwanese businessmen operating in China," Hsieh said,
adding that if elected, he will allow entry of international capital to speed up
Kinmen's development.</P>
      <P>Unused military-controlled land plots will also be opened for county government
management for commercial and tourism development, he added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's agricultural losses due to the recent cold spell have risen to NT$87.17
million (US$2.75 million), with high-grafted pears being the crop suffering the
heaviest damage, according to statistics released by agriculture authorities
Monday.</P>
      <P>The statistics also show that Taiwan's fishery losses as a result of the latest
cold weather amounted to NT$85.43 million, and that Penghu County alone suffered
losses totaling NT$84.81 million.</P>
      <P>The Agriculture and Food Agency under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA) said that a series of cold snaps in the past several weeks, with
temperatures dipping to as low as 7 degrees Celsius, have caused damage to at
least seven crop categories: high-grafted pears, rice seedlings, flowers,
grapes, wax apples, peaches and leafy vegetables.</P>
      <P>Statistics  compiled  by the agency  show that damage  to high-grafted pear buds
alone amounted to NT$79 million.</P>
      <P>High-grafted pears are grown mainly in the counties of Hsinchu, Yilan and
Taichung.</P>
      <P>The high stem-grafting technique was developed to produce juicy and crispy pears
of high quality. The method took pear stems from high-altitude temperate zones
and had them grafted into cuts in stems of low-altitude Hengshan pears -- a
cultivated variety of Asian pear -- to produce a new generation of pear in three
to four years.</P>
      <P>Currently four high-grafted pear varieties have been developed: the Feng-shui
pear, Hsin-hsing pear, the New Century pear, and the Hsing-shui pear.</P>
      <P>About 6,000 hectares of Taiwan's farmland has been devoted to growing high-
grafted pears, with some 300 million buds grafted each year, according to the
Agricultural Research Institute under the COA.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to ease restrictions on Chinese investment in property market</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  19 (CNA)
02/19/08  14:33:36
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is finalizing its plan to ease restrictions on Chinese citizens
intending to invest in Taiwan's property market, offering investment incentives
such as exempting them from proving the origin of their capital and allowing
them to borrow more from Taiwan banks, a high-ranking Mainland Affairs Council
official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said under proposed revisions
to current regulations,  prospective Chinese investors would no long be required
to provide any certificate of origin of funds -- a requirement that has blocked
Chinese capital inflows because the Chinese government has not permitted its
citizens to invest in Taiwan's property market.</P>
      <P>The maximum loan amounts that Chinese citizens would obtain from domestic banks
could reach 50 percent of the worth of the property, the official said.</P>
      <P>Also, the business properties that Chinese citizens would be allowed to invest
in would cover most leisure and tourism facilities such as resorts and leisure
farms, but exclude hotels near major attractions, in light of the fact the
Chinese government has not allowed foreign investment in China's hotels, he
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, to allow Chinese citizens more time to deal with property
transactions in Taiwan, they would be allowed to stay up to 90 days for each
visit to Taiwan, compared with a maximum of 10 days per visit and no more than
30 days per year at present, the official said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has opened its property market to Chinese investors since 2002, but only
a few cases have been successful so far due to the large number of restrictions
imposed by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on the policy, Sherry Wu, director of commercial property of
the Taiwan branch of Jones Lang LaSalle, a U.S.-based real estate services and
money management firm, predicted that the measure would invigorate Taiwan's
property market.</P>
      <P>After the measure is implemented, the scale of the commercial property market --
which amounted to NT$120 billion (US$3.78 billion) in 2007 -- is expected to
double, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that while many Chinese investors attracted to the high return on
property investment in Taiwan have visited the country over the past several
years to explore business opportunities here, they have not been able to make
any move because Taiwan imposes many restrictions on Chinese investment in its
property market.</P>
      <P>Expressing a different view, Chang Chin-o, a professor at National Chengchi
University's (NCCU's) Department of Land Economics, said the measure might have
short-term stimulation on Taiwan's property market but is not going to resolve
the basic problem faced by the country's real estate industry.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the oversupply of residential properties -- which are
unaffordable to many people in the country -- is the core issue faced by the
industry and is one that cannot be solved by foreign capital.</P>
      <P>Lin Chu-chia,  a professor at NCCU's Economics Department, suggested that the
government sets as few restrictions as possible on the areas Chinese citizens
would be allowed to invest in so as to maximize the measure's positive effect on
Taiwan's real estate industry.</P>
      <P>Also, Lin said the duration of stay for Chinese citizens should not be limited
to 90 days per visit, which he claimed is too short for an investor.</P>

      <P>Wang Cheng-hsiao, an MND intelligence official, made the remarks when he
reported on China's possible military movement ahead of Taiwan's March 22

      <P>He said that Chinese military personnel were involved in snowstorm relief and
defense readiness operations during the Chinese New Year holiday and engaged in
routine basic training afterward.</P>

coastal provinces opposite Taiwan, with their range covering the island.</P>
      <P>"No unusual movement of its 700-odd fighters, 60,000 ground forces and
approximately 90 vessels has been detected so far," he said, adding that "the
military will continue to monitor the situation closely."</P>
      <P>Wang noted that the number of Chinese sea and aerial operations were drastically

      <P>The diplomatic ties between Taiwan and its three allies in the South PacificXthe

power transitions, an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regularly scheduled press briefing, Donald Lee, director-general
of the ministry's Department of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, noting concerns
that there might be a switch in allegiance of the South Pacific nations are "not
true", stressed that the diplomatic links between Taiwan and its South Pacific
allies remain unchanged and will continue to grow closer and firmer under their

      <P>Taiwan's national baseball team has one last chance to earn a berth in the 2008
Beijing Olympic Games baseball  tournament,  and despite the likely absence  of
its foreign-based players, the team says it's ready.</P>
      <P>It better be.</P>
      <P>The squad drew the wrath of home fans late last year when it finished an
embarrassing eighth in the Baseball World Cup in November and a disappointing
third in the Asian Baseball Championship in December, and many worried that
baseball in Taiwan was in a state of permanent decline.</P>
      <P>But the team can redeem itself by finishing in the top three of the final eight-
team Olympic qualifying tournament that will be held in Taichung and Douliou in
central Taiwan from March 3-14.</P>
      <P>"In fact, this is a five-for-three competition, " manager Hung Yi-chung said in
Taichung, where the team is training for the tournament.</P>
      <P>Hung was referring to the quality of the field, with five countries -- Taiwan,
South Korea, Canada, Australia and Mexico -- expected to compete for the final
three Olympic slots.</P>
      <P>The remaining three teams,  international  baseball minnows Germany, Spain and
South Africa, are seen as having little chance of staging a breakthrough.</P>
      <P>South Korea is expected to be the strongest team, Hung said, so Taiwan's game
plan will be to win two of its three round robin games against Australia, Mexico
and Canada to secure a top three finish.</P>
      <P>Hung's task will be complicated by the absence of Taiwan's foreign-based stars.
Pitchers Tsao Chin-hui and Keng Po-hsuan, who play in the United States, and Lin
En-yu and Hsu Ming-chieh, who pitch in Japan, have all dropped out and opted to
concentrate on advancing their professional careers.</P>
      <P>That means Hung will be left with a roster composed mostly of players who
compete in Taiwan's Chinese Professional Baseball League or local amateurs, but
the manager said he's prepared to play with an all-local 24-man roster if need
be.</P>
      <P>Regardless of how the roster shapes up, Hung said, Taiwan will still try to win
every game, and could be helped by having more information on its opponents.</P>
      <P>Local baseball commentators blasted the national team for poor scouting after
its disappointing finishes in the Baseball World Cup and Asian Championship, but
it has made more of an effort before this tourney to learn its adversaries'
tendancies.</P>
      <P>Players have been watching a lot of film from games played by Canada, Mexico and
Australia, Hung said, and he believed the three teams will not be as strong as
their World Cup squads because they'll be missing some of their U.S. Major
League players.</P>
      <P>Major League Baseball has prohibited players on teams' 40-man rosters from
participating in the Olympic qualifiers.</P>
      <P>Hung hopes to have his team sharp by the time the tournament opens next month.
To get the players back into game condition, the national squad will play a six-
game warm-up series against the six CPBL teams, beginning Feb. 25.</P>

However, on Feb. 6, the child developed a fever, symptoms of hand, foot and
mouth disease (HFMD), as well as arm and leg spasms, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The parents brought the child back to the same medical center, and the child was
immediately admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. On Feb. 19, after
conducting tests, the hospital reported the suspected enterovirus-71 case to the
CDC. The child was released from the medical center several days later after her
condition had improved.</P>
      <P>Lin said that although the latest data shows that enterovirus may be on the
wane, the data was compiled ahead of the start of school following the extended
holiday break which he noted may be the reason for the decline in new
enterovirus cases.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that enterovirus may make a resurgence when school starts again,
Lin reminded parents and teachers to not let their guard down and to pay
attention to students' sanitary habits as well as to make sure that they wash
their hands often to avoid being infected.</P>
      <P>He also urged parents to take their kids to a hospital immediately if they
develop a fever, HFMD symptoms, or arm and leg spasms.</P>
      <P>In 2007, there were a total of 49 cases of confirmed enterovirus infections in
Taiwan, with two fatalities. So far this year, there have been 14 cases, with no
fatalities, which Lin said shows that citizens have become more aware of the
threat of enterovirus.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is set to become an official partner of a European Union greenhouse gas
monitoring program after a Taiwanese university signed a Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) with laboratories of EU countries in Brussels Monday.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan-based National Central University inked the MOU with German and
French national laboratories in the Belgian capital, finalizing a joint project
aimed at measuring greenhouse gases over the Pacific region.</P>
      <P>The agreement paves the way for Taiwan to become a formal partner of the In-
Service Aircraft for Global Observing System (IAGOS) program supported by the EU
Commission, said Wang Kuo-ying, a professor in the university's Department of
Atmospheric Sciences and Institute of Atmospheric Physics.</P>
      <P>The formal partnership will also enable Taiwan to learn about greenhouse gas
changes being monitored by the IAGOS program in other regions of the world, Wang
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's participation fills a crucial gap in the EU program, which has failed
thus far to include the Pacific Ocean in its monitoring program, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Starting later next year,  the IAGOS program will install monitoring equipment
on a total of 10-20 long-haul Airbus aircraft, including some operated by
Taiwan's largest carrier, China Airlines Ltd. (CAL), to survey the Pacific Ocean
region.</P>
      <P>CAL also signed the MOU Monday.</P>
      <P>Winston Dang, minister of Taiwan's Cabinet-level Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) who attended the signing ceremony in the Belgian capital,
lauded the partnership, as it comes at a time when Taiwan is limited
diplomatically because of China's obstruction.</P>
      <P>Dang said he believes Taiwan's active efforts to join the world in protecting
the environment will eventually earn it the recognition of the international
community.</P>
      <P>At the ceremony, representatives from national laboratories in Germany and
French as well as EU officials also said that the cooperation with Taiwan is
significant for the EU's related research plans and will enhance their
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Prior to the signing of the MOU, Dang gave a speech on Taiwan's achievements and
efforts in waste recycling and greenhouse gas reduction.</P>
      <P>Dang later told the Central News Agency that the EU attaches great importance to
environmental protection, and said it might become a major factor in its
interaction with other countries.</P>
      <P>Citing China as an example, Dang said that before agreeing to lift its embargo
on arms exports to China, the EU might ask Beijing to resolve its heavy
pollution problems in addition to improving its bad human rights record.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Dang met with EU officials to review the results of bilateral
projects launched last year and exchange ideas on energy and greenhouse gas
reduction issues.</P>
      <P>In addition, Dang was invited by Luxembourg lawmakers Sunday to visit
communities there to learn more about their efforts to conserve energy and use
renewable energies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) rebutted reports that the government
ignores Taiwanese prisoners in Thailand, saying efforts have been made to
protect their rights, with some even released ahead of schedule due to the
ministry's help, a MOFA official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regularly scheduled press briefing, Donald Lee, director-general
of the ministry's Department of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said that
Taiwan's 119 inmates in Thailand are not neglected by the government.</P>
      <P>"Officials of Taiwan's Representative Office in Thailand paid visits before and
during the Chinese New Year to 10 different prisons to console Taiwanese
prisoners, " Lee said, adding that the ministry has been actively involved in
helping them.</P>
      <P>"Assistance such as free health care and medicine, as well as document
translations, are provided," he said.</P>
      <P>The ministry also worked with the Taiwan Dental Association to dispatch the
first ever dental delegation to Thailand in mid-January to give free dental care
to the Taiwanese inmates.</P>
      <P>"It is something that many other foreign prisoners very much envied," Lee said.</P>
      <P>The foreign ministry also provided legal assistance to Taiwanese prisoners who
applied for early release, the MOFA official said. Nine Taiwanese prisoners have
been granted early release over the years, including three who received general
pardons in honor of Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej's 80th birthday last December.</P>
      <P>Another 34 have applications for early release pending.</P>
      <P>There are 119 Taiwanese imprisoned in Thailand, with 85 percent of them
imprisoned for drug trafficking, a felony in the Southeast Asian country.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The production value of Taiwan's flat panel display industry is expected to
increase 22.6 percent to NT$2.15 trillion in 2008, marking the first time the
industry's output has topped NT$2 trillion, the Industrial Technology Research
Institute (ITRI) forecast Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In 2007,  the industry's  production value totaled NT$1.75 trillion, up 37.6
percent from 2006, with panel production exceeding NT$1 trillion for the first
time in 2007 to amount to NT$1.28 trillion, an increase of 41 percent from 2006.</P>
      <P>Large-area thin-film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) panels remained
the industry's locomotive in 2007, with the products' production value soaring
42 percent to NT$1.09 trillion.</P>
      <P>According to ITRI's Industrial Technology Information Services (ITIS), Taiwan's
panel production is likely to further expand by 23.8 percent this year to amount
to NT$1.59 trillion, driven mainly by large-area and small- and medium-sized
TFT-LCD panels.</P>
      <P>The ITIS predicted that the production of large-area TFT-LCD panels measuring 10
inches and over will jump 26 percent to amount to NT$1.37 trillion this year,
while that of small- and medium-sized TFT-LCD panels will climb 22.7 percent to
NT$156 billion.</P>
      <P>However, the production of super twisted nematic liquid crystal display (STN-
LCD) panels is expected to decline 9.8 percent to NT$57.5 billion this year,
while that of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels is likely to drop 5.4
percent to NT$6 billion, the ITIS said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ITIS predicted the production of key parts and components will
increase 22 percent to amount to NT$554.18 billion this year, including NT$158
billion for color filters, NT$81 billion for polarizers, NT$138 billion for
glass substrates and NT$177.18 billion for back light modules.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Changhua's Public Health Bureau announced Tuesday that it will put syringe-
dispensing machines in 49 locations around the county to provide drug users with
round-the-clock access to sterile syringes.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yen-po, director of the bureau, said that the vending machines are being
installed as part of the county government's program to fight the spread of
HIV/AIDS and other diseases by making it unnecessary for drug addicts to share
needles.</P>
      <P>"For just NT$10, drug users can get two sterile syringes, diluent and alcohol-
soaked sanitary tissues, " Yeh said.</P>
      <P>He noted that the number of new HIV/AIDS cases resulting from the sharing of
needles among intravenous drug users in the southern Taiwan county increased to
166 in 2005.</P>
      <P>However, after the county government in central Taiwan began the clean needle
program in late 2006, the number of new cases declined to 92 in 2007, marking a
52 percent drop over the figure for the previous year.</P>
      <P>Under the program, the Public Health Bureau set up HIV/AIDS information service
centers at pharmacies, clinics, hospitals and 27 bureau offices around the
county, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Intravenous drug users can receive sterile syringes at any of these centers, he
said, adding that a total of 160,000 syringes were handed out at the centers
last year.</P>
      <P>The health bureau decided to install syringe dispensing machines after drug
users complained that they could only obtain the syringes during the centers'
hours of operations.</P>
      <P>The bureau then decided to ask the Department of Health (DOH) for funds to set
up syringe vending machines outside the centers to allow drug users round-the-
clock access to clean syringes.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the bureau will determine whether to add more machines in other
locations around the county after assessing the effect of those to be installed.</P>
      <P>The first county in Taiwan to set up syringe vending machines is southern
Taiwan's Tainan County, which set up 10 such dispensers in May 2007, with 16
machines currently in operation, a Tainan County Health Bureau official told a
CNA reporter.</P>
      <P>Local media reported that other cities and counties have similar plans,
including Keelung City, Taipei County and Taipei City.</P>

      <P>The government is planning to appropriate NT$23 billion (US$726 million) to fund
the second stage of the "Taiwan National Science and Technology Program for
Nanoscience and Nanotechnology" slated for 2009-2014, officials at the cabinet-
level National Science Council (NSC) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The first stage, which began in 2003 with NT$17.8 billion in funding, will
conclude by the end of this year, officials told reporters.</P>
      <P>In the first phase, more than 4,000 science research papers have been generated
to date, dozens of top-notch research teams were initiated, and ties between
industry, university, and research institutions have been strengthened, they
said.</P>
      <P>Program Director Wu Maw-kuen, who is also the director of the Institute of
Physics under Taiwan's top research institute Academia Sinica, said the program
office is now working on the outlines of the next phase by determining which
items of research are worth further financial support.</P>
      <P>Wu said the focus of the next stage will be nano- electronic and optoelectronic
technology, nano-scale instruments, nanotechnology for energy and environmental
applications, nano-scale biomedical research, and the various technologies'
utilization in potential and traditional industries.</P>
      <P>According to the science council, so far completed research projects under the
auspices of the program include the visualization of circuits and gene
expression patterns in the whole Drosophila (fruit fly) brain, the target drug
for diabetes, and nano porosity materials for cell marking and gene therapy.</P>
      <P>And those that have already been used in pilot production or mass production
include various materials, equipment, machinery, components and instruments
using related nanotechnologies developed by Taiwanese researchers, according to
the council.</P>
      <P>Some of the items have great commercial potential, science council officials
said.</P>
      <P>They said TAK Technology Co., a local company which received the technology of
LiNiCoO2 anode production from the Hsinchu-based Industrial Technology Research
Institute, had generated a production value of NT$1.5 billion last year, and the
estimated production value for 2009 is expected to reach NT$3 billion.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Penghu county government officials and residents joined in a campaign Tuesday to
remove dead fish washed ashore by the ton on the outlying island chain as a
result of the recent cold spell.</P>
      <P>Penghu Magistrate Wang Chien-fa led the campaign, supported by members of the
public and officials from the county government's Environmental Protection
Bureau, Agriculture and Fishery Bureau, Public Works Bureau and Economic Affairs
Bureau.</P>
      <P>Wang launched the drive after massive numbers of dead fish kept washing up on
Penghu's scenic beaches,  although environmental protection officials had been
using heavy equipment to remove 17 metric tons of fish carcasses over the past
two days.</P>
      <P>The Penghu island group lies about 50 km west of Taiwan proper. The four most
seriously affected beaches are located in Huhsi township and Baisha township.</P>
      <P>"This ecological disaster will have a serious impact on Penghu's fishery
industry," Wang said.</P>
      <P>"The dead fish on the beaches are from shallow waters," Wang continued, adding
that more dead fish from deeper waters might wash ashore in the next few days.</P>
      <P>Wang expressed concern that the abnormal cold weather might have broken the food
chain, making it difficult for Penghu's fishermen to make a living.</P>
      <P>He said it is important that the county government step up marine conservation
programs to allow the release large amounts of young fish into the ocean.</P>
      <P>When the fish first started washing ashore, some local residents picked them up
and made "a small fortune." But as more carcasses kept piling up on the beaches,
county government officials began to worry about sanitation problems as the fish
began to rot.</P>
      <P>Penghu's fish culture industry also suffered its heaviest losses in 30 years --
estimated at NT$181.86 million -- as a result of the cold spell over the past
two weeks, according to statistics released by the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>County government statistics show that fish farms in Penghu lost over 1,500
metric tons, or 80 percent of their fish, including cobia and grouper, which
experts say cannot survive temperatures below 15 degrees Celsius.</P>
      <P>The COA is working on a relief program to provide low-interest loans to help
Penghu's fish farmers get back on their feet.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) and National Pingtung University of Science and
Technology in southern Taiwan signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) Tuesday
on the production of horse serum to combat snake venom.</P>
      <P>Steve Hsu-sung Kuo, director of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control, and
university President Ku Yuan-kuang signed the MOU, with DOH Minister Hou Sheng-
mou looking on.</P>
      <P>Hou noted that the university has a spacious campus and livestock departments,
which he said would make it "most suitable for the production of horse serum to
fight against snake venom."</P>
      <P>The concept was first suggested by Ku, Hou said, and after the DOH chief
inspected the school's environment, the deal was sealed.</P>
      <P>The NT$250 million (US$7.92 million) project calls for the construction of a
horse stable and the production of the horse serum, and is expected to result in
annual output of 5,000 vials of horse serum for domestic use as well as exports.</P>
      <P>The project is significant, CDC officials said, because the serum is not readily
available from other countries.</P>
      <P>They said various diluted snake venoms will first be injected into the horses,
which will then produce the antibodies used in the serum to fight poisonous
snake bites.</P>
      <P>The officials said that Taiwan has produced serum to fight snake venom for more

      <P>Statistics released Tuesday by the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) indicate that
the Internet is more accessible to young workers with high-level education in
Taiwan, while a digital divide still exists among workers, varying with age,
educational level, vocation and region.</P>
      <P>According to the survey results, about 71.4 percent of the labor force are
connected to the Internet, a 17.8 percent increase from 2003.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that more than 96 percent of workers aged between 15 and

of age have done so.</P>
      <P>In the category of employment, about 95 percent of employees in finance and
assurance services have to use a computer at work, and 92.2 percent of those in
the information and communication sector use them, while only 28.3 percent of
workers in the service industry do so.</P>
      <P>The statistics also show that 94.3 percent of workers in Taipei have a personal
computer at home, while 89.1 percent in the southern city of Kaohsiung and in
northern Taiwan have one and 82.7 percent in central regions of the island have
computer access. In eastern and southern Taiwan, less than 80 percent of workers
own personal computers.</P>

      <P>National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) in the southern city of Tainan conferred
honorary degrees Tuesday on two outstanding foreign scientists, including a
Nobel laureate, for their contributions to Taiwan's scientific development.</P>
      <P>Aaron Ciechanover, an Israeli biologist who serves as a chair professor in the
university, was awarded a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2004 for his co-discovery
of one of the most important cyclical processes in biochemistry. Ciechanover is
also a faculty member of the Vascular and Cancer Biology Research Center, the
Rappaport Faculty of Medicine and Research Institute, and the Technion-Israel
Institute of Technology in Haifa, Israel.</P>
      <P>Britton Chance, who is also a chair professor of the university, received a
Ph.D. in physical chemistry in 1940 at the University of Pennsylvania,  and a
second Ph.D.  in physiology at Cambridge University in 1942.</P>
      <P>Chance, now 94, is currently a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and
has been a member of U.S. National Academy of Science and a foreign member of
the British Royal Society. His research  interest  focuses on the use of
infrared  light to characterize the properties of various tissues and breast
tumors. With more than 4,000 publications, Chance was also on the U.S. Olympic
yachting team in 1952.</P>
      <P>NCKU President  Lai Ming-chao  presided over the conferral ceremony, which was
attended by more than 100 domestic and foreign academics and experts.</P>
      <P>Raphael Gamzou,  representative of the Israel Economic and Cultural Office in
Taipei, sent an e-mail to NCKU expressing gratitude for the respect given to
Ciechanover and expressing hope that Taiwanese and Israeli scientific
investigation can be further boosted through Ciechanover's contributions.</P>
      <P>During the ceremony, Ciechanover said the academic sector is a sphere in which
people can contribute and win recognition regardless of nationality or political
affiliation.</P>
      <P>Chance for his part noted that sciences are a wonderful puzzle for him.
"Sciences keep us going forward and never let us rest, " Chance said, adding
that he is lucky to have had the privilege to explore the sciences.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Frank Hsieh, presidential candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) , confirmed a media report Tuesday that President Chen Shui-bian plans to
relax cross-Taiwan Strait trade and investment policies, describing it as the
result of "internal negotiations" within the party.</P>
      <P>Admitting that "the DPP administration would assess relaxing its China-related
economic and investment policies," Hsieh attributed the latest development to
"continued negotiations and communications within the party."</P>
      <P>His comments, made at his campaign office in response to reporters' questions,
coincided with recent speculation that the president was assessing the
possibility of relaxing cross-strait economic policies before his term ends on
May 20.</P>
      <P>It had been previously reported that Hsieh and the Presidential Office and the
Executive Yuan were at odds over his proposals to reduce or waive punishment for
Taiwanese businessmen who have invested illegally in China.</P>
      <P>In response to another media report that the government would ease restrictions
on Chinese nationals investing in Taiwan's real estate market, Hsieh said that
as far as he knew, Chinese investors would only be permitted to invest in
commercial properties.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also said he hopes to help lure Taiwanese businessmen operating in China
to return home and invest in the domestic market by helping them resolve labor,
capital and technology obstacles.</P>
      <P>The DPP presidential candidate has tried to appeal to swing voters by offering a
vision of closer relations with China, in contrast to a less accommodating
policy favored during Chen's presidency.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said Monday that he would invite Chinese President Hu Jintao for talks on
the Taiwan-controlled island of Kinmen if elected president on March 22.</P>
      <P>According to the DPP presidential hopeful, Taiwan and China still can conduct
negotiations  even if the two sides  have  many longstanding disputes dividing
them, including Taiwan's future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to invest NT$15 billion in eastern rail line</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 19 (CNA)
02/19/08  20:46:01

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has decided to invest NT$15 billion (US$468.8 million) over the
next seven years in the first phase of a project to modernize the rail system in
the less-developed eastern part of the country.</P>
      <P>The overall plan, developed by the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD), consists of two major projects to improve the 155-kilometer part of the
line connecting Hualien and Taitung -- replacing diesel-powered trains with
electric-powered trains and converting single track sections to double track.</P>
      <P>When the project is fully completed, the line's 2 hour 55 minute travel time
will be reduced to under two hours and out of the 30 stations on the line at
present, only 11 will remain.</P>
      <P>At a briefing on the plan Monday, Sharon Hsieh, one of the council's planners in
the Urban and Housing Development Department, said the first phase of the plan,
to begin as early as sometime next year, will focus on the electrification of
the line and laying double track in sections with severe bottlenecks.</P>
      <P>During the second phase, she said, the electrification process and the line's
conversion to a double track railway will be fully completed.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said switching to electric-powered locomotives, which are commonly used in
most of Taiwan's railway system, will increase train frequencies and improve
safety. Average speeds will be improved to 130km/hr from 110km/hr by using
electric power.</P>
      <P>The eastern railway network is formed by three main sections -- the Yilan Line,
the North-link Line and the Hua-Tung Line. While the two northern lines are
fully electrified, only diesel powered trains can operate on the Hua-Tung Line.</P>
      <P>That means travelers from Taipei to Taitung must either change trains in Hualien
or wait there while an electric-powered locomotive is replaced a diesel-powered
one. The inconvenience and longer travel time to Taitung is seen as an
impediment to tourism in the region.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the first phase of the project will take seven years to complete at a
cost of NT$15 billion. The budget will be reviewed annually by the legislature,
and the council will review the project's construction progress carried out by
the Ministry of Transportation and Communications.</P>
      <P>The plan is part of a 2005 government campaign aimed at bringing greater
economic prosperity to Taiwan's eastern countiesVYilan, Hualien and Taitung --
that includes development plans ranging from rebuilding rural communities to
upgrading transportation.</P>

nuclear power plant under construction in Kungliao township, Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Iap Phok-bun, chief executive of the Nuke-4 Referendum Initiative Association

interest for the holding of a referendum.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, he recently met former ruling Democratic Progressive Party

      <P>In response to a question emailed by a CNA reporter, American Institute in
Taiwan (AIT) spokesman Thomas Hedges wrote Tuesday that AIT "will consider"
responding to issues of U.S. citizenship and permanent residency concerning both
of Taiwan's presidential candidates should it receive such inquiries from the
Taiwanese authorities.</P>
      <P>"AIT would certainly consider responding to an inquiry from the Central Election
Commission regarding U.S. citizenship or permanent legal resident status of
candidates in the presidential election. To date, AIT has received no such
inquiry, " Hodges wrote in an email.</P>
      <P>The Central Election Committee (CEC) has requested authorization from both
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate Frank Hsieh and Kuomintang
(KMT) candidate Ma Ying-jeou in order to verify whether both hold dual
citizenship, which would violate Taiwanese election laws, or permanent residency
of a foreign country.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's camp has recently challenged Ma over his possession of a U.S. green
card. Ma claims that the green card, which he obtained while studying in the
U.S. in the late 1970s, lost its validity in the mid-1980s after he returned to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The CEC, which listed eight questions in a questionnaire for both campaigns, had
not received replies from either Hsieh or Ma, CEC spokesman Deng Tien-yu said
that day.</P>
      <P>Both were asked to provide their passport numbers, dates of birth, Chinese and
English names and say whether they hold U.S. social security numbers, foreign
residency or passports.</P>
      <P>In addition to the AIT, the CEC will also submit the same inquiries to the
representative offices of Japan and the United Kingdom on the matter.</P>
      <P>Hsieh studied in Japan and Ma was born in Hong Kong, a former British colony.</P>
      <P>In his email response, Hodges wrote that as AIT Taipei Office Director Stephen
Young and senior U.S. State Department officials have said on several occasions,
the U.S. government has no favorite in the election.</P>
      <P>"We will respond to inquiries of this nature in whatever manner best maintains
our neutrality in this election, " he wrote.</P>
      <P>The AIT declined to comment on the dispute when Hsieh's camp first made the
allegation against Ma in late January.</P>

      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang  (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou took aim
Tuesday at his ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) rival Frank Hsieh,
accusing him of making "sensationalist and unworkable empty remarks" that are
not beneficial to the people's livelihoods.</P>
      <P>"Hsieh  should  prioritize  issues concerning  the people's livelihoods in his
remarks about cross-Taiwan Strait ties if he is to comment in this regard, " Ma
said, arguing that "it is neither imminent nor possible for the leaders of
Taiwan and China to meet at present."</P>
      <P>Ma made the comments to reporters in a gathering after a tour of Shenao fishing
port in Taipei County, northern Taiwan. The KMT hopeful also unveiled the marine
policy he will adopt if elected president on March 22 during a meeting with
Shenao residents.</P>
      <P>Hsieh offered an olive branch a day earlier to Chinese President Hu Jintao,
inviting him for talks on Taiwan-held Kinmen Island if Hsieh wins the
presidency.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT presidential candidate, cross-strait labor, fisheries and
trade disputes are urgent issues that the two sides should seek to settle
quickly.</P>
      <P>Turning to speculation that the DPP government is assessing the feasibility of
relaxing its China economic and investment policies and reducing penalties for
Taiwanese businessmen who have invested in China against Taiwanese regulations,
Ma urged the administration not to waste its time as there are only three months
left of Chen's presidency.</P>
      <P>"The DPP should have done so much sooner, since it came to power in 2000," Ma
said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh confirmed earlier that day that the government is studying the possibility
of relaxing its China policy in a bid to mark a departure from President Chen
Shui-bian and attract more voters, including the many China-based Taiwan
businessmen.</P>
      <P>According  to unofficial  estimates,  the number of Taiwan businessmen operating

    <HEADLINE>25% of health insurance used for patients with serious disease</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>One quarter of the NT$440 billion (US$13.75 billion) health insurance expenses
in 2007 were spent on patients with serious illnesses, the Bureau of National
Health Insurance (BNHI) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Among them, 320,000 cancer patients used up most of the expenses at NT$36
billion, according to 2007 statistics.</P>
      <P>They said that in addition to the cancer patients, patients requiring  dialysis
and respirators,  psychiatric  patients and premature babies all benefited from
the health insurance payments, which they said "have helped patients avoid
financial crisis because of their diseases and have helped build up a social
safety net."</P>
      <P>The officials said that as of the end of 2007, 760,000 people had met the
criteria to be listed as major or serious patients. The number in this category
patients accounted for between 10 percent and 14 percent of patients a decade
ago, but dropped to between 4 percent and 9 percent over the past three years.</P>
      <P>This shows that the growth in the number of patients with major or serious
illness has slacked off, they said.</P>
      <P>The number of cancer patients was the largest group, with each patient using up
more than NT$100,000 of national health expenses on average. In comparison, the
63,000 kidney patients used up NT$32.7 billion, averaging NT$520,000 annually
per patient.</P>
      <P>Nearly 30,000 patients that used respirators used up more than NT$25 billion,
among whom, over half used the respirators for more than 21 days, at an average
cost of NT$7,610 per day.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the increase in new dialysis patients and the total
number of dialysis patients has also lessened and that the growth of expenses
allocated to them has also slowed.</P>
      <P>The number of patients requiring respirators had climbed to 30,000 in 2007 from
25,000 five years ago, and the costs also increased to NT$27.3 billion in 2006
from around NT$22 billion in 2003-2005.</P>
      <P>The growth level surpassed the growth of around 4 percent of national health
insurance expenses annually and had only slackened off since 2006.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang announced  Tuesday that Taiwan
officially  recognizes  Kosovo's independence but denied speculation that the
decision came after angry remarks from China about Taiwan's expression of
congratulation to the newly independent country.</P>
      <P>The decision came after the United States and other European countries
recognized Kosovos sovereignty, Huang said, adding that the remarks by China's
Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not influence Taiwans decision.</P>
      <P>China reacted angrily to Taiwans expression of support for Kosovos independence.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said in a statement Monday
thatit is known to all that as a part of China, Taiwan has no right or
eligibility to give so-called recognitionto Kosovo.</P>
      <P>As a sovereign,  independent  country  and part  of the international community
with 23 allies, there is no doubt that Taiwan has the right to recognize
Kosovo,Huang said, adding that Taiwans expression of congratulations was a kind
ofacquiescencebefore Tuesdays official announcement of recognition.</P>
      <P>It would be negligent of the ministry if Taiwan did not express its stance on
this significant international matter,he added.</P>
      <P>Huang said Chinas remarks came asno surpriseas it has long been squeezing
Taiwans diplomatic space in the international community. Although the
recognition of Kosovo is by no means a response to Chinas comment, had Taiwan
done nothing on the issue, it would be admitting that what China said is
correct.</P>
      <P>Self-determination is a right recognized by the United Nations, and Taiwan, a
member of the international community that cherishes democracy and freedom, is
delighted that the people of Kosovo have the fruits of independence, democracy
and freedom to look forward to, the minister said.</P>
      <P>Under international law, a sovereign state can recognize an entity as a country
to join any international body that requires statehood, Huang noted, saying that
Chinas remarks failed to accord with the basic concept of international law.</P>
      <P>Huang said there have been some contacts between Taiwan and Kosovo over the last
two years and that Taiwan has made a good impression on Kosovan government
officials and media that have visited Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Given that Taiwan wishes to develop all kinds of relations with any country that
cherishes peace and freedom, Taiwan willcontinue the bilateral contacts and
develop further relations based on respect and mutual willingness,he said.</P>
      <P>Kosovo, formerly a province of Serbia and under UN administration since
mid-1999, has over 90 percent ethnic Albanians and 7 percent Serbs making up its
2 million population. It has officially declared independence and has been
recognized by the United States as well as the majority of countries in the
European Union.</P>
      <P>However, there are a number of dissenters to Kosovos independence, including
Serbia and Russia, which even called an emergency United Nations Security
Council meeting to protest the declaration.</P>
      <P>China expressed grave concern over Kosovo's declaration of independence Monday,
saying that it can produce a series of results that will lead to a seriously
negative influence on peace and stability in the Balkan region, and that U.N.
Security Council Resolution 1244 is still the political basis and legal
foundation under which Kosovo's status should be resolved.</P>
      <P>China fears that the immediate recognition granted to Kosovo by major European
countries and the U.S. might set a precedent for Taiwan and Tibet, which have a
similar relationship to Beijing as Kosovo has to the Serbian capital, Belgrade.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung city government will begin to award contracts for a light rail
project as soon as the Cabinet approves the project's budget of NT$12.2 billion
(US$385.12 million), the city government's Mass Rapid Transit Bureau said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Officials in charge of the project's planning and integration told reporters
they will invite the private sector in June at the latest to invest NT$5.29
billion in the project, while 75 percent of the rest of the budget will come
from the central government, with the remaining 25 percent put up by the city
government.</P>
      <P>The officials said the city government cannot afford to wait any longer,
because the central government cannot be expected to indefinitely stand by its
promise to provide the needed funds.</P>
      <P>The 19.6-km light railway is proposed to supplement Kaohsiung's mass rapid
transit system, which is still under construction. The circular line will have
34 stations, with a 16.3 km stretch of the line completed for use in 2013 and
the full line going into operation in 2017.</P>
      <P>In January, the Kaohsiung city council decided to freeze an initial NT$60
million budget intended for acquiring land for the project.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu has expressed concern that further procrastination
might force the southern port city to abandon the project altogether.</P>
      <P>Most council members, including Speaker Chuang Chi-wang, favor a bus rapid
transit (BRT) system instead of a light rail circular route, because they
contend that light rail systems are no longer preferred by cities in other
countries as the centerpiece of their regional transportation systems.</P>
      <P>They have suggested a high-quality bus service, which they said could be
established at a cost of NT$60 million per kilometer, much lower than the
NT$NT$600 million per kilometer for a light rail system.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian met at the Presidential Office Tuesday with Marshall
Islands Foreign Minister Tony deBrum, who arrived in Taiwan Sunday for a five-
day visit.</P>
      <P>DeBrum is visiting Taiwan to make arrangements for a visit next month by
Marshall Islands President Litokwa Tomeing at Chen's invitation.</P>
      <P>Chen extended his congratulations to the Pacific island's United People's Party
(UPP) for its victory in the presidential election held Jan. 7 and to the new
government formed by the UPP.</P>
      <P>He also expressed gratitude to deBrum for his contributions to bilateral
diplomatic relations. DeBrum was finance minister of the Marshall Islands when
the two countries forged diplomatic ties Oct. 21, 1998 and also attended the
signing ceremony, Chen noted , adding that both deBrum and the UPP have made
great efforts in forging and maintaining the ties.</P>
      <P>Chen said he invited Tomeing to make a state visit when he phoned to
congratulate him Jan. 9. He also thanked Vice President Annette Lu for setting
up the timing of the visit on her diplomatic trip to the Marshall Islands last
month.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed hope that relations between Taiwan and the Marshall Islands will
grow closer on the basis of their present solid friendship.</P>
      <P>DeBrum told Chen that his country is grateful for the help provided by Taiwan's
government and people. It has always supported Taiwan's determination to seek
independence because what Taiwan has undergone has also been experienced by the
Marshall Islands, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that he will have already left the Presidential Office when the
third Taiwan-Pacific Allies Summit is held later this year in the southern port

    <HEADLINE>Former Academia Sinica head says nuclear plants are `lesser evil'</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh said Tuesday that his support for
the construction of a fourth nuclear power plant in Taiwan does not represent a
change in his stance, explaining that he considers nuclear energy "the lesser
evil."</P>
      <P>Lee was responding  to questions about an Academia Sinica environment and energy
group's report released a day earlier on cutting carbon dioxide emissions. Lee
served as the convener of the country's top research institute's group.</P>
      <P>The report also calls for liberalization of trade between Taiwan and China and
the opening up of the energy market between the two sides.</P>
      <P>"With the current situation of insufficient energy and no feasibility of turning
away from nuclear energy, the group is forced to choose the lesser evil," Lee
said on the sidelines of a meeting to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of
the late Chien Szu-liang, who served as Academia Sinica president from
1970-1983.</P>
      <P>Lee said he agrees with ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) former
Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung's ideals of having a "nuclear-free homeland, " but said
present CO2 emissions are too high.</P>
      <P>Coal-fired power plants contribute heavily to CO2 emissions.</P>
      <P>"To achieve the goal of cutting CO2 levels in 2025 to the level of 2000, the new
government should put off the decommissioning of the previous older nuclear
power plants," Lee said.</P>
      <P>The DPP government, in response to Lin's call for a "nuclear-free homeland,"
suspended the construction of Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant in October
2000, shortly after President Chen Shui-bian's inauguration for his first term
in office.</P>
      <P>An agreement was reached for the resumption of construction only after bitter
wrangling between the executive and legislative branches in February 2001, but
billions of dollars were lost due to the suspension.</P>
      <P>The power plant in Kungliao, Taipei county has yet to be completed.</P>
      <P>In response to the Academia Sinica report, DPP presidential candidate Frank
Hsieh gave a more reserved response, saying that the party has already included
the goal of having a "nuclear-free homeland" in its party platform.</P>
      <P>The DPP is opposed to the construction of the new nuclear power plant, Hsieh
said, adding that Taiwan should instead "have efficient, low-risk generators
replace the aged generators."</P>
      <P>His rival, Ma Ying-jeou of the main opposition Kuomintang, was positive about
the report.</P>
      <P>Ma said that reducing the use of energy that causes CO2 emissions has become a
world trend and urged the speedy completion of the fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>Lee, well-respected in Taiwan and a Nobel laureate, was considered a major
factor in catapulting Chen into the presidency in 2000 when he openly endorsed
him.</P>
      <P>Chen's victory ended KMT's rule of more than five decades in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC to reduce penalty on businessmen who invested illegally in China</HEADLINE>

      <P>A high-ranking official of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) confirmed Monday
that the government will lower fines on Taiwanese business people who violated
local regulations when investing in China.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reportedly is considering offering amnesty before he
leaves office in May to those businesses that invested in China without the
permission of the government, hoping to lure them back to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Companies that violated investment laws when they relocated to China are subject
to fines ranging between NT$50,000 (US$1,577) and NT$25 million, and are
reluctant to return to Taiwan because of fears they would have to pay a stiff
penalty.</P>
      <P>The MAC official said under the new government policy, his agency was inclined
to limit any fines to the minimum amount permissible, which he felt would
provide an incentive for their return.</P>
      <P>"In my opinion, most of the Taiwanese businessmen are more willing and can
afford to pay the lowest penalty," the official said, but he indicated there
would be some exceptions.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese enterprises with operations in China making products that are not
among the categories permitted by the government to be produced there will not
be eligible for the amnesty, as it would require amending the law," the official
said.</P>
      <P>"The MAC will continue study ways to address the issue, " he added.</P>
      <P>The biggest fine ever levied under the existing regulations was NT$5 million,
imposed on United Microelectronics Corp (UMC) , the world's No. 2 chip foundry,
for helping a Chinese chipmaker establish a plant in Suzhou, China by providing
capital, personnel and technology.</P>
      <P>In addition to the amnesty policy, the MAC official said, the government also
plans to offer more tax and land acquisition incentives to lure Taiwanese
business people with investments abroad back to the country.</P>

      <P>In a bid to lure Taiwanese investors back from China to help boost the local
economy, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has earmarked NT$10 million to help
their enterprises upgrade capabilities if they want to invest in Taiwan,
Minister Steve R.L. Chen announced Monday.</P>
      <P>The plan is part of an existing project aimed at offering assistance to local
small and medium businesses to obtain business expertise and upgrade
manufacturing techniques.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ministry is also planning to adopt simplified application
procedures to allow China-based Taiwanese investors, who have yet to complete
company registration in Taiwan, to apply for a subsidy before setting up a
company here.</P>
      <P>Also Tuesday, Cabinet spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey dismissed speculation that the
government's plan to adjust its policy on cross-Taiwan Strait trade is related
to the March 22 presidential race.</P>
      <P>"The government, when coping with cross-strait economic issues, has been going
beyond party lines and never takes into account factors associated with election

      <P>More than 1 million Taiwanese business people and their family members are
reportedly living in China. They represent a significant voting bloc in the
upcoming election.</P>
      <P>Shieh did not respond to questions regarding  whether the government will grant
amnesty to Taiwanese investors who have violated relevant regulations in
investing in China. Violators are subject to legal penalties.</P>
      <P>Shieh argued that China is no longer favorable to Taiwanese investors due to the
higher cost of doing business in the mainland as a result of China's new labor

      <P>Therefore, Shieh said, the government is duty bound to create an attractive

      <P>Taiwan's world-famous Cloud Gate Dance Theater has decided to choose a disused
art and education site in the northern county of Taipei to be the theater's
permanent rehearsal studio, a Taipei County official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The decision came as a surprise because Lin Hwai-min, founder and choreographer
of the 35-year-old dance company, said a day earlier that the company still
needed time to finalize a decision on its new studio.</P>
      <P>The theater's 1,324 square-meter rehearsal studio, costumes, props and
production archives were lost in a fire Feb. 11.</P>
      <P>Lin was expected to call a news conference the following day to explain the
company's decision, along with Taipei magistrate Chou Hsi-wei.</P>
      <P>Lin contacted Chou Monday to express his willingness to rent the site in the
county's Tamshui township as a new rehearsal studio, the county official said.</P>
      <P>Chou welcomed Lin's decision and promised his full assistance for the troupe,
known for blending Asian mythology,  folklore and aesthetics with a modern
sensibility, according to the official.</P>
      <P>Among Cloud Gate's best known works are Nine Songs, Moon Water and the Cursive
trilogy inspired by Chinese calligraphy.</P>
      <P>Following the fire, the Taipei county government, the Taipei city government and
the Cabinet-level Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) offered to provide Lin with
rehearsal spaces and funds.</P>
      <P>During a Feb. 14 meeting with CCA Chairman Wang Tuoh, Lin told Wang that he had
decided to choose the Taiwan Human Rights Memorial park in Taipei City's Jingmei
as a mid-term rehearsal venue and will start to use it from March.</P>
      <P>Cloud Gate is generally considered to have greatly raised Taiwan's international
profile.</P>
      <P>The theater has staged over 1,500 shows locally and globally over the years,
with each attracting an average of 60,000 people.</P>
      <P>Lin had previously blasted the central government for failing to boost the
country's cultural development and called for greater attention to local
performing art groups, which he said are in dire financial need.</P>

      <P>A Christian hospital in eastern Taiwan announced Tuesday that it was joining
hands with FamilyMart, a convenience store chain, to solicit donations to help
aboriginal youths.</P>
      <P>Huang Sheng-hsiung, executive officer of the Mennonite Christian Hospital in
Hualien, said the goal is to raise NT$11.75 million (US$357,200)  for aboriginal
youths who cannot pursue regular studies to learn vocational skills, and help
them come out of their dire economic straits.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that the average lifespan of aboriginal people is 10 years shorter
than non-aboriginals, which he said is not due only to environmental or
nutritional factors but also to lack of education.</P>
      <P>He said education can serve as a "fishing pole" for the economically
underprivileged people, so that they can "fish for themselves" rather than just
being given fish handouts.</P>
      <P>According to statistics of the Council of Indigenous Peoples, the jobless rate
among aboriginal people is two or three times the national average. The jobless
rate among the aboriginal community surges during periods of economic
sluggishness, yet when the economy turns around, the drop in the jobless rate
among them is usually slower than in other sectors.</P>
      <P>Huang said aboriginal youths usually enter the job market early to support their
families and that if they can find work in their hometowns, they will tend to
stay there, which will not only reduce the exodus of young people from
aboriginal communities but will also help the elderly get better care.</P>
      <P>Family Mart Chairman Pan Chin-ting said he will install donation boxes in the
chain's 2,000 stores around the country.</P>
      <P>He will also mobilize staff to go to Hualien and Taitung to do volunteer work to
publicize and promote the donation drive.</P>

      <P>The Special Investigation Task Force (SITF) under the Supreme Prosecutors Office
remains undecided on whether to probe a newly established defense company known
as Taiwan Goal, a spokesman for the panel said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Yun-nan, director of the SITF office, was commenting on media reports that
the Supreme Prosecutors Office will investigate possible irregularities in
Taiwan Goal's establishment under the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration's guidance.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the SITF is just collecting news clips and other relevant
information and data. At the moment, he said, the SITF is still undecided on
whether to launch a probe into the case.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Premier Chiuo I-jen was quoted as having told incumbent and
former DPP lawmakers Tuesday that the establishment of Taiwan Goal, a joint
venture between the government and private investors, is mainly aimed at
diversifying sources of Taiwan's arms procurement.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Goal, founded late last month, is led by Wu Nai-jen, a stalwart of the
DPP's now disbanded New Tide faction. Capital of NT$200 million (US$6.3 million)
has been underwritten for Taiwan Goal, with NT$90 million expected to come from
the Ministry of National Defense. As the project is still in the planning
stages, the defense ministry has not yet injected any funds into the company,
ministry officials said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's state-run aerospace company has been forbidden from displaying the name
"Taiwan" on its booth or showing the national emblem on its exhibits at an
aviation show being held in Singapore, a company official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The organizers of Singapore Airshow 2008 also banned a DVD recording of the
March 2007 christening ceremony for the company's upgraded indigenous defense
fighters presided over by President Chen Shui-bian, said Aerospace Industrial
Development Corp. Vice President Hsu Yen-nien.</P>
      <P>After negotiating with the organizers over the "unreasonable" requests, the
company was only allowed to indicate its country of origin in Chinese but not in
English, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Singapore Airshow 2008, being held Feb. 19-24, is a biennial aerospace and
defense event organized by Singapore's Defence Science and Technology Agency and
the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore.</P>
      <P>Owing to opposition from the People's Republic of China, Taiwan has often been
barred from using its official name, the Republic of China,  and displaying its
national flag when taking part in international activities. It is rare for the
name "Taiwan" to be forbidden.</P>

      <P>Some 100 Hsinchu Science Park workers gathered Wednesday to launch a "cycling to
work" drive, urging people employed at the park to improve their health and
reduce greenhouse gas emissions by using green modes of transportation.</P>
      <P>Wearing safety helmets and sports gear, members of the group assembled outside
the park's administration building in the morning to promote the drive, which
calls for the scientists, engineers, and others working at the park to cycle to
work at least one Wednesday a week.</P>
      <P>Lulu Hsieh, chairwoman of the park's biking club, said she anticipated more park
workers will join the 139-member club after Wednesday's campaign.</P>
      <P>One of the club's members, Hsieh said, has already been biking to work every day
from Toufen Township south of Hsinchu, a 45-minute ride.</P>
      <P>Some 130,000 people, including foreign blue-collar workers, work at the Hsinchu
Science Park -- Taiwan's first and largest science park that has come to be
known as the country's "Silicon Valley."</P>
      <P>Science Park Administration Director Huang Teh-jui met with the bikers as they
launched the campaign and praised their effort.</P>
      <P>Hsieh took advantage of Huang's presence to ask him if the administration  could
help develop  bike lanes  and restrooms exclusively for bikers within and near
the park.</P>
      <P>She also called on colleagues who drive to work to pay closer attention to
bikers and yield to them on the road.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's state-controlled Aerospace Industrial Development Corp. (AIDC) unveiled
Tuesday its plan to develop a new generation of fighters that meet the country's
future defense needs.</P>
      <P>The company  aims to equip the new fighters  with combat capabilities comparable
to those of the next-generation U.S. Joint Strike Fighters and will make sure
they are manufactured with mature technologies to persuade the military to buy
them, AIDC Chairman Kent Feng told the Central News Agency while taking part in
Singapore Airshow 2008.</P>
      <P>The company is also seeking to develop a new generation of advanced jet trainers
that use subsonic technology, Feng said.</P>
      <P>Stressing that sustaining the development of Taiwan's defense industry remains a
major mission of AIDC, Feng said the company will maintain close cooperation
with the Chung-shan Institute of Science and Technology under the Ministry of
National Defense to achieve the objective.</P>
      <P>Formerly known as the Aero Industry Development Center, the entity was
established as a military organization in 1969 under the authority of the
Republic of China Air Force. It adopted its present name in 1996 when it was
transformed into a government-owned company.</P>
      <P>The company is the maker of the indigenous defense fighter (IDF), known locally
as the Ching-Kuo jet fighters in memory of late President Chiang Ching-kuo.</P>
      <P>In March 2007, the company officially inaugurate an upgraded version of the IDF,
named the Chingkuo Imposing Eagle.</P>
      <P>Feng, formerly a member of the Air Force, said in addition to upgrading the
IDFs, working to transform AIDC into a contract aerospace designer and
manufacturer is one of his most important missions as head of the company.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit Bureau (KMRTB) filed an application Tuesday for
second-phase inspection of the north section of its Red Line, hoping that it can
begin service as early as next month.</P>
      <P>After the initial inspection was completed Monday, inspectors from Kaohsiung's
transit authority gave the bureau the go-ahead to apply for a second inspection,
which will be conducted by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC).</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung inspectors said, however, that the bureau must improve the line's
facilities for the disabled, security systems and other incomplete sections.</P>
      <P>KMRTB planning department section chief Li Yong-kun hopes a second and final
inspection would happen soon.</P>
      <P>"We hope the second inspection can be done before the end of February, so that
the Red Line can begin operating in early March, " he said.</P>
      <P>The south section of the Red Line already passed two phases of inspection.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung MRT system is the second one built in Taiwan. Taipei's MRT, in

    <TEXT>
      <P>Veteran long-distance Taiwanese swimmer Wang Han is planning to lead a team of
nine swimmers across the Taiwan Strait in June, after failing in a similar
attempt in August 2007 due to poor weather conditions.</P>
      <P>Wang, who successfully swam across 12 major channels or straits around the world
between 1986 and 1998, including a solo crossing of the Strait of Gibraltar and
a tag team effort across the English Channel, issued an open invitation to long-
distance swimmers of any nationality living in Taiwan or gender, aged between 20
and 45, to join his team.</P>
      <P>The nine swimmers he eventually selects, two other back-ups and Wang himself are
expected to begin training March 29, Wang said at a news conference.</P>
      <P>Wang's plan is for the 10 swimmers to start their swim from either of the
northern counties of Hsinchu or Miaoli in June when sea temperatures are higher
and swim in a relay toward a beach in China's Fujian province, if weather and
sea conditions permit.</P>
      <P>The journey could take three to five days to finish, depending on the
conditions, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The shortest straight-line distance across the Taiwan Strait is 145 kilometers,
but the actual swimming distance, when taking into account detours to avoid
sharks and adverse ocean currents, could be 200 kilometers, he indicated.</P>
      <P>The ideal dates for the challenge will be June 10 and June 23, Wang said, citing
the Central Weather Bureau's marine meteorology information services.</P>
      <P>Wang, 56, once said that despite his successful experiences in swimming across
straits or channels around the globe, he considered the Taiwan Strait as the
"longest" and "most difficult" one to tackle,  giving  various  political,
environmental  and  even psychological difficulties involved.</P>
      <P>After several years of preparation, Wang and his team announced the first
attempt to swim across the Taiwan Strait in January 2007.</P>
      <P>The swim began from Fishermen's Wharf in Danshuei, Taipei County, Aug. 22, with
28 swimmers, including 16 from Taiwan, eight from China and four from South
Africa, participating.</P>
      <P>Their ill-fated challenge ended the next day, however, when the swimmers were
transported back to Taiwan as a result of overcast skies and turbulent ocean
currents caused by an oncoming typhoon.</P>
      <P>Wang and his team are also planning a third attempt to swim across the Taiwan
Strait in 2009, where the swimmers would first fly to Fujian and swim back to
Taiwan across the Taiwan Strait.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will join forces with the private sector
in setting up an investment and development  company which will focus on
encouraging  and facilitating Taiwanese investment in India, a high-ranking MOEA
official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In addition to building an industrial park in India, the official said,  the
proposed  company  will  also search  for business opportunities,  evaluate
business feasibility  and establish an information  data bank for Taiwanese
enterprises interested in investing in India.</P>
      <P>According to the official, Taiwan hopes to forge stronger economic ties with
India as the South Asian coutnry is one of the so-called "BRIC" coutnries
considered as the most promising of the world's emerging markets.</P>
      <P>The company's establishment is part of a government policy to expand the
investment network for Taiwanese business people, the official said.</P>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Steve R. L. Chen will invite industry representatives
later  this week to discuss  the details  of establishing the company geared
towards India investments, in the hope of making concrete progress on setting up
the company by the end of this year, the official said.</P>
      <P>A majority of the funding for the company will come from the private sector,
which will lead the company, the official said, but the MOEA does not rule out
the possibility that the company's capital will be partly funded by the
Executive Yuan's National Development Fund.</P>
      <P>The southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh has already agreed to provide 1,200
hectares of land as an industrial area for Taiwanese investors to set up
factories and offices there, based on a memorandum of understanding signed by
Taiwan and India last month.</P>
      <P>Chiu Po-ching,  director-general  of MOEA's  Department  of Investment Services
led a delegation to India earlier this year to evaluate development of some of
India's industries, including those in software, information technology, food
processing, shoe making, and vehicle components and parts.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese manufactureres had launched a total of 69 investment projercts worth
around US$400 million in India as of last July, according to governemnt
statistics.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government had previously started fund-raising  to establish a company
to facilitate investments in the Middle East, as the area is also included in
the government's plan to widen Taiwan's investment network.</P>

      <P>Taiwan shipped 28.19 million notebook computers in the fourth quarter of 2007,
hitting a record high for a single quarter, according to a report released
Wednesday by the International Data Corp. (IDC) Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The number marked an increase of 11.6 percent from the previous quarter and a
growth of 44 percent over the year-earlier level, driven mainly by rising market
demand and Christmas purchases, the report said.</P>
      <P>Of the shipments, 24.95 million units, or 88.5 percent, were delivered by
Taiwan's top five original design manufacturers (ODMs) -- Quanta Computer Inc.,
Compal Electronics Inc., Wistron Corp., Inventec Corp. and ASUSTek Computer
Inc., the report said.</P>
      <P>Notebook production during the period amounted to US$15.14 billion, for a year-
on-year increase of 31.6 percent, it said.</P>
      <P>Helen Chiang, a research manager with IDC Taiwan, said domestic notebook
manufacturers performed better than expected in the quarter because of brisk
sales in consumer PC models by major brands such as Hewlett Packard, Acer and
Dell.</P>
      <P>Although battery supply shortages had been predicted to impact notebook
shipments, only a small number of manufacturers were actually affected, Chiang
pointed out.</P>
      <P>For the first quarter of 2008, the shortage is expected to also have only a
limited impact on the industry, she said.</P>

    <TEXT>The New York Times:Wisconsin Hands Obama aVictory, the Ninth in a Row

Senator Barack Obama decisively beat Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in the
Wisconsin primary on Tuesday night, accelerating his momentum ahead of crucial
primaries in Ohio and Texas and cutting into Mrs. Clintonzs support among women
and union members.

The Wall Street Journal:Obama Holds Off Clinton in Wisconsin

Barack Obama held off Hillary Clinton's belated attempt to brake his momentum in
Wisconsin's  Democratic  primary,  winning his ninth-straight presidential-
nominating contest as the two get closer to the showdown Sen. Clinton has
promised in Ohio and Texas two weeks away.

In Wisconsin's Republican primary and Washington state caucuses, Arizona Sen.
John McCain prevailed as expected over his main remaining challenger, former
Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. The senator drew closer to the 1,191 delegates that
would make official his current status as the party's presumptive nominee,
though a sizable number  of social conservatives  continued  to register  their
unhappiness by voting for his rival.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>Dispute between bank and fugitive tycoon's wife nears verdict</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los Angeles,  Feb.  19 (CNA)
02/20/08  17:06:14
(By Chu Lu-sheng and Howard Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Final arguments were heard at a Los Angeles court Tuesday in a dispute between a
Taiwan-based bank and the wife of a Taiwanese fugitive tycoon, but it is
uncertain when the judge will render his verdict.</P>
      <P>Attorneys for Mega International Commercial Bank stated the bank's case in a
federal court in Los Angeles against defendant Wang Chin She-ying, president of
China Rebar Co., an affiliate of the Rebar Group. Mega Bank is the Rebar Group's
biggest creditor.</P>
      <P>Wang You-theng, Wang Chin's husband as well as founder of the Rebar Group, is
suspected of having embezzled billions of dollars in corporate funds from the
group before fleeing with his wife to China in late 2006 and then to the United
States in January 2007.</P>
      <P>Mega Bank filed suit in a Los Angeles court on Feb. 5, 2007 to recover the Rebar
Group's outstanding loans. According to bank officials, the bank initially hoped
to recover US$ 210 million but later adjusted the figure after reassessing their
strategy.</P>
      <P>After hearing oral arguments, Judge Elihn M. Berle said it might take some time
to announce the verdict due to his involvement with other pending jury trials.</P>
      <P>According to convention in U.S. civil procedures, judges can issue verdicts
within two or three days. Some judges, however, will issue a temporary verdict
that enables both sides to appeal or add details within 15 days. After taking
the added information into consideration, the judge then renders his final
verdict.</P>
      <P>If Mega Bank wins the case, a list of assets that the bank can claim from Wang
Chin to reimburse her debts will be listed with the verdict.</P>
      <P>A high-end property worth US$3 million under Wang Chin's name in Pasadena,
California and about 7,000 shares of OMNIBANK worth US$200,000 to US$300,000
will be the premier targets for the bank in reclaiming the debts, said officials
of Mega's Los Angeles branch.</P>
      <P>Wang Chin, however, could also appeal a verdict against her.</P>
      <P>The Rebar scandal came to light in January 2007 after the group's China Rebar
Co. and Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber Co. applied for insolvency
restructuring, triggering a run on the Chinese Bank, another Rebar affiliate.</P>
      <P>Taiwan authorities placed the couple on the country's most-wanted list in Jan.
2007 and have been seeking U.S. assistance to have them repatriated back to
Taiwan to face charges.</P>
      <P>In March, Taiwanese prosecutors indicted Wang and 106 others involved in the
Rebar Group scandal on a long list of charges, including fraud, money laundering
and insider trading. They are seeking a prison sentence of 30 years and an
unprecedented fine of NT$1.71 billion (US$52.13 million) for Wang.</P>
      <P>According to initial estimates, the total losses caused by the Wang family's
systematic siphoning of assets from Rebar Group-owned subsidiaries totals NT$300
billion (US$ 9.38 billion) -- about one-fourth of Taiwan's annual tax revenues.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Gene screening technique used in IVF to produce healthy baby</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese researchers have successfully applied gene screening techniques to the
in-vitro fertilization process and helped a couple carrying pathogenic genes of
thalassemia to have a healthy baby girl last month, medical sources reported
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Researchers from National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) said the girl's
birth could also bring some hope to her seriously ill older brother, who was
born two years ago and diagnosed at birth as having serious thalassemia or
Mediterranean anemia.</P>
      <P>Her umbilical cord blood, collected and preserved at delivery, contains the
genes that can be used to treat her brother, with the aim of at least
alleviating his symptoms even if a cure cannot be effected, they claimed.</P>
      <P>Chen Su-yuen, a physician at NTUH's Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology,
said both of the couple carry the thalassemia gene but neither have shown
symptoms. However, the genes were passed onto the older boy and became dominant.</P>
      <P>Chen said the couple went to his hospital for assistance with gene-screened IVF,
in the hope that they could have a healthy baby and that the newborn's umbilical
stem cells could save the older child.</P>
      <P>Hospital researchers later retrieved eggs and sperm from the couple and
developed 16 embryos for further screening. After careful inspections and
comparisons,  only one of the 16 embryos was determined to be carrying recessive
pathogenic genes that will not develop into thalassemia and whose human
lymphocyte antigen (HLA) is identical to that of the older boy, indicating that
gene therapy can be carried out without rejection.</P>
      <P>The stem cell transplant operation for the boy will take place in April or May,
according to a NTUH statement.</P>
      <P>Su Yi-ning, a physician at the NTUH's Department of Medical Genetics, explained
that when both parents carry thalassemia genes, their children have a 25 percent
possibility of carrying the dominant gene, a 50 percent chance of carrying
recessive genes, and only a 25 percent chance of carrying normal genes.</P>
      <P>For HLA rejection among siblings, the percentage of non- rejection is 25
percent, Su went on.</P>
      <P>"For a sibling to carry normal genes and have identical HLA to the brother, the
chance is as low as 0.06 percent; and to carry recessive genes and the identical
HLA, the chance is 0.18 percent, " Su explained, adding that the IVF success
rate is about 25 percent.</P>

released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The "Internet Broadband Usage in Taiwan" survey conducted by the Taiwan Network
Information Center (TWNIC) revealed that 15,548,000 individual users in Taiwan
accessed the Internet last month, 318,000 more than the same period last year.</P>
      <P>Just over two-thirds, or 68.51 percent, of Taiwan's population aged 12 and above
use the Internet, a 0.74 percent increase from the previous year while 63.37
percent used broadband, the survey showed.</P>
      <P>A slightly higher percentage of males (70.2 percent) than females (66.8 percent)
logged  onto the Internet,  while the highest concentration of use was in the

in Taiwan, are connected to the Internet, while 66.41 percent, or 4,960,000
households, are using broadband.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed that among broadband users, 93.57 percent go online at
home, with the peak hours for surfing falling between 7 p.m. and midnight.</P>
      <P>Some 20.74 percent of those using broadband spent more than one hour but less

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has lauded Kosovo's decision to declare independence
from Serbia, saying that "coercion,  intimidation  and violence may silence
people only temporarily."</P>
      <P>Speaking to foreign ambassadors and delegates to Taiwan at a Spring Festival
banquet hosted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Tuesday, Chen said that "the
developments in Kosovo over the past few days have once more demonstrated the
global trend toward democracy and self-determination."</P>
      <P>"Coercion,  intimidation  and violence  may silence  people temporarily," he
went on, "but in the long run, it is futile."</P>
      <P>In addition,  Chen said Taiwan will take another step to consolidate and deepen
its own democracy next month as the country will hold its fourth direct
presidential election March 22.</P>
      <P>Alongside the elections, two national referendums proposed by different
political parties will be held, aimed at supporting Taiwan's bid to join the
United Nations. Taiwan's U.N. membership applications have been rejected by the
world body for the past 15 years annually due to China's objections.</P>
      <P>Chen also drew attention to activists' efforts to call on China to improve its
notorious human rights record.</P>
      <P>He said that "many people concerned with the human rights situation in China
hope to highlight that country's human rights abuses through the 2008 Beijing
Olympic Games."</P>
      <P>"They are exerting pressure on the Communist Party of China and are making known
their hope that China will not just content itself with hosting this magnificent
sporting event, " Chen noted.</P>
      <P>"Rather, they hope China will make genuine progress on its human rights
practices and realize the true Olympic spirit of peace, justice and harmony," he
added.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks came after Hollywood  film director  Steven Spielberg recently
quit as an artistic adviser to the 2008 Olympics to protest China's failure to
do enough to pressure Sudan to end the continuing human suffering in Darfur.</P>
      <P>During the address, Chen further expressed hope that "China will renounce its
intention and preparations to use force against Taiwan, so that the dream of
peaceful co-existence for Taiwan and China, and a win-win situation for both,
can one day come true."</P>
      <P>China has deployed in its southeastern coastal areas over 1,000 missiles
targeting Taiwan and Beijing has repeatedly refused to rule out the use of force
against  Taiwan if it declares  formal independence.</P>

      <P>A Pakistani businessman celebrated his rebirth Tuesday after receiving a
successful liver transplant at a southern Taiwan hospital, made possible by a
special favor from Taiwanese authorities who granted him an unusual visa.</P>
      <P>Ahmed Khawaja Shakeel, 46, is Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital's first
liver transplant recipient from a country considered unfriendly toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Another Pakistani man had approached the Kaohsiung Chang Gung Hospital for a
similar surgery last September, but the patient's visa application was rejected
by Taiwan's representative office in Saudi Arabia, hospital sources said.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan's visa regulations, citizens from countries listed as
politically unfriendly and risky for migration are barred from visiting Taiwan
for medical purposes. Pakistan is high on the list of such countries.</P>
      <P>When relevant government authorities finally agreed to issue the man a visa at
the hospital's request on humanitarian considerations, the patient had already
died.</P>
      <P>In Khawaja's case, the Chang Gung sources said, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) assigned a staff member to assist in the visa application upon receiving
the hospital's request last November.</P>
      <P>Khawaja was diagnosed with hepatitis C and cirrhosis in 2004. After vomiting
blood five times, he was advised to get a liver transplant. He first traveled to
Singapore for treatment. Physicians there suggested that he seek a liver
transplant at the Chang Gung hospital in Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>With foreign ministry's special assistance, Khawaja obtained a visa about 20
days after Chang Gung received his inquiry letter on Nov. 12 last year.
Accompanied by his wife and their only son, Khawaja arrived in Kaohsiung from
Singapore on Jan. 14.</P>
      <P>On Jan. 29, a Chang Gung surgical team conducted a liver transplant on Khawaja,
with his son donating a part of his liver for the operation.</P>
      <P>The 10-hour surgery was successful and Khawaja is recovering well, doctors said.</P>
      <P>The hospital held a celebration for Khawaja Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Khawaja said he heartily appreciates the medical team that saved his life. "I'll
tell my compatriots about Taiwan's high quality health care and medical
service," a grateful Khawaja said.</P>
      <P>Khawaja is scheduled for discharge from the hospital in late March and will then
be transferred to a hostel operated by the hospital where he will live for one
month while he undergoes observation.</P>
      <P>If all goes well, he will be allowed to return to Pakistan in late April,
hospital sources said.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, Khawaja's case is expected to help boost the
government's plan to promote globalization of Taiwan's medical service industry.</P>
      <P>The government has relaxed visa regulations to attract foreign and Chinese
citizens to travel to Taiwan for medical treatment as part of its efforts to
spur growth of medical tourism. enditem/cs</P>

      <P>According to the Tainan county government, which is organizing the festival,
President Chen Shui-bian will preside over a ceremony at 7 p.m. Feb. 21 to light
the centerpiece of the lantern festival, a lantern in the shape of a giant
spinous country rat -- a species of rodent endemic to Taiwan -- praying for
peace and prosperity for the nation.</P>
      <P>The venue of the lantern festival is located in Solar City, a special zone of
the science park, with 88 hectares of showgrounds. Over 55,000 red and yellow
lanterns are used to form giant Chinese and English characters that read "Taiwan
Peace," the theme of the festival. A special area is reserved for religious
lanterns.</P>
      <P>Local and foreign performing groups, including a troupe from Japan, will provide
entertainment to visitors, who will also be treated to 34 fireworks shows
throughout the festival.</P>
      <P>The Tainan county government has also prepared 120,000 hand-held lanterns
featuring the rat motif to give away to visitors.</P>
      <P>To make it easier for visitors to reach the festival, the Taiwan Railway
Administration has scheduled 58 trains each day to stop at a temporary station
located about 100 meters from the venue.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Speed Railway will also provide daily free shuttle services from
its Tainan Station in Gueiren township to the venue.</P>
      <P>For those who drive their own cars to the festival, there is a three-hectare

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Ministry of National Defense (MND) official said Wednesday that he has
suggested to Defense Minister Lee Tien-yu that it is not appropriate for the
ministry to fund a private arms firm, Taiwan Goal, which was set up last month
to deal with Taiwan's arms deals with other countries.</P>
      <P>Wu Wei-jung, director of the MND's Armaments Bureau, made the remarks when he
attended a news conference called by Legislator Kuo Su-chun, a caucus whip of
the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Wu said that after a cautious overview, he suggested that the plan for the MND
to hold a 45 percent stake in the company is unfeasible.</P>
      <P>"Although the idea of establishing the company is good, the timing is
inappropriate because of the March 22 presidential election, which may give rise
to misgivings," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Asked by Kuo whether he suggested to Minister Lee that the company be disbanded,
Wu said only that he "had made full suggestions and communications."</P>
      <P>"As far as I know, Lee agreed to the view," Wu continued.</P>
      <P>Kuo demanded  that Premier Chang Chu-hsiung  announce  the disbanding of Taiwan
Goal prior to the general interpellation session when the legislature officially
opens its first plenary session Feb. 22, describing the stance as the KMT's
"bottom line."</P>
      <P>Kuo said earlier in the week that if the premier does not disband the company,
the KMT-dominated  new legislature will adopt a resolution after the opening of
the first session to forbid the MND from becoming a founding shareholder or from
signing any contracts with the company.</P>
      <P>She also said that if the MND has already entered into contracts with Taiwan
Goal, the KMT caucus will boycott all related government budgets, to prevent
public funds from being invested in the company.</P>
      <P>She further said that if the KMT gets back into power in the March 22
presidential election, the new administration will not ratify any contracts with
Taiwan Goal and will immediately disband the company.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Chang Hsien-yao questioned if the MND or the Armaments Bureau had
any say in the forming of the company, even though the MND is the largest

Wu said the Presidential Office did "suggest a name."</P>
      <P>Premier Chang confirmed last week that the controversial establishment of Taiwan
Goal was made possible with public funds from various government agencies and
state-owned corporations, but he defended the move as "necessary to help upgrade
Taiwan's defense industry."</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) also confirmed that Taiwan Goal
completed registration with the MOEA Jan. 28 as a private company, with capital
of NT$1 billion (US$31.15 million) and paid-in capital totaling NT$80 million,
and that Wu Nai-jen, a DPP heavyweight and head of China Steel Machinery Corp.
-- a subsidiary of the formerly state-owned China Steel Corp. -- serves as
chairman of the company.</P>
      <P>MOEA data shows that Taiwan Goal has a seven-member board of directors, with
three seats going to the MND, which will contribute 45 percent of Taiwan Goal's
capital. The company's office is located in Taipei 101 -- one of the world's
tallest buildings.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Goal is registered to deal in a variety of businesses, including the
import and export of arms and weaponry systems; sales of garments and
accessories,  industrial explosives,  precision instruments,  and batteries of
all types; and product design, according to the MOEA.</P>
      <P>The defense minister was quoted by opposition KMT lawmakers as having
acknowledged that although the MND is the largest shareholder, the company will

    <HEADLINE>Enhancing mini-links aimed at boosting local tourism: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 20 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Before the government makes the mini-links fully available to the public, it
will first enhance the benefits of the links for residents of the islands of
Kinmen and Matsu, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Chen Ming-tong said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Although the government has not opened the mini-links to everyone, it has been
studying feasible means to help bolster tourism on the two outlying islands by
taking advantage of the links, such as organizing group tours for tourists from
Taiwan proper to visit China's Fujian Province via the links," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen made the comments in response to reporters' questions following a regular
weekly Executive Yuan meeting.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC chief, it would be good if Kinmen and Matsu travel agencies
could design special tour packages to attract Taiwan residents to stay for two
nights on the two outlying islands and then travel to Fujian for sightseeing.</P>
      <P>"And should China be willing to allow more tourists to sightsee in Kinmen or
Matsu, tourism on both islands would benefit greatly, " he added.</P>
      <P>Frank Hsieh, the presidential candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) in the March 22 presidential election, confirmed a day earlier that
President Chen Shui-bian is assessing the possibility of relaxing the
government's China economic and investment policies before he ends his tenure
May 20.</P>
      <P>The MAC chief, said, however that "many opening proposals toward China, although
being assessed by the government, are still some way off."</P>
      <P>"The government's failure to make the mini-links available to all Taiwan's
nationals lies in the large number of local people visiting China every year,"
he argued, noting that in 2007, Taiwan people made more than 4 million visits to
China.</P>
      <P>"The facilities at Kinmen and Matsu airports cannot accommodate such a large
number as 10,000 travelers per day if the mini-links were opened to all Taiwan
citizens, " he explained, insisting that "the key point concerning the mini-
links at the present stage is to take better advantage of them and create
wellbeing for residents of the two outlying islands."</P>
      <P>"The government has done its best to permit as many people as possible to use
the direct shipping services linking Taiwan's Kinmen and Matsu  islands  to
China's  Fujian  Province  after their implementation from January 2001,"
according to Chen.</P>
      <P>"The scope of the current mini-links was expanded in 2004 to all China-based
Taiwanese businessmen registered with the government, retired veterans and
religious and academic groups, marking a departure from earlier years, when only
Fujian-based Taiwanese businessmen and Kinmen and Matsu residents were permitted
to travel via the links, "he went on.</P>
      <P>The mini-links -- direct shipping and trade services between Taiwan-held Kinmen
and Matsu islands and the Fujian ports of Xiamen, Mawei and Quanzhou -- were set
up to offset the lack of such links between Taiwan proper and China.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet passed draft amendments and a provisional statute Wednesday that, if
passed by the legislature, will streamline the Executive Yuan's structure and
provide incentives for civil servants and political appointees to retire early.</P>
      <P>Under the Organic Law of the Executive Yuan amendment, the number of Cabinet
agencies will be reduced from 36 to 26, with 14 ministries, seven councils and
five independent institutions. The amendment, if passed, will be implemented
Jan. 1, 2010.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet also passed a draft provisional statute on the adjustment of the
functions, business and organization of the Executive Yuan that will allow civil
servants with 20 years of service, civil servants aged over 50 with 10 years of
service, and those who have served in the highest posts for at least three years
to apply to retire with an additional seven months' salary.</P>
      <P>The statute applies to over 190,000 civil servants, political appointees and
faculty members of public schools and universities. Only civil servants hired
before the date of the statute's passage by the Cabinet, or Feb. 20, 2008, will
be included.</P>
      <P>Those eligible for the retirement incentive will be able to apply from July 1,
2009, with the amount of the incentive progressively reduced by 58 percent of a
month's salary each month during the one-year period that the statute is in
effect.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan also passed an amendment to the Organic Standard Law of the
Central Government Agencies to raise the limit on the number of ministries and

    <HEADLINE>Economic Ministry announces ban on rebar exports</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20 (CNA)
02/20/08  20:48:45

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) announced Wednesday a ban on the export
of rebars and small billets -- the main material for the production of round
steel bars or rebars for construction -- in light of an outcry from the domestic
real estate development industry over surging steel prices.</P>
      <P>The ban is expected to last for three months after it takes effect in two weeks,
according to Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R.L. Chen.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said, the MOEA will also put exports of H-shaped steel and steel
scrap under "supervision" which will also last for three months.</P>
      <P>The ministry, however, will respect the market mechanism rather than intervening
in price fluctuations of steel building materials, he added.</P>
      <P>Lai Cheng-yi, chairman of the Shining Group, which is known for building high-
priced houses and resorts, complained earlier in the day that the costs of
construction development have surged by NT$6,000 (US$189.27) per ping (3.3 sq.
ft. ) over the past few weeks, mainly as a result of surging prices of rebars
and gravel.</P>
      <P>"The problem is now that you cannot buy rebars (reinforcing steel bars) even if
you have money, " said Lai, claiming that there are people who have been
hoarding the products.</P>
      <P>Lai expressed hope that the administration will investigate the surging prices
and warned that public construction projects and private developers will be
forced to suspend operations should the government not intervene in time.</P>
      <P>Wei Chia-ming, president of the Shining Group, said that owing to the surging
prices,  the room for price negotiations  between developers and house buyers
has shrunk by at least 5 percent.</P>
      <P>Wei lamented that because each major steel bar supplier is now willing to
provide Shining with no more than 2,000 kg of the product each month, the
company has been forced to source steel bars from as many more suppliers as
possible.</P>
      <P>Even pushing like this, Wei said, Shining is anticipating that it will face
difficulty achieving its target for this year of building NT$35 billion (US$1.1
billion)-worth of houses and resorts.</P>
      <P>As a result of surging prices of imported iron ore, which has skyrocketed by 65
percent over the past two weeks, the price of round steel bars in Taiwan is
expected to exceed NT$30,000 per ton in two months, anticipated Chung Jung-
chang, chairman of Huaku Construction, another listed real estate development
company.</P>
      <P>The domestic housing market will suffer an obvious impact beginning from the
second half of the year, with the market in northern Taiwan sustaining
relatively lighter impact than that in southern Taiwan because the northern
Taiwan-based developers can translate higher building costs into higher selling
prices, while their counterparts in southern Taiwan -- where housing prices are
much lower -- will not be able to raise their selling prices much in order not
to frighten off clients, Chung noted.</P>

Taiwan diplomats stationed in Panama said Tuesday, citing MOFA data.</P>
      <P>Central America, South Africa and the Caribbean region are where 12 of Taiwan's
23 diplomatic allies are located.</P>
      <P>The scholarships include 20 reserved for Paraguayan students, 18 for Panamanian

Salvadoran students, six for Guatemalan students, six for Belizean students,
five for Saint Lucia students, four for Haitian students, four for St. Vincent

the data shows.</P>
      <P>No scholarships have been reserved for the Dominican Republic this year.</P>
      <P>Worldwide, MOFA is offering 163 scholarships this year to students from
countries with diplomatic ties with Taiwan or those from countries specified as
diplomatically favorable to Taiwan, after deducting four that were originally

      <P>An investment and development company will be set up in mid-April to encourage
and facilitate Taiwanese businesses to invest in the Middle East, officials in
charge of the Executive Yuan's National Development Fund said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Fund will join forces with the private sector to form the company by
investing a maximum of NT$800 million (US$25.28 million) at the highest or under
the ceiling of 40 percent of total paid-in capital of the new company.</P>
      <P>"The company will help expand business opportunities in the Middle East, seek
major construction tender cases, evaluate business feasibility, and establish a
business information data bank for Taiwanese investors," one of the officials
told reporters.</P>
      <P>The government expects to solicit a total of NT$2.8 billion of capital to set up
the company, but does not rule out the possibility of increasing the target
fund, due to strong interest from the private sector, the official said.</P>
      <P>The company will be controlled by the private sector, the official said.</P>
      <P>So far fundraising has gone well, the official said, adding that more private
enterprises are showing interest in investing in the company after the Ministry
of Economic Affairs sent a delegation to the Middle East to scope out business
opportunities earlier this year.</P>
      <P>The Middle East market is attractive to international investors due to its
abundant oil resources and the fact that several countries in the region are
seeking to diversify their economies, which could present good investment
opportunities for Taiwanese firms.</P>
      <P>The area is considered by Taiwan's government  as a good investment destination
for Taiwanese businesses in its attempt to seek more countries for Taiwanese
business people to invest in.</P>
      <P>Government officials hope to target the petrochemical  and construction
industries and tap into the market through the company, especially in the six
Gulf countries -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United
Arab Emirates.</P>
      <P>Leaders of Taiwan's state-run oil company CPC Corp., as well as Taiwan
Fertilizer Co., TECO Electric and Machinery Corp., Farglory Land Development

      <P>It is not possible for Kosovo to play an active role in the United Nations nor
in other non-governmental organizations any time soon, a U.S. scholar said in
Taipei Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Herbert London, president of the Washington-based think tank, the Hudson
Institute, said in an exclusive interview with the Central News Agency that
neither Russia nor China will permit Kosovo to play an active role in the U.N.</P>
      <P>"But there is an NGO status that is possible for Kosovo, such as in the World
Health Organization or other entities within the U.N. That is a possible
compromise. But in the short term, I don't even think that compromise will
occur," he added.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that "all the comments that have been issued in the last
couple of days clearly suggest that China is going to take a pretty tough line
when it comes to Kosovo's involvement in U.N. activities."</P>
      <P>According to London,  an expert on U.N. affairs, Kosovo's declaration of
independence created a "very interesting precedent," and the Chinese government
at the moment is very concerned about the precedent.</P>
      <P>China expressed grave concern about Kosovo's declaration of independence, saying
that it can produce a series of results that will lead to a seriously negative
influence on peace and stability in the Balkans.</P>
      <P>China fears that the immediate recognition granted to Kosovo by major European
countries and the United States might set a precedent for Taiwan and Tibet,
which have similar relationships to Beijing as Kosovo had to Serbia before the
province went independent.</P>
      <P>London said that there is a kind of "ambiguity" in the American position on the
Kosovo issue and Taiwan, since on the one hand, the U.S. recognizes Kosovo,
while on the other hand, it does not recognize Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The double standard emerged from the fact that China is not Serbia. China's
role in world affairs is totally different from Serbia's," he said, adding that
"we can turn our back on Serbia, which is unimportant in the state of world
affairs. But turning our back on China is not so easy considering all the U.S.
investments in China."</P>
      <P>However, London said "time is on the side of Taiwan" because it is only a
question of time before China undergoes dramatic changes as the political system
will have to be liberalized in facing the problems of the market economy.</P>
      <P>"In the future, the China that looks very different from the China today, might
very well open up opportunities for Taiwan that are inconceivable at the
moment," London said.</P>

      <P>Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng said Wednesday that reported plans by the
government to expand direct "mini strait links" across the Taiwan Strait would
be a "belated blessing."</P>
      <P>Lee was responding to news reports that Chen Chin-jun, secretary-general of the
Executive Yuan, recently revealed that the Cabinet is considering expanding the
"mini cross-strait links, " between Taiwan's outlying islands of Kinmen and
Matsu and China's Fujian province.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Chen Ming-tong confirmed Wednesday that the
government was considering taking such a step, but he noted that realizing such
proposals to further open up to China was still "some way off."</P>
      <P>According to the news reports, under the plan, those who reside in Taiwan proper
would also be allowed to travel to Fujian province directly if they stay two
nights in Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>The reports said allowing more people to travel to China through the outlying
islands is aimed at boosting tourism and economic development on the outlying
islands.</P>
      <P>Lee said Wednesday that although the plan might be an attempt by the Executive
Yuan, which is currently controlled by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party,
to win voter support for its candidate in the March 22 presidential election, he
would still be happy to see the proposal "carried out."</P>
      <P>Lee noted that Vice President Annette Lu had called for the expansion of the
cross-Strait links during her two visits to Kinmen.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Rail Administration (TRA) will launch a pilot program in March to
allow bicyclists to bring their bikes on trains, in an attempt to satisfy the
increasing demand of cyclists to travel long distance with their bikes, a TRA
spokesman said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>This will be the first long-haul public transportation in Taiwan to allow
passengers with their bicycles on board.</P>
      <P>"Riding a bicycle has become a trend in Taiwan, but for cyclists, traveling to
counties far away from home is troublesome, " said TRA Deputy Managing Director
Chang Ying-huei.  "The TRA hopes to give better service to the cyclists to show
its concern about our customers as well as the environment."</P>
      <P>Describing the difficulties bike riders face in Taiwan, Chen Chi-yuan, founder
of the Big Apple (bicycle) Team, which has an estimated  30,000 cyclists around
the island who are members, expressed his appreciation for the TRA's decision.</P>
      <P>"This service indeed benefits cyclists intending to travel far with their
bikes," Chen said.</P>
      <P>"We  are  prohibited  on  board  (many  types  of  public transportation) ,
whether it's buses or trains.... Hopefully, this kind of service will continue
and more routes can be introduced by the TRA."</P>
      <P>According to the TRA, a special train, the "Environmental Friendly Train", will
be operated on a trial basis between Sijhih, a satellite city of Taipei City,
and Miaoli, 112.3 km south of the capital on March 8, April 19 and May 17
respectively.</P>
      <P>"We will evaluate the outcome of the trials as well as the popularity of the
service to see whether we can continue the program, " said Yang Chen-teh,
director of the TRA's transportaiton department.</P>
      <P>The fare for a bicycle will be the same as a passenger's.</P>
      <P>Groups of six or more cyclists are requested to make reservations in advance so
rail service staff can prepare space for them on the train, said Yang.</P>
      <P>Yang said the TRA is also planning to launch another route for this service to
the eastern coastal city of Hualien in the summer. The scenic and less populated
Hualien is a popular area for bicyclists.</P>

      <P>Search teams consisting of fire brigade members and Coast Guard Administration
officials on the outlying island of Matsu searched nearby waters in the East
China Sea for the past three days but failed to find the eight missing crew
members from a sunken Chinese fishing boat.</P>
      <P>Lienchiang County Magistrate Chen Hsueh-sheng said he activated the county's
emergency response mechanism after a Matsu fishery radio station received
distress signals Feb. 18 from the Chinese side saying that its fishing boat, the
Minlianyu 1917, capsized off Dongyin Island, one of the islands in the Matsu
island chain, a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Chen said he immediately dispatched a search team from the local fire brigade to
search the area by boat, and notified the COA to send its patrol cutters to join
the search.</P>
      <P>After receiving a request for help Tuesday from the Taiwan Affairs office in
Lianjiang County of China's Fujian province, Chen asked the Sunrise Airlines Co.
to send a helicopter to circle at low altitude around the shipwreck Wednesday,
but the search again found no survivors.</P>
      <P>The magistrate said the location of the ship-sinking -- at about 120 degrees
east longitude and 26 degrees north latitude -- is actually quite distant from
Dongyin Island, and that the vast stretch of water made the search very
difficult.</P>
      <P>Lianjiang is a county on the coast of Fujian province. Most of the county is

      <P>Taiwan and Libya maintained diplomatic relations from 1959 through 1978. In
1980, Taiwan set up a trade office in Libya, which was shut down in September
1997.</P>
      <P>But Taiwan has continued to make efforts to seek substantial exchanges with the
oil-rich North African nation.</P>
      <P>Through such efforts, Saif Qadhafi, the elder son of Libya leader Moammar
Gadhafi, visited Taiwan in January 2006, and reached an agreement with Taiwan on
exchanging representative offices. Saif became the first influential Libyan
figure to visit Taiwan since the two countries severed diplomatic ties in 1978.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian also visited Libya in May of that year.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials said that Libya has greatly improved its international image and
its ties with the West by cooperating with Washington in fighting terrorism
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu promised Wednesday that the central government will
offer help to Penghu's fishing and aquaculture  industries  to overcome their
current difficulties after record amounts of fish died due to cold weather
conditions over the past two weeks.</P>
      <P>Lu made the pledge during an inspection tour of the offshore island county where
she was briefed by the county's fishery bureau chief Cheng Ming-yuan on the
plight faced by local fishermen and aquaculture farmers.</P>
      <P>While giving  her assurances  to local fishermen  and the aquaculture  industry
that the central government will provide assistance to help them tackle their
losses, she suggested the county government assess the possibility of developing
the deep-sea fishing industry in collaboration with Taiwan's diplomatic allies
instead of relying on the local aquaculture industry -- a main business on
Penghu.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, Penghu's eco-marine system has been severely damaged by the
recent cold snap, and the local government also should consider shifting its
focus to make Penghu a high-tech island group in view of unavoidable natural
catastrophes arising from worsening dramatic climatic changes around the world.</P>
      <P>As much as 1,537 metric tons of fish raised by the local aquaculture industry
died as a result of the recent cold weather, causing losses of more than NT$180
million (US$5.7 million), Cheng reported, explaining that a significant portion
of the dead aquatic products are of high value, including garoupa, gurnard, eel
and scallop.</P>
      <P>Cheng further pointed out that overall monetary losses would be uncalculatable
to Penghu County if the damage made to at least 3,000 metric tons in fishery
resources were added.</P>
      <P>Commenting on an ocean resources recovery plan and a package of measures to prop
up the local aquaculture industry, Cheng said that an estimated NT$236 million
in funds will be needed to carry out the tasks.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, local residents helping the county government workers remove the
large piles of dead fish washed ashore Penghu's beaches over the past 10 days
say they will need more time to complete the clean up.</P>

      <P>The government's efforts to promote acquisitions and mergers among local banks
in the last two years have boosted the financial sector's production values and
wages, a top financial regulatory official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) will continue to encourage large
local banks to expand their overseas markets and attract foreign investment  in
Taiwan,  said FSC Chairman  Hu Sheng-cheng.</P>
      <P>Despite the negative impacts of the credit card crisis in 2006, Taiwan's
insurance industry saw a growth rate of 7.8 percent in the first three quarters
of 2007, Hu said in a keynote speech to students at National Taiwan University.</P>
      <P>The percentage was much higher than the country's economic growth rate of 5.45
percent, Hu said.</P>
      <P>In addition,  the total loans for local small and medium enterprises grew 9.3
percent year-on-year to surpass NT$3 trillion (US$94.7 billion) in 2007, Hu
added.</P>
      <P>In the past, Taiwan had too many banks that provided similar services, which
resulted in price competition, he explained.</P>
      <P>The acquisitions and mergers involving foreign investment in recent years have
forced problematic banks out of the market, Hu said.</P>
      <P>The number of Taiwan's banks has decreased from 53 in 2001 to 39 at present,
according to Hu.</P>
      <P>The consolidation of the financial sector has also increased local banks'
profits, which has helped the sector outperform other industries in terms of pay
raises and year-end bonuses, Hu said.</P>
      <P>To further boost the financial sector's competitiveness, the commission will
push for the establishment of a financial monitoring mechanism between Taiwan
and China, Hu pointed out.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, local banks' offshore banking units (OBUs) have been allowed to
accept foreign currency checking deposits, in currencies other than the Chinese
yuan, from January this year, he continued.</P>
      <P>Hu said that the opening was aimed at enabling the OBUs to meet the capital
needs of overseas Taiwanese businesspeople.</P>
      <P>Hu explained that China-based Taiwanese businesspeople have become a major
source of profits for the OBUs.</P>
      <P>As of the end of last year, the OBUs' assets totaled NT$3 trillion, Hu said,
adding that the pre-tax profits of the OBUs accounted for 57 percent of the
total banks' pre-tax earnings last year.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Hu said that the commission plans to ease the restrictions on the
amount of loans that the OBUs can offer to China-based Taiwanese businesspeople,
which is currently capped at the 30 percent of an OBU's net worth of assets, or
10 percent for unsecured loans.</P>

      <P>Chungtak, who won the crown last October, arrived in Taipei Tuesday for a visit
at the invitation of the Miss Taiwan Beauty Contest organizer.</P>
      <P>The 22-year-old pageant winner is a student at the University of Delhi in India.
The Miss Tibet pageant has been held for the fifth year at Dharamsala in

that she was told if she refused to wear the replaced sash she would have to
leave the competition.</P>
      <P>Chungtak made the decision to withdraw from the Miss Tourism Queen 2007 pageant
and returned to her home in India. She said she did not regret making the
decision and still believes she did the right thing in pulling out.</P>
      <P>Similar title replacements due to pressure from the Chinese government have been
experienced by many of Taiwan's pageant entrants participating in international

the hands of Taiwan's people."</P>
      <P>As to the future of Tibet, Chungtak said she will follow the Dalai Lama's
moderate approaches in dealing with China. Tibet is currently officially claimed
and administered by China, while many Tibetans place their allegiance with the
exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama.</P>
      <P>Chungtak's itinerary in Taiwan includes meeting with Government Information

    <TEXT>
      <P>A European bank has applied to establish a branch in Taiwan, following the trend
of foreign banks acquiring domestic ones over the past two years and the
subsiding credit card crisis, Financial Supervisory Commission Vice Chairwoman
Susan Chang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chang said the European bank's name can only be announced after the application
is approved. But she revealed that the bank's strong points are in asset
management, derivative product investment and new financial products.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan will have a total of 33 foreign banks if the application is approved,"
Chang said.</P>
      <P>The acquisition of domestic banks by foreign banks has atracted more
multinational banking groups to pay attention to the Taiwan market, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The London-based Standard Chartered PLC acquired Taiwan's Hsinchu International
Bank in September 2006.</P>
      <P>The New York-based Citigroup Inc., the most profitable overseas bank in Taiwan,
bought the Bank of Overseas Chinese last April, while ABN Amro Holding NV
assumed control of Taitung Business Bank last June. The HSBC Holdings PLC,
Europe's biggest bank by market value, took control of the debt-laden Chinese
Bank last December.</P>
      <P>Chang said many international financial institutes have recently inquired about
setting up branches in Taiwan, but did not submit applications because they did
not meet the basic requirements.</P>
      <P>Only international  financial institutions ranked among the world's top 500
without any major irregularities within the past five years are qualified to
apply to establish branches in Taiwan, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang added that investment from foreign financial institutions will help
increase management efficiency and service quality, and also proves that
Taiwan's financial market is recognized by the international community.</P>
      <P>The commission will keep working on easing restrictions related to foreign
financial institutions' investment in Taiwan to boost the internationalization
of Taiwan's financial market, Chang said.</P>
      <P>She added that the ease of restrictions on the cross-Taiwan Strait financial
policies will also contribute to attracting more investment from foreign
financial institutions to Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung branch of the Taiwan High Court acquitted a senior Taipei City
government official of slander charges, saying that he harbored no intention of
insulting the plaintiff, the Public Prosecutors Office in the southern port city
of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Su Ying-kuei, director of the Taipei City Department's Department of Labor
Affairs and a former independent legislator, was earlier sentenced by the
Kaohsiung District Court to one and a half months in prison, which could be
converted to a fine, for calling prosecutors in Kaohsiung "walking dogs."</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks on May 23, 2006 while appearing in court over another
slander case involving himself.</P>
      <P>Unhappy with the district court sentence, Su appealed the case to the High
Court. A presiding judge granted his petition and overturned the sentence,
saying that Su was merely expressing his displeasure with the attitudes of the
prosecutors in handling the libel suit involving him, and that his remarks
should not be construed as verbal abuse.</P>
      <P>As the higher court's ruling is final, the Public Prosecutors Office in

    <HEADLINE>European bank applies to set up branch in Taiwan: FSC</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A European bank has applied to establish a branch in Taiwan, following the trend
of foreign banks acquiring domestic ones over the past two years and the
subsiding credit card crisis, Financial Supervisory Commission Vice Chairwoman
Susan Chang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chang said the European bank's name can only be announced after the application
is approved. But she revealed that the bank's strong points are in asset
management, derivative product investment and new financial products.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan will have a total of 33 foreign banks if the application is approved,"
Chang said.</P>
      <P>The acquisition of domestic banks by foreign banks has atracted more
multinational banking groups to pay attention to the Taiwan market, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The London-based Standard Chartered PLC acquired Taiwan's Hsinchu International
Bank in September 2006.</P>
      <P>The New York-based Citigroup Inc., the most profitable overseas bank in Taiwan,
bought the Bank of Overseas Chinese last April, while ABN Amro Holding NV
assumed control of Taitung Business Bank last June. The HSBC Holdings PLC,
Europe's biggest bank by market value, took control of the debt-laden Chinese
Bank last December.</P>
      <P>Chang said many international financial institutes have recently inquired about
setting up branches in Taiwan, but did not submit applications because they did
not meet the basic requirements.</P>
      <P>Only international  financial institutions ranked among the world's top 500
without any major irregularities within the past five years are qualified to
apply to establish branches in Taiwan, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang added that investment from foreign financial institutions will help
increase management efficiency and service quality, and also proves that
Taiwan's financial market is recognized by the international community.</P>
      <P>The commission will keep working on easing restrictions related to foreign
financial institutions' investment in Taiwan to boost the internationalization
of Taiwan's financial market, Chang said.</P>
      <P>She added that the ease of restrictions on the cross-Taiwan Strait financial
policies will also contribute to attracting more investment from foreign
financial institutions to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cabinet unveils plan to cut business, individual income tax rates</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 21 (CNA)
02/21/08  13:29:20
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet unveiled Wednesday its plan to reduce business and individual income
tax rates to ease the burdens on taxpayers, a measure which could be implemented
as early as 2010.</P>
      <P>The plan was put forth in preparation for the expected expiration of the Statute
for Upgrading Industries at the end of 2009. The government is expected to see
its revenue increase by NT$150 billion (US$4.74 billion) per year after the tax
deductions or exemptions currently enjoyed by targeted businesses are abolished
following the termination of the statute, said Minister of Finance Ho Chih-chin.</P>
      <P>The new tax rates could be put into force Jan. 1, 2010 if related laws are
amended by the Legislative Yuan by then, Ho said.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, the business income tax rate would be decreased from the current
25 percent to 17.5 percent, and the current 10 percent tax rate on undistributed
corporate earnings would be abolished altogether.</P>
      <P>According to Deputy Minister of Finance Chang Sheng-ford, the changes would help
improve taxation transparency because they would conform the nominal tax rate
with the effective tax rate.</P>
      <P>Chang said the reform would also bridge the gap between Taiwan and neighboring
economies such as Hong Kong and Singapore, which see their business income tax
rates standing at 17.5 percent and 18 percent, respectively, and thus help
enhance Taiwan's international competitiveness.</P>
      <P>In terms of individual income tax, the Cabinet is planning to adjust the
progressive tax brackets from the current 6 percent, 13 percent, 21 percent, 30
percent and 40 percent to 5.5 percent, 12 percent, 19.5 percent, 28 percent and
37.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The special deduction for salary or wages per person would be increased from the
current NT$78,000 to NT$100,000, that for the disabled would be raised from
NT$77,000 to NT$100,000, and that for tuition would be adjusted from NT$25,000
per household to NT$25,000 per child.</P>
      <P>Concerning the standard deduction category for income tax, the amount would be
raised from NT$46,000 to NT$60,000 for singles and from NT$92,000 to NT$120,000
for married couples.</P>
      <P>Chang said the government believes the reform would benefit all taxpayers,
especially relieving the burdens of low and middle income earners in light of
the fact that 67 percent of Taiwan households use the standard deduction
category when filing their tax returns, 65 percent of which are low or middle
income families.</P>
      <P>Minister Ho said the decrease of business and individual income tax rates is
expected to reduce the government's revenue by NT$2 billion per year.</P>
      <P>However, the changes are expected to boost the country's nominal gross domestic
product (GDP) by 1.63 percentage points, the real GDP by 0.35 percentage points,
the real private consumption expenditure by 1.15 percent and the real fixed
capital formation by 5.71 percent, Ho said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has required China Steel Corp., the
nation's largest steelmaker, to prioritize its steel supplies for domestic needs
by maintaining its lower than international market price in the face of surging
global steel prices, Minister Steve R.L. Chen said Thursday.</P>
      <P>As an increase in steel prices is a world trend and the price of every steel
product item offered by China Steel is already lower than the international
market price by US$130-US$150 per metric ton, it is unreasonable and might cause
market chaos to demand that prices be further cut, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Chen was responding to the domestic construction industry's call on the ministry
to urge the state-run steel manufacturer to cut domestic prices due to soaring
international prices.</P>
      <P>The ministry, in the capacity of the steelmaker's largest shareholder, also
asked the company to ban downstream manufacturers maintaining cooperative
relations with it from exporting unprocessed steel products to foreign
countries, Chen added.</P>
      <P>As to the downstream steel producers' comments that "China Steel's steel
materials are extremely hard to get, even if we bring great amounts of cash to
the company, " Chen said that given the company's limited output, it is natural
for that company to first offer products to its existing clients rather than
meeting the needs of new ones.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen noted the rising prices of steel products highlighted the
importance of Taiwan's self production capacity.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks came after the ministry announced Wednesday a ban on exports of
small steel billets and reinforcing steel bars, or rebars--the main material for
construction--in view of a supply shortage. The measure will begin March 5 for
three months.</P>
      <P>The ministry will put exports of H-shaped steel and steel scrap under
"supervision" which would also last for three months.</P>
      <P>However, steel corporations that receive orders, letters of credit or advance
receipts, and other verified documents before March 5, can apply for export
approval by the ministry's Bureau of Foreign Trade on a case-by-case basis.</P>

      <P>While downloading resources online is popular among young Internet users in
Taiwan, many are unaware of the legality or safety of the downloaded items,
according to the results of a survey released Thursday by the Business Software
Alliance's Taiwan branch.</P>
      <P>The survey conducted among 440 youths aged 13-24 revealed that 42 percent of
respondents go online every day and 85.4 percent usually stay online for more
than one hour each time.</P>
      <P>Slightly over 31 percent of Taiwan youth usually go online to chat with friends
through instant messenging and play online games, 13.4 percent visit or run
blogs, 12.3 percent do searches, 4.5 percent view news reports, 2 percent
receive or send e-mail, and 2 percent visit chat rooms.</P>
      <P>It was found that 79.8 percent of respondents have had experience downloading
Internet resources.</P>
      <P>Of these respondents, 74.9 percent have obtained music, 64.1 percent have gotten
games, 58.4 percent have downloaded photos, 40.2 percent have gained computer
software, 30.5 percent have downloaded movies, and 16.8 percent have obtained
online comic or fiction literature -- all for free.</P>
      <P>The results showed that 40.2 percent of respondents have no idea if the
resources they have downloaded are legal or illegal, and 54.7 percent have seen
their computers suffer a viral attack after a download.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. congressmen call for abolition of 'one China' policy</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  20 (CNA)
02/21/08  17:41:14
(By Jorge Liu and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of nine members of the U.S. Congress sent a joint letter to President
George W. Bush Tuesday calling on him to abolish what they called an "obsolete"
"one China" policy, which they said would make China incorrectly estimate the
situation.</P>
      <P>In the letter, the congressmen stressed that the "one China" policy was drawn up
during the Cold War. As the policy implies that Taiwan is a part of China, it
offers Beijing an excuse to oppose any defensive arms supply by the United
States to Taiwan and an opportunity to control Taiwan and its nearby important
marine routes, the letter said.</P>
      <P>As long as the United States continues to acknowledge Beijing's claim that
Taiwan is part of China, the Beijing government will keep on raising objections
to United States' arms supply to Taiwan, and its protection of Taiwan's
democracy," the congressmen said.</P>
      <P>They cited an example as saying that China refused recently two American ships
entry to Hong Kong to evade a storm as a way to show its displeasure  about
America's promise to guarantee Taiwan's security and President Bush's awarding
the Congressional Gold Medal to the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet
that the Chinese government sees as a separatist.</P>
      <P>Today, the stability in the West Pacific has been maintained not because of
America's "one China" policy, but rather because of the Taiwan Relations Act
abided by the U.S. government, the congressmen continued.</P>
      <P>It's unthinkable that the American government still adopts a policy enacted in
the 1970s during the 21st century, they said, warning that the United States
will face increasing tension in the region unless it updates its "one China"
policy.</P>
      <P>In addition, they said, it would cause disastrous results due to the complicated
messages transmitted by the U.S. to China and Taiwan when the United States
adopts a "one China" policy while abiding by the Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>Being a vanguard for freedom, the U.S. should set an example by insisting on its
beliefs, values and principles since it has urged China to play a responsible
role, the congressmen stressed.</P>
      <P>The nine congressmen are Gus Bilirakis (R-Fla.), Thomas Tancredo (R-Colo.),
Thaddeus Mccotter (R-Mich.), Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), Scott Garrett (R-N.J.) ,
Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) , John Culberson (R- Texas), Mark Souder (R-Ind.)

      <P>Formosa Petrochemical Corp. -- Taiwan's sole private fuel supplier -- urged the
government Thursday to lift a freeze on its floating pricing system and said
that it might adjust upward its product prices in March.</P>
      <P>"The government and the public should face up to the reality of a high oil price
era and that their efforts to freeze product prices will not resolve this
problem," company spokesman Lin Keh Yen said.</P>
      <P>"We hope the government will resume allowing the industry to use a floating oil
pricing system," Lin said.</P>
      <P>He added that "Formosa Petrochemical Corp. does not rule out the possibility of
increasing prices for its products in March."</P>
      <P>The government has suppressed oil price hikes by Formosa's rival state-run CPC
Corp., making it difficult for Formosa to raise its prices.</P>
      <P>As the international crude oil price again re-surged to US$100 per barrel
Tuesday, domestic gasoline and diesel prices should be hiked by NT$2.20 and by
NT$2.50 per liter, respectively, in March, Lin said.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the freeze on the domestic oil and fuel prices has cut down
the company's profit by some NT$1 billion (US$31.75 million).</P>
      <P>Lin voiced the hope that the government would reinstate its oil floating pricing
mechanism in view of recent jumps in international crude oil prices.</P>
      <P>He meanwhile pledged that his company will definitely supply the home market
first before supplying overseas markets. Currently, 45 percent of the company's
products are sold to the domestic market, Lin noted.</P>
      <P>State-owned fuel supplier CPC Corp. Taiwan imposed a floating pricing mechanism
in January 2007 that adjusted its product prices every week in response to crude
oil price changes in the world market. But the system was substituted by a
monthly adjustment formular last September.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs ordered a freeze on the mechanism in November
2007 out of fear that continuous hikes would fan inflationary pressure.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) appointed Ibrahim Chao, Taiwan's deputy
representative to Saudi Arabia,  as the island's deputy representative to Libya,
MOFA Spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh said Thursday.</P>
      <P>There is currently no representative from Taiwan appointed to Libya, Yeh said,
so Chao will serve as acting representative in the mean time.</P>
      <P>Yeh said Chao studied in Libya in North Africa for many years and received his
doctoral degree in that country. He also taught there and is proficient in
Arabic, Libya's official language, according to Yeh.</P>
      <P>"Chao will help strengthen bilateral relations at his new position," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Chao's appointment comes shortly after the Taiwan Commercial Office in Tripoli,
Libya's capital, was inaugurated on Feb. 13 after nearly two years of
preparations.</P>
      <P>"The office will open a window of opportunity for Taiwan to develop relations
with Libya on all levels," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>"It will also serve as the new foothold for Taiwan to promote exchanges with
North African countries and help tap investment opportunities for Taiwan
businessmen," she added. Libya draws foreign investors with its development in
petrochemical, tourism, and basic infrastructure construction industries.</P>
      <P>In Africa, Taiwan also has representative offices in Nigeria and South Africa,
in addition to Libya. It has embassies in Swaziland, Gambia, Burkina Faso, Sao
Tome and Principe.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Libya maintained diplomatic relations from 1959 through 1978, but
relations ended in 1978 when Libya switched diplomatic recognition to China. In
1980, Taiwan set up a trade office in Libya, which was shut down in September
1997 because of pressure from China.</P>

response to a letter from a citizen who praised Chen for amassing four
intangible assets for the country, including introducing the referendum system
in Taiwan and raising a stronger sense of Taiwan identity.</P>
      <P>Agreeing that the public's consciousness about Taiwan's identity has taken roots
in the country over the past seven years, Chen noted that while only 36 percent
of the country's citizens identified themselves as Taiwanese, rather than
Chinese, in 2000, the percentage of people considering themselves Taiwanese has
increased to 68 percent today.</P>
      <P>On the referendum system, Chen said the enactment of the Referendum Act in 2003
made possible the country's first referendum in March 2004, which he said helped
deepen and consolidate Taiwan's democracy.</P>
      <P>Following that were two referendums held last month alongside the Jan. 12
legislative elections, but voter turnout was too low for the referendums to be
considered.</P>
      <P>Two more referendums -- both on Taiwan's long bid to join the U.N. -- will be
held alongside the March 22 presidential election to help Taiwan realize the
idea that "sovereignty lies in the hands of the people, "Chen said.</P>
      <P>The two referendums are initiated by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) and the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) . While the DPP's version advocates
joining the United Nations under the name "Taiwan, " the KMT's initiative calls
for regaining U.N. membership under the name "Republic of China" or any other
"suitable" name.</P>
      <P>However, as both the 2004 referendum and the Jan. 12 referendums failed because
the turnout rates did not reach the required 50 percent -- partly due to a
boycott by the KMT, there have been concerns that the upcoming referendums would
fail to pass as well, especially when voters who opt to take part in the KMT-
initiated referendum are likely to skip the DPP-backed referendum, and vice
versa.</P>
      <P>Based on such concerns, the DPP has recently been calling on the public to take
an active part in both referendums to ensure their passage.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will export 47.79 million desktop computers this year, with a growth rate
of 3.7 percent over last year, according to an industry analyst Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang Ching-shu of the Institute of Information Industry (III) predicted that the
export of desktops in the first quarter of this year will be 11.35 million, with
production value totaling US$3.29 billion.</P>
      <P>Citing recent statistics from the Institute of Information Industry (III)
database, Wang said Wednesday that it is estimated that the number of desktop
computers exported to overseas markets in the first quarter of this year will
register 11.35 million, with production value totaling US$3.29 billion.</P>
      <P>The first quarter of each year is generally a dull season for the global sales
of desktop computers, said Wang, but the demand for desktop computers during
this year's first quarter seems even more languid, apparently due to the impact
of the US subprime mortgage crisis.</P>
      <P>Low laptop computer prices and a wait-and-see attitude taken by most potential
buyers of Microsoft's Windows Vista-based computers were also factors causing a
slower rate of growth in desktop sales.</P>
      <P>The subprime  mortgage  crisis  saw a sharp rise in home foreclosures which
started in the United States in September 2007 and developed into a global
financial crisis.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's isolation in the international community has a negative effect on the
country only in the short term, while its democratic and economic achievements
can serve as a great example for the region, especially China, a U.S. scholar
said in Taipei Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The isolation that Taiwan feels is entirely artificial. It is based entirely on
the great shadow of the penumbra of China, " Herbert London, president of the
Washington-based think tank, the Hudson Institute, said in an interview with the
Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Speaking about Taiwan's role in the international community, he said "time is
very much on the side of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>London noted that the difficulty Taiwan has in trying to join the United Nations
is due to China possessing the veto power. As long as China is a member of the
U.N. Security Council and unanimous vote in the Security Council is required for
Taiwan to join the U.N., Taiwan will be barred from joining the world body, he
said.</P>
      <P>"That isolation is a great problem in the short term for Taiwan," London said,
but he stressing that "if you take a long term view, I'm very sanguine about
Taiwan's role in the world."</P>
      <P>Playing an even more active role in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
, a forum of which Taiwan is a part, is one way Taiwan can build bridges with
other countries, London said.</P>
      <P>He noted that the commercial arrangements that could be made between Taiwan and
ASEAN countries can play an important role in "cementing relationships that
ultimately lead to political contact."</P>
      <P>London said: "Taiwan can reach out on its own and has an awful lot to offer"
such as its democracy, political system, and economic achievements.</P>
      <P>Describing Taiwan's economic and democratic achievements as "exceedingly
important", London said "in some respects, Taiwan represents a model for China."</P>
      <P>According to London, it is logical to expect that China's political system will
have to undergo a significant change, a form of liberalization.</P>
      <P>However, China does not have a multi-party system nor does it understand the
nature of democratic institutions, he said. When China does eventually
liberalize its political system, which is only a matter of time, the model can
come from its neighbor -Taiwan, London said.</P>
      <P>"The rise of the Democratic Progressive Party has been an amazing development
and however critical Taiwanese people are of President Chen Shui-bian, the fact
that Taiwan has an active two party system is very important," London said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Most people around the world are indifferent toward human rights violations,
David Matas, a Canadian human right attorney, claimed Thursday at an
international forum, adding  that even though the public agrees that human
rights violations in China are wrong, "they are not prepared to do anything
about it."</P>
      <P>Describing indifference as the "biggest obstacle" to combating human rights
violations, Matas said that "people are indifferent because they do not pay
close enough attention to sort out truth from falsehood, the real from the
unreal."</P>
      <P>He further suggested that the best strategies are to arouse awareness of human
rights and to enable everyone to distinguish the lies told by any regime -- like
China -- in the form of propaganda and hiding the truth.</P>
      <P>Discounting China's promise to improve its human rights record, Paolo Barabesi,
a representative of Human Rights Without Frontiers, examined cases of how China
has suppressed  religion and the development of human rights within the nation,
saying that "there has not been any progress."</P>
      <P>The International Forum titled Human Rights in China and the 2008 Olympics,
organized by the Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong in China
(CIPFG) and the Taiwan Culture Foundation, was aimed at pressing China to
improve its human rights record before the 2008 Beijing Olympics scheduled to
open Aug. 8.</P>
      <P>Human rights defenders, including David Kilgour, the former Canadian secretary
of state for Asia-Pacific affairs, Australian Senator Andrew Bartlett, Falun
Gong spokesman Erping Zhang and Dhondup Dorjee, vice president of the Tibetan
Youth Congress, as well as Falun Gong practitioners and scholars, were attending
the one-and-a-half day seminar to exchange views and experiences.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lai Ching-te of Taiwan, the president of CIPFG Asia, urged the
governments of all nations to face the bloody suppression of human rights by the
Chinese government and take measures to prevent the Beijing Olympics from being
a repeat of the 1936 Berlin Olympics.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the Berlin Olympics were a propaganda tool for Adolf Hitler
and Nazi Germany to stir up nationalism, Lai said that "what the 2008 Beijing
Olympic Games is going to become is in our hands."</P>
      <P>Cabinet spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey also said that "it is very important for people
around the world to be able to speak out and to act as individuals, " which is,
according to him, what the Chinese government fears the most.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's role in helping facilitate human rights in China, Shieh said that
"Taiwan is not only a part of the word... it will fight against this communist
regime that has killed many people, " adding that "working against evil, working
against the devil is a part of human rights."</P>
      <P>In response to Lai and Shieh, Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Tung Chen-
yuan said at the opening address of the forum that "we believe Chinese people
deserve just as good human rights as other people in the world."</P>
      <P>Describing Taiwan as a model of democracy among Chinese societies, Tung
expressed hope that Taiwan's experience in democratization will promote human
rights and the legal system in China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A large majority of Taiwan's voters are not concerned about a controversy over
whether presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou holding a U.S. green card, according
to poll results released Thursday, which indicated the issue will not swing
votes in the upcoming election.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) 's candidate Frank Hsieh's camp
has recently challenged opposition Kuomintang candidate Ma's loyalty and
integrity over his possession of U.S. permanent residency status, or a "green
card" from the United States.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the green card, which he obtained while studying in the U. S. in
the late 1970s, had lost its validity in the mid-'80s after he returned to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the pro-independence Taiwan Thinktank,  which conducted the poll,
65.3 percent of the respondents said they will not change their decision on
voting Hsieh or Ma because of the controversy.</P>
      <P>However, 19.4 percent of the survey respondents said the green card controversy
is leading them to change their mind on who to vote for in the presidential
election slated for March 22, the poll found.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Thinktank conducted the telephone poll on Feb. 13-16 among eligible
voters randomly selected nationwide. A total of 1,088 valid samples were
collected with a margin of error of 3.0 percentage points.</P>
      <P>The poll, meanwhile, found that 66.5 percent of the respondents considered the
green card incident as "political rhetoric" played up by the DPP camp. Only 19.5
percent considered the green card issue "an important discussion topic."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 38.5 percent of the respondents said they believed Ma had been
"dishonest" when he talked about his U.S. green card, compared with 16.5 percent
who disagreed with the suggestion.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 38.4 percent of the respondents considered it
"inappropriate" for a candidate who is a U.S. green card holder to be the
nation's future head of state, compared with 34.2 percent who disagreed, Taiwan
Thinktank said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, up to 51 percent of the respondents said Ma and his wife should make
public their passport records to address public concerns, compared with 25.3
percent who said it is unnecessary for the couple to do so.</P>
      <P>While 41.9 percent of the respondents criticized Ma's crisis handling ability in
the wake of the green card incident, 26 percent said Ma has no problem in terms
of crisis management, according to the Taiwan Thinktank.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to the poll, 40 percent of the respondents said Hsieh made
impressive achievements during his tenure as mayor of the southern metropolis
Kaohsiung between 1998-2005, such as streamlining the Love River that flows
across Kaohsiung. But 46.3 percent said they have no idea what and whether Ma
had done during his tenure as Taipei mayor between 1998-2006.</P>
      <P>On the question of who voters think will perform better during upcoming
televised presidential debates between Hsieh and Ma, 43.3 percent said Hsieh
will perform better, compared with a mere 16.7 percent for Ma.</P>
      <P>The two debates are slated for Feb. 24 and March 9.</P>
      <P>Two referendums will be held alongside the March 22 presidential election on
Taiwan's bid to enter the United Nations.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 44.1 percent of the respondents said they support the
DPP-proposed referendum on joining the U.N. under the name "Taiwan, " compared
with 40.5 percent who expressed opposition to the suggestion.</P>
      <P>A total of 37.4 percent said they support the KMT-proposed referendum on joining
the U.N. under the name "Republic of China" or any other "suitable" name,
compared with 45.2 percent who expressed opposition to the suggestion, according
to the poll.</P>
      <P>Neither the DPP-proposed U.N.-bid referendum nor the KMT-proposed U.N.-bid
referendum obtained support by half of the country's general voters, the poll
found.</P>

      <P>China-based Taiwanese businessmen seem to be adopting a wait-and-see attitude
toward booking preferential air tickets for flights home for the March 22
presidential vote, a local travel agent said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin Yu-chen, a manager in charge of the Chinese market of the Taipei-based SET
travel agency, said some Taiwan businessmen might have reservations about flying
back to Taiwan and taking part in the presidential election. "This might be
another factor why some tickets have not been booked, apart from the
traditionally low season in March," she explained.</P>
      <P>Lin, however, was reluctant to reveal the actual number of Taiwanese businessmen
to have booked the tickets -- which are some 40 percent cheaper than normal
flight prices.  SET travel agency, in collaboration with the Beijing-based
Taiwan Compatriot Investment Enterprises Association, which provides
preferential air tickets to Taiwanese businessmen, is responsible for booking
the tickets for the businessmen.</P>
      <P>In response to the cool response from the Taiwanese businessmen, the secretary-
general of the association pledged that the association will do its best to help
all Taiwanese businessmen hoping to get home to vote in the presidential
election buy cheap tickets.</P>
      <P>It is also understood that some of the businessmen  have complained that they
did not know about the booking service for the preferential tickets.</P>
      <P>According to the association's estimates, at least 250,000 Taiwanese people
residing in China,  including businessmen and students, are planning to return

      <P>Two hundred overweight policemen were among 1,000 policemen in northern Taiwan
who registered to take part in an international marathon scheduled for next
month, the National Police Agency (NPA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen Kuo-en, who is in charge of public relations in the NPA, said the "fat
cops" -- whose combined weight is nearly 20 tons -- were encouraged by the
agency's Director-General Hou Yu-ih to take part in the marathon to be held in
Taipei County on March 2.</P>
      <P>The NPA is currently promoting a "get lean by weight loss" program and
encouraging all overweight policemen to get more exercise to get rid of flab.
Hou has encouraged those officers with body mass index (BMI) larger than 27 to
take part in the event.</P>
      <P>BMI is found by dividing one's weight by the square of one's height in meters.
If the result is more than 24, the person is considered overweight, obese if
over 27, and too thin if lower than 18.5.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the competition will be divided into three categories: 42 km, 21
km and 6 km, and he himself will run the 42-km category.</P>
      <P>Hou will lead some policemen to run the 6-km race, while his deputy, Hsieh Hsiu-
neng, at the age of 60, will run the 21-km, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that to encourage policemen to stay fit, police stations around
the island have invited nutritionists to speak on balanced diets regularly.</P>
      <P>In addition to promoting more exercise, the NPA is also offering "belly dance"
classes to policemen, hoping that it will be a "fun" and "easy" way to get
weight down.</P>

      <P>Agriculture researchers at a government- run laboratory have proven the effects
of a new eco-friendly crop enhancer in boosting the output of cultivated
vegetables  and improving land productivity, government sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Explaining the composition of the bio-enhancer, staffers at the Taoyuan District
Agricultural Research and Extension Station under the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture (COA) said they first carbonize bamboo stems left over by local
farmers and then grind the bamboo charcoal into particles to mix with other
ingredients.</P>
      <P>In field experiments, the bio-enhancer provides maximal effect at the ratio of
1,000 kg per hectare. However, when the amount exceeds 1,500 kg per hectare, the
marginal effect decreases drastically, they said.</P>
      <P>"At the optimal ratio, the output volume of lettuce is raised by 4 percent,"
said Fu Yang-jen, deputy director of the station.</P>
      <P>"Meanwhile, the enhancer can also purify farmland by absorbing toxic chemicals,"
Fu explained.</P>
      <P>The station researchers said bamboo charcoal has a high pH value, hence can be
used to neutralize acid soil laced with fertilizer or pesticide residue to
provide a more suitable environment for plant growth. Meanwhile the numerous
microscopic holes in charcoal particles also traps these chemicals.</P>
      <P>According to COA tallies, most vegetable farmers in northern Taiwan use indoor
cultivation facilities, covering a total of 250 hectares in the Keelung, Taipei,
Taoyuan and Hsinchu areas. These facilities generate an annual vegetable output
of 3,750 tons.</P>
      <P>"If they overuse the fertilizer or pesticide, the secluded environment contains
too high concentrations of these chemicals, hence the need for an eco-friendly
crop enhancer that can raise output while purging the excessive chemicals to
support sustainable agriculture," Fu said.</P>

will not exclude presenting a resolution in the legislature on Taiwan's desire
to join the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks after attending a seminar on legislative affairs held by a
KMT thinktank in Taipei. His remarks came at a time when both the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the KMT are promoting their own versions
of a U.N. bid referendum to be held alongside the March 22 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>The DPP's version focuses on joining the United Nations under the name Taiwan,
which has encountered strong opposition from the United States and several
European countries,  while KMT's referendum proposal advocates regaining U.N.
membership under the name Republic of China or another "suitable" name.</P>
      <P>Describing the holding of referendums as an inevitable step for Taiwan on its

      <P>The 2008 Taiwan Lantern Festival, organized by the Tainan county government,
opened in the Southern Taiwan Science Park for an 11-day show until March 2 to
celebrate the arrival of the Year of the Rat.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian lit the centerpiece of the festival, a giant lantern in
the shape of a spinous country rat -- a species of rodent endemic to Taiwan --
standing on its hind legs and holding a gold ingot to its chest.</P>
      <P>The 15-meter papier mache rat is mounted on a three-meter pedestal and the whole
piece weighs 25 metric tons.</P>
      <P>The venue of the lantern festival is located in Solar City, a special zone of
the science park, with a 88-hectare showground. Over 55,000 red and yellow
lanterns have been used to form giant Chinese and English characters that read
"Taiwan Peace" -- the theme of the festival.</P>
      <P>In addition to the centerpiece, there are eight areas in the showground for
lanterns in different motifs and designs, plus a flower show and a gourmet food
street.</P>
      <P>Prior to the opening ceremony at 7 p.m., visitors were treated to a two-hour
performance by seven dance groups, including five from Japan -- a 22-member
Yosakoi dance group, a 52-member Kamidon dance troupe from Kamikawa in Hokkaido,
a 62-member dance team from Hokkaido University, a 28-member Nebuta traditional
folk dance troupe from Aomori Prefecture, and a Basara dance group from Mizunami
in Gifu Prefecture.</P>
      <P>The two domestic groups were a lion dance team from Taichung and</P>
      <P>a dance team consisting of students from the Taipei Physical Education College's
Dance Department and the Department of Sport Training Science and Martial Arts.</P>
      <P>There will be 34 fireworks shows throughout the festival and the county
government will give away 120,000 hand-held lanterns featuring the rat motif as
gifts to visitors.</P>
      <P>To encourage the public to use mass transit vehicles, the organizers will
distribute gift lanterns to visitors in the next three days at a new temporary
railway station located 100 meters from the venue of the festival. The Taiwan
Railway Administration has scheduled 58 trains each day to stop at the station.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Speed Railway will also provide daily free shuttle services from

airlines for 2007 was 24.79 million, down by 7.1 percent or 1.9 million from the
year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>Of this figure, the number of domestic flight passengers was 6.32 million, a
decrease of 26.6 percent from the figure of 2006, the official said. The number
of international flight passengers rose slightly by 2.1 percent from the 2006
figure to 18.47 million, according to the statistics.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the total freight volume of the six domestic airlines for 2007 was
1.73 million tons, a decrease of 50,000 tons or 3 percent, from the year-earlier
level. Domestic route freight volume was 5.2 tons, down 2.3 percent, while
international route freight volume for the same year was 1.68 million tons, down
by 3 percent.</P>
      <P>The world's airlines, including Taiwan's, all faced challenges due to the rising
oil prices. However, the local airlines were also affected by the Taiwan High
Speed Railway, which began operating last January, offering an alternative quick
method of traveling the length of Taiwan. Its express train takes 90 minutes to
travel from Taipei City in northern Taiwan to Kaohsiung City in southern Taiwan,
at a cost of about NT$1,500 (US$48) . The airfare for the same journey is about
NT$2,000.</P>
      <P>THSR's relatively cheap fare and acceptable speed have forced several domestic
airlines to stop operations on the Taipei-Kaohsiung route.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Small German community keeps tradition alive in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's relatively small German expatriate community is keeping a centuries old
tradition from their home country alive here by hosting an event celebrating the
spring harvest next week.</P>
      <P>The Green Cabbage Dinner,  a North-Germany  tradition that celebrates the
harvest with cabbage and liquors, will be held for the eighth consecutive year
in Taiwan to cater to nostalgic German expatriates.</P>
      <P>Menu items for the dinner are made from ingredients imported from Germany, with
each year's event serving the same German cuisine, including specially-cooked
German cabbage, sausages, potatoes, beer and schnaps, which is an unsweetened
distilled beverage popular in Germany.</P>
      <P>In addition, as in previous years, German entertainers are invited to spice up
the party, with German folk singer Peter Petrel scheduled to perform this year.</P>
      <P>The event will be held on Feb. 29 at the Far Eastern Plaza Hotel, the location
for the party in three of the past eight years.</P>
      <P>The party is organized by Jens Finke, a German expatriate from Bremen of
northern Germany, who first initiated the event eight years ago.</P>
      <P>Over 80 percent of the guests are local Germans, who take the opportunity to
absorb their cooking from their home country and get together with their
countrymen, according to Finke.</P>
      <P>"Each time we keep the dishes the same as much as possible to maintain our
unique German tradition alive in a foreign country, " Finke said, hailing this
as a key consideration in organizing the event.</P>
      <P>Rooted in German tradition, the cabbage dinner has been staged around northern
Germany every February since 1545.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based series was first launched in 2001 and has become the main
social function for the German community in Taipei ever since, drawing
approximately 130 participants each year, said Finke, who owns an ice cream shop
in Taipei's Tianmu district.</P>
      <P>The same event is held around major Asian cities including Shanghai, Hong Kong,
Seoul and Tokyo. The Hong Kong event is among the oldest, with more than 20
years of history.</P>
      <P>Event sponsors  are mostly  German  enterprises,  including electronics giant
Siemens, beer maker Beck's, spring water company Apollinaris and shipping
company Kuehne + Nagel.</P>
      <P>This year Apollinaris will sponsor the event by giving out free bottles of
spring water, while the Kuehne + Nagel will offer free shipping service for
ingredients exported from Germany.</P>
      <P>"They (German companies) sponsor the event mainly to show their support  to the
German community  here,  rather  than seeking advertisement opportunities,"
Finke said.</P>
      <P>Having participated in all previous Green Cabbage Dinners, Brenda Rowek, a
Taiwanese who is married to a German expatriate, said although the food served
at the dinner might not fit the taste of Taiwanese, the warm-hearted ambience
welcomes everyone who joins the meal.</P>
      <P>She said one of the major challenges of continuing the event is to maintain the
level of participation, due to factors like the high entrance fee and the small
population of Germans in Taiwan, which has shown very little growth in recent
years.</P>
      <P>"Nowadays a large portion of Germans in Taiwan are students rather than
employees of German companies," she said, indicating that the NT$1,800 entrance
fee for the party might be too expensive for the students.</P>
      <P>But the turnout at the dinner does not indicate a decline in German investment
in the island.</P>
      <P>Duncan Levine, Communications Director of European Chamber of Commerce Taipei,
said there are no indications that German business activities are declining in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Over US$1.7 billion (NT$54.4 billion) of German investment in Taiwan and a
bilateral trade volume of US$10 billion between the two countries were recorded
in 2006, making Germany the biggest trading partner of Taiwan among EU member
states, according to a report issued by the European Economic and Trade Office
in 2007.</P>
      <P>The current population of Germans living in Taiwan is around 1,400 to 1,500
people and has been stable, according to an estimate by Sven Meier, the Press
and Public Relations Officer of the German Institute Taipei.</P>
      <P>Levine noted it is becoming more common for German companies in Taiwan to hire
more local employees rather than German expatriates, a trend that might explain
the lack of growth in expatriate numbers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Local parliamentary reform activists urged the new legislature  Thursday  to
have all major  legislative proceedings broadcast live over the Internet to
enhance transparency and accountability.</P>
      <P>Key members of the Citizen Congress Watch, a private watchdog group dedicated to
supervising the lawmaking body, made the appeal at a news conference held on the
eve of the opening of the new legislative session.</P>
      <P>Ku Chung-hua, the watchdog body's chairman, first criticized Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng for lending only "half-hearted support" to their call for
full transparency in all legislative proceedings.</P>
      <P>Ku was referring to Wang's recent declaration that he will push for legislative
reforms,  including  crafting  a parliamentary broadcasting system.</P>
      <P>While recognizing Wang's consent to have legislative floor meetings broadcast
live, Ku said it is regrettable that Wang did not promise similar transparency
for other legislative proceedings, such as committee meetings and cross-party
caucus negotiations.</P>
      <P>Wang's hesitation to have committee meetings broadcast live and to scrap closed-
door caucus negotiations will only increase public misgivings about shady deals
inside the legislature, Ku pointed out.</P>
      <P>Noting that the new, streamlined legislature, with only 113 seats instead of the
previous 225, will determine the fate of many critical bills, Ku said the public
has the right to know details of legislative proceedings.</P>
      <P>"The public should have access to the operations  of the legislative standing
committees, " Ku said, adding that it is unreasonable and unjustifiable to keep
the operations of legislative committees from public supervision.</P>
      <P>Denial of public access to legislative committee proceedings violates the
existing regulations, which require transparency of government information, Ku
added.</P>
      <P>He further took to task the legislature's spending of tens of millions  of
dollars installing  a closed-circuit  audio-visual broadcasting system that
restricts broadcasting of floor meetings and committee sessions to only inside
the legislature.</P>
      <P>Ku also questioned the plausibility of the legislature's plan to send a
delegation abroad to study parliamentary broadcasting systems adopted in major
foreign countries.</P>
      <P>"The legislature  need simply modify its current  in-house broadcasting system
to allow public access, " Ku noted, adding that he sees no need for the
legislature to waste money and time studying foreign practices.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Huang Hsiu-tuan, a professor at Soochow
University, said the results of a recent survey by the Citizen Congress Watch
show that procedure committee and caucus negotiations are the least transparent
among all the legislative proceedings.</P>
      <P>"Although Hong Kong lags behind Taiwan in democratic development and its
Legislative Council is less powerful than its Taiwan counterpart, it outstrips
Taiwan in terms of legislative transparency as all of its legislative
proceedings are broadcast live and its citizens can easily observe legislative
meetings in person," she noted.</P>
      <P>Huang also urged the legislature to revise many exisiting regulations governing
its operations to facilitate public supervision of the lawmaking body.</P>

      <P>The government should realize that culture is one of a country's major
foundations and should allocate more funds to boost cultural development, a top
cultural official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking to a group of nearly 100 art workers and activists, Wang Tuoh, chairman
of the Cabinet-level Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA), said the CCA will
strive to raise the percentage of its funds in the central government's total
funds to 1.5 percent from the current 1.34 percent.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the government has long failed to pay enough attention to
cultural development.</P>
      <P>He added that a recent fire that destroyed the rehearsal studio of Taiwan's
highly acclaimed Cloud Gate Dance Theatre has exposed many long-term problems
faced by the country's cultural sector.</P>
      <P>The Feb. 11 fire burned down the 35-year-old theater's 1,324 square-meter
rehearsal studio, as well as destroying costumes, props and production archives.</P>
      <P>In the past, Wang went on, the council only offered emergency relief measures to
individual artists.</P>
      <P>Now, the council is formulating regulations to provide similar measures to art
groups, he added.</P>
      <P>In addition, Wang noted, the council has assisted Cloud Gate in using the Taiwan
Human Rights Memorial park in Jingmei, Taipei City, as a temporary rehearsal
studio for one year.</P>
      <P>After the theater leaves the park, the space will be provided to other
performing groups, which he said will add artistic touches to the park, a former
military detention center.</P>
      <P>Wang said culture should transcend politics and urged people in the cultural
sector and other members of the public to be more open-minded and to respect
different opinions.</P>
      <P>On a different occasion that same day, Wang, a ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) member, was invited to give a report at a regular DPP Central
Standing Committee on how the council helped Cloud Gate.</P>
      <P>After listening to the report, DPP Chairman Frank Hsieh, who is also the party's
candidate for the March 22 presidential election, vowed that if he is elected,
he will increase the government's cultural funding to 5 percent of its budget,
which would amount to some NT$80 billion (US$2.5 billion).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government adjusts economic growth rate downward for 2008</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will be able to achieve an economic growth rate of 4.32 percent this
year, down slightly from the previously targeted 4.53 percent, the country's top
statistics official forecast Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Jan-yau, director-general of the Cabinet-level Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said the agency adjusted downward the
economic growth forecast for this year mainly in light of the impact of the
subprime mortgage crisis in the United States and its aftermath, which has
wreaked havoc on the global economy since last year.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS made public that day Taiwan's economic tallies for 2007,  including
an overall  economic  growth of 5.7 percent year-on-year, with per capita gross
domestic product (GDP) hitting US$16,790 and the consumer price index (CPI)
rising by a mild 1.8 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Hsu forecast that with an economic growth rate of 4.32 percent, the country's
per capita GDP is expected to hit US$18,042 this year.</P>
      <P>Worldwide, he predicted, the global economy -- which will inevitably sustain the
impact of the U.S. subprime crisis and aftermath -- will post a growth of 3.2
percent for this year, 0.1 percentage points lower than was forecast last
November.</P>
      <P>He predicted that the U.S. economy will expand by a mere 1.4 percent this year,
down from 2.2 percent that was posted last year, despite the facts that the U.S.
Fed cut interest rates several times and President George W. Bush signed a new
US$168 billion economic measure to rev up the sagging economy.</P>
      <P>The world's major economic players, including Japan, the European Union and
China, will also witness slower economic growth this year, at 1.2 percent, 1.9
percent and 9.9 percent, respectively, from the previously estimated 2.1
percent, 2.9 percent and 11.4 percent, he said.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, Hsu said, Taiwan will fare better than the U.S., Japan and the EU
economically this year, as the country has increased its exports to newly
emerged markets such as the ASEAN countries, India and the Middle East -- a
development that will help alleviate the impact of declining imports from major
industrialized countries.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports to those newly emerged economies constituted 17.7 percent of
the country's entire export trade last year, compared to the U.S.' 13 percent
and the EU's 10.8 percent, according to Hsu.</P>

      <P>The government will boost the efficiency of the collaboration between
universities and industry in a bid to keep up with the changing global economy
with high-end product innovation, Small and Medium Enterprise Administration
Director-General Robert Lai said Thursday.</P>
      <P>A 2006 project initiated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) was put into
action in January with the goals of doubling the trade volume from intellectual
property  rights developed  in universities, enticing industry to allocate more
research funding and boosting the number of companies incubated by universities,
Lai said.</P>
      <P>"To maximize the use of academic research and enhance technology transfer and
the commercialization of university- born inventions, the project will team up
with National Science Council (NSC) and the Ministry of Education (MOE) to
establish a link between Taiwan universities and industry, " said Lai.</P>
      <P>Addressing  a seminar,  Lai noted  that past  efforts  on university-industry
collaboration have not been efficient, as the business incubators in
universities, funded with investment by industry for intellectual property
development,  have not been properly managed.</P>
      <P>"Facing a highly competitive global intellectual economy, a well- integrated
platform  coordinating  school research and product development is key to the
survival of the companies," he added.</P>
      <P>Tsai Lien-Sheng,  top official of the Taiwan-based Chinese National Federation
of Industries, also stressed the urgency of setting up such a platform, saying
that universities must be aware of what industry needs in order to develop
better products that find their places in the global market.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan ranks third globally in the amount of patents acquired during 2001 and
2005, but those patents did not always help create lucrative products," Tsai
said.</P>
      <P>The project, set to reach its goals within the next four years, will oversee the
subsidy plans given to prop up the country's university-industry cooperation in
the initial stage.</P>
      <P>In the second stage, a coordinating platform will be launched to integrate the
cooperation, with the MOEA taking an advisory role to upgrade the profitability
of Taiwanese inventions.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) plans to cancel the president's power to
initiate a defensive referendum by revising the law in the new session of the
legislature slated to open Friday, in which it holds a majority, KMT lawmakers
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The announcement came after claims that President Chen Shui-bian might resort to
a defensive referendum if the KMT and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) fail to reach a consensus before Friday on two upcoming referendums
supporting the country's bid to join the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Friday is the legal deadline for proposing a new referendum.</P>
      <P>The DPP recently called on the KMT to support each other's U.N. bid referendums
due to concern that the referendums, to be held alongside the March 22
presidential polls, might fail.</P>
      <P>The U.N. bid referendums will mark the third time the government has held a
referendum, even though neither of the earlier ones passed the threshold of
voter interest.</P>
      <P>According to the Referendum Act, the passage of a referendum requires votes from
a majority of the electorate and for over 50 percent of those ballots to be
"yes" votes.</P>
      <P>In their referendums, both parties support U.N. membership for the country, but
they disagree on what name the country should use in its membership
applications.</P>
      <P>The DPP-proposed referendum backs using the name Taiwan, while the KMT one
advocates use of Republic of China, or another "suitable" name.</P>
      <P>Opposing the president's use of a defensive referendum, the KMT lawmakers said
the party has listed its own amendment to the Referendum Act as a priority bill.</P>
      <P>The amendment, which will abolish an article of the Referendum Act governing the
use of defensive referendums, is aimed at barring such a referendum from being
"abused," the lawmakers claimed.</P>
      <P>The amendment is part of the 59 priority bills that the KMT vowed to pass in the
first session of the new 113-seat legislature, according to the lawmakers.</P>
      <P>The priority bills will focus on boosting the economy, providing care for the
disadvantaged, improving electoral rights,  clean politics,  legislative
reforms,  energy  saving,  government restructuring, educational development and
financial reforms.</P>

      <P>Major powers have ignored China's human rights violations in the run up to the
2008 Beijing Olympics, which is reminiscent of what happened before the 1936
Berlin Olympics, human rights advocates said Thursday in an international forum.</P>
      <P>"Nazi authorities held high hopes for the 1936 Berlin Olympics, which they saw
as an occasion to showcase the so-called German economic miracle and assert
Germany's world power status, " said Seweryn Ozdowski, former commissioner of
the Commonwealth of Human Rights in Australia.</P>
      <P>"The Olympics in China seem to be set in exactly the same mould, " Peter
Westmore, chairman of the Australia-based National Civil Council, said on the
first day of an international forum on human rights in China and the 2008
Olympics.</P>
      <P>The two-day forum was organized by the Coalition to Investigate the persecution
of Falun Gong in China (CIPFG) and the Taiwan Culture Foundation.</P>
      <P>Another similarity between the two Olympics 64 years apart could be found in
major powers' neglect of the host countries repeated human rights violations,
the forum participants claimed.</P>
      <P>"In 1936, Nazi dictatorship was already well-established, with political
executions  without trial,  censorship of the media, abolition of the freedom of
association and the racist Nurnberg Laws," said Ozdowski.</P>
      <P>"The Communist Party of China (CPC) has not improved its human rights situation
over the past 10 years, " said Michel Wu, former director of the Mandarin
service of Radio France International.</P>
      <P>"Despite this, the Western democracies have decided to overlook these
developments in the name of unity of Olympic spirit, " he said.</P>
      <P>While a number of celebrities, including American film director Steven
Spielberg, and various non-government organizations have called for a boycott of
the Beijing Olympics, most Western countries have decided to participate.</P>
      <P>"Many Western governments, including my own, are afraid to offend Beijing,
fearing that to raise the issue of human rights in a serious way would
jeopardize trade and other links. Businesses, particularly those with
subsidiaries in China and including media organizations, also fear offending
China, " Westmore said.</P>
      <P>"We should take comfort from the fact that just as courageous and far-sighted
people opposed the German Olympics in 1936, today we are called on to object to
the conducting of the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008, " he added.</P>
      <P>"China should not hold the Olympics. The CPC had no intention from the first to
keep the promise that it would improve the human rights situation in China, "
said Kan Ando, Japan vice president of CIPFG Asia.</P>
      <P>The advocates called for a boycott of the Beijing Olympics as China has failed
to fulfill its promise made in 2001 when it won the Olympics hosting bid to
improve the human rights situation in China, so that the communist regime will
learn a lesson and human rights in China can be protected.</P>
      <P>"Let us remember that a boycott of the 1936 Berlin Olympics could have prevented
World War II and holocaust, " Ozdowski said.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian honored two Taiwanese Web designers Thursday who won an
international competition in the United States last month, and encouraged young
people to learn from the winners' creativity, courage and efforts in running
their own business.</P>
      <P>Chen praised the designers in an article he posted on his e-newsletter Web site.</P>
      <P>The award-winning Web site, Atlaspost, was established last April by brothers
Jerry and Andy Kuo. It was selected as the jury's favorite along with other 10
projects from foreign teams at the DEMO '08 -- an annual conference that serves
as a launch platform for new products, technology and Web sites.</P>
      <P>Atlaspost also won the competition's People's Choice Award, which was voted on
by over 500 venture companies and more than 100 international  media
organizations.  The award was given to a non-American team for the first time.</P>
      <P>It is an innovative map-based social network site that lets users network on a
global map. It allows members to upload articles, albums, or other files for
sharing, both regionally and globally. Locations of members will be shown on the
Web site's map and they can find other members in their neighborhood or far
away.</P>
      <P>"The Web site is a channel for Taiwanese people to strengthen identification
with others and introduce their homeland to the rest of the world," Chen said in
the article.</P>
      <P>The site  already  has nearly  200,000  members  and many international venture
companies have show interest in investing.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Kuo brothers confronted financial difficulties in founding the
site but eventually succeeded thanks to their efforts and persistence. He
encouraged young people to learn from their spirit of achievement and to share
their thoughts about Taiwan with other members of the site.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT will not rule out reinvestigating `319' shooting</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 21 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will not rule out the possibility of re-opening
the investigation into the "319" shooting on the eve of the 2004 presidential
election that injured President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu,
KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks after U.S. forensic expert Henry Lee, who participated in
the investigation of the March 19 incident, said a day earlier that the real
target of the shooting was the vice president. He had previously suggested in
June 2006 that the case should be closed because investigators had exhausted all
leads.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on the new development, KMT presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou
said that all questions regarding further investigation into the shooting should
wait until after the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The vice president said Lee's new statement about the incident was unclear and
urged him to elaborate. Otherwise, she added, it might affect the result of the
election.</P>
      <P>The 319 incident occurred when Chen and Lu were shot while campaigning in a jeep
in Tainan, southern Taiwan. The opposition believes the shooting was staged to
generate sympathy votes for Chen and Lu, enabling them to win a second term by a
mere 29,500 votes.</P>
      <P>A commission established by the legislature to investigate the incident met
strong opposition from the Presidential Office, the Cabinet and other government
agencies.</P>
      <P>In August 2005, the Tainan Public Prosecutor's Office closed the case after
concluding that Chen Yi-hsiung, the lone suspect in the shooting, had apparently
committed suicide. Chen, 63, was found drowned in Anping Harbor in Tainan City
10 days after the shooting.</P>
      <P>The opposition parties, however, were not convinced and tried to set up a
commission through legislation to investigate the incident.</P>
      <P>In December 2006, the Council of Grand Justices ruled that some of the articles
in the organic statute of the commission were unconstitutional, because they
gave the commission the same powers as those of prosecutors.</P>
      <P>The opposition legislators amended the statute in early 2007 and a second
commission was formed, with its 17 members selected in proportion to the number
of seats held by different parties in the legislature.</P>
      <P>However, in September 2007, the Grand Justices again ruled that certain clauses
in the amended organic statute for the 319 Shooting Truth Investigation
Commission were unconstitutional, because the commission should not have been
given power to mete out penalties to those under investigation and because the
commission should have obtained approval from relevant government agencies when
using the services of their employees.</P>
      <P>Despite these setbacks during its investigation, the second 319 Shooting Truth
Investigation Commission completed two reports in 2006 -- one in August and the
second in November -- and called for a review of the shooting.</P>
      <P>The first report claimed that based on forensic analysis led by James Chun-i
Lee, a professor at National Taiwan University's Graduate Institute of Forensic
Medicine, Chen Yi-hsiung did not kill himself but was most likely murdered,
because his body -- wrapped in fishing net and found in the harbor -- had been
dumped into the water after he died.</P>
      <P>The second report overturned one of the conclusions reached by a Criminal
Investigation Bureau task force that the two shots fired at the president and
vice president came from the same pistol, because one of the two bullet casings
found at the scene had an outer caliber measuring 9.1 mm and could not be loaded
into the chamber of the 9 mm pistol that police claim was used by the suspect.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's first and only dog sperm bank has helped soothe a dog lover's sorrow
over the death of his beloved dog, a veterinarian at the bank said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Years ago, a 50-year-old man brought his paralyzed boxer to the bank and had the
dog's sperm stored there, recalled Cheng Feng-bang, who is also a professor at
National Chung Hsing University's Veterinary Medicine Teaching Hospital in
Taichung City, which runs the sperm bank.</P>
      <P>The boxer died a year later.</P>
      <P>Two years later, his owner decided to be "reunited" with his dog and sought
assistance from the bank, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The bank made his dream come true by breeding two puppies from the sperm through
the use of artificial insemination, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The bank, which was established nine years ago, now stores the sperm of 150
dogs.</P>
      <P>The bank has also helped breed some rare and valuable species, Cheng said,
adding that the bank can also assist dogs with vibriosis problems.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT lawmakers to abolish defensive referendum</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 21 (CNA)
02/22/08  11:07:41
(By T.C. Jiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) plans to cancel the president's power to
initiate a defensive referendum by revising the law in the new session of the
legislature slated to open Friday, in which it holds a majority, KMT lawmakers
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The announcement came after claims that President Chen Shui-bian might resort to
a defensive referendum if the KMT and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) fail to reach a consensus before Friday on two upcoming referendums
supporting the country's bid to join the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Friday is the legal deadline for proposing a new referendum.</P>
      <P>The DPP recently called on the KMT to support each other's U.N. bid referendums
due to concern that the referendums, to be held alongside the March 22
presidential polls, might fail.</P>
      <P>The U.N. bid referendums will mark the third time the government has held a
referendum, even though neither of the earlier ones passed the threshold of
voter interest.</P>
      <P>According to the Referendum Act, the passage of a referendum requires votes from
a majority of the electorate and for over 50 percent of those ballots to be
"yes" votes.</P>
      <P>In their referendums, both parties support U.N. membership for the country, but
they disagree on what name the country should use in its membership
applications.</P>
      <P>The DPP-proposed referendum backs using the name Taiwan, while the KMT one
advocates use of Republic of China, or another "suitable" name.</P>
      <P>Opposing the president's use of a defensive referendum, the KMT lawmakers said
the party has listed its own amendment to the Referendum Act as a priority bill.</P>
      <P>The amendment, which will abolish an article of the Referendum Act governing the
use of defensive referendums, is aimed at barring such a referendum from being
"abused," the lawmakers claimed.</P>
      <P>The amendment is part of the 59 priority bills that the KMT vowed to pass in the
first session of the new 113-seat legislature, according to the lawmakers.</P>
      <P>The priority bills will focus on boosting the economy, providing care for the
disadvantaged, improving electoral rights,  clean politics,  legislative
reforms,  energy  saving,  government restructuring, educational development and
financial reforms.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Beijing Olympics echoes Berlin Olympics: human rights advocates</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Major powers have ignored China's human rights violations in the run up to the
2008 Beijing Olympics, which is reminiscent of what happened before the 1936
Berlin Olympics, human rights advocates said Thursday in an international forum.</P>
      <P>"Nazi authorities held high hopes for the 1936 Berlin Olympics, which they saw
as an occasion to showcase the so-called German economic miracle and assert
Germany's world power status, " said Seweryn Ozdowski, former commissioner of
the Commonwealth of Human Rights in Australia.</P>
      <P>"The Olympics in China seem to be set in exactly the same mould, " Peter
Westmore, chairman of the Australia-based National Civil Council, said on the
first day of an international forum on human rights in China and the 2008
Olympics.</P>
      <P>The two-day forum was organized by the Coalition to Investigate the persecution
of Falun Gong in China (CIPFG) and the Taiwan Culture Foundation.</P>
      <P>Another similarity between the two Olympics 64 years apart could be found in
major powers' neglect of the host countries repeated human rights violations,
the forum participants claimed.</P>
      <P>"In 1936, Nazi dictatorship was already well-established, with political
executions  without trial,  censorship of the media, abolition of the freedom of
association and the racist Nurnberg Laws," said Ozdowski.</P>
      <P>"The Communist Party of China (CPC) has not improved its human rights situation
over the past 10 years, " said Michel Wu, former director of the Mandarin
service of Radio France International.</P>
      <P>"Despite this, the Western democracies have decided to overlook these
developments in the name of unity of Olympic spirit, " he said.</P>
      <P>While a number of celebrities, including American film director Steven
Spielberg, and various non-government organizations have called for a boycott of
the Beijing Olympics, most Western countries have decided to participate.</P>
      <P>"Many Western governments, including my own, are afraid to offend Beijing,
fearing that to raise the issue of human rights in a serious way would
jeopardize trade and other links. Businesses, particularly those with
subsidiaries in China and including media organizations, also fear offending
China, " Westmore said.</P>
      <P>"We should take comfort from the fact that just as courageous and far-sighted
people opposed the German Olympics in 1936, today we are called on to object to
the conducting of the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008, " he added.</P>
      <P>"China should not hold the Olympics. The CPC had no intention from the first to
keep the promise that it would improve the human rights situation in China, "
said Kan Ando, Japan vice president of CIPFG Asia.</P>
      <P>The advocates called for a boycott of the Beijing Olympics as China has failed
to fulfill its promise made in 2001 when it won the Olympics hosting bid to
improve the human rights situation in China, so that the communist regime will
learn a lesson and human rights in China can be protected.</P>
      <P>"Let us remember that a boycott of the 1936 Berlin Olympics could have prevented
World War II and holocaust, " Ozdowski said.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian honored two Taiwanese Web designers Thursday who won an
international competition in the United States last month, and encouraged young
people to learn from the winners' creativity, courage and efforts in running
their own business.</P>
      <P>Chen praised the designers in an article he posted on his e-newsletter Web site.</P>
      <P>The award-winning Web site, Atlaspost, was established last April by brothers
Jerry and Andy Kuo. It was selected as the jury's favorite along with other 10
projects from foreign teams at the DEMO '08 -- an annual conference that serves
as a launch platform for new products, technology and Web sites.</P>
      <P>Atlaspost also won the competition's People's Choice Award, which was voted on
by over 500 venture companies and more than 100 international  media
organizations.  The award was given to a non-American team for the first time.</P>
      <P>It is an innovative map-based social network site that lets users network on a
global map. It allows members to upload articles, albums, or other files for
sharing, both regionally and globally. Locations of members will be shown on the
Web site's map and they can find other members in their neighborhood or far
away.</P>
      <P>"The Web site is a channel for Taiwanese people to strengthen identification
with others and introduce their homeland to the rest of the world," Chen said in
the article.</P>
      <P>The site  already  has nearly  200,000  members  and many international venture
companies have show interest in investing.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Kuo brothers confronted financial difficulties in founding the
site but eventually succeeded thanks to their efforts and persistence. He
encouraged young people to learn from their spirit of achievement and to share
their thoughts about Taiwan with other members of the site.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Opposition lawmakers blast arms company</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators from the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) derided Friday the
government's justification of a newly established defense company named Taiwan
Goal.</P>
      <P>Speaking  at the first session  of the KMT-dominated  new legislature,  KMT
Legislator Wu Ching-chih  lashed out at the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration for "secretly" establishing Taiwan Goal late last month with
capital of NT$1 billion (US$31.75 million) and paid-in capital totaling NT$80
million, to handle arms deals worth over NT$150 billion a year.</P>
      <P>Wu criticized Premier Chang Chun-hsiung for "not mentioning a word" about Taiwan
Goal in his written administrative report expected to be delivered at the
Legislative Yuan later that day.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Chiuo I-jen was quoted as having told incumbent and former DPP
lawmakers earlier this week that the establishment of Taiwan Goal -- a joint
venture between the government and private investors and led by Wu Nai-jen, a
stalwart of the DPP's now disbanded New Tide faction -- is mainly aimed at
"diversifying the sources of Taiwan's arms procurement."</P>
      <P>The KMT legislator claimed that Taiwan Goal -- which is beyond the control of
either the Ministry of National Defense (MND) or the legislature -- is an
operation using "government funds to benefit a few individuals."</P>
      <P>Noting that even MND Armaments Bureau Director Wu Wei-jung had suggested that
"it is not appropriate for the ministry to fund a private arms firm, " KMT
Legislator Yang Chiung-ying said Taiwan Goal's establishment is "obviously
questionable."</P>
      <P>Wu Wei-jung made the remarks when he attended a news conference called by Kuo
Su-chun, a whip of the KMT legislative caucus, two days earlier.</P>
      <P>He said that after a cautious overview, he suggested that the plan for the MND
to hold a 45 percent stake in the company is unfeasible. "Although the idea of
establishing the company is good, the timing is inappropriate because of the
March 22 presidential election, which may give rise to misgivings," he said.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Pan Wei-kang questioned the timing of Taiwan Goal's establishment
and claimed that the company is a vehicle through which the Chen Shui-bian
administration plans to steal the country's military resources before it bows
out in May.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's inflation rate is projected at a moderate 1.98 percent for 2008, when
hikes in international commodity prices are expected to temper slightly, the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) forecast
Friday.</P>
      <P>The wholesale price index (WPI) is expected to increase 2.4 percent this year,
following a rise of 6.5 percent in 2007 owing to soaring international oil and
commodity prices, said DGBAS Minister Hsu Jan-yau.</P>
      <P>The consumer price index (CPI) jumped 1.8 percent last year, impacted by the
rise in wholesale prices and storms that hit the island in the second half of
the year that sharply boosted food prices, Hsu noted.</P>
      <P>He predicted that international commodity prices will continue rising in the
first half of this year but calm down slightly in the second half, with oil
prices likely to average US$81.5 per barrel this year, compared with the average
of US$70 per barrel in 2007.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Taiwan's CPI is likely to rise 3 percent in the first
half of this year, and the increase is expected to diminish to 1 percent in the
second half as prices become more stable, he said.</P>

      <P>In the statement, the delegates called for support for a "global human rights

      <P>The central government's fiscal deficit dropped to NT$30 billion (US$960
million) in 2007, thanks to a 5.7 percent economic growth rate and an increase
in tax revenue, Cabinet-level  Directorate  General of Budget,  Accounting  and
Statistics (DGBAS) Director-General Hsu Jan-yau said Friday.</P>
      <P>In 2007, Taiwanese companies enjoyed earnings growth and the government
registered an increase in overall tax revenue as a result of the country's
stable economic growth, according to Hsu.</P>
      <P>The total tax revenue totalled  NT$1.7 trillion  in 2007, surpassing the
budgeted level by NT$120 billion, with the central government seeing an increase
of NT$90 billion in tax revenue, Hsu said, adding that the increase has been
reflected in the narrowing of the fiscal deficit.</P>
      <P>According to preliminary calculations, the overall budget surplus for 2007
amounted to nearly NT$70 billion. While taking the special budget deficit into
account, the central government's fiscal deficit stood at NT$30 billion, a
whopping decrease compared with the deficit of NT314.7 billion recorded in 2003,
Hsu added.</P>
      <P>The figures signify a big step toward the government's goal of balancing the

      <P>Half of the restaurants tested in a recent Consumers' Foundation survey were
found to have excessive levels of carbon monoxide, pointing to the need for
making the installation of carbon monoxide detectors in restaurants compulsory,
foundation officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>The foundation tested 20 restaurants in Taipei City for three minutes each, and
discovered that carbon monoxide concentrations at 10 of them averaged more than
the 9 ppm limit set in Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) guidelines,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>Two restaurants, which were 90 percent occupied at the time of the test,
registered average carbon monoxide concentrations of 103 ppm and 70.9 ppm,
respectively, they said.</P>
      <P>Foundation Chairman Cheng Jen-hung, referring to guidelines released in December
2005 by the EPA on indoor air quality, said the concentration  of carbon
monoxide  at public  and  commercial establishments  should not average more
than 9 ppm during an uninterrupted eight-hour monitoring period.</P>
      <P>Although the tests conducted by the foundation ran less than eight hours, the
results indicate there is much room for improvement in the air quality of
restaurants, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas produced by burning material
containing carbon, such as propane gas, oil, kerosene, wood and charcoal.</P>
      <P>Carbon monoxide poisoning in restaurants has received national attention after
27 customers were poisoned last week in Taoyuan County hot pot restaurant that
used charcoal heaters.</P>
      <P>The incident prompted calls for the government to mandate the installation of
carbon detection monitors in all restaurants.</P>
      <P>According to the Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection, people can be
impaired at work if they are exposed to an environment where the carbon monoxide
concentration reaches 50 ppm for 1.5-4 hours.</P>
      <P>They can get a severe headache if the concentration reaches 200 ppm and feel
weak and dizzy if the concentration increases to 400 ppm.</P>
      <P>A concentration of 1,200 ppm can cause the heartbeat rate to increase and become
irregular, and a concentration of 2,000 ppm or higher can result in a loss of
consciousness and death.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two government agencies categorically denied Friday intervening in the
operations of foreign media outlets by feeding them questions to put opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou on the spot during
interviews.</P>
      <P>Both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and the Government Information
Office (GIO) denied they have offered to "help" several European media outlets
in preparing questions so that the European interviewers give KMT presidential
candidate Ma Ying-jeou a hard time when interviewing him.</P>
      <P>The MOFA and the GIO issued the denials in response to a report by the Taipei-
based Chinese-language China Times Friday. According to the report, Ma's camp
has questioned whether the agencies have assisted European media outlets,
including French quarterly Politique Internationale and television station Euro
News, in preparing "hard" questions for Ma for interviews to be conducted prior
to the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh dismissed the China Times report, saying that the
foreign ministry could not possibly intervene in the content of interviews
conducted by foreign media. Yeh said the foreign ministry regretted what it
called the daily's unfounded and irresponsible allegation.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, Prof. Stephane Corcuff with the University of Lyon in France
and his research team will interview both Ma and ruling Democratic Progressive
Party presidential candidate Frank Hsieh later this month.</P>
      <P>The interviews will be incorporated in their analysis of Taiwan's upcoming
presidential  election  to  be carried  in Politique Internationale in March.</P>
      <P>Corcuff will conduct the interviews with Ma and Hsieh through written questions
that will first be sent to the MOFA and then forwarded to the two candidates'
offices, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>The spokeswoman added that as far as she knows, the questions expected to be
asked by Corcuff and his researchers will all be "sharp" and "hard to deal with,
" regardless of whether they are directed toward Ma or Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, GIO Minister Shieh Jhy-wey defended his office's invitation of major
international media outlets to cover news regarding the upcoming presidential
election and candidates.</P>
      <P>Shieh said Euro News has prepared many questions for Ma and Hsieh, questions
that are sharp, down-to-earth and that could "pierce through to the truth with a
single pertinent remark."</P>
      <P>Saying that it is impossible for the GIO to "direct" European media in the
preparation of questions for any Taiwan presidential candidate, Shieh contended
that any politician would be arrogant if he considered his interviewers to be
"opposed" to him if they asked him critical questions.</P>

      <P>The Fisheries Research Institute under the Council of Agriculture (COA) has
discovered a new fishing ground off Gueishan Island rich in two kinds of shrimp
popular in local cuisine, an institute official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Wu Chi-lun, head of the institute's Marine Fisheries Division, said the agency
discovered the fishing ground for sakura and Japanese glass shrimp after
approximately five years of fishing trials in the area, just off the coast of
Yilan County in northeastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu declined, however, to disclose the size of the fishing ground's stocks of the
planktonic shrimp to prevent overfishing and damage to the biological
environment in the area.</P>
      <P>During their trials, he said, institute trawlers caught more Japanese glass
shrimp than sakura shrimp in spring and summer while sakura shrimp dominated the
catches in autumn and winter.</P>
      <P>The thin-shelled sakura shrimp are rich in calcium that can be absorbed directly
by the body.</P>
      <P>Wu said the institute has completed research on the shrimps' biological
characteristics, including their breeding patterns. Based on the research
results, along with other research on planktonic shrimp found in Taiwan's
waters, the COA will outline a long-term research program aimed at developing
sustainable fishing in the waters, he said.</P>

      <P>The Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital announced Friday that the hospital is to
solicit volunteers willing to participate in a stem cell therapy trial project
using umbilical cord blood for patients with spinal cord injuries.</P>
      <P>Chen Tze-yung, vice president of Tzu Chi hospital's Taichung branch who heads
the project, said the trial therapy project is intending to solicit 80
volunteers from March 1 to June 30 for the first observation stage of the
project.</P>
      <P>As the research efforts in spinal cord therapy made by Tzu Chi hospitals for the
past years have gained recognition from both domestic and foreign medical
institutions, the hospital has obtained money from sponsors from the United
States, Hong Kong and China for this project, Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the project will be implemented at the hospital's
headquarters in Hualien, and its branches in Taichung, Chiayi and Taipei.</P>
      <P>"The project is to find a new possibility for the therapy for many patients with
injuries to their spinal cords in Taiwan, " Chen stressed.</P>
      <P>As the project is in its "observation stage", it will not involve any invasive
examinations or treatments and will not require the patients to stop their
regular treatments, Chen said, adding that it will only collect and register the
information of the patients free of charge.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the volunteers should satisfy the following conditions: They
should be aged between 16 and 65, diagnosed by medical doctors as patients
having spinal cord injury, without serious brain damage, mentally stable, and
not participating in other experimental treatments.</P>

      <P>Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Friday that he will respect the decision
by lawmakers regarding the content of live broadcasting of legislative
proceedings over the Internet, and that he will not "interfere with it."</P>
      <P>Wang was responding to criticism a day earlier by Citizen Congress Watch, a
private watchdog group dedicated to supervising the lawmaking body, that
although Wang gave consent to have legislative floor meetings broadcast live, he
did not promise similar transparency for other legislative proceedings, such as
committee meetings and cross-party caucus negotiations.</P>
      <P>The group noted that the public is entitled to know the details of legislative
proceedings, given the fact that the new legislature is streamlined by half from
the previous legislature and that the present 113 members will determine the
fate of many important bills.</P>
      <P>Wang said that he had never stated that he had "only agreed to broadcast
legislative floor meetings," and he had no idea why the watchdog group leveled
the criticism against him.</P>
      <P>"I have no set views on the content of the broadcast," Wang said, adding that he
"will fully respect the decision of the lawmakers."</P>
      <P>He also said that the legislature will soon send a delegation abroad to observe
the parliamentary broadcasting systems of other countries.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers will mainly view the systems in the United States and Japan since
their committees are similar to Taiwan's, he said.</P>

      <P>The new presidents of Taiwan and the United States should sit down for face-to-
face talks while the head of state of Taiwan should tone down the rhetoric
regarding independence, a U.S. scholar suggested Wednesday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Central News Agency, Herbert London, an American
conservative activist boldly predicted that Ma Ying-jeou, presidential candidate
of Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , and John McCain, front-runner for the
Republican nomination in the 2008 U.S. presidential election, would become the
new heads of state of Taiwan and the U.S., respectively, and said if he were to
provide advice to McCain, he would recommend that he should "do something George
Bush is not willing to do-- that is to sit down with Mr. Ma."</P>
      <P>London, the president of the Washington-based Hudson Institute, added that
whether Frank Hsieh, candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),
or Ma Ying-jeou, candidate of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), becomes the new
president, "many refined statements about independence will be much more low-key
than it's been under Mr. Chen."</P>
      <P>The new U.S. president should "lay out the American position clear, to encourage
Mr. Ma to do everything he can to lower the level of rhetoric, to understand the
American position vis-a-vis China, and also understand that time may very much
be on Taiwan's side, " he said.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the criticism toward President Chen Shui-bian's hard-line stance on
the issue of national identity and sovereignty, London said maybe Chen pushed a
little harder than desired, at least from the America's perspective.</P>
      <P>"But what he recognizes is a sentiment that goes very deep into the culture of
Taiwan at the moment, and that is the desire to express independence even though
it is 'de facto independence' not 'independence de jure'," he added.</P>
      <P>The DPP's initiation of the referendum to join the United Nations under the name
of Taiwan to be held with the March 22 presidential election not only angered
China but also ruffled relations between Taiwan and the U.S.</P>
      <P>As to whether the Beijing Olympics will stir up nationalism in China to an even
higher level, London said the ethnic tide in China cannot be overlooked but the
Olympics is "really a gloss over the real China."</P>
      <P>"I don't think the Olympics will have the effect that the Chinese government is
looking for, which is to display the strides that have been made in China.
Instead, people will see that this is all facade, like the 'Potemkin village' in
the former Soviet Union," he said.</P>
      <P>London arrived in Taipei Feb. 19 for the first time to observe the run-up to
Taiwan's presidential election as well as the island's political and economic
situations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier vows to continue 'one policy per week' governance</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Friday that his "one policy per week" drive to
improve Taiwan's economy and cross-Taiwan Strait relations would continue as
long as he is in office.</P>
      <P>In his administrative report delivered on the opening day of the new Legislative
Yuan's first session, Chang said the Cabinet under his leadership will continue
to push forward in a number of areas using the "one policy per week" campaign.</P>
      <P>They included building "complete social networks" around the country, developing
the economy in a way that would not compromise the environment, narrowing gaps
between urban and rural areas, and improving  cross-strait  relations  and
Taiwan's ties with the international community.</P>
      <P>Chang said his administrative team will do its best in the coming months to
realize development projects, put ideals of justice and fairness into practice,
and adhere to a Taiwan-centric political line to help secure sustainable
development for the country.</P>
      <P>He said that under the principle of a "Taiwan centric line, " the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) administration would continue to build on past efforts
to push for closer cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>The DPP administration initiated in early 2007 the "mini three links" to allow
Taiwanese businessmen to travel to China or return to Taiwan via the Taiwan-held
islands of Kinmen and Matsu, Chang said.</P>
      <P>It had also implemented a series of measures to facilitate two-way trade, fund
remittance and direct charter flight services between Taiwan and China on major
festivals over the past seven years, he said.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that despite Taiwan's good will,  Beijing has obstinately stuck to
the "one China" policy when dealing with cross-strait  issues  and continued  to
step  up its military intimidation and political attacks directed at Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The premier expressed his hope that Beijing perceive the truth that Taiwan is an
independent country that has never been ruled by China for a single day and that
Beijing handle the cross-strait issue in a positive and constructive manner.</P>
      <P>He hoped that trust and closer contacts could be developed across the Taiwan
Strait in place of misunderstanding and suppression, saying that "win win"
situations could be created when the two sides pragmatically engage in dialogue
based on good will and sincerity.</P>
      <P>Chang  said  that over the past several  years,  the DPP administration has
completed many important tasks in the face of adversity and challenges from
within the country and abroad.</P>
      <P>Those tasks, he said, included the legislation of an act governing referendums
and the holding of two referendums, in March 2004 and in January 2008,
respectively; the establishment of the 228 Incident Memorial Foundation and the
National 228 Memorial Hall; and adding the word "Taiwan" to all new Republic of
China passports issued.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Three  members  of the  National Communications Commission (NCC), the country's
media regulator, have tendered their resignations to the Executive Yuan, the
commission's vice chairman, Howard Shyr, said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The three commissioners -- Liu Yu-li, Lin Tung-tai, and Hsieh Chin-nan --
submitted their resignations before the Chinese New Year and are expected to
leave before the beginning of March. Shyr said the three hoped to return to
academia.</P>
      <P>Only Liu's resignation has been approved so far, but she still must complete the
necessary administrative procedures before she can leave, Shyr said.</P>
      <P>Once the three leave, the commission will only have six members remaining,
including Chairman Su Yeong-chin and Vice Chairman Shyr.</P>
      <P>All of the members had pledged to step down Jan. 31 together with the sixth
Legislative Yuan after the Justices of the Constitutional Court ruled last July
that the way the NCC was formed violated the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The constitutional  arbiter  found that having the members recommended by major
political parties in proportion to the number of seats they held in the
legislature infringed upon the power of the administrative branch.</P>
      <P>As a result of the court's ruling, the government amended the commission's
Organic Law last December to have the premier nominate the commissioners and
then have the legislature confirm them.</P>
      <P>According to the revised statute, the Cabinet should have presented a list of
commissioner nominees to the legislature for confirmation by Jan. 31, but the
plan was upset when the Cabinet, led by Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, resigned en
masse Jan. 24, four days ahead of schedule.</P>
      <P>With the process to name new commissioners delayed, NCC Chairman Su backed down
on the pledge to resign and expressed the hope on Jan. 31 that the body could
maintain its normal operations until new members could assume their posts.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Minister Shieh Jhy-wey said Feb. 12 that the
Executive Yuan would deliver the list of candidates for the commission to the
seventh Legislative Yuan before it began Feb. 22.</P>
      <P>But Legislative Yuan Secretariat Director-General Chuang Li-chen said that as of
Friday afternoon, the list had not yet been received.</P>

      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang  (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou said
Thursday that he will issue a statement strongly defending Taiwan's national
sovereignty on the third anniversary of China's anti-secession law.</P>
      <P>Speaking to KMT lawmakers at a seminar organized by the party's think tank, Ma
said that he would like to invite 18 KMT mayors and magistrates as well as KMT
lawmakers to issue a joint statement March 14 to help local people better
understand the KMT's policy on relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In the statement, Ma is expected to stress that there is "only Taiwan's interest
as the bottom line, and no red lines from foreign governments," Ma's aides said.</P>
      <P>Ma had voiced his opposition immediately after Beijing introduced its anti-
secession law targeting Taiwan, KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih said.</P>
      <P>For this reason, Ma will not be affected by any attempts by the KMT's rival, the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , to manipulate cross-strait issues in
favor of the DPP to win the March 22 polls, he added.</P>
      <P>The KMT is widely seen as supporting closer ties with Beijing than the DPP,
which claims that the KMT seeks ultimate unification with China.</P>
      <P>Ma is expected to say in the statement that China has no right to unilaterally
decide Taiwan's future, Ma's aides said.</P>
      <P>Ma will also stress that the people of Taiwan will not accept any country,
including those that are friendly toward Taiwan, to make any move that will harm
Taiwan's sovereignty, interests, and dignity.</P>
      <P>In addition, Ma will stick to his stance and say that China made a mistake in
enacting the anti-secession law, and that only when Beijing stops denying
Taiwan's sovereignty  will there be the possibility for cross-strait peace.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-owned Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) could lose nearly NT$100 billion
(US$3.17 billion) this year in a worst-case scenario, Economic Affairs Minister
Steve R. L. Chen said Friday at a legislative hearing.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions from opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Ting Shou-chung,
Chen said that based on the fluctuating cost of fuel, the ministry initially
estimated Taipower's losses in 2008 at between NT$40 billion and NT$50 billion,
after the company lost NT$31.24 billion in 2007.</P>
      <P>But with the price of crude oil topping US$100 per barrel, and China's demand
for coal rising in the wake of its worst snowstorms in half a century, the
losses could be nearly NT$100 billion under the worst-case scenario, Chen said.</P>
      <P>During his questioning of Chen, Ting attributed Taipower's losses in 2007 to the
limited amount of power provided by nuclear energy. According to information
provided by Taipower, the legislator said, nuclear energy is the cheapest method
of power generation, but it accounted for only 38.3 billion kilowatt hours, or
20 percent, of the company's total power generation in 2007.</P>
      <P>According to the MOEA, Taipower was the only one out of six state-owned
enterprises under its supervision to lose money in 2007, mainly because it could
not raise electricity rates as part of the government's policy to stabilize
commodity prices despite surging crude oil prices.</P>

      <P>A delegation from Taiwan promoted the country's high-quality agricultural
products in Tokyo Friday, hoping to expand their share of the Japanese market.</P>
      <P>The group was in Japan to capitalize on mounting fears among Japanese consumers
and supermarkets that food imported from China is unsafe, prompted by a recent
case of dumplings from China found to be tainted with toxic pesticides.</P>
      <P>China is Japan's largest source of food imports, but with its reputation
tainted, Japanese buyers have been forced to look in other directions, and
Taiwan is hoping to benefit.</P>
      <P>At a press conference in Tokyo, TAITRA Deputy Secretary-General Yeh Ming-shui
underlined Taiwan's efforts in making safe and healthy food, citing Taiwan's
mango exports to Japan that set a record high of 787 metric tons in 2007 after
passing stricter pesticide-free tests in Japan.</P>
      <P>"The figure also represented 83 percent-growth over the previous year," Yeh
said.</P>
      <P>The TAITRA official noted that Japan is already one of Taiwan's most important
export markets, with the value of agricultural and livestock exports to Japan
reaching US$850 million in 2007.</P>
      <P>"Among Taiwan's 30 major agricultural export products, 11 are usually targeted
at the Japanese market," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Japan's agricultural exports to Taiwan totaled US$704 million last
year, trailing only those of the United States and China.</P>
      <P>"There is still plenty of room for both countries to boost their mutual trade in
agricultural products, " Yeh stressed.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, Taiwan's Council of Agriculture (COA) has established a Taiwan
Product Center in both Tokyo and Yokohama to promote goods imported from Taiwan,
and plans to hold six Taiwan Fairs this year to boost the sales of Taiwan-made
fruits, meat and processed products.</P>
      <P>In addition, the TAITRA plans to invite several major Japanese food importers
to visit Taiwan  this year to gain a better understanding of the operations of
Taiwanese factories, Yeh said. He called on Japanese entrepreneurs to adopt a
more open attitude toward Taiwan's agricultural produce.</P>

      <P>A tourism policy developed from an international perspective could help improve
the quaility of touring Taiwan, said Philippe Pellegrin, chairman of the
European Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT) at a recent roundtable discussion
with high-ranking Taiwan officials.</P>
      <P>He suggested that Taiwan embrace the experience of professional travel agencies
overseas to combine popular landmarks with cultural resources and offer
international tourists a unique visit infused with local cultural flavor.</P>
      <P>"For instance, the National Palace Museum, with the stored historical treasures,
should be included in a package tour along with local gourmet cuisines and trade
shows, " Pellegrin said at the forum organized by the Council of Economic
Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>Noting that tourism is an industry that caters to international customers,  he
said  tour packages  for high-spending  foreign businessmen should present a
comprehensive view of the island.</P>
      <P>"Performances at the National Concert Hall should be showcased during the tour,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Pellegrin called for trade show organizers to improve hotel booking services to
persuade more foreign trade show participants to see some of the beautiful
island on business trips.</P>
      <P>To develop tourism on a long-term basis, he recommended that the government
should place greater emphasis on attracting high-end overseas visitors.</P>
      <P>CEPD Vice Chairman Thomas Yeh acknowledged that Taiwan's economy relied heavily
on visitors from overseas and said the government plans to invest NT$1 billion
(US$31 million) in a program to boost tourism and attract 4 million visitors to
the country.</P>
      <P>Some 3.7 million visitors arrived in Taiwan in 2007.</P>
      <P>"But the declining world economy might force us to explore our domestic market,
which is associated with our tourism environment, " Yeh said.</P>
      <P>The NT$1 billion program, the brainchild of the Tourism Bureau, was launched
Feb.15. and includes a wide range of events and activities to enable
international visitors to familiarize themselves with local culture and customs
and enjoy Taiwan's natural beauty.</P>

      <P>An international human rights torch relay that seeks to end all human rights
abuses in China will make its way into the Olympic host country through text
messages, flying balloons and e-mails, a human rights group announced Friday.</P>
      <P>Launched by the Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong in China
(CIPFG) , the international relay has traveled to 26 countries and 80 cities
around the world since the torch was lit in Athens, Greece on Aug.9, 2007.</P>
      <P>The group has now decided to take it one step further by entering China.</P>
      <P>"At this crucial time when the eyes of the world are on Beijing and in response
to the strong demand by the Chinese people to further expose the tyranny of the
CCP and to improve the increasingly poor human rights situation in China, the
'Human Rights Torch' will enter mainland China at the end of March 2008, " it
said in a statement.</P>
      <P>It called for all Chinese who are against dictatorship and for the pursuit of
freedom to participate in an alternative and creative form of torch relay from
the end of March to the end of the Olympic Games in August.</P>
      <P>Considering the safety of the participants, the China leg of the torch relay
will not be a traditional run. Instead, participants can distribute a relay logo
through e-mails, text messages, e-cards, and blog entries.</P>
      <P>They can also hand out T-shirts or baseball caps printed with the slogan "The
same world, the same human rights" on them, or play the relay's theme song using
multimedia devices in public spaces.</P>
      <P>Participants  can also write messages on bills,  important buildings and
facilities, and even a flying balloon.</P>
      <P>CIPFG, the main organizer of a two-day international forum on the human rights
situation in China and the 2008 Olympics, also released a joint statement
Friday, urging the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to request the host
Chinese Olympic National Committee to adhere to the Fundamental Principles of

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui appealed Friday for the de-linking of the March 22
presidential election and two referendums on Taiwan's U.N. membership bid that
will be held on the same day.</P>
      <P>"A failure to adequately handle the two referendums will cause the international
community to misinterpret the strong desire of Taiwan's people to take part in
the United Nations, and it will in turn cause irreversible damage to the
country, " Lee told reporters before he was to give a speech to a group of
Japanese CEOs at a hotel.</P>
      <P>Lee warned that if the two referendums on Taiwan's U.N. bid are not approved by
the people, it would bring "extreme danger to the country."</P>
      <P>He called on all political party leaders and presidential candidates to put
aside their differences and seek a solution to the thorny issue as soon as
possible for the sake of Taiwan's future, while suggesting that "it would be
best to hold the referendums at a later date."</P>
      <P>Lee also questioned the logic of proposing a referendum on joining the United
Nations without any certainty of international support.</P>
      <P>"If the international community isn't in favor of it, why pursue it?" he asked.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT)  have each initiated a referendum regarding Taiwan's pursuit of
U.N. membership. The two referendums will be held alongside the presidential
election.</P>
      <P>The DPP-initiated question asks voters if they support joining the United
Nations under the name "Taiwan,"  while the KMT-initiated question asks voters
if they support re-entry to the world body under the name "Republic of China" or
any other "suitable" name.</P>
      <P>Both China and the United States have voiced objections to the DPP's referendum
initiative, which they described as a move toward Taiwan's independence.</P>

      <P>In view of Taiwan's fast-growing solar opto-electricity industry, the semi-
official Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) will lead groups to
promote the domestic industry at exhibitions overseas, TAITRA said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to a TAITRA statement, TAITRA will organize several delegations to
take part in expositions in Japan, Germany, Spain and the United States this
year.</P>
      <P>First, a mission composed of 14 top Taiwan companies will take part in Japan's
PV EXPO 2008, which will open Feb. 27 in Tokyo, TAITRA said. It will be Japan's
first exhibition of its kind, it added.</P>
      <P>A second delegation comprising 23 Taiwan businesses, meanwhile, is slated to
exhibit their latest and advanced products at Intersolar -- the largest European
solar technology fair -- to be held in June in Freiburg, Germany.</P>
      <P>According to TAITRA, the EU PVSEC (European Photovoltaic Solar Energy Conference
and Exhibition) , scheduled to be held from Sept. 1-5 in Valencia, Spain, and
the Solar Power Conference &amp; EXPO 2008 that will kick off from Oct. 13-16 in
San Diego, California will also attract Taiwan's professional elites to stage
their products.</P>
      <P>Apart from these groups, a TAITRA organized group will visit France for the same
purpose, while another delegation to will travel to Greece, which provides good
access to Taiwanese enterprises keen on exploring the emerging market in eastern
Europe, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>The solar opto-electricity industry has grown rapidly to become a potential
business in Taiwan capable of creating an annual production value of over NT$1
trillion (US$31.75 billion), statistics showed.</P>
      <P>The domestic industry posted an output of NT$40 billion in 2007 -- almost double
the 2006 figure of NT$21.2 billion. In 2005, its annual production value was
only NT$7 billion.</P>
      <P>Last year, 24 new corporations started their business in the industry by
funneling NT$15 billion -- a large jump from NT$4.1 billion invested by eight
new companies in 2006.</P>
      <P>In 2005, only five new companies kicked off business in the industry, with a
combined investment funds of NT$1.6 billion.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-ranking official of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) criticized China
Friday for blocking its citizens from visiting Taiwan on a luxury ocean liner
less than two weeks after 659 Chinese nationals made the trip.</P>
      <P>MAC spokesman Liu Te-hsun condemned China after local travel agents confirmed
that the Chinese who planned to visit Taiwan in late February aboard the
British-registered ocean liner "Rhapsody of the Seas" canceled their
applications.</P>
      <P>The travel agents speculated it was due to Chinese obstruction.</P>
      <P>A total of 659 Chinese tourists arrived at the northern Taiwan port of Keelung
on the luxury ocean liner Feb. 11, after the Cabinet-level MAC relaxed local
regulations to allow the entry of Chinese nationals on ships from ports outside
China.</P>
      <P>It was the largest Chinese tour group ever to visit the island.</P>
      <P>With local travel agencies hoping to benefit from the relaxed government policy
toward China, the fate of the second trip of the cruise liner from Hong Kong to
Taiwan via Okinawa remained unknown because of the cancellation of the Chinese
passengers.</P>
      <P>Liu also confirmed that several profesional groups from China, including those
intending to observe Taiwan's upcoming presidential elections, recently withdrew
their applications to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liu urged Chinese authorities not to intervene in cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges,
stressing that elections are regular and normal political activities in a
democratic society.</P>
      <P>"It is also still uncertain  whether a Chinese delegation intending to arrive in
Taiwan Feb. 25 to learn more about Taiwan's real estate market will arrive," Liu
added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Abnormal cold weather wreaks havoc on Penghu's fishery industry</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/22/08  21:45:42</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The abnormal cold spell of the past several weeks has devastated the fishery
industry of the Penghu island chain to such a serious extent that it might take
years before the industry can fully recover.</P>
      <P>The subtropical  Penghu  island group,  also known as the Pescadores, is located
about 50 kilometers west of Taiwan proper. The archipelago consists of 90
islands, of which only 19 are inhabited. The area is rich in fishery resources
and has been termed a "paradise for scuba divers."</P>
      <P>The recent cold weather, with temperatures dipping to below 9 degrees Celsius,
has caused massive damage to both the marine ecology in Penghu's coastal waters
and the local net cage fish farming industry.</P>
      <P>During a beach cleaning campaign led by Penghu County Magistrate Wang Chien-fa,
county government officials and local residents removed nearly 50 metric tons of
fish carcasses from the beaches of Penghu's inhabited islands.</P>
      <P>Members of the Penghu Scuba Diving Association who examined the coastal waters
around Makung Island, the largest island in the archipelago, delivered a more
shocking finding -- there were probably 10 times as many dead fish lying on the
bottom of the sea.</P>
      <P>Association President Cheng Cheng-kang and two other divers said they saw large
numbers of many species of dead fish as they swam around the coastal waters, and
that some of the carcasses had already began to rot.</P>
      <P>Cheng said he is worried that as the weather gets warmer, the high nutrient
levels in the water would cause algal blooms, which could lead to a red tide,
with the toxins  from the algae contaminating marine lives and posing a hazard
to human health.</P>
      <P>Tsai Wann-sheng, director of the Penghu Fisheries Research Institute, described
the damage to Penghu's fishery industry as "the worst in 30 years." He said the
recent cold weather -- unseen since 1978 -- might have seriously affected some
300 fish species.</P>
      <P>With the real potential for a red tide, Tsai urged Environmental Protection
Bureau officials to monitor the quality of sea water around Penghu's coasts
closely and take necessary precautionary measures to prevent algal blooms.</P>
      <P>Chen Ying-nan, chairman of the Department of Aquaculture at National Penghu
University, said the adverse impact on Penghu's marine ecology will be
foreseeable in the next couple of years, although the exact degree of the impact
cannot be assessed yet.</P>
      <P>"We expect the currents of the ocean to use the power of nature to repair
itself," he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, statistics compiled by the Penghu county government show that the
cold spell killed more than 1,500 metric tons, or over 80 percent, of the fish
yields in the county's net cage fish farms, with the losses totaling over NT$180
million (US$5.75 million) . Cobia, a high-value cage culture species, suffered
the heaviest losses. If shell fish is included, the total damage will exceed
3,000 metric tons.</P>
      <P>At a briefing to Vice President Annette Lu on how to cope with the aftermath of
the disaster, Cheng Ming-yuan, director of the Penghu county government's
Agriculture  and Fisheries  Bureau, estimated that the county government would
need NT$178 million to help revive Penghu's net cage fish farming industry and
NT$58 million to fund marine conservation programs to allow the release of large
amounts of young fish of all kinds into the ocean.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, another NT$167 million is needed to provide natural disaster
relief and low-interest emergency loans to fish farmers in order to help them
get back on their feet.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) demanded the
government Friday strictly prevent Chinese onions from entering the domestic
market during peak season of the onion in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Pan Meng-an put forward the emergency request on behalf of a group of farmers
from the southern Taiwan county of Pingtung during a question-and-answer session
in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>According to Pan, many Pingtung farmers have complained to him about the large
quantities of Chinese onions grown in China's Shandong Province that could be
found in the Taiwan market.</P>
      <P>Such products were imported from China via Hong Kong and Thailand, Pan said.</P>
      <P>The entry of the Chinese onions at this time has dealt a heavy blow to the
business in the home market and largely affected the livelihoods of local
growers -- mostly on the Hengchun Peninsula in Pingtung County, Pan said.</P>
      <P>Hengchun is Taiwan's key onion production area and now is its peak season.</P>
      <P>Pan said local farmers hope that the Council of Agriculture will allow onion
imports only in off-season.</P>
      <P>The lawmaker also demanded the government effectively crack down on smuggling as
traders might hide onions in shipment of other produce.</P>

      <P>The rising prices of chicken and duck eggs are expected to stabilize and
production levels to revert to normal once the weather turns warm, the Cabinet-
level Council of Agriculture (COA) said in a statement Friday.</P>
      <P>The price of chicken eggs has increased to NT$29.5 per 600 grams, or Taiwan
catty, the standard unit of measurement in traditional food markets, while the
price of duck eggs reached NT$33 per catty, the council said.</P>
      <P>According to the Taipei-based China Times daily, the price of chicken eggs was
more than double that of a year ago and the second highest in history, trailing
only the NT$30 per catty registered in 1996 when local consumers went crazy for
Portuguese-style egg tarts.</P>
      <P>Duck egg prices, meanwhile, were 43 percent higher than a year ago and the
highest in two decades, the report said.</P>
      <P>In its statement, the Council of Agriculture attributed the soaring prices to
recent cold spells that have dampened  egg production and rising international
grain prices that have led the cost of feed to skyrocket.</P>
      <P>Huang Ying-hao, chief of the COA's Animal Industry Development, said that if the
weather remains stable in the coming weeks, falling egg production should return
to normal within a month and current egg prices would stabilize.</P>
      <P>He said that current egg price levels were "reasonable" based on chicken feed
costs that have risen from NT$9 to NT$14 per catty over the past year and duck
feed costs that have gone from NT$10 to NT$15 over the same period.</P>
      <P>Based on the agency's calculations, the current cost of producing chicken eggs
was NT$27 per catty while that of duck eggs NT$31 per catty, Huang said, an
indication of how egg farmers' profits are being squeezed by higher feed costs
and lower production levels.</P>
      <P>The COA official said that the council has taken action to help local farmers
face the impact of increasing production costs resulted from rising
international prices of feed grain -- mainly corn -- including guiding poultry
farmers on how to use other feed formulas.</P>
      <P>The COA has also taken moves to encourage farmers to grown sweet corn in an
effort to reduce the country's reliance on imports, Huang said.</P>

      <P>The Taipei District Court issued an emergency injunction Friday barring
creditors from taking action in the next 90 days to collect debts owed by
domestic carrier Far Eastern Air Transport (FAT) , welcome news for the airline
that has filed for bankruptcy protection.</P>
      <P>Under the ruling, trading of FAT shares on the Gre Tai Securities Market will
also be suspended for a three-month period.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the airline said the injunction relieved pressure on the cash-
strapped to service its debts in the coming months and allowed it to focus on
flight operations and give the airline time to resolve its financial crisis.</P>
      <P>The spokesman reiterated the company's promise to repay its debts and appealed
for patience on the part of its creditors.</P>
      <P>FAT is trying to settle its financial crisis by selling its investments in other
businesses, collecting overdue payments owed by other partner airlines, and
seeking the support of its major shareholders, according to the company.</P>
      <P>FAT, Taiwan's oldest privately-owned airline that celebrated its 50th
anniversary in November 2007, filed for bankruptcy protection last Friday after
reporting debts of NT$9.99 billion (US$315 million) at the end of September
2007.</P>
      <P>The airline reported a loss of NT$ 3.3 billion as of Sept. 30 in 2007. Like
Taiwan's other carriers that primarily fly domestic routes, FAT has been hit
hard by a downturn in domestic air travel, partly due to competition from a new
high speed rail service launched in January 2007.</P>
      <P>The airline's membership in the International Air Transport Association's
Clearing House (ICH) was temporarily suspended last Wednesday because of its

    <TEXT>
      <P>A court in Geneva is expected to deliver a verdict within two months on a
lawsuit filed by Taiwan against the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) for referring to Taiwan as a part of China.</P>
      <P>The Geneva First Instance Court held a second hearing Thursday on the lawsuit
filed on July 20 of last year that demanded that the organization correct
Taiwan's designation from "Taiwan Province, China" to "Republic of China
(Taiwan) " in the ISO 3166 country codes list.</P>
      <P>The lawsuit came after the ISO failed to respond positively to Taiwan's repeated
requests over the name issue.</P>
      <P>In rebutting the organization's doubts about Taiwan's legal standing, Henri-
Philippe Sambuc, the lawyer representing Taiwan, argued during the Thursday
hearing that Taiwan has all the elements of a country  and that Taiwan  enjoys
an international  legal personality, which requires no recognition from other
countries.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan has inked many valid treaties and agreements with countries,
including Switzerland, that do not have diplomatic ties with Taiwan, Sambuc
said.</P>
      <P>In many legal cases, courts in countries that are not Taiwan's diplomatic allies
have also confirmed Taiwan's legal eligibility, Sambuc noted.</P>
      <P>Sambuc further cited as an example a ruling by the Swiss Federal Supreme Court
on a kickback scandal involving Taiwan's procurement of six Lafayette-class
frigates from France.</P>
      <P>For its part, the ISO raised a procedural problem during the hearing, saying
that many documents presented by Taiwan were not translated into French.</P>
      <P>The organization  also countered  that many  of the Swiss institutions with
which Taiwan has signed agreements were not official.</P>
      <P>Following the hearing, Sambuc told the Central News Agency that he is confident
of winning the case, while a ISO lawyer and legal consultant declined to
comment.</P>
      <P>Prior to the lawsuit, the organization told Taiwan that it created the 3166 list
back in 1974 in accordance with the United Nations' practice of calling Taiwan
"Taiwan Province, China, " a term not coined by the ISO.</P>
      <P>It is the first time that Taiwan has resorted to legal action against a major
international organization over the name issue.</P>
      <P>The ISO 3166 list has been widely used globally, which has resulted in the use
of "Taiwan Province,  China" increasingly prevalent  among international
organizations  and multinational business groups.</P>
      <P>Taiwan  said,  however,  that  such  a trend  has  caused misunderstanding and
confusion for itself and undermined its national status and interests.</P>
      <P>The Geneva-based ISO is an international standard-setting body comprised  of
representatives  from various national  standards organizations.</P>
      <P>Founded on Feb. 23, 1947, the organization promulgates world-wide industrial and
commercial standards.</P>
      <P>While ISO defines itself as a non-governmental organization, its ability to set
standards that often become law, either through treaties or national standards,
makes it more powerful than most NGOs. In practice, ISO acts as a consortium
with strong links to governments.</P>

      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) has sent letters of authorization  from
Taiwan's  two presidential candidates to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA),
which will enable the ministry to see if they are citizens of other countries.</P>
      <P>CEC Secretary-General Deng Tien-yu said that both Frank Hsieh, presidential
candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, and his rival, Ma Ying-
jeou of the Kuomintang, had given written authorization to the commission to
have their statuses checked.</P>
      <P>The ministry will now ask the United States, Japan and Britain to see if they
are citizens of those countries.</P>
      <P>He said the CEC had received Ma's authorization earlier in the day along with
personal data, including his date of birth, ID number, passport number, English
name used on the passport, household address, U. S. social security number and
U.S. permanent residence document, or "green card."</P>
      <P>The process of checking if either of the candidates have dual citizenships in
other countries comes as Hsieh's campaign has pressed Ma over the past two weeks
over his possession of a "green card, " questioning his loyalty and integrity.</P>
      <P>Ma, who holds a doctoral degree in law from Harvard University, said that he did
possess a green card while studying in the United States in the 1980s, but he
stopped using it after returning to Taiwan, and the green card had since been
invalidated.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the CEC reminded television and radio programs on political affairs
Friday to be "just and equal" to the presidential candidates, and "not to treat
them differently."</P>
      <P>CEC officials said that the presidential and vice presidential election and
recall law stipulates that the TV and radio station could offer paid time slots
for presidential candidates and the political parties that nominate them for
campaign activities. The stations should provide "just and equal" treatment to
the candidates.</P>
      <P>The officials said that anyone could submit substantive evidence of possible
violations such as video or audio tapes to the CEC within one month after the
airing of the programs. Violators will be subject to fines of between NT$200,000
and NT$2 million (US$6,370-63,700).</P>

      <P>The campaign of ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate
Frank Hsieh repeated its claim Friday that its rival's U.S. permanent residence
status, or green card, remains valid.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuo-yung, a spokesman for the Hsieh campaign, repeated the claim after the

    <TEXT>
      <P>China has agreed to sell 200,000 metric tons of corn feed to Taiwan, which may
help Taiwan lower its feed costs, according to an official of the National
Animal Industry Foundation.</P>
      <P>The deal was revealed after the foundation received a faxed notice from Beijing
agreeing to export the feed.</P>
      <P>In the notice, China agreed to allow China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs
Corp. (COFCO) to export the corn feed to two Taiwanese private organizations --
the R.O.C Federation of Swine Cooperatives General Catalogue and the Taiwan Feed
Industry Association.</P>
      <P>China gave its nod after Taiwan's Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs approved last year the import of Chinese corn feed
for period limited to between Oct. 1, 2007 and March 31, 2008, the foundation
official said.</P>
      <P>The bureau approved the deal to help Taiwan cope with soaring international
grain prices, which have increased the cost of raising livestock and poultry in
Taiwan, and consequently spurred higher local meat prices.</P>
      <P>The official said that China's agreement to export corn feed will mainly help
Taiwan save in shipping costs.</P>
      <P>Taiwan consumes 5 million metric tons of corn feed every year, most of which is
imported from the United States at low prices, the official said.</P>
      <P>In recent years, however, the price of imported corn feed has risen from NT$5
(US$0.16) to NT$11 per kilo, the official explained. With shipping costs across
the Pacific rising, the import deal would help save NT$0.6 to NT$0.7 per kilo in
transportation expenses, the official said.</P>
      <P>China had been carefully assessing the case because its own demands for the crop
have been growing rapidly, the official said.</P>

      <P>Tourism Bureau Director-General Janice Lai presented "honorary" accreditation to
21 Japanese tour guides Friday who recently passed tests to certify their
professionalism in guiding tour groups in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lai said that this is the first time that the bureau had decided to accredit
foreign tourist guides, hoping to encourage them to learn more about Taiwan and
therefore be more authoritative in recommending Taiwan's scenic spots and
features to their clients.</P>
      <P>She noted that Japan is the largest source of overseas tourists to Taiwan, with
1.16 million Japanese visitors coming to Taiwan, 31.39 percent of a total of
3.71 million visitors to Taiwan in 2007.</P>
      <P>She said that middle-aged or elder Japanese used to form the lion's share of
Japanese tourists visiting Taiwan a decade ago, but in recent years, Japanese
youths and women have become the mainstay.</P>
      <P>This is why the bureau has now asked pop idol group F4 to become spokesmen for
Taiwan tourism in recent years, she continued, although the promotional efforts
"were still not efficient."</P>
      <P>At the suggestion of the Kinki Nippon Tourist Co. (KNT) , the second largest
travel agency in Japan, the bureau began cooperating with the travel agency by
offering their staff classes and training courses on understanding Taiwan and
accrediting them after tests.</P>
      <P>"If you like Taiwan, you will be more able to market Taiwan," Lai said, and this
is why the bureau offered training to the staff of the tourist company to
enhance their understanding of the tourism products in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The first test had originally hoped to accredit 500 KNT tour guides, but a total
of 733 registered for the test and 624, including KNT President Takashi Ota
himself, passed the test.</P>
      <P>The KNT treated 21 of the tourist guides to a four-day tour in Taiwan, and some
of them wrote about their experience in Taiwan during the stay. Among the
responses were "I feel I got a good rest in Taiwan, " "Taiwan has so much to see
and eat, and I enjoy foot massages, " and "the Taiwan Lantern Festival is
spectacular."</P>
      <P>Lai said that the bureau will continue to work with other travel agencies in
Japan for accreditation, and could expand the program to tourist guides in
Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, Hong Kong and Macau, countries that are also
major source of tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The bureau has recently launched a plan to promote Taiwan as a tourism
destination in 2008-2009, which is coupled with a series of incentive measures.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau expects the number of visitors to Taiwan, excluding Chinese
tourists, will reach its target of 4 million in 2008.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Presidential hopefuls of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Frank
Hsieh and his opponent Ma Ying-jeou representing the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) are slated to debate on television Sunday to give voters a better picture
of how they would lead the nation in the coming four years.</P>
      <P>In this first face-to-face debate, which is considered a decisive factor in the
presidential campaign that will officially kick off Saturday, Hsieh and Ma will
face questions on their administrative policies and social, economic and
cultural agenda.</P>
      <P>According to the format of the debate, both Hsieh and Ma will first answer the
questions from 20 citizens, including Lo Chao-hsun, who is known for heckling
President Chen Shui-bian in public, and Su Chien-ho, a convicted murderer whose
controversial death sentence is still under review by the Taiwan High Court.</P>
      <P>The program -- a presidential debate in which average citizens will quiz the
candidates, organized by the Central News Agency, the Public Television Service
Foundation and four local newspapers, is to air live on Channel 13 from 2 p.m.
to 5:15 p.m.</P>

general public to express their concerns on the Internet over the candidates,

the candidates answers to the 20 videotaped questions, which includes such
issues as the identity of Taiwan and its people, Taiwan's participation in the
Kyoto Protocol, same-sex marriage, the promotion of Aboriginal culture, social
welfare, and the development of the nation's economy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Geneva court to rule on ISO reference to Taiwan in 2 months</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Switzerland, Feb. 21 (CNA)
02/23/08  10:45:45
(By Jou Ying-cheng and T.C. Jiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A court in Geneva is expected to deliver a verdict within two months on a
lawsuit filed by Taiwan against the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) for referring to Taiwan as a part of China.</P>
      <P>The Geneva First Instance Court held a second hearing Thursday on the lawsuit
filed on July 20 of last year that demanded that the organization correct
Taiwan's designation from "Taiwan Province, China" to "Republic of China
(Taiwan) " in the ISO 3166 country codes list.</P>
      <P>The lawsuit came after the ISO failed to respond positively to Taiwan's repeated
requests over the name issue.</P>
      <P>In rebutting the organization's doubts about Taiwan's legal standing, Henri-
Philippe Sambuc, the lawyer representing Taiwan, argued during the Thursday
hearing that Taiwan has all the elements of a country  and that Taiwan  enjoys
an international  legal personality, which requires no recognition from other
countries.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan has inked many valid treaties and agreements with countries,
including Switzerland, that do not have diplomatic ties with Taiwan, Sambuc
said.</P>
      <P>In many legal cases, courts in countries that are not Taiwan's diplomatic allies
have also confirmed Taiwan's legal eligibility, Sambuc noted.</P>
      <P>Sambuc further cited as an example a ruling by the Swiss Federal Supreme Court
on a kickback scandal involving Taiwan's procurement of six Lafayette-class
frigates from France.</P>
      <P>For its part, the ISO raised a procedural problem during the hearing, saying
that many documents presented by Taiwan were not translated into French.</P>
      <P>The organization  also countered  that many  of the Swiss institutions with
which Taiwan has signed agreements were not official.</P>
      <P>Following the hearing, Sambuc told the Central News Agency that he is confident
of winning the case, while a ISO lawyer and legal consultant declined to
comment.</P>
      <P>Prior to the lawsuit, the organization told Taiwan that it created the 3166 list
back in 1974 in accordance with the United Nations' practice of calling Taiwan
"Taiwan Province, China, " a term not coined by the ISO.</P>
      <P>It is the first time that Taiwan has resorted to legal action against a major
international organization over the name issue.</P>
      <P>The ISO 3166 list has been widely used globally, which has resulted in the use
of "Taiwan Province,  China" increasingly prevalent  among international
organizations  and multinational business groups.</P>
      <P>Taiwan  said,  however,  that  such  a trend  has  caused misunderstanding and
confusion for itself and undermined its national status and interests.</P>
      <P>The Geneva-based ISO is an international standard-setting body comprised  of
representatives  from various national  standards organizations.</P>
      <P>Founded on Feb. 23, 1947, the organization promulgates world-wide industrial and
commercial standards.</P>
      <P>While ISO defines itself as a non-governmental organization, its ability to set
standards that often become law, either through treaties or national standards,
makes it more powerful than most NGOs. In practice, ISO acts as a consortium
with strong links to governments.</P>

      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) has sent letters of authorization  from
Taiwan's  two presidential candidates to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA),
which will enable the ministry to see if they are citizens of other countries.</P>
      <P>CEC Secretary-General Deng Tien-yu said that both Frank Hsieh, presidential
candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, and his rival, Ma Ying-
jeou of the Kuomintang, had given written authorization to the commission to
have their statuses checked.</P>
      <P>The ministry will now ask the United States, Japan and Britain to see if they
are citizens of those countries.</P>
      <P>He said the CEC had received Ma's authorization earlier in the day along with
personal data, including his date of birth, ID number, passport number, English
name used on the passport, household address, U. S. social security number and
U.S. permanent residence document, or "green card."</P>
      <P>The process of checking if either of the candidates have dual citizenships in
other countries comes as Hsieh's campaign has pressed Ma over the past two weeks
over his possession of a "green card, " questioning his loyalty and integrity.</P>
      <P>Ma, who holds a doctoral degree in law from Harvard University, said that he did
possess a green card while studying in the United States in the 1980s, but he
stopped using it after returning to Taiwan, and the green card had since been
invalidated.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the CEC reminded television and radio programs on political affairs
Friday to be "just and equal" to the presidential candidates, and "not to treat
them differently."</P>
      <P>CEC officials said that the presidential and vice presidential election and
recall law stipulates that the TV and radio station could offer paid time slots
for presidential candidates and the political parties that nominate them for
campaign activities. The stations should provide "just and equal" treatment to
the candidates.</P>
      <P>The officials said that anyone could submit substantive evidence of possible
violations such as video or audio tapes to the CEC within one month after the
airing of the programs. Violators will be subject to fines of between NT$200,000
and NT$2 million (US$6,370-63,700).</P>

      <P>The KNT treated 21 of the tourist guides who passed the tests to a four-day tour
in Taiwan, and some of them wrote about their experience in Taiwan during the
stay. Among the responses were "I feel I got a good rest in Taiwan, " "Taiwan
has so much to see and eat, and I enjoy foot massages, " and "the Taiwan Lantern
Festival is spectacular."</P>
      <P>Lai said that the bureau will continue to work with other travel agencies in
Japan for "honorary" accreditation, and could expand the program to tourist
guides in Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, Hong Kong and Macau, countries that
are also major source of tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The bureau has recently launched a plan to promote Taiwan as a tourism
destination in 2008-2009, which is coupled with a series of incentive measures.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau expects the number of visitors to Taiwan, excluding Chinese
tourists, will reach its target of 4 million in 2008.</P>

      <P>The United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) has confirmed that Taiwan's
cities and companies can apply to join the newly established Climate Neutral
Network, opening a new way for Taiwan's future participation in the global
campaign against climate change.</P>
      <P>UNEP unveiled the Climate Neutral Network (CN Net) at the 10th Special Session
of the Governing Council and Global Ministerial Environmental Forum held in
Monaco earlier this month, aiming at "catalyzing a transition to a low-carbon
world."</P>
      <P>Under the program, CN Net will integrate countries, cities and companies all
over the world to boost a green economy and "will assist in building confidence
through demonstrable action at the national and local level on the art of the
possible, " said Achim Steiner,  the U.N.  under-secretary-general  and UNEP
executive director.</P>
      <P>Climate neutral is the concept of reducing  or offsetting greenhouse gases
emitted by a country in ways such as planting trees, reducing fuel usage and
adopting green energy, to balance the global warming effect.</P>
      <P>Asked if Taiwan, which is not a U.N. member, can join the program, UNEP
spokesman Nick Nuttall told CNA in a telephone interview Friday that Taiwanese
cities and companies can file applications at any time. He stopped short of
mentioning whether Taiwan can join the program at the national level.</P>
      <P>"It is a positive development, paving a new way for Taiwan to participate in the
environmental movement on an international scale," said Taiwan Environmental
Protection Union Chairwoman Gloria Hsu.</P>
      <P>"What needs to be seen is the Taiwanese people's and government's conscience
about environmental protection, " she went on, saying that once Taiwan joins the
program, it will have to make commitments to the reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions.</P>
      <P>So far, CN Net has registered four countries -- Costa Rica, Iceland, New Zealand
and Norway -- four cities, including Rizhao, a city in the eastern Chinese
province of Shandong, the Norwegian town of Arendal, the Swedish town of Vaxjo
and Canada's Vancouver, as well as five companies in Singapore, Brazil, the
United States, the United Kingdom and South Africa.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Environmental Protection Administration

      <P>Shipments by Taiwan's contract server system manufacturers are expected to
remain strong in the first quarter of 2008, driven mainly by efforts by server
brands such as HP and IBM to promote the establishment of Internet data centers
(IDCs) by businesses, the Institute for Information Industry (III) forecast
Saturday.</P>
      <P>While demand by international Internet service providers and telecommunications
operators will continue expanding, the multi-core and virtualization
technologies introduced by processor suppliers will also help boost shipments,
said Tung Chi-sheng, a senior industry analyst with the III's Market
Intelligence Center.</P>
      <P>Tung predicted that Taiwan's server system manufacturers will ship a total of
773,000 full systems and barebone systems in the first quarter of 2008, for a
quarter-on-quarter increase of 0.3 percent and a year-on-year increase of 8.6
percent.</P>
      <P>For the same period, the number of motherboards shipped by Taiwanese
manufacturers is expected to amount to 1.126 million units, up 0.1 percent
quarter-on-quarter and 7.6 percent year-on-year, Tung said.</P>
      <P>In the fourth quarter of 2007, full system and barebone system shipments by
Taiwanese manufacturers posted a year-on-year increase of 9 percent to reach
771,000 units, while motherboard shipments rose 8.4 percent year-on-year to
1.126 million units, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's server system production amounted to US$618.4 million in the third
quarter of 2003, for a quarter-on-quarter increase of 2.6 percent and year-on-
year increase of 8 percent, despite a US$2.4 decline in the average selling
price, he noted.</P>
      <P>During  the same quarter,  the average  selling  price of motherboards dropped
US$0.7, with the production value amounting to US$219.9 million, he added.</P>

      <P>In general, the output will tend to decline this year due to an expected
shortage of battery cells, Huang Yi-chuan predicted.</P>
      <P>In 2007, Huang said, the notebook output from the region amounted to 27.55
million units in the fourth quarter, recording an annual rise of 38.7 percent,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung has approved the resignation of Minister of National
Defense Lee Tien-yu, Executive Yuan Secretary-General Chen Chin-jun announced
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen also said he would convene a news conference at the Government Information
Office later in the day to explain Lee's resignation.</P>
      <P>Lee offered to resign in a news release posted on the Ministry of National
Defense (MND) Web site earlier in the day in which he said that he felt "deep
regret" over the controversy surrounding the formation of the private arms firm
Taiwan Goal.</P>
      <P>Lee said he had set his mind to implementing the nation's defense policy and
upgrading its defense capability ever since assuming the post last May.</P>
      <P>"Although I was instructed to establish Taiwan Goal, I have failed to carry out
the plan properly and have caused misgivings among the public about the project,
for which I have to step down, " Lee's statement said.</P>
      <P>Chang said earlier that same day that whether the MND should continue  to invest
in Taiwan  Goal should be given careful reconsideration.</P>
      <P>"I think it is necessary to reconsider whether the MND should go on as scheduled
to invest in a 45 percent stake of the company, " Chang said.</P>
      <P>"If we think it is improper for the MND to invest in the company, then it should
not invest," the premier went on, amid harsh criticism from the opposition-
controlled legislature that the formation of the arms firm is aimed at dodging
the supervision of the legislature even though most of the funding comes from
government agencies and state-owned corporations.</P>
      <P>Attending an international seminar on the 228 Incident earlier in the day, Chang
said that although the MND plans to hold 45 percent of the company, it has yet
to submit an investment proposal to the Executive Yuan and the funding has not
been channeled into the project or revived by the public.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that until such time that the MND's funds are channeled into the
project, the company is still privately owned and that the Cabinet therefore has
no legal authority to disband the company.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Goal completed registration with the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
Jan. 28 as a private company, with capital of NT$1 billion (US$31.15 million)
and paid-in capital totaling NT$80 million, and with Wu Nai-jen, a DPP
heavyweight and head of China Steel Machinery Corp. -- a subsidiary of the
formerly state-owned China Steel Corp. -- serving as chairman of the company.</P>
      <P>MOEA data shows that Taiwan Goal has a seven-member board of directors, with
three seats going to the MND.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Goal is registered to deal in a variety of businesses, including the
import and export of arms and weaponry systems; sales of garments and
accessories,  industrial explosives,  precision instruments,  and batteries of
all types; and product design, according to the MOEA.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China should improve human rights through 2008 Olympics: President</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has said that China should not use the 2008 Beijing
Olympics as a pretext for purging political dissent but should use the games as
an opportunity to show the world that it has made true improvements to its human
rights situation.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks Friday while meeting at the Presidential Office with
foreign delegates attending an international forum titled Human Rights in China
and the 2008 Olympics held Feb. 21-22 in Taipei with the aim of pressing China
to improve its human rights record prior to the Beijing Olympics scheduled to
open Aug. 8.</P>
      <P>The forum concluded that the Chinese government has violated the commitment it
made to improve its human rights situation before the Olympics and that the
human rights situation in China has in fact deteriorated since Beijing was
awarded the Olympics.</P>
      <P>Addressing the delegates, Chen called on China to stop using the games as a
pretext for purging or arresting dissidents.</P>
      <P>"The trend of pursuing democracy and liberty cannot be stopped and coercion can
only silence people temporarily, " Chen said, adding that independence of Kosovo
from Serbia Feb. 17 best illustrates the global trend of seeking democracy and
autonomy.</P>
      <P>"China's pressure on Taiwan seeking independence excludes itself from the global
trend and reveals its lack of confidence, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Taiwan's people enjoy freedom that is the fruit of the
country's democracy, while China's 1.3 billion people face life with jeopardized
human rights.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's democracy should serve as a good example for China and Taiwan's people
and government are willing to do their best to help China travel the road of
democracy, Chen said. He added that only if China transforms into a democratic
country can the Taiwan-China problem be solved and hope be given to regional and
world peace.</P>
      <P>Chen also expressed the hope that China will follow the global trend, respect
its people and protect their rights and dignity, to become a respectful, mature
and responsible country instead of one that relies on military power and rapid
economic growth.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that a Kosovan Web site that lists and expresses gratitude to
countries that have recognized Kosovo deleted Taiwan's name because of pressure
from China. The Web site gave as the reason for the deletion the fact that it
only listed names of U.N. member states, although Taiwan was listed for a short
time.</P>
      <P>Chen said he understands Kosovo's difficulty but felt sad because of what Taiwan
has experienced in terms of being refused entry to the U.N. and being denied
even the right to recognize other countries.</P>
      <P>"No matter how much time it takes for Kosovo to become a U.N. member,  its
independence cannot be denied,  just as Taiwan's sovereignty will not be
affected by the fact that it is not a U.N. member, " Chen said.</P>

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung voiced the government's concern and care Saturday for
the families of the victims of the 228 Incident of 1947 and said the care will
continue.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks when he attended an international seminar to mark the
61st anniversary of the 228 Incident, an uprising against the Kuomintang
administration under then-President Chiang Kai-shek that began Feb. 28, 1947 and
was followed by a bloody crackdown, resulting in tens of thousands of civilian
deaths.</P>
      <P>The event was sponsored by the 228 Incident Memorial Foundation, a non-profit
organization founded by the Executive Yuan in April 1995 based on the
Compensation and Rehabilitation Act.</P>
      <P>In his address, Chang said the truth of an authoritarian government's oppression
of the people should be revealed. He called on people not to forget the mistakes
of history in order to prevent the same mistakes from happening again.</P>
      <P>Since the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) took power in 2000, the
administration has designated Feb. 28 as Taiwan Peace Day and has established a
228 Peace Fund to help finance the 228 Incident Memorial Foundation, Chang said.</P>
      <P>In addition, he went on, the legislature passed last March an amendment  that
replaces  the  word  "compensation"  with "indemnification" in a bill related to
the 228 Incident -- a long-awaited request made by 228 Incident victims and
their families.</P>
      <P>Although the change in the official wording will not alter the compensation
conditions stipulated in the bill, it is believed that the word
"indemnification"  connotes  the wrongfulness  of the then-government's part in
the incident.</P>
      <P>The Statute for Handling of and Compensation for the 228 Incident enacted in
April 1995 details a series of steps that need to be made to make up for what
the victims suffered, but falls short of determining legal responsibility for
the incident.</P>
      <P>Citing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Chang repeated that the
"recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of
all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace
in the world."</P>
      <P>He also expressed hope that the concept will be carried out on Taiwanese soil
and in the international community and that Taiwan will always be a nation that
embraces human rights and democracy.</P>
      <P>The two-day seminar is being held at the National Library, with discussions on
topics focusing on human rights in small countries and the hegemony of big
countries.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's agricultural losses due to the recent cold spell have increased to
NT$380 million (US$12.1 million), as the fishery losses grew to NT$223 million,
according to statistics released by agriculture authorities Saturday.</P>
      <P>The increased losses were due to more places reporting crop and fishery losses,
including Tainan city and county and Chiayi County in southern Taiwan and Yilan
county in eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) statistics show that a series of cold snaps
over the past several weeks, with temperatures dipping to as low as 7 degrees
Celsius, have caused damage to crops including high-grafted pears, grapes, wax
apples, peaches, rice seedlings, flowers, plums and leafy vegetables.</P>
      <P>Around 2,100 hectares of farmland sustained 33 percent damage, meaning 684
hectares of farmland saw no harvest.</P>
      <P>The high-grafted pear buds suffered the heaviest damage, with farmers in Hsinchu
County sustaining the largest losses, followed by those in Taichung, Yilan,
Miaoli, Changhua, Kaohsiung, Pingtung, Yunlin and Taoyuan counties.</P>
      <P>Fishery losses amounted to NT$223 million, with Penghu County alone suffering

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States should re-establish a positive bilateral agenda with Taiwan by
helping it expand its international participation in order to maintain regional
stability, according to a report released Friday by the U.S.-based American
Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research (AEI).</P>
      <P>The report suggests that Washington help Taipei re-orient its foreign policy to
emphasize its role as a peaceful, vibrant member of the international community,
so that "Taiwan will strengthen its international identity as a responsible
stakeholder and face less temptation to press issues that cannot now be
resolved."</P>
      <P>"A more integrated Taiwan that can share its successes with the rest of the
world will be less inclined to force the thorniest cross-Taiwan Strait disputes
to the fore, " contends the report titled "Strengthening Freedom in Asia: A
Twenty-First Century Agenda for the U.S.-Taiwan Partnership, " which was worked
out by the Taiwan Policy  Working  Group  that was formed  by AEI and Armitage
International, an organization that assists companies in the global marketplace.</P>
      <P>While admitting that it will be difficult for China to accept a Taiwan with a
higher international  profile,  the report says Washington should nevertheless
end Beijing's expectations that it can "deliver" Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Beijing should talk directly to Taipei about its disagreements and not pressure
Washington to pressure the Taiwanese government, " the report says. "America
should make clear to Beijing that it has interests in the continued freedom of
the Taiwanese people to decide their  own fate and the peaceful  resolution  of
cross-strait differences."</P>
      <P>The report argues that the issue is urgent now that U.S.-Taiwan relations are
"dangerously drifting, " with Beijing using diplomatic isolation and the threat
of military force to pressure Taiwan into an unfavorable settlement and Taiwan
reacting by forcing intractable disputes to the front of the debate.</P>
      <P>Describing Taiwan's democracy as a beacon to other societies seeking peaceful
political liberalization, the report warns that if Taiwan is coerced by China
into a settlement against the wishes of the Taiwanese people, the United States
will lose a valuable international partner and suffer a severe blow to its
interests and regional position.</P>
      <P>In the event of China taking control of Taiwan, the United States and its allies
could be denied access to critical sea areas during conflict and China would
also significantly extend its reach in the Asia-Pacific region, it says.</P>
      <P>While a U.S.-Taiwan common agenda requires better, more routine high-level
contact, the Bush administration has taken a step backward in its exchanges with
Taiwan, with not a single Cabinet member or other high-level official having
visited Taiwan in the past several years, the report points out.</P>
      <P>It suggests that the U.S. secretary of state should be able to call his or her
counterpart in Taiwan to clarify American positions, understand Taiwan's
policies firsthand and create a climate of mutual trust.</P>
      <P>Also, the Department of Defense should use all the tools at its disposal to help
Taiwan improve its defense capabilities rapidly and to improve interoperability
in case the two militaries ever need to operate together, it continues.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is a flashpoint for war, and the United States must use all means of
communication, diplomacy, training and exchange to avert such a catastrophic
prospect," the report concludes.</P>

      <P>A former member of China's national men's basketball team who recently completed
a run across the United Sates to promote human rights and freedom for China's
people took part in an "Olympic Freedom Run" in Taipei Saturday and urged
Taiwanese people to "firmly defend the moral responsibility of spreading the
conviction of freedom."</P>
      <P>Kai Chen, 55, who played for China in the 1970s, has lived in the United States
since the early 1980s but continues to follow China's situation concerning human
rights. In 1989, shocked by the bloody suppression in Tiananmen Square, he
decided to devote himself to speaking for persecuted people in China.</P>
      <P>In August 2007, one year before the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, he set up the
"Olympic Freedom Run" in Los Angeles in the hope of drawing the world's
attention to the China's deplorable human rights situation.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese people in particular have the moral responsibility to fight for
freedom, because you, who are also Chinese-speaking people, live in a free and
democratic society, " said Chen. "It is not race or language that assembles all
of you in Taiwan, it is because of the conviction of freedom that you share, "
he went on.</P>
      <P>"But I'm not telling you not to travel in China or participate the Beijing
Olympics, " Chen said, adding that "I just hope you can go without forgetting to
express your faith in freedom."</P>
      <P>Citing the Olympic Games in Berlin in 1936, which he described as an "illusion
created and propagandized by the Nazis, " Chen said he does not want to see
history repeated in Beijing.</P>
      <P>After the press conference, Chen did a symbolic 8-km run in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Even if his name is reportedly on the Chinese authorities' "black list, " Chen
said, he is not frightened and will continue to run to raise people's awareness
of the universal value of freedom.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The achievements of an 18-year-old student at a senior high school in southern
Taiwan in helping farmers and the disadvantaged has been highlighted in a
textbook for first-grade junior high school students in the new semester.</P>
      <P>The textbook mentions that Shen Hsin-ling, a student from a debt-laden and poor
family at the National Tou-Liu Senior High School in the southern county of
Yunlin, made great contributions to society with her computer talents and her
passion for helping people in need.</P>
      <P>Shen established a Web site when she was only an elementary student to promote
pomelos -- amajor crop in her home town -- for her grandfather and neighbors
when the fruit became unsaleable due to a glut that year.</P>
      <P>In addition to helping farmers, she also set up a Web site in 2002 providing a
variety of free resources to facilitate learning for students who cannot afford
extra-curricular lessons. The Web site, www.anan1.webnow.biz,  also offers free
learning  resources  on languages, local culture and customs for foreign spouses
in Taiwan to help them better integrate to society.</P>
      <P>Shen's story was included in a social sciences text published by the Kang Hsuan
Educational Publishing Group.</P>
      <P>"It is a special experience to be mentioned in the textbook, especially when
most of the other stories in the textbook are about old or dead people," Shen
said.</P>
      <P>School Principal Lee Shih-feng said the school is proud of Shen's achievement.</P>
      <P>Shen said the publisher contacted her for her approval last March and the
Ministry of Education approved the publishing of the text last October. She
expressed hope that her story will inspire more young people to dedicate
themselves to social welfare services.</P>
      <P>Shen was selected as one of the top 10 young people with great potential by the
CNA this year for her contributions to social welfare. The CNA awards, now
entering their fifth year, awards the winners for their achievements in various
fields.</P>
      <P>Shen told reporters that she learned how to set up Web sites at the age of 12
and made up her mind to help the disadvantaged at 13. She  has already  received
33 certificates  for her computer proficiency.</P>
      <P>Shen said she will continue helping the disadvantaged and lessening the
disparity between urban and rural areas, and called on the government to pay
more attention in this regard.</P>
      <P>She also encouraged young students to believe in themselves and to create their
own futures.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian acclaimed Saturday the Taiwanese people's ability to
stand up and step forward again after sustaining a big fall, referring to the
reconstruction of places severely damaged by the 7.3-magnitude earthquake that
battered central Taiwan Sept. 21, 1999.</P>
      <P>Chen voiced his praise while visiting the Wusiu Bamboo Charcoal Kiln Cultural
Park in Luku township, Nantou County. He said this vitality enables the
Taiwanese people to "create the best possible future in a challenging living
environment with limited resources."</P>
      <P>"It is the very spirit of the Son of Taiwan, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president conducted a tour of the central Taiwan county, the area worst-hit
by the biggest earthquake to hit Taiwan in a century, earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>On his visit to the park, Chen expressed admiration for bamboo charcoal and
various bamboo charcoal-derived products produced at the park, an outlet of the
bamboo charcoal industry that was established after the 921 earthquake as part
of efforts to rebuild business in the area.</P>
      <P>Chen described the charcoal, made of locally grown moso strain of bamboo, as
"black diamond" and a miracle born from the ruins of the 921 earthquake.</P>
      <P>Each year, the bamboo kiln cultural park attracts over 200,000 visitors and
produces a wide variety of bamboo charcoal-derived products ranging from
clothing to foods, according to the park's operator.</P>
      <P>The epicenter of the 921 earthquake was near Chichi township in Nantou County,
150 km south southwest of Taipei. It caused over 2,400 deaths and more than
11,000 injuries, and destroyed tens of thousands of houses and buildings.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Strong Chinese culture will reduce identity challenge: scholar</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23 (CNA)

(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A visiting academic said in a speech in Taipei Saturday that what is essential
regarding the future of Chinese culture is "the quality of the modern culture
that China itself can ultimately generate" and that by the time an attractive
and well-respected Chinese culture is generated, it will reduce the problem of
self-identity to much more manageable proportions.</P>
      <P>Wang Guangwu, an expert in Southeast Asian studies who holds a distinguished
faculty position at the National University  of Singapore, made the remarks in a
speech titled "What Kind of Chinese? Southeast Asian Variations, " to share his
unique perspective on the topic of identity, an issue that often plagues
overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>"If China can ultimately generate a culture that is seen by everybody as
attractive and is well-respected, then Chinese cultures in any country can be
sustained and grow, " Wang said.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, there are three kinds of overseas Chinese -- the faithful,
the peripheral and the marginal.</P>
      <P>The faithful are those who identify themselves as only Chinese and retain close
links to China emotionally. The peripherals are those who understand the nature
of Chinese culture but enjoy the richness of local cultures, while the marginal
are Chinese descendants from settlers who arrived a long time ago and who have
moved away from the culture of their ancestors and have developed their own
cultures, he said.</P>
      <P>Infusing tradition with new modern features that everybody can associate with
China would reduce the problem to much more manageable proportions, he said.</P>
      <P>Overseas Chinese in Malaysia and Singapore face a series of identity challenges
he said, adding that changes within China, as well as the complex  interactions
with the British  colonial authorities, all affect the identity issue.</P>
      <P>Since the 1950s, several kinds of nationalism have demanded redefinitions of
identity, while globalization, regionalism and the rise of China have each begun
to attract those of Chinese descent in different ways.</P>
      <P>Wang, a pioneer and leading authority on the study of Southeast Asian Chinese
societies who was born in Indonesia and raised in Malaysia, shares the same
experience and identity problem that has tugged at thousands of overseas
Chinese.</P>
      <P>His speech was one of the MediaTek International Lecture Series sponsored by the
MediaTek Company and organized by the Lung Yingtai Cultural Foundation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government will not invest in 'Taiwan Goal' defense firm: Cabinet</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung has issued an instruction that no government funds
will be used to bankroll a controversial  joint venture  defense company,
Executive  Yuan Secretary-General Chen Chin-jun said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in a news conference during which he announced the
resignation of Minister of National Defense Lee Tien-yu, who said he had not
"properly" implemented the establishment of Taiwan Goal, a private arms firm set
up last month. Chen also announced Lee's successor, Tsai Ming-shian.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the government had originally hoped that the company could help
upgrade the nation's defense industry.</P>
      <P>But he lamented that opposition lawmakers have "grilled and smeared" Chang and
related Cabinet members over what they called a "suspicious source of the
company's funds" -- almost entirely from government agencies and state-
controlled corporations.</P>
      <P>Chen said government funds will not be channeled into Taiwan Goal and that the
company will have to depend on itself for funding.</P>
      <P>"If the government wants to buy weaponry, it will not commission the company to
make the purchases," he said.</P>
      <P>"No government funds have yet entered the company, the company has not signed
contract with the government and the government has not commissioned it to
purchase weaponry," he reaffirmed, adding that the government will "not spend
even one dime" investing in the project or any other private arms firms related
to the defense industry.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Taiwan Goal Chairman Wu Nai-jen, a heavyweight of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party and head of the China Steel Machinery Corp. -- a
subsidiary of Taiwan-based China Steel Corp. in which the government has more
than 20 percent stakes -- will stay in his post, Chen said that is his own
business.</P>
      <P>Wu issued a news release earlier that day that the controversy surrounding the
project, has "switched the focus of helping develop the nation's defense
industry, which was the purpose of forming the company."</P>
      <P>"The company will not be able to maintain its private enterprise capacity now
and its existence has become meaningless under the circumstances,  " Wu said,
adding that he will soon call a shareholders' meeting to discuss the disbanding
of the company.</P>
      <P>Chen said the government had acted in accordance with the National Defense Act
and the Organic Act of the Armament Bureau under the Ministry  of National
Defense to cooperate  with private enterprises to develop the defense industry.</P>
      <P>On an allegation leveled by opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Chang Hsien-
yao that Taiwan Goal negotiated with France last month to buy Rafale jet
fighters, Chen said that this kind of information "is not suitable for public
disclosure."</P>
      <P>He noted that China has continued to squeeze Taiwan by preventing other foreign
countries from selling it weaponry, putting the nation into a very difficult
plight.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the company has only engaged in initial contacts with arms suppliers,
he went on, adding that "random speculation may undermine national security."</P>
      <P>Taiwan Goal registered with the Ministry of Economic Affairs Jan. 28 as a
private company, with capital of NT$1 billion (US$31.15 million) and paid-in
capital totaling NT$80 million.</P>
      <P>According to information provided by the Executive Yuan, the first-stage capital
of the company will be NT$200 million. The initial funding of NT$80 million has
been collected, including NT$50 million from China Steel Machinery Corp. and
NT$30 million from a subsidiary of Chunghwa Telecom.</P>
      <P>But NT$90 million from the Ministry of National Defense, which had planned to
hold 45 percent of the company shares and was the largest shareholder under the
original plan, and NT$30 million from the Yao Hua Glass Co. -- a company under
the Ministry of Economic Affairs -- had yet to be injected.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New meals to be included in meal delivery service: CEPD</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Saturday that it
has commissioned welfare groups to develop health-conscious meals for the
elderly and will include them in its delivery service.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials said that under the government's "mega warmth" project, they have
targeted meal deliveries as the most basic and urgent service for the elderly.</P>
      <P>According to Ministry of the Interior statistics, the number of elderly in
Taiwan had reached 2.38 million as of the end of October 2007, with about
320,000 living alone.</P>
      <P>With the population continuing to age, the government has taken the initiative
to help with meal delivery services for these elderly people, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>The CEPD conducted a survey on meal deliveries to solitary elders in cities and
counties around the nation last year and found that the existing operation has
problems such as an insufficient volunteer network, while menus, calories and
taste have proved unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>The CEPD therefore commissioned the Hondao Senior Citizen's Welfare Foundation
in Taichung, central Taiwan, to conduct a project last October to integrate
eateries, welfare groups and women wanting to create their own businesses for
the meal delivery services.</P>
      <P>According to the survey among the elderly in Taichung, they tend to eat out
mostly for lunch, and 80.8 percent of them prefer rice-based meals.</P>
      <P>When they eat out, they consider the factors of environmental hygiene, food
freshness and price, in that order. They also hope that meals delivered to their
homes will be priced at between NT$51 and NT$70 (US$1.7-US$2.15).</P>
      <P>The 10 newly developed meals, priced between NT$60 and NT$65, will make their
debut in early March for test sales, with delivery services starting at a later
date.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New defense minister to withdraw from presidential campaign</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Defense Minister-designate Tsai Ming-hsian will withdraw from campaigning for
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential ticket after assuming
his new post, a close friend of Tsai said Saturday.</P>
      <P>"Tsai has to stop his involvement in presidential campaign affairs to maintain
administrative neutrality and devote himself wholeheartedly to Defense Ministry
work, " said Tsai's friend, speaking on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang Liao Wan-chien, a Taichung city councilor, described Tsai's
appointment as a suitable personnel arrangement, saying he is a man of integrity
and diligence who is capable and experienced.</P>
      <P>"Tsai is no stranger to defense affairs, as he has served as deputy defense
minister and as deputy secretary-general of the National Security Council, "
said Chang Liao, who served as top campaign manager of Tsai's unsuccessful bid
for a legislative seat in the Jan. 12 elections.</P>
      <P>During his two terms as legislator from 1996-2002, Tsai was on the Defense
Committee and once served as its convener, an experience that enabled him to get
a full grasp of the country's defense posture and military strength, Chang Liao
said.</P>
      <P>But a political analyst said Tsai, who is now an adviser to the Ministry of
National Defense (MND), will face a host of tough tasks as the first defense
minister from the DPP, which has a scant support base in the military.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan announced Tsai's appointment as the new defense minister
earlier in the day after Lee Tien-yu abruptly resigned over a dispute
surrounding a defense firm.</P>
      <P>Lee resigned after opposition lawmakers accused members of the DPP
administration of seeking to profit from the defense company, named Taiwan Goal,
which is headed by Wu Nai-jen, a DPP heavyweight who maintains close ties with
Vice Premier Chiou I-jen.</P>
      <P>"I deeply regret that the establishment of Taiwan Goal caused concerns and
doubts in various sectors and I hereby tender my resignation, " Lee said in a
brief statement posted on the MND Web site late Friday.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung promptly approved Lee's resignation and appointed Tsai
as his successor.</P>
      <P>The first test for Tsai is to maintain stability in the military ahead of the
presidential election, the analyst said, adding that the precarious cross-Taiwan
Strait military situation could also be great challenge.</P>
      <P>"With less than a month to go before the March 22 presidential poll, Tsai must
settle the dust and ripples from the bungled Taiwan Goal project as quickly as
possible to boost military morale and maintain combat readiness," the analyst
said.</P>
      <P>As the main opposition Kuomintang, which now holds an absolute majority in the
Legislative Yuan, had attributed its defeat in the 2004 presidential election
partly to the alleged MND restrictions on absence of leave on the voting day,
the analyst said Tsai will definitely come under intensive supervision by the
opposition camp over the MND planning to enable as many service members as
possible to return home to cast ballots this time around.</P>
      <P>The KMT, who used to be in power for more than 50 years, commands astrong
support base in the military.</P>
      <P>Although the MND said last week it has not detected any abnormal or unusual
movement of the Chinese army amid the heat of presidential campaign in Taiwan,
the analyst said, Tsai cannot afford any lapse or negligence in guard against
unexpected developments in the Taiwan Strait situation.</P>
      <P>"Ensuring military stability and smooth proceeding  of the presidential election
will be Tsai's top mission before the country's new president takes office on
May 20," the analyst said.</P>
      <P>In the face of China's continued expansion of its military might, Tsai has
consistently advocated closer Taiwan-U.S.-Japan cooperation to maintain East
Asian stability and peace, using the U.S.-Japan defense treaty and the Taiwan
Relations Act as a platform.</P>
      <P>Tsai traveled to the United States to pursue a doctoral degree after graduating
from National Taiwan University's Department of Law. As he maintained frequent
contacts with political dissidents in Taiwan during his stay in the United
States, he was barred from returning to Taiwan to take up a teaching job in 1982
when Taiwan was still under martial law. He did not return until 1990 after the
lifting of the martial law.</P>
      <P>He started his political career with a seat on the now defunct National Assembly
and later won a legislative seat. He switched to the administrative job after
the DPP won the presidency in 2000. He first served as the country's deputy
representative to the United States before returning to take up the post of
deputy defense minister  in 2004.  He resigned from his post as NSC deputy
secretary-general in 2006 to prepare for the legislative race in his hometown of
Taichung City, which he lost.</P>

      <P>The Penghu county government plans to set up nursery grounds along its coastline
to facilitate rejuvenation of its coastal fishery resources after the recent
abnormal cold weather devastated its fishing industry, a local official said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Cheng Ming-yuan,  director of the county's Fishery Bureau, revealed the plan
during a seminar that brought together local and central government officials as
well as academics and experts to discuss post-disaster relief measures.</P>
      <P>Describing the cold spell-inflicted damage to the offshore county's fishing
industry as the "worst in 30 years, " Cheng said regeneration of shallow nursery
grounds is urgent and imperative.</P>
      <P>"We are pondering to designate certain selected coastal areas as conservation
sanctuaries in which fish eels will be released, cultured and protected," Cheng
said, adding that the measure is aimed at facilitating growth of fishy resources
and recovery of marine ecology in the county's coastal regions.</P>
      <P>As a fishing ban will be imposed on the protected waters, Cheng said the nursery
grounds regeneration project may draw backlash from local fishermen.</P>
      <P>"The county government will launch a publicity campaign after finalizing the
rejuvenation plan next Tuesday to seek understanding and support from local
fishermen," Cheng said, adding that the Penghu Prosecutor's Office has promised
to cooperate with the county government and the Coast Guard Administration in
policing the protected areas.</P>
      <P>Chen Tien-shou, deputy head of the Fisheries Administration under the Cabinet-
level Council of Agriculture, led an 11-member delegation composed on fishing
administrators, marine ecologists and fishery experts to attend the seminar and
conduct a field survey of the causes of the devastation and the extent of damage

      <P>The possibility of altering the date for two referendums on Taiwan's U.N.
membership bid is slim, if not nil, a Central Election Commission (CEC) official
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>CEC Secretary-General Teng Tien-you made the remarks a day after former
President Lee Teng-hui appealed for separating the two controversial referendums
from the March 22 presidential election to spare Taiwan a "crisis" that the
implementation of the referendums might bring it.</P>
      <P>Noting that any change to the date of the two referendums requires the approval
of a majority of CEC commissioners, Teng said he has not received any
information showing that CEC commissioners are prepared to hold a new round of
meeting to address the issue.</P>
      <P>Since the CEC officially sanctioned the holding of the two referendums alongside
the March 22 presidential election on Feb. 1, Teng said, the CEC has been
working on voting preparations.</P>
      <P>"We are now ready for printing of referendum ballots and election gazette,"
Tengs said, adding that judging from this situation, the possibility of changing
the referendum date is very low.</P>
      <P>Claiming that if the two referendums fail to pass the legal threshold, the
international community would have a mistaken interpretation of Taiwan people's
willingness to join the U.N., Lee said such a result would cause "irreparable
damage" to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT)  have each initiated a referendum regarding Taiwan's pursuit of
U.N. membership. The two referendums will be held alongside the presidential
election.</P>
      <P>The DPP-initiated question asks voters if they support joining the United
Nations under the name "Taiwan,"  while the KMT-initiated question asks voters
if they support re-entry to the world body under the name "Republic of China" or
any other "suitable" name.</P>
      <P>Both China and the United States have voiced objections to the DPP's referendum
initiative, which they described as a move toward Taiwan's independence.</P>

      <P>The possibility of altering the date for two referendums on Taiwan's U.N.
membership bid is slim, if not nil, a Central Election Commission (CEC) official
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>CEC Secretary-General Teng Tien-you made the remarks a day after former
President Lee Teng-hui appealed for separating the two controversial referendums
from the March 22 presidential election to spare Taiwan a "crisis" that the
implementation of the referendums might bring it.</P>
      <P>Noting that any change to the date of the two referendums requires the approval
of a majority of CEC commissioners, Teng said he has not received any
information showing that CEC commissioners are prepared to hold a new round of
meeting to address the issue.</P>
      <P>Since the CEC officially sanctioned the holding of the two referendums alongside
the March 22 presidential election on Feb. 1, Teng said, the CEC has been
working on voting preparations.</P>
      <P>"We are now ready for printing of referendum ballots and election gazette,"
Tengs said, adding that judging from this situation, the possibility of changing
the referendum date is very low.</P>
      <P>Claiming that if the two referendums fail to pass the legal threshold, the
international community would have a mistaken interpretation of Taiwan people's
willingness to join the U.N., Lee said such a result would cause "irreparable
damage" to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT)  have each initiated a referendum regarding Taiwan's pursuit of
U.N. membership. The two referendums will be held alongside the presidential
election.</P>
      <P>The DPP-initiated question asks voters if they support joining the United
Nations under the name "Taiwan,"  while the KMT-initiated question asks voters
if they support re-entry to the world body under the name "Republic of China" or
any other "suitable" name.</P>
      <P>Both China and the United States have voiced objections to the DPP's referendum
initiative, which they described as a move toward Taiwan's independence.</P>

      <P>The Penghu county government plans to set up nursery grounds along its coastline
to facilitate rejuvenation of its coastal fishery resources after the recent
abnormal cold weather devastated its fishing industry, a local official said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Cheng Ming-yuan,  director of the county's Fishery Bureau, revealed the plan
during a seminar that brought together local and central government officials as
well as academics and experts to discuss post-disaster relief measures.</P>
      <P>Describing the cold spell-inflicted damage to the offshore county's fishing
industry as the "worst in 30 years, " Cheng said regeneration of shallow nursery
grounds is urgent and imperative.</P>
      <P>"We are pondering to designate certain selected coastal areas as conservation
sanctuaries in which fish eels will be released, cultured and protected," Cheng
said, adding that the measure is aimed at facilitating growth of fishy resources
and recovery of marine ecology in the county's coastal regions.</P>
      <P>As a fishing ban will be imposed on the protected waters, Cheng said the nursery
grounds regeneration project may draw backlash from local fishermen.</P>
      <P>"The county government will launch a publicity campaign after finalizing the
rejuvenation plan next Tuesday to seek understanding and support from local
fishermen," Cheng said, adding that the Penghu Prosecutor's Office has promised
to cooperate with the county government and the Coast Guard Administration in
policing the protected areas.</P>
      <P>Chen Tien-shou, deputy head of the Fisheries Administration under the Cabinet-
level Council of Agriculture, led an 11-member delegation composed on fishing
administrators, marine ecologists and fishery experts to attend the seminar and
conduct a field survey of the causes of the devastation and the extent of damage
to the county's marine ecology.</P>

      <P>A group of Tibetans living in Taiwan and and their Taiwanese friends called for
support Sunday for a "Tibetan Olympics" in a bid to denigrate Beijing, which has
barred Tibet from entering a delegation to the 2008 Olympic Games to be held in
Beijing in August.</P>
      <P>A ceremony marking the symbolic arrival of the so-called "Tibetan Olympics
torch" was held at the Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall in Taipei Sunday under the
sponsorship of Tibetans living in Taipei and the private group Taiwan Friends of
Tibet.</P>
      <P>People shouted "Free Tibet" and waved banners reading "Boycott Beijing Olympics"
on the Taipei leg of the torch relay, led by Miss Tibet 2006 Tsering Chungtak.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, Chungtak -- who quit a beauty pageant in Malaysia
last year over China's pressure to have her "Miss Tibet" sash replaced with one
reading "Miss Tibet-China" -- said the Tibetan Olympics torch relay is being
carried out to demonstrate the importance of freedom and human rights for
Tibetan people and how they have been deprived of their right to take part in
international athletic games like the 2008 Beijing Olympics.</P>
      <P>Chungtak -- who arrived in Taipei Feb. 19 at the invitation of the Miss Taiwan
Beauty Contest organizers -- said Tibetans are peace-loving people who also have
good sportsmanship.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chou Mei-li, president of the Taiwan Friends of Tibet, said that in
order to protest  against  Beijing's  denial of participation by Tibetans in the
Olympics, the "Tibetan Olympics" and a worldwide torch relay are designed to let
the world know better how the Tibetan people have been discriminated against
politically by China.</P>
      <P>The "Tibetan Olympics" -- slated to be held May 15-25 in Dharamsala, northern
India, where the Tibetan government-in-exile is based -- is an initiative to
offer a platform for young Tibetans to celebrate the spirit of the Olympics,
according to Chou.</P>
      <P>The "Tibetan Olympics torch, " which departed from Delhi Jan. 30, will go around
the world, making one full circle touching 10 major cities in five continents,
including Sydney, Taipei, Tokyo, Maui, San Francisco, New York City, London and
Jerusalem, according to the organizers.</P>
      <P>Tsering Chungtak said in Taipei several days ago that she did not regret making
the decision to quit the Malaysian beauty pageant in protest against Beijing's
bullying. The 22-year-old is a student at the University of Delhi in India.</P>
      <P>She said she will follow the Dalai Lama's moderate approach in dealing with
China. Tibet is currently officially claimed and administered by China, although
many Tibetans place their allegiance with the exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai
Lama.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Fishery disaster caused by cold water current from China: academic</HEADLINE>

02/24/08  17:12:44

    <TEXT>
      <P>The recent massive fish die-off in outlying Penghu County was mainly caused by a
cold water current from China rather than by the abnormally cold spell of the
past month, as many had previously thought, a local oceanologist said over the
weekend.</P>
      <P>National Taiwan Ocean University President Lee Kuo-tien aired the view while
conducting a field survey of disaster zones in the island county off the
southwestern coast of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, snowmelt from heavy snowstorms that hit many parts of China in
late January and early February flowed into China's southeastern coastal waters,
which then drifted through the seas off Penghu.</P>
      <P>Noting that the low-temperature, low-salt water flow from China impeded the
Kuroshio Current, also known as the Black Stream, which usually flows around
Penghu bringing warm,  tropical  currents northward, Lee said water temperatures
in coastal Penghu consequently dropped sharply and led to a massive fish die-off
in the county that depends on the fishing industry as the backbone of its
economy.</P>
      <P>In his observation, Lee said the so-called "M-type" phenomenon in socioeconomic
development is also seen in meteorology, meaning that tropical regions have
become ever hotter, while cold and polar regions are getting increasingly
colder, just as the rich are getting richer and the poor becoming ever poorer.</P>
      <P>"And both such climatic phenomena can affect Penghu, as it is located between
tropical and colder regions, " Lee said, adding that since the entire global
ecosystem has changed, the so-called 30-year cycle of fishery cold disaster in
Penghu could also be broken.</P>
      <P>He suggested that an efficient alarm and monitoring system be crafted to
facilitate prevention of similar disasters in future.</P>
      <P>Lee was among a score of scholars and experts in marine ecology, coral reefs,
fish species and climatic changes, as well as central government officials, who
had traveled from Taiwan proper to the outlying island to study the cause of the
recent disaster, the extent of damage to fishing grounds and feasible relief
measures.</P>
      <P>The group was led by Chen Tien-shou, deputy director of the Fisheries
Administration  under the Cabinet-level  Council  of Agriculture. Among the
members were Shao Kwang-tsao, director of Academia Sinica's Research Center for
Biodiversity, and National Taiwan University professors Chiu Tai-sheng and Tai
Chang-feng.</P>
      <P>In addition to inspecting the two hardest-hit regions -- Chingwan Bay and
Houliao Beach -- the group held a seminar with Penghu county officials,
including Magistrate Wang Chien-fa.</P>
      <P>Cheng Ming-yuan, director of the county's Fishery Bureau, first gave a briefing
on the county's fishery losses.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, 44 tons of dead fish had been cleared from beaches around
the county in the past 10 days. "There are also numerous dead fish on the sea
bed," he added.</P>
      <P>All the academics present at the colloquium agreed that the county government
need not bother to clean up the dead fish on the sea bed, saying Mother Nature
will dispose of them.</P>
      <P>A marine ecologist noted that dead fish become part of the food chain, which
will in turn contribute to conservation of fishery resources.</P>
      <P>The scholars and experts were also reserved about the county government's plan
to release eels into designated coastal waters to spur rejuvenation of fish
stocks, saying such moves may sabotage the delicate natural balance among fish
species.</P>
      <P>They offered many recommendations on how to forge an efficient alarm and
monitoring system to prevent recurrence of any massive fishery disaster. They
also presented opinions on the formulation of short-, middle- and long-term
marine policy to benefit both marine resource conservation and bolster the
county's economic development.</P>
      <P>Penghu Magistrate Wang said after the meeting that Fisheries Administration
Deputy Director Chen Tien-shou had promised to assist the county government in
surveying damaged fishing grounds along its beautiful coastline and establishing
a monitoring and tracking mechanism.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Sunday that there are precedents in foreign
countries to make arms procurements via privately run companies.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan faces difficulties seeking to obtain advanced arms or weaponry
systems from industrially advanced countries via official channels,  given the
country's constrained  diplomatic situation.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks in an indirect response to the resignation the
day before of Minister of National Defense Lee Tien-yu over the controversy
surrounding the formation of the private arms firm Taiwan Goal in the wake of
heavy and lengthy complaints by opposition  Kuomintang (KMT)  legislators.  The
KMT legislators questioned the legitimacy of Taiwan Goal, which was established
with public funds but will be beyond the control of the Ministry of National
Defense and the legislature.</P>
      <P>Lee said in a news release posted on the Ministry of National Defense Web site a
day earlier that he had set his mind on implementing the nation's defense policy
and upgrading its defense capability ever since assuming the post last May.
"Although I was instructed to establish Taiwan Goal, I have failed to carry out
the plan properly and have caused misgivings among the public about the project,
for which I have to step down," Lee's statement said.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks during a visit to Chen I-chiu, a former
presidential adviser appointed by Chen in 2001, in the southern county of
Kaohsiung, according to Chen I-chiu's family.</P>
      <P>Chen I-chiu was quoted by his family as having asked the president about how the
government will help China-based Taiwanese businessmen relocate their
investments back to Taiwan from China now that the Chinese government has
imposed new, stricter regulations governing taxation, environmental and labor
conditions.</P>
      <P>The president said it is only natural that Taiwanese businessmen would choose to
return home from China in the wake of the change in the investment climate

      <P>Presidential hopefuls Frank Hsieh and Ma Ying-jeou went head- to-head in the
first of two crucial televised debates Sunday with the election less than four
weeks away.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) Hsieh and Ma, who represents
the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), looked confident and prepared in the first
segment of the debate, which included 20 pre- recorded questions in video format
from citizens.</P>
      <P>The debate was seen as an important platform for both to appeal to the
electorate for support in the March 22 election, as well as a chance for Hsieh
to close the gap between them, as he has been trailing in most public opinion
polls since the campaign began last year.</P>
      <P>Hsieh and Ma were asked to answer questions from 20 citizens, including Lo Chao-
hsun, who is known for heckling President Chen Shui-bian in public, and Su
Chien-ho, a convicted murderer whose controversial death sentence is still under
review by the Taiwan High Court.</P>
      <P>Both candidates only exchanged friendly fire in the first 10 questions, although
Hsieh occasionally took jabs at Ma.</P>
      <P>The debate was organized by the CNA, the Public Television Service Foundation
and four local newspapers.</P>
      <P>In the first two sections of the program, according to the rules, Hsieh and Ma
had to respond to the 20 videotaped questions selected by the organizers from
among 456 questions contributed to PeoPo, a Web site specially set up for the
general public to express their concerns on the Internet over the candidates,
their policies, and the future of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 20 people chosen were then given the opportunity to question both candidates
directly at the debate, based on the candidates' answers to the videotaped
questions, which included such issues as the identity of Taiwan and its people,
Taiwan's participation in the Kyoto Protocol, same-sex marriage, the promotion
of aboriginal culture, social welfare and economic development.</P>
      <P>In the third section of the program, each presidential hopeful challenged  his
opponent with three questions,  with responses requiring to be made within a

      <P>Statistics indicate that new car registrations in Taiwan have declined over 30
percent in two years, a clear sign that the country's car market is continuing
to shrink as a possible result of soaring global oil prices, according to a
press report issued Saturday by the Taipei City Motor Vehicles Office.</P>
      <P>In 2007 366,022 new cars were registered nationwide, showing a 9.6 percent
decline year-on-year, according to the press report. Compared with the 2005
figure of 545,856, the downsizing could be expanded to a 33 percent decline, the
report said.</P>
      <P>The report attributed the decline mainly to high crude oil prices and a
weakening global economy.</P>
      <P>Another possible reason could be that car loans are getting tougher, as banks
all over the world tighten their lending policies, the report said.</P>
      <P>In contrast, mass transport was given a boost, with passenger numbers hitting a
record of high of 1.04 billion in Taipei in 2007, representing an increase of
more than 4 percent year-on-year, showing that urban commuters are more inclined
to use public transport.</P>
      <P>The economic slump has also forced car buyers to turn to the used car market,

countries establish a task force governing U.S.-Taiwan defense relations.</P>
      <P>The report urges the United States to give priority to enacting a free trade
agreement with Taiwan and not to succumb to Chinese pressure to snub Taiwan,
while also suggesting that Taiwan lift a ban on investment in China.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the report stresses the importance of relations between the United
States and Taiwan and that a more positive and productive bilateral agenda
between the two sides should be forged.</P>
      <P>The report also expresses hope for smooth development  of U.S.-Taiwan relations,
Yeh noted.</P>
      <P>In her view, Yeh said, "the bilateral relations between the two countries rely
on a solid and consolidated foundation, but there is still ample room for
expansion."</P>
      <P>As the ministry has its own goals and methods for improving relations with
Washington, Yeh said, it will continue to strengthen bilateral communication in
addition to taking the report into consideration.</P>
      <P>The two main authors of the study -- Randall Schriver, a former deputy assistant
secretary of state for Asia-Pacific affairs who now works in the private sector
and Dan Blumenthal, a former Pentagon official-- are slated to release the
report Feb. 25 at a seminar in Taipei. Foreign Minister James Huang will deliver
a speech during the seminar, according to Yeh.</P>

      <P>A Cabinet-level task force has moved to investigate price manipulation and has
adopted various measures to stabilize prices after sharp hikes in consumer
prices, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The measures include a halving of tariffs on seven imported commodities for six
months and various approaches to maintain low prices for oil, electricity and
water, Chang added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a price stabilization task force under the Executive Yuan has also
intensified its efforts to look into whether there has been artificial
manipulation behind soaring prices for necessities.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Ministry of Economic Affairs announced last Wednesday a ban on
exports of locally produced rebar and small steel billets -- important materials
for construction -- for a period of three months to counter a recent domestic
shortage, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet is also considering to remove the 5 percent business tax on bulk
communities by submitting amendments to the Value-Added Business Tax Act to the
Legislative Yuan for approval, according to Chang.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks in response to inquiries about reports that prices of
flour, butter and milk powder have more than doubled in a year, causing the
closure of more than 600 bakeries.</P>
      <P>"How to diminish the impact of soaring consumer prices on the daily lives of the
people has always been the primary concern and major administrative goal of the
Cabinet, " Chang said, adding that the task force will continue to keep track of
price fluctuations of important consumer goods and come up with response
measures.</P>
      <P>The consumer price index (CPI) is forecast to reach 3 percent for the first half
of the year, with 3 percent for the first quarter, 3.1 percent for the second
quarter, according to the latest report from the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting, and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>However, the CPI will amount to 1.98 percent, according to the DGBAS report.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS forecast was made after taking into account the impact of potentially
higher international oil and raw material prices, according to the report, which
said that based on a forecast by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, the price of crude oil is expected to average US$88 per barrel in
January, a 74.3 percent increase over the same period of last year.</P>

      <P>Both presidential hopefuls called Sunday for respect for and tolerance of
homosexuals  in their first face-to-face televised debate, but fell short of
promising to legalize same-sex marriages.</P>
      <P>Gay societies and activists, however, expressed dissatisfaction with the two
candidates in a press release immediately following the debate, complaining that
"their answers lacked foresight and failed to give real and concrete responses
to the issue."</P>
      <P>In response to questions about gay issues raised by a citizen in the first of
two debates, Ma Ying-jeou, representing the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT),
said that "sex orientation is by nature deserving of respect and toleration, "
adding that "people need to learn how to tolerate and appreciate homosexuality."</P>
      <P>As mayor of Taipei between 1998 and 2006, Ma went on, his administration
allocated a special budget for gay activities in 1999.</P>
      <P>"Taipei is the freest city in Asia for homosexuals," according to Ma.</P>
      <P>Saying that there should not be any discrimination against gay love, Frank
Hsieh, the presidential hopeful of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), add that he respects human rights and that society should look at gay
issues with an open mind.</P>
      <P>Despite expressing sympathy for gay rights, however, neither Ma nor Hsieh
committed themselves to legalizing same-sex marriages, saying only that the
matter needs to be further reviewed.</P>
      <P>Reaffirming his attitude toward human rights and the rights of homosexuals, Ma
said same-sex marriage would require an amendment to the Civil Law and that
society would need to reach consensus on the issue.</P>
      <P>"I respect same-sex marriage, but it has to be cautiously planned, " Ma said,
adding that "we still need to struggle for equal rights for gays."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to Hsieh, marriage can be diversified, but people should
take "culture" and "family" into consideration when talking about same-sex
marriage.</P>
      <P>Ma and Hsieh made the remarks in the debate organized by the CNA, the Public
Television Foundation and four local newspapers. The organizers consider the
debate to be a decisive factor in the presidential campaign.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's presidential candidates Ma Ying-jeou and Frank Hsieh on Sunday tried to
point out each other's weaknesses in their first televised debate, with Ma
suggesting Hsieh's proposed tax cuts were inadequate and Hsieh raising further
questions about Ma's loyalty to the island.</P>
      <P>But both candidates presented similar positions on China -- agreeing it was
necessary to hold talks with Beijing, and pledging to allow direct charter
flights between Taiwan and the mainland within two or three months if elected.</P>
      <P>At the first of two head-to-head debates before the March 22 election, both
candidates agreed that it will be necessary to negotiate with China and have the
two sides call off their battle on the diplomatic front.</P>
      <P>Front runner Ma, from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , was adamant that China
must stop its attempts to suffocate Taiwan in the international arena,  while
Hsieh,  from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , stressed that the
ruling and opposition parties must remain united when negotiating with China
over this issue.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said charter flight services between Taiwan and mainland China could be
expanded to become weekly flights between multiple destinations on both sides of
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Ma said in addition to charter flights, he would push for the operation of
regular flights through cross-strait negotiation over air traffic rights. Ma
added that with direct transport links between the two sides, Taiwanese
entrepreneurs would not need to move their production bases to China.</P>
      <P>Both candidates agreed that any direct flight services should be based on the
premise that Taiwan's security would not be affected.</P>
      <P>During the two-hour and 45-minute debate, each candidate was asked to answer 20
questions from pre-recorded video tapes submitted by members of the public. The
selected questioners were allowed to ask follow-up questions at the debate. In
the second part of the debate, they were required to answer three questions from
each other, with the third part allowing each of them three minutes for a
conclusion.</P>
      <P>The questions covered a wide range of subjects, including relations with China,
the national economy, ways to protect Taiwan's farmers, education of the young
generation, and punishment for corrupt government officials.</P>
      <P>In response to public concerns that wages in Taiwan have failed to keep up with
inflation, Hsieh said he favored a reduction in income, sales and in inheritance
taxes as a solution.</P>
      <P>Ma, however, said tax cuts proposed by Hsieh was not enough.</P>
      <P>"Cutting taxes is not the best solution. Economic restrictions must be relaxed.
There must be direct transport links between the two sides of the Strait, in
order to attract foreign investment to Taiwan," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma, instead, called for increased public investment, salary raises and increased
consumer spending, plus relaxing restrictions on economic relations with China
to allow direct transportation between Taiwan and China, in order to attract
more foreign investment to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, however, criticizes Ma's proposal as deficit spending. "Vote for Ma Ying-
jeou, and each household will have to write Ma Ying-jeou aNT$400,000 bounced
check, " Hsieh said, referring to how much the deficit budget would cost each
household and emphasizing that Taiwan could not afford such spending.</P>
      <P>Ma said that his economic blueprint would allow Taiwan to maintain an economic
growth rate of at least 6 percent, increase the nation's per capita income to
US$20,000 by 2011 and US$30,000 by 2016, and keep the jobless rate below 3
percent. Hsieh said he would attach more importance to the purchasing power, and
that he would try to keep the real purchasing power for an average citizen at
around US$30,000 or even more per year.</P>
      <P>The two candidates also promised to increase financial aid to Taiwan's cultural
and creative industries and allow the outlying island chain Penghu, located
about 50 kilometers west of Taiwan proper, to set up gambling casinos with
appropriate safeguard measures.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who is trailing behind Ma in the opinion polls by up to 20 points
according to some polls, spent much of the debate attacking his opponent.</P>
      <P>He lost no opportunity to once again raise questions, as he's done recently,
about Ma once possessing permanent resident status in the United States --
suggesting lack of loyalty to Taiwan. But Ma explained that although he obtained
permanent residence to get a student loan when pursuing his graduate education
in the United States in the late 1970s, he gave up the status over 20 years ago
after returning to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma countered with a question that many of Hsieh's hand-picked officials were
indicted on charges of corruption, but Hsieh rebutted that being indicted does
not mean they are guilty, because the legal proceedings are not yet complete.
Hsieh reminded Ma that he himself was also indicted on charges of misusing his
special fees while serving as Taipei mayor.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court and the Taiwan High court both ruled that Ma is not
guilty of graft in 2007, but the prosecutors appealed the case to the Supreme
Court in January. Although the Supreme Court has not set a date for hearing the
case, it appears unlikely that a ruling might be made before the presidential
election.</P>
      <P>There were lighthearted moments in the debate - a rare occurrence in Taiwanese
politics, but considered by some to be a good step toward democracy.</P>
      <P>Asked by the moderator if they could say anything nice about each other, Ma
said: "Frank Hsieh is very articulate, funny and humorous. He speaks good
Japanese... He is caring towards his wife... He's good at exercising and can
play the ceramic flute and the erhu (a Chinese string instrument)."</P>
      <P>Hsieh cited Ma's merits, including his administrative experience, his mild
temper and love for sports. Asked to name Ma's shortcomings, Hsieh said, "His
only shortcoming is that he has too many strong points."</P>
      <P>A second debate, scheduled for March 9, between Hsieh and Ma will adopt a
different format, with the two candidates responding to questions from the six
joint organizers of the two debates: the Central News Agency, the Public
Television Service, the China Times, the Liberty Times, the United Daily News
and the Apple Daily.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's presidential hopefuls Ma Ying-jeou and Frank Hsieh took time to praise
each other before trading barbs in the first of two crucial televised debates
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ma, candidate of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), and Hsieh, the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) candidate, were asked to name three
qualities of their rival in the debate, which was something they almost never
did since the campaign began last year.</P>
      <P>The debate included 20 pre-recorded questions in video format from citizens.</P>
      <P>"I can name more than three qualities of Mr. Hsieh, " Ma said, listing humor,
Japanese proficiency, communication skills,  and cooking as Hsieh's strengths.
Ma also said he admired Hsieh's achievement as a high school gymnast.</P>
      <P>Hsieh countered with humor: "The only weakness for Mr. Ma is that he has too
many strengths." He gave Ma high marks on his language skills, experience as a
public official, appearance and mild mannered personality.</P>
      <P>The atmosphere, however, changed dramatically after the first segment of the
event. Less than 10 minutes later in the question and answer period, both
candidates attacked each other over the issue of integrity.</P>
      <P>It was not easy to differentiate between Ma and Hsieh's platforms regarding
agriculture, same-sex marriages, culture, environmental protection and major
infrastructure construction projects, which were among various topics brought up
in the 20 questions from citizens.</P>
      <P>They had different views on how to stimulate the domestic economy, however, as
Ma advocated closer agricultural and trade exchanges, further opening in
regulation and market, and direct flights to China, while Hsieh held a more
cautious and conservative view.</P>
      <P>The debate was organized by the Central News Agency, the Public Television
Service Foundation and four local newspapers. The second debate is scheduled to

    <TEXT>
      <P>In an otherwise unexciting debate with no surprises, presidential hopefuls Ma
Ying-jeou and Frank Hsieh Sunday found themselves locked in close battle near
the end of the first of two televised debates when the two questioned each
other's integrity.</P>
      <P>As the candidate for Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , Hsieh fired the first
shot by saying his opponent from Kuomintang (KMT) had failed to realize many of
his campaign commitments during his eight- year term as the mayor of Taipei
City, from 1998-2006.</P>
      <P>Hsieh continued his attack by referring to Ma's rejections to previous charges
against him, including embezzling the special mayoral funds and having a U.S.
green card. Hsieh said Ma's words have been proven "unreliable and inconsistent"
on several occasions.</P>
      <P>"If a president-to-be cannot identify what he previously said about things such
as whether he had a U.S. 'green card', how can the people ever trust him?" Hsieh
said.</P>
      <P>Ma has been acquitted  by the Taiwan  High Court on the embezzlement charges. He
explained that he obtained the green card to apply for financial aid while he
was a student in the United States.</P>
      <P>Ma countered the attacks by challenging Hsieh's integrity as a government
leader, pointing out that several former officials under Hsieh 's administration
of Kaohsiung City, where he served as mayor, have been charged with corruption
charges.</P>
      <P>"How can Hsieh  be responsible  for the voters  when his administration was
shadowed by scandals?" Ma exclaimed.</P>
      <P>Ma  also  indicated  that  during  the  DPP's  eight-year administration, some
central and local governments were "collectively corrupt, " saying Hsieh was
purposely ignoring his and his party's wrongdoings.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, like Ma, rejected his opponents' accusations.</P>
      <P>Rejecting Ma's attacks, Hsieh said that many of the Kaohsiung officials involved
in corruption prosecutions were not convicted.</P>
      <P>"I have been very much straightforward in matters of personal morality and
policies,... while Ma is the only presidential candidate ever prosecuted in the
country's history," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Ma defended himself by saying that as the mayor of Taipei City, his policies
were often blocked by the DPP-ruled central government, and he has made no
wrongful use of the mayoral funds.</P>
      <P>"For eight years as mayor, none of my officials were prosecuted. As for the
charges against me, the legitimacy of those investigations was under scrutiny,"
he added.</P>
      <P>Responding to the green card dilemma, Ma strongly emphasized that neither him
nor his family members have valid green cards currently.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Presidential hopeful of Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Ma Ying-jeou
emphasized Sunday that he would never negotiate with China on unification and
independence during his term if elected, spending much of the a rare televised
debate defending his loyalty toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma, who has made such a pledge against negotiating with China before, reiterated
his stance in the first televised debate for the March 22 presidential election
when asked about Taiwan's national identity.</P>
      <P>He said that under his cross-Strait policy --no unification, no independence and
no warfare -- he will never talk about unification and independence with China
if elected.</P>
      <P>"I am Taiwanese, and I am a citizen of the Republic of China," Ma stressed.</P>
      <P>In the debate, Frank Hsieh of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party once again
tried to raise doubts about Ma's loyalty toward Taiwan, and Ma, who was born in
Hong Kong but was raised in Taiwan from the time he was a small child, once
again had to define where his heart lie.</P>
      <P>Ma said he is an upright and honest Taiwanese person and said he teaches his
offsprings that "Taiwan is our mother land," pointing out that he would want to
be buried in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I am a real Taiwanese who was raised on Taiwan's water and food," Ma said,
speaking in the Taiwanese dialect. In defense of his previous possession of a
U.S. green card -- an issue his opponent has frequently brought up in recent
days to raise doubts about his loyalty, Ma admitted that he once had a green
card when he was a student in the U.S., but later gave it up. He said he got the
green card to apply for student loans but relinquished his rights to longterm
U.S. residency when he moved back to Taiwan about 20 years ago.</P>
      <P>"It doesn't affect my recognition of and devotion for Taiwan," Ma claimed.</P>
      <P>In response  to Ma's claims,  Hsieh said Ma's stance was inconsistent and said
"I never hesitate to claim myself Taiwanese, and Taiwan is the place for me to
live steadily."</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, Ma claimed himself as "a new Taiwanese" only 10 years ago,
and then changed to "I am a Taiwanese, and also a Chinese" five years later.</P>
      <P>"I never have the trouble to define where I am from," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, however, suggested that everyone should adopt "a broader and a more
tolerant view of national identity, " adding that "one has to see himself not
only as a Taiwanese but also a citizen of the world."</P>
      <P>The debate organized by Taiwan's Central News Agency, the Public Television
Foundation and four local newspapers, was aimed at providing two hopefuls, Ma
and Hsieh a forum to give voters a better picture of how they would lead the
nation in the coming four years.</P>

      <P>A program to broadcast speeches by Taiwan's renowned scientists live on a
Website was launched Sunday by the National Science Council (NSC) with the aim
of fostering the public's, especially youngsters', interest in science.</P>
      <P>The program was made possible thanks to software developed by the National
Center for High-Performance Computing.</P>
      <P>The software, titled Co-Life, enables the speech delivered by master scientists
at the National Science Technology Museum in this port city in southern Taiwan
to be transmitted instantly around the island on the Internet.</P>
      <P>It was a milestone in the five-year-old program set up for students of senior
occupational high schools as well as their teachers and the general public with
the purpose of inspiring them to have an interest in and dedication to
scientific and technological development.</P>
      <P>People now are able to listen to and watch the speech via their computer as if
they were on the spot, according to Yang Hung-duen, NSC deputy minister who
presided over the inauguration of the Website broadcast in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Yang said the Website broadcast will provide easy access to these speech for
people in the remote areas on the island, especially students in eastern Taiwan
who are far away from the island's science hubs in southern and northern Taiwan,
and therefore have less access to educational resources.</P>
      <P>In order to showcase the benefits of the new system, Yang talked with Tsai Den-
mo, president of the National Taitung University in the eastern county of
Taitung through computers equipped with the Co-Life software during the
inauguration.</P>
      <P>Then the program broadcasted live on a Website a speech by Lien Chin-fa, a
professor of the Hsinchu-based National Tsing Hua University, about the charms
of language.</P>
      <P>Under the program, the organizers invite established scientists to give speeches
in various disciplines on specific weekends from the National Science and

    <TEXT>
      <P>In an otherwise unexciting debate with no surprises, presidential hopefuls Ma
Ying-jeou and Frank Hsieh Sunday found themselves locked in close battle near
the end of the first of two televised debates when the two questioned each
other's integrity.</P>
      <P>As the candidate for Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , Hsieh fired the first
shot by saying his opponent from Kuomintang (KMT) had failed to realize many of
his campaign commitments during his eight- year term as the mayor of Taipei
City, from 1998-2006.</P>
      <P>Hsieh continued his attack by referring to Ma's rejections to previous charges
against him, including embezzling the special mayoral funds and having a U.S.
green card. Hsieh said Ma's words have been proven "unreliable and inconsistent"
on several occasions.</P>
      <P>"If a president-to-be cannot identify what he previously said about things such
as whether he had a U.S. 'green card', how can the people ever trust him?" Hsieh
said.</P>
      <P>Ma has been acquitted  by the Taiwan  High Court on the embezzlement charges. He
explained that he obtained the green card to apply for financial aid while he
was a student in the United States.</P>
      <P>Ma countered the attacks by challenging Hsieh's integrity as a government
leader, pointing out that several former officials under Hsieh 's administration
of Kaohsiung City, where he served as mayor, have been charged with corruption
charges.</P>
      <P>"How can Hsieh  be responsible  for the voters  when his administration was
shadowed by scandals?" Ma exclaimed.</P>
      <P>Ma  also  indicated  that  during  the  DPP's  eight-year administration, some
central and local governments were "collectively corrupt, " saying Hsieh was
purposely ignoring his and his party's wrongdoings.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, like Ma, rejected his opponents' accusations.</P>
      <P>Rejecting Ma's attacks, Hsieh said that many of the Kaohsiung officials involved
in corruption prosecutions were not convicted.</P>
      <P>"I have been very much straightforward in matters of personal morality and
policies,... while Ma is the only presidential candidate ever prosecuted in the
country's history," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Ma defended himself by saying that as the mayor of Taipei City, his policies
were often blocked by the DPP-ruled central government, and he has made no
wrongful use of the mayoral funds.</P>
      <P>"For eight years as mayor, none of my officials were prosecuted. As for the
charges against me, the legitimacy of those investigations was under scrutiny,"
he added.</P>
      <P>Responding to the green card dilemma, Ma strongly emphasized that neither him
nor his family members have valid green cards currently.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No negotiations on unification and independence: KMT candidate</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Presidential hopeful of Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Ma Ying-jeou
emphasized Sunday that he would never negotiate with China on unification and
independence during his term if elected, spending much of the a rare televised
debate defending his loyalty toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma, who has made such a pledge against negotiating with China before, reiterated
his stance in the first televised debate for the March 22 presidential election
when asked about Taiwan's national identity.</P>
      <P>He said that under his cross-Strait policy --no unification, no independence and
no warfare -- he will never talk about unification and independence with China
if elected.</P>
      <P>"I am Taiwanese, and I am a citizen of the Republic of China," Ma stressed.</P>
      <P>In the debate, Frank Hsieh of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party once again
tried to raise doubts about Ma's loyalty toward Taiwan, and Ma, who was born in
Hong Kong but was raised in Taiwan from the time he was a small child, once
again had to define where his heart lie.</P>
      <P>Ma said he is an upright and honest Taiwanese person and said he teaches his
offsprings that "Taiwan is our mother land," pointing out that he would want to
be buried in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I am a real Taiwanese who was raised on Taiwan's water and food," Ma said,
speaking in the Taiwanese dialect. In defense of his previous possession of a
U.S. green card -- an issue his opponent has frequently brought up in recent
days to raise doubts about his loyalty, Ma admitted that he once had a green
card when he was a student in the U.S., but later gave it up. He said he got the
green card to apply for student loans but relinquished his rights to longterm
U.S. residency when he moved back to Taiwan about 20 years ago.</P>
      <P>"It doesn't affect my recognition of and devotion for Taiwan," Ma claimed.</P>
      <P>In response  to Ma's claims,  Hsieh said Ma's stance was inconsistent and said
"I never hesitate to claim myself Taiwanese, and Taiwan is the place for me to
live steadily."</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, Ma claimed himself as "a new Taiwanese" only 10 years ago,
and then changed to "I am a Taiwanese, and also a Chinese" five years later.</P>
      <P>"I never have the trouble to define where I am from," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, however, suggested that everyone should adopt "a broader and a more
tolerant view of national identity, " adding that "one has to see himself not
only as a Taiwanese but also a citizen of the world."</P>
      <P>The debate organized by Taiwan's Central News Agency, the Public Television
Foundation and four local newspapers, was aimed at providing two hopefuls, Ma
and Hsieh a forum to give voters a better picture of how they would lead the
nation in the coming four years.</P>

      <P>A program to broadcast speeches by Taiwan's renowned scientists live on a
Website was launched Sunday by the National Science Council (NSC) with the aim
of fostering the public's, especially youngsters', interest in science.</P>
      <P>The program was made possible thanks to software developed by the National
Center for High-Performance Computing.</P>
      <P>The software, titled Co-Life, enables the speech delivered by master scientists
at the National Science Technology Museum in this port city in southern Taiwan
to be transmitted instantly around the island on the Internet.</P>
      <P>It was a milestone in the five-year-old program set up for students of senior
occupational high schools as well as their teachers and the general public with
the purpose of inspiring them to have an interest in and dedication to
scientific and technological development.</P>
      <P>People now are able to listen to and watch the speech via their computer as if
they were on the spot, according to Yang Hung-duen, NSC deputy minister who
presided over the inauguration of the Website broadcast in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Yang said the Website broadcast will provide easy access to these speech for
people in the remote areas on the island, especially students in eastern Taiwan
who are far away from the island's science hubs in southern and northern Taiwan,
and therefore have less access to educational resources.</P>
      <P>In order to showcase the benefits of the new system, Yang talked with Tsai Den-
mo, president of the National Taitung University in the eastern county of
Taitung through computers equipped with the Co-Life software during the
inauguration.</P>
      <P>Then the program broadcasted live on a Website a speech by Lien Chin-fa, a
professor of the Hsinchu-based National Tsing Hua University, about the charms

      <P>Under the program, the organizers invite established scientists to give speeches
in various disciplines on specific weekends from the National Science and

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's presidential candidates spar off in first televised debate</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  24  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's presidential candidates Ma Ying-jeou and Frank Hsieh on Sunday tried to
point out each other's weaknesses in their first televised debate, with Ma
suggesting Hsieh's proposed tax cuts were inadequate and Hsieh raising further
questions about Ma's loyalty to the island.</P>
      <P>But both candidates presented similar positions on China -- agreeing it was
necessary to hold talks with Beijing, and pledging to allow direct charter
flights between Taiwan and the mainland within two or three months if elected.</P>
      <P>At the first of two head-to-head debates before the March 22 election, both
candidates agreed that it will be necessary to negotiate with China and have the
two sides call off their battle on the diplomatic front.</P>
      <P>Front runner Ma, from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , was adamant that China
must stop its attempts to suffocate Taiwan in the international arena,  while
Hsieh,  from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , stressed that the
ruling and opposition parties must remain united when negotiating with China
over this issue.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said charter flight services between Taiwan and mainland China could be
expanded to become weekly flights between multiple destinations on both sides of
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Ma said in addition to charter flights, he would push for the operation of
regular flights through cross-strait negotiation over air traffic rights. Ma
added that with direct transport links between the two sides, Taiwanese
entrepreneurs would not need to move their production bases to China.</P>
      <P>Both candidates agreed that any direct flight services should be based on the
premise that Taiwan's security would not be affected.</P>
      <P>During the two-hour and 45-minute debate, each candidate was asked to answer 20
questions from pre-recorded video tapes submitted by members of the public. The
selected questioners were allowed to ask follow-up questions at the debate. In
the second part of the debate, they were required to answer three questions from
each other, with the third part allowing each of them three minutes for a
conclusion.</P>
      <P>The questions covered a wide range of subjects, including relations with China,
the national economy, ways to protect Taiwan's farmers, education of the young
generation, and punishment for corrupt government officials.</P>
      <P>In response to public concerns that wages in Taiwan have failed to keep up with
inflation, Hsieh said he favored a reduction in income, sales and in inheritance
taxes as a solution.</P>
      <P>Ma, however, said tax cuts proposed by Hsieh was not enough.</P>
      <P>"Cutting taxes is not the best solution. Economic restrictions must be relaxed.
There must be direct transport links between the two sides of the Strait, in
order to attract foreign investment to Taiwan," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma, instead, called for increased public investment, salary raises and increased
consumer spending, plus relaxing restrictions on economic relations with China
to allow direct transportation between Taiwan and China, in order to attract
more foreign investment to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, however, criticizes Ma's proposal as deficit spending. "Vote for Ma Ying-
jeou, and each household will have to write Ma Ying-jeou aNT$400,000 bounced
check, " Hsieh said, referring to how much the deficit budget would cost each
household and emphasizing that Taiwan could not afford such spending.</P>
      <P>Ma said that his economic blueprint would allow Taiwan to maintain an economic
growth rate of at least 6 percent, increase the nation's per capita income to
US$20,000 by 2011 and US$30,000 by 2016, and keep the jobless rate below 3
percent. Hsieh said he would attach more importance to the purchasing power, and
that he would try to keep the real purchasing power for an average citizen at
around US$30,000 or even more per year.</P>
      <P>The two candidates also promised to increase financial aid to Taiwan's cultural
and creative industries and allow the outlying island chain Penghu, located
about 50 kilometers west of Taiwan proper, to set up gambling casinos with
appropriate safeguard measures.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who is trailing behind Ma in the opinion polls by up to 20 points
according to some polls, spent much of the debate attacking his opponent.</P>
      <P>He lost no opportunity to once again raise questions, as he's done recently,
about Ma once possessing permanent resident status in the United States --
suggesting lack of loyalty to Taiwan. But Ma explained that although he obtained
permanent residence to get a student loan when pursuing his graduate education
in the United States in the late 1970s, he gave up the status over 20 years ago
after returning to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma countered with a question that many of Hsieh's hand-picked officials were
indicted on charges of corruption, but Hsieh rebutted that being indicted does
not mean they are guilty, because the legal proceedings are not yet complete.
Hsieh reminded Ma that he himself was also indicted on charges of misusing his
special fees while serving as Taipei mayor.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court and the Taiwan High court both ruled that Ma is not
guilty of graft in 2007, but the prosecutors appealed the case to the Supreme
Court in January. Although the Supreme Court has not set a date for hearing the
case, it appears unlikely that a ruling might be made before the presidential
election.</P>
      <P>There were lighthearted moments in the debate - a rare occurrence in Taiwanese
politics, but considered by some to be a good step toward democracy.</P>
      <P>Asked by the moderator if they could say anything nice about each other, Ma
said: "Frank Hsieh is very articulate, funny and humorous. He speaks good
Japanese... He is caring towards his wife... He's good at exercising and can
play the ceramic flute and the erhu (a Chinese string instrument)."</P>
      <P>Hsieh cited Ma's merits, including his administrative experience, his mild
temper and love for sports. Asked to name Ma's shortcomings, Hsieh said, "His
only shortcoming is that he has too many strong points."</P>
      <P>A second debate, scheduled for March 9, between Hsieh and Ma will adopt a
different format, with the two candidates responding to questions from the six
joint organizers of the two debates: the Central News Agency, the Public
Television Service, the China Times, the Liberty Times, the United Daily News
and the Apple Daily.</P>

      <P>At least 2,200 supporters of Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang (KMT) presidential
candidate Ma Ying-jeou from the greater New York area are expected to return to
their home country next month to vote, a supporter source said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Ma supporters, from the states of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, are
expected to return to Taiwan in six groups beginning from March 14 for the
presidential election slated for March 22, said Chang Hsieh-hai, a chief

      <P>The number would be much greater than those who returned to Taiwan to cast their

      <P>Growing bilateral exchanges in the railway sectors represents avery healthy
relationshipbetween the United Kingdom and Taiwan, an official of the British
Trade &amp; Cultural Office (BTCO) said Monday at an international seminar in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>The BTCO Acting Director Charles Garrett said in opening remarks that the number
of British experts coming here continues to grow and this is the largest UK rail
delegation ever to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Garrett added that thisfurther prove[s] it really is a very healthy relationship
between Taiwan and the UK."</P>
      <P>The seminar titledUK Expertise in Railway Asset Management, Renewal and New
Projectswas held by the Taipei-based BTCO with over 120 guests from the UK and
Taiwan railway authorities, companies and academics in attendence to share
expertise and explore opportunities for further cooperation between the UK and
Taiwan railway industries.</P>
      <P>The railways of Taiwan and the UK share many similarities that is to provide
safe, reliable and essential public transport in crowded islands and both are
committed to the best days of the future,Garrett said.</P>
      <P>Ho Nuan-hsuan,  vice  minister  of Taiwans  Ministry  of Transportation and
Communication (MOTC), said the UKs railway system, including the London
Underground, has been in operation for well over 150 years. With this history,
Britain has developed long experience in railway maintenance and in using
resources to extend the life cycle of the system.</P>
      <P>Taiwan can be well placed to benefit from the UKs experience," Ho said, adding
thatthe MOTC will continue to work on the development and integration of all
track transportation systems to provide high service quality and effective
management.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese who plan to travel to Japan were warned Monday to steer clear of
China-produced caviar sold there that has been mislabeled as originating from
Russia.</P>
      <P>Liu Ching-fang, a division chief of the Cabinet-level Consumer Protection
Commission, urged local travelers to be careful when buying caviar in Japan and
not be fooled by the falsely labeled Chinese product.</P>
      <P>Liu's warning came after the economic division of the Taiwan representative
office in Japan notified the commission that two Japanese department store
chains -- Seibu Department Stores and SOGO Department Store Co. -- were found on
Feb. 7 to be marketing Chinese-produced caviar as Russian-made.</P>
      <P>Seibu and SOGO had reportedly delivered bottles of the mislabeled caviar as
year-end gifts to some 300 people across Japan between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31. The
two department stores did not check the origin of the caviar, sourced by the
Millennium Retailing Group for the two department stores.</P>
      <P>So far, 270 Japanese consumers have asked to have the product replaced,
complaining that "it tasted differently."</P>
      <P>The Millennium Retailing Group has made detailed reports to Japan's Fair Trade
Commission and offered an apology to Japanese consumers, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>Although the caviar is not sold in Taiwan, and there have not been any
indications that eating the China-made caviar could endanger one's health, Liu
said her commission still wanted to warn local travelers about the situation.</P>
      <P>In related news, officials from the Taipei City Department of Health said Monday
that a brand of frozen Chinese dumplings removed from the shelves of Taipei's
Pacific SOGO Department Store last month were found to be free of pesticides.</P>
      <P>The department said the distributor would still be fined, however, because the
China-made dumplings were labeled as Japanese made.</P>
      <P>The dumplings were removed from SOGO Department Store's Zhongxiao Branch in
Taipei because they were the same brand as those sold in Japan -- made by
Tianyuan Co. in Hebei Province -- that caused 2,000 Japanese in 46 prefectures
to fall ill last month.</P>
      <P>Taipei's health department said the dumplings removed from the retailer's
shelves here had different lot numbers and expiration dates than the
contaminated dumplings found in Japan, but still suspended their sale as a
precautionary measure.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan won't be able to develop itself into a world-class biotechnology giant
without much greater efforts by the government, private sector and scientists as
well as more investment, the head of the country's top research institution
Academia Sinica said Monday.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a lecture at National Cheng Kung University in Tainan, southern
Taiwan, Academia Sinica President Chi-Huey Wong said it takes concerted efforts
-- specialists' expertise plus research resources from the biological, medical,
engineering and even law fields --  before Taiwan can build a well-established
biotech industry.</P>
      <P>Wong said that compared to the global medical and pharmaceutical biotech market
-- a market valued around US$800 billion which could be a mammoth sector worth
US$2 trillion if all other industries related to health were combined -- Taiwan
basically "has no biotech industry at all" with its biotech industry
constituting only about 0.6 percent of the global market.</P>
      <P>Wong attributed Taiwan's "much-to-be-desired" biotech industry to several
disadvantages, including a relatively late start, limited resources for
development, lack of focus in research directions and insufficient research
scale. As a result, Wong said, Taiwan has been surpassed by China and India,
which have won business opportunities that could have been directed toward
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, nevertheless, should not feel dejected or discouraged because of these
set backs, given Taiwan's rich pool of talented people, Wong said.</P>
      <P>The number of patented products and inventions developed by Taiwanese people
ranks the fourth in the world and No. 1 if calculated by population ratio, Wong
said, calling Taiwan "a nation with great potential."</P>
      <P>To seize opportunities in the global biotech and health market, which is
expected to balloon to some US$5 trillion in five years, Wong said Taiwan needs
to correct some of the problems its industry faces and rapidly catch up.
Taiwan's biotech industrial development will begin to become fruitful in five
years if innovations and discoveries are expedited, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou on Monday praised
those Taiwanese who resisted Japan during the Sino-Japanese  War in 1937-1945,
telling an association of their family members that they "were models worth
admiring."</P>
      <P>At the same time Ma also said he felt deeply sorry for these Taiwanese heroes
who were treated unjustly during the authoritarian KMT regime's bloody crackdown
in the months following the 228 Incident in 1947 and during the "white terror"
during the 1950s and '60s when thousands were imprisoned or put to death without
cause.</P>
      <P>"If elected, I will do everything I can not to emphasize getting revenge or
complaining, but rather to build a nation that adheres to the rule of law and
respects human rights, " said Ma during his address to a meeting of the founders
of the association.</P>
      <P>He also hoped that the mistakes of history would not be repeated, and asserted
that could be achieved by recording history in textbooks to ensure that
following generations learn from it.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, Ma received the support of several association members who used
to maintain close ties with the pro-independence "pan-green camp" led by the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>They said that in the past they could not forgive the KMT's repression  of
relatives  from previous generations,  but were supporting Ma in recognition of
his efforts and as an expression of their hopes for a Ma administration.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma told Japanese reporters present at the event that he evaluated
issues through the prisms of human rights and the rule of law.</P>
      <P>Based on those standards, Ma said he saw the conduct of the Japanese in Taiwan's
history as "the same as that of the KMT in Taiwan's history and that of the
Communist Party in China, " calling human rights and the rule of law universal
principles.</P>
      <P>Anticipating that some Japanese reporters might brand him as being anti-Japanese
because of his attendance at the event, Ma stressed, "I have never been anti-
Japanese." He hoped that Taiwan and Japan would be friends forever and work with
each other to create a "win-win" future.</P>
      <P>Ma was described as "anti-Japanese" during his recent visits to Japan in July
2006 and last November due to his active participation in Taiwan's civil
"Defending Tiaoyutai" movement in the 1970s.</P>
      <P>The Tiaoyutais are a group of islets some 100 kilometers off Taiwan's northeast
coast and are claimed by Taiwan, China and Japan.</P>
      <P>At Monday's event, Ma reiterated the importance of the historical truth, but
urged those who made the history, including the Japanese, the KMT and the
Chinese Communist Party to maintain good relations with each other in the future
in efforts to encourage a long-lasting peace.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Many of those who asked questions at Sunday's televised presidential debate said
afterwards that they were not satisfied with the answers given by the two
candidates.</P>
      <P>They were disappointed by what they felt were evasive answers on important
issues from the candidates, Frank Hsieh of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) and Ma Ying-jeou of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Su Chien-ho --  one of the 20 Taiwanese  citizens  whose pre-recorded questions
were selected by the debate's organizers -- asked the candidates about their
platforms on human rights in Taiwan and the legal system.</P>
      <P>Both candidates stressed the importance of human rights and pointed out that
there is room for improvement for Taiwan's legal system, Su said, but they did
not specifically address their future policies.</P>
      <P>Su is a convicted murderer whose controversial death sentence is still under
review by the Taiwan High Court.</P>
      <P>Green Party Taiwan (GPT) Secretary-General Pan Han-shen asked the candidates
about Taiwan's participation in the Kyoto Protocol and how they would respond to
the expansion of highly polluting industries.</P>
      <P>Describing his question as "quite simple, " Pan said he simply wanted to know if
both candidates had the courage to say no to big companies that have heavily
polluted Taiwan's environment.</P>
      <P>"They both failed to respond to the question directly, " Pan lamented.</P>
      <P>Huang Chun-chen, a student from Penghu who asked Hsieh and Ma to name three
positive attributes of their opponent at the debate, said she felt they did not
show enough sincerity in complimenting each other.</P>
      <P>Wang Shu-chen, a social service worker who asked the candidates what they would
do to stem the decline of Taiwan's birth rate if elected in the March 22 polls,
said that while the question addressed a serious issue, Hsieh did not reply in a
serious manner.</P>
      <P>She said Hsieh was a more skillful debater than Ma, but Ma's answer was more
specific, and also noted that Ma's Web site provided a more detailed white paper
on the issue than Hsieh's. She concluded that Ma slightly outperformed Hsieh on
the topic.</P>
      <P>For his part, Lo Chao-hsun, a Taipei County resident who asked the candidates to
discuss their agricultural policies, declined to appraise the performance of the
candidates but applauded the efforts of the organizers to hold such a debate.</P>
      <P>Sunday's event marked the first time in Taiwan that local citizens directly
asked presidential candidates questions in a debate. In addition to the pre-
recorded questions, the selected citizens were allowed to pose a follow-up
question.</P>
      <P>In previous debates, questions for presidential candidates were asked by
organizers.</P>
      <P>The second presidential debate, scheduled for March 9, will adopt a different
format, with the two candidates responding to questions from the six joint
organizers of the two debates: the Central News Agency, the Public Television
Service, the China Times, the Liberty Times, the United Daily News, and the

    <HEADLINE>Opinion polls show Hsieh's approval ratings up slightly after debate</HEADLINE>

      <P>Approval ratings for Taiwan's presidential candidate Frank Hsieh rose slightly
following Sunday's debate between the ruling party's candidate and his rival,
front runner Ma Ying-jeou from the main opposition party.</P>
      <P>Ratings released by two major local dailies after Sunday's debate, however,
offered different public views on Ma's performance, with one showing he gained a
few percentage points while another showed his support had slipped by several
points.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News poll showed that support for the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) ticket of Hsieh and vice presidential candidate Su Tseng-chang rose
by 3 percentage points to 21 percent, while support for the Kuomintang (KMT)
ticket of Ma and Vincent Siew -- slipped by 7 percentage points to 49 percent,
compared to a poll conducted 10 days ago.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a poll carried out by the China Times showed that support for both
DPP and KMT tickets rose slightly, to 23 percent and 49 percent, respectively,
with a margin of error of 2.7 percent. Support for Hsieh went up by one
percentage point while that for Ma rose by two percentage points, according to
the poll.</P>
      <P>Hsieh told reporters Monday that he had expected to gain in approval ratings
after the first presidential debate for the March 22 election.</P>
      <P>He said that after the debate, voters have "a clear picture" of him and his
"consistent stance," unlike his rival Ma who is "shifting stance from time to
time."</P>
      <P>Debates generally help underdogs. Hsieh has been trailing far behind Ma in
opinion polls, and the debate did not appear to have helped him narrow the gap
by much.</P>
      <P>Hsieh spent much of the two-hour and 45 minute debate trying to point out flaws
in Ma, criticizing Ma's plan to revive the economy as deficit spending, and
raising doubts about his loyalty to Taiwan by again pointing out that Ma once
possessed a U.S. green card.</P>
      <P>Ma has said he got the green card to qualify for financial aid while he was
studying in the U.S. and gave up the green card after returning to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsieh on Monday again lashed out at Ma's economic blueprint for reviving
Taiwan's economy, in which Ma said he would help Taiwan achieve an economic
growth rate of at least 6 percent, increase the nation's per capita income to
U$20,000 by 2011 and US$30,000 by 2016, and keep the jobless rate below 3
percent.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said Ma was "being too rash" and warned Ma would be "bringing down the
economy," by aggravating the nation's deficit, worsening inflation and
increasing the tax burden for the public.</P>
      <P>Hsieh on Monday also attacked Ma's calls for investing around NT$4 trillion into
the economy, among which the government will spend NT$2.65 trillion and will
attract NT$1.3 trillion from the private sector. The money would be spent on 12
major infrastructure projects, according to Ma.</P>
      <P>Hsieh repeated what he said on Sunday that this will mean that each household
will have to write Ma a NT$400,000 bounced check.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Taiwan's annual budget is only between NT$1.5 trillion and
NT$1.6 trillion. Even if Ma can serve two terms with a budget of NT$12 trillion,
if the government spends about NT$2.6 trillion on the project, it will squeeze
budgets for national defense, social welfare and education, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>For his part, Ma said that he had explained his policy in Sunday's debates, and
will leave the details for related government agencies. He has on several
occasions criticized Hsieh's DPP party for causing Taiwan's economy to suffer
during its eight-year rule.</P>
      <P>Ma said that he has noted the poll changes after the debate, but will not "pay
special attention," because the polls are "short-term" and he will continue to
focus on campaign platforms that will be beneficial to the country.</P>
      <P>A second debate, scheduled for March 9, between Hsieh and Ma will adopt a
different format, with the two candidates responding to questions from the six
joint organizers of the two debates: the Central News Agency, the Public
Television Service, the China Times, the Liberty Times, the United Daily News
and the Apple Daily.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang urged the United States Monday to view
Taiwan as its constructive partner and provide incentives to boost bilateral
trade and exchanges at a time when relations are seen to be dangerously
drifting.</P>
      <P>"We hope that America can base its Taiwan policy on the conception of
'constructive partnership' underpinned by our shared belief in universal values
of democracy, freedom, and human rights as well as our common interests in peace
and stability in Asia, " Huang said in a keynote speech on the future of
U.S.-Taiwan relations at a seminar in Taipei.</P>
      <P>While he acknowledged that Taiwan's government should make more of an effort to
improve ties, Huang called on America "to provide incentives for both countries
to boost bilateral trades on the basis of Free Trade Agreement, to promote
exchanges in academic community and industries, and to encourage high-level
official visits."</P>
      <P>Huang's appeal comes at a time when relations between Washington and Taipei are
strained, as reflected in a Taiwan Policy Working Group report unveiled at the
seminar.</P>
      <P>The report, called "Strengthening Freedom in Asia: A Twenty-First Century Agenda
for the U.S.-Taiwan Partnership, " was prepared by the American Enterprise
Institute (AEI) and Armitage International, in collaboration with the Taiwan
Foundation for Democracy.</P>
      <P>Huang said he concurred with the report's observation that "frequent  official
contacts  are key to healthy  Taiwan-U.S. interaction."</P>
      <P>The report argues that the issue is urgent now that U.S.- Taiwan relations are
"dangerously drifting, " with Beijing using diplomatic isolation and the threat
of military force to pressure Taiwan into an unfavorable settlement and Taiwan
reacting by forcing intractable disputes to the front of the debate.</P>
      <P>"The win-win situation in Taiwan-U.S. relations lies in candid communication to
minimize misunderstanding and strengthen mutual trust, " Huang said, reiterating
what he said he told Stephen Young when Young took over as the director of the
American Institute in Taiwan in 2006.</P>
      <P>He said the absence of official ties between Taiwan and America should  not
become an obstacle  to establishing  an effective communication mechanism,
particularly on critical issues, and "direct contacts at the highest level will
be effective in minimizing misunderstanding."</P>
      <P>Although Washington has encouraged the promotion of democracy in Taiwan for the
past 20 years, it more recently has grown reserved and concerned about the
development of Taiwan-centered consciousness, Huang said, citing the countries'
differences over Taiwan's two referendums on Taiwan's United Nations membership
bid.</P>
      <P>Democracy in Taiwan and Taiwan-centered consciousness cannot be separated, Huang
said, because it would "not follow the logic of democracy -- that people are
free and entitled to speak and pursue happiness for themselves," he said.</P>
      <P>Echoing the report's description of Taiwan's democracy as a beacon to other
societies seeking peaceful political liberalization, Huang stressed that a
strong, thriving and prosperous Taiwan is a concrete manifestation of the
sustained success of the free and democratic system.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's democracy and its independent existence and development are therefore
an asset of America in the region," he said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Policy Working Group first convened in January 2007 to discus the
status of U.S.-Taiwan political, military, and economic relations.</P>
      <P>The working group's co-directors, Dan Blumenthal of AEI and Randall Schriver of
Armitage International, investigated areas in which a more positive and
productive agenda might be forged and provided advice to both the U.S. and
Taiwan government in promoting bilateral relations.</P>

      <P>: Standard &amp; Poor's Equity Research released Monday its "2008 Portfolio of
Greater China Picks, " comprising 25 stocks, with only two -- AU Optronics and
Chunghwa Telecom Ltd. -- being listed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to a report provided by the rating company to the Central News Agency,
the other 23 companies are listed in Hong Kong and consist of Hong Kong
companies, H-shares (China-based companies listed in Hong Kong) and Red Chips
that the rating company believes reflect the sectors of China's economy that are
expected to perform well in 2008.</P>
      <P>The rating company forecast that the 25 stocks will outperform others in their
respective sectors.</P>
      <P>The stocks chosen have at least a three-star rating, meaning investors should
hold onto the shares. The majority, however, had a four-star  (buy
recommendation)  or  five-star  (strong  buy recommendation) rating.</P>
      <P>The 23 Hong Kong-listed companies included Cheung Kong Holdings, Handerson Land
Development, China Mobile and the China Construction Bank.</P>
      <P>Standard &amp; Poor's Equity Research believes that with Greater China companies

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan cautious about joining UN's new group to fight climate change</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government reacted cautiously Monday on whether it would join the U.N.'s
newly-established group to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, participation in
which could pave the way for the island to join global efforts to fight climate
change, despite it not being a U.N. member.</P>
      <P>The group -- Climate Neutral Network (CN Net) -- unveiled last week at a meeting
in Monaco, aims to have not only countries, but cities and companies, share
successes about how to reduce carbon emissions so as to drastically cut
greenhouse gases emitted and spark a global transition to a low-carbon world.</P>
      <P>An official from the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) told
reporters Monday that the government needs to review all aspects of the issue,
particularly those involving sensitive relations between Taiwan and its rival
China, which objects to Taiwan joining global groups, namely those reserved for
nations.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwanese cities and companies file applications for CN Net, we cannot be
sure that they won't be classified as Chinese ones, " said the official,
referring to the fact that Taiwan, not a member of the U.N., is often regarded a
part of China under the U.N. system.</P>
      <P>He indicated that the EPA will relay all information to local governments and
private companies about the new U.N. group, but will advise against taking
immediate action.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs official also stressed that the government must
have a full assessment before deciding whether to join the group, which falls
under the U.N.'s Environment Programme (UNEP).</P>
      <P>"We don't want to see any political repercussion after formal application is
filed," he said.</P>
      <P>However, he said Taiwan's position and record on global warming are evident,
citing Taiwan's advocacy of a "Green APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation)"
and Taipei and Kaohsiung cities' membership in the group "Local Governments for
Sustainability."</P>
      <P>UNEP spokesperson Nick Nuttall told a CNA reporter last Friday that Taiwanese
cities and companies are welcomed to file applications to join the group,
indirectly ruling out the possibility of Taiwan's participation as a nation.</P>
      <P>Climate neutral refers to actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by in ways
such as planting trees, reducing fuel usage and adopting green energy, to
balance the global warming effect.</P>
      <P>So far, CN Net's members include four countries -- Costa Rica, Iceland, New
Zealand and Norway -- four cities, including Rizhao, a city in the eastern
Chinese province of Shandong, the Norwegian town of Arendal, the Swedish town of
Vaxjo and Canada's Vancouver, as well as five companies in Singapore, Brazil,
the United States, the United Kingdom and South Africa.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The suicide rate among the country's senior citizens is high relative to the
rest of the population and they are more determined to take their own lives, a
psychiatrist said in Tainan City Monday.</P>
      <P>Dr. Lin Chung-yi, director of the Psychiatry Department of Tainan City Hospital,
said of the 4,406 people who took their own lives in 2006, 884, or 20 percent,
were senior citizens aged 65 and above.</P>
      <P>The number is quite high considering that the elderly only account for 10
percent of the population, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the government, Lin said the two age brackets at
highest risk for suicide are those aged between 25 and 44, and senior citizens,
especially those aged above 85.</P>
      <P>One of the factors contributing to the higher suicide rate among senior citizens
is their 25 percent rate of success in taking their own lives, alarmingly high
compared to the 5 percent success rate for all age brackets and 0.5 percent for
people aged 24 and below, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Seniors who commit suicide "often resort to drastic means which result in a much
higher rate of success than people attempting suicide in other age groups,"
according to Lin.</P>
      <P>This indicates that seniors who attempt suicide are "more determined to carry
out their decisions, " and underlines the importance of mental health among the
elderly as the country's population ages, the psychiatrist said.</P>
      <P>Lin said that most senior citizens who ended their lives were suffering from
mental diseases, especially depression, which was responsible for 78 percent of
the suicide cases in 2006.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics from foreign countries,  Lin said senior citizens with
depression are 60 times more likely to commit suicide than their peers.</P>
      <P>In addition to their declining health and loss of financial support, social
status, and their spouses, senior citizens are vulnerable to the feelings of
social isolation, Lin said, and therefore especially needed the support of their
friends and family members.</P>
      <P>Lin reminded those with elderly family members to pay more attention to them and
provide them with sufficient material support.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Tsai Ming-shian took over as defense minister Monday, making him the first
defense chief to be appointed from the ranks of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Tsai took possession of the Ministry of National Defense's (MND's)  official
seal from his predecessor Lee Tien-yu at a changeover ceremony presided over by
Minister-without-portfolio Huang Hwui-jen.</P>
      <P>On behalf of President Chen Shui-bian, Huang lauded Lee for his dedication to
fulfilling his call of duty since assuming office last May, citing Lee's
achievements in promoting the restructuring of the nation's defense system,  the
reduction of armed forces,  and adjustments in troop deployments.</P>
      <P>Lee was also credited for organizing a rare show of the country's military
muscle in a National Day celebration rally last year and completing construction
of a new highway on the remote Taiping Island in the South China Sea, which can
be used as a runway for emergency relief operations.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Huang said, President Chen especially commended Lee for his
accomplishments in maintaining neutrality and keeping politics away from
military affairs, which compliments Taiwan's progress in democratization.</P>
      <P>During Monday's ceremony, Huang also conveyed President Chen's expectations for
Tsai, asking him to continue carrying out various military reform projects,
strengthen combat readiness and complete military buildup plans with a well-
rounded vision.</P>
      <P>The ceremony was attended by senior military officials, including Chief of the
General Staff Gen. Huo Shou-yeh and two deputy defense ministers, Ko Cheng-heng
and Lin Chen-yi, as well as top commenders of the three branches of service.</P>
      <P>At the end of the ceremony, Lee gave Tsai a hug and said: "Dear doctor, I hand
over the defense ministry to you, " before leaving the ministry.</P>
      <P>Lee, who assumed the post last May, resigned Saturday amid mounting controversy
over the establishment of a new defense company, named Taiwan Goal, in which the
MND was supposed to hold a 45 percent stake.</P>
      <P>"I deeply regret that the establishment of Taiwan Goal caused concerns and
doubts in various sectors and I hereby tender my resignation to take
responsibility for failing to smoothly carry out an order to establish an arms
company to boost development of the country's defense industry, " Lee said in a
brief statement posted on the MND Web site Saturday.</P>
      <P>Tsai, 67, who has a doctorate from the California Western School of Law, served
as a legislator for two terms and as a deputy representative to the United
States and as a deputy defense minister and as a deputy secretary-general of the
National Security Council.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND to allow as many servicemen to vote as possible: new chief</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Newly appointed Defense Minister Tsai Ming-shian said Monday that the ministry
will let as many military servicemen as possible exercise their right to vote in
the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>"We will do our best to ensure the voting rights of the public, " Tsai said, but
noted that some military personnel would have to remain at their posts to
safeguard national security.</P>
      <P>Tsai was responding to questions by Alex Fai, a caucus whip of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) in the legislature, on how many military servicemen would be
allowed to leave their posts to vote on election day.</P>
      <P>The KMT believes that the Ministry of National Defense barred an excessively
high number of servicemen from leaving their bases to vote on election day in
2004, one of the factors the party says contributed to its defeat by a razor-
thin margin.</P>
      <P>The KMT, which was entrenched in power for more than 50 years before 2000,
commands a strong support base in the military.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the ministry will act in line with past practice to allow
military personnel to exercise their voting rights, although "some definitely
will have to remain at their posts for the sake of national security.</P>
      <P>"The ratio of military personnel remaining at their posts will vary with each
military unit, and the MND will act according to the law," Tsai stressed.</P>
      <P>He pledged to get the prior consent of the KMT's legislative caucus on the
military's policy.</P>
      <P>Responding to questions about the disbanding of a controversial private arms
broker to handle Taiwan's military purchases, Tsai referred to Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung's pledges made Saturday.</P>
      <P>The premier, according to Tsai, said unequivocally that the government will not
invest "even one dime" in the firm, and that it will soon be disbanded, while
promising "everything will follow standard procedures governing companies."</P>
      <P>Tsai replaced Lee Tien-yu, who stepped down Saturday for not "properly" handling
the project. Tsai said he didn't know when asked if the arms firm, Taiwan Goal,
will change its name or operate clandestinely.</P>
      <P>But he said that if the government says "it will be disbanded, then it will be
disbanded."</P>
      <P>He also dismissed the possibility that it will reappear as a company with
another name.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmakers have questioned the "origins and lineup" of the company, charging
that "it was designed to evade the supervision of the Legislative Yuan."</P>
      <P>Although the MND has a 45 percent stake in the company and is its largest
shareholder, Lee reportedly said the ministry had no control over the company.
The remaining shares were mostly held by companies related to state-owned
enterprises.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Goal completed its registration with the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) on Jan. 28 as a private company, with capital of NT$1 billion (US$31.15
million) and paid-in capital totaling NT$80 million.</P>
      <P>Wu Nai-jen, a ruling Democratic Progressive Party heavyweight and head of China
Steel Machinery Corp. -- a subsidiary of the formerly state-owned China Steel
Corp. -- was listed as chairman of the company.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Goal is registered to deal in a variety of businesses, including the
import and export of arms and weaponry systems; sales of garments and
accessories,  industrial explosives,  precision instruments,  and batteries of
all types; and product design, according to the MOEA.</P>
      <P>According to information provided by the Executive Yuan, the company's capital
in its initial stage of operations will total NT$200 million. Of that amount,
NT$80 million has already been collected, including NT$50 million from China
Steel Machinery Corp. and NT$30 million from a subsidiary of Chunghwa Telecom.</P>
      <P>But NT$90 million from the Ministry of National Defense, which had planned to
hold 45 percent of the company's shares, and NT$30 million from the Yao Hua
Glass Co. -- a company under the Ministry of Economic Affairs -- had yet to be
deposited.</P>

      <P>Green Island officials urged environmental authorities Monday to help them
determine why massive numbers of fish have perished in recent months near the
islet located off Taiwan's southeastern coast.</P>
      <P>Residents on Green Island, also known as Lyudao, which is administered by the
Taitung County government, spotted large numbers of dead fish on the beach and
in waters off the coast two months ago.</P>
      <P>Dead fish carcasses have since been seen on a 3-4 kilometer-long stretch along
the islet's northern coast, and some are still floating in waters there,
officials of the Lyudao Township office said.</P>
      <P>Twenty-six different kinds of coral fish were among those that died, authorities
said.</P>
      <P>A report by the Penghu Marine Biology Research Center, which was commissioned to
investigate the mystery excluded a number of factors in the massive die-off,
including illegal fishing with explosives or electricity, and natural disasters
such as earthquakes and sea water temperature changes.</P>
      <P>The township office then sent dead fish samples to the Taiwan Agriculture
Chemicals and Toxic Substances Research Institute for a further check on
possible toxicity from pesticides used in the agricultural sector.</P>
      <P>However, tests found only small traces of some the 250 kinds of pesticides used
in Taiwan or cyanide in the fish, not enough to cause their deaths, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>The only oddity detected during the examination was that the fish had not eaten
for a period of time before they died because their stomachs were empty.</P>
      <P>Now the township office hopes environmental experts can join the investigation
to check whether the death was caused by waste dumped into the seas by
international freighters or merchant ships passing by the island, the officials
said.</P>

      <P>Many of the agricultural  policy prescriptions offered by Taiwan's two
presidential candidates in Sunday's debate have already been implemented,  a
high-ranking agricultural official said after the debate's conclusion.</P>
      <P>The two candidates -- Frank Hsieh of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) and Ma Ying-jeou of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) -- vowed to
increase the use of idle farm land, and Ma also promised to increase exports of
Taiwan's farm produce.</P>
      <P>Lee Chien-chuan, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA), said, however, that the council has been pushing to expand the exports of
Taiwanese farm products over the years, and described 2007 as a banner year.</P>
      <P>Citing local mangoes as an example, Lee explained that following three years of
negotiation, Australia agreed to allow the import of mangoes from Taiwan last
May.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time that Taiwanese fruit had entered Australia, which has
strict quarantine standards, Lee said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan exported more than 450 metric tons of mangoes to South Korea
last year, three times as much as the year before, while Japan imported over 450
metric tons of Taiwanese mangoes in 2007, with Japanese consumers rating
Taiwanese mangoes as their favorite fruit in an online poll.</P>
      <P>Lee also noted that some 8,500 metric tons of Taiwan-grown bananas were exported
in 2007, 87 percent more than the 4,533 metric tons registered in 2006.</P>
      <P>COA Chairman Su Jia-chyuan previously touted a project launched by the council
in 2006 to help increase the exports of local agricultural products.</P>
      <P>Under the project,  the council has successfully  exported butterfly orchids to
the United States, papayas and rice to Japan, and mangoes to New Zealand and
Chile, Su said.</P>
      <P>In the debate, Hsieh proposed to set up "farmland banks" to boost the use of
farmland, but the council already began promoting the establishment of such
banks in 2007.</P>
      <P>The banks, which have been set up in many cities and counties in Taiwan, serve
as platforms to offer legal and loan information to those who intend to rent,
buy, or sell farmland, according to Su last year.</P>
      <P>The banks will help the government save on subsidies for local fallow land,
which amount to NT$10.6 billion (US$337.8 million) every year, Su said.</P>

      <P>Dialogue between Taiwan and the United States should be strengthened with the
involvement of high-ranking officials, and Washington should keep its Taiwan
agenda separate from U.S.-China relations, said a visiting American consultant
Monday at a seminar.</P>
      <P>Randall Schriver, founding partner of Washington-based consulting firm Armitage
International, argued that a communication channel of high quality between the
U.S. and Taiwan needs to be a priority in searching for a strategy to meet the
interests of the two sides.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on the 21st century agenda for the U.S.-Taiwan
partnership, Schriver also hoped that with the election</P>
      <P>of a new president the U.S government could view the Taiwan issue</P>
      <P>independently, without making it a part of the U.S.-China agenda.</P>
      <P>"The new U.S. president needs to build up a better relationship with Taiwan
without hampering the relationship between the U.S. and China," Schriver said.</P>
      <P>Another speaker at the seminar, Dan Blumenthal, resident fellow of the American
Enterprise Institute, acknowledged Taiwan's desire to participate in more
international organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) or the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</P>
      <P>"Increasing Taiwan's international recognition and space" is really essential,
he said, and Schriver promised to encourage U.S. allies in ASEAN to strengthen
their relationship with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The foreign policy experts supported the idea of Taiwan holding direct talks
with China to gain more international space, but Foreign Affairs Minister James
Huang said that while Taiwan should be aware of such negotiations, it would have
to be very careful about not compromising on the issue of sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Looking back at direct contacts between Taiwan and China in the early 1990s,
Huang said that sovereignty was, and still is, the biggest obstacle in Taiwan-
China relations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, commending Taiwan's achievement in fighting against SARS in 2002-2003
as remarkable, Schriver further said that "we have to raise international
awareness of Taiwan to get Taiwan known to the globe."</P>
      <P>As for the future of Taiwan, Schriver stressed that every Taiwanese citizen had
to "make the decision by themselves about the future, " adding that the "people
of Taiwan should determine the future of Taiwan."</P>

      <P>A portable microscope developed by a Taiwanese company has attracted the
attention of 100 companies involved in the aviation field at an airshow in
Singapore that concluded Sunday, according to a company executive.</P>
      <P>The microscope, developed by Taipei-based Lumos Technology Co. to help precision
industries with maintenance and quality control, drew inquiries from many
manufacturers of aircraft and related components, including Boeing and Airbus,
said company president Yang Chi-yi.</P>
      <P>It took the company nearly three and a half years to develop the high-
resolution,  portable microscope, which helps manufacturers monitor production
lines and effectively help them repair and check products, Yang said.</P>
      <P>One of its main advantages is that it can be installed on digital cameras, the
executive said, because the camera makes it easier for companies to discuss the
quality of products with their clients or employees, and keep records.</P>
      <P>The company's portable microscope is already being used by major semiconductor
companies, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and United
Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) , as well as European automakers, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Defense ministries in the United Kingdom and Germany have also purchased the
product to help them repair or check their military equipment, Yang noted.</P>
      <P>Japanese companies are the company's main competition, but Yang said Lumos'
product costs only half of that offered by its rivals while the quality is the
same.</P>

Sunday's first of two battles between the two presidential candidates could
hardly be called a genuine debate.</P>
      <P>James Chan, president of the Taipei Society, comprised of university professors
and academic figures, said the society "was not satisfied with the format and
content" of the debate.</P>
      <P>During Sunday's two-hour and 45-minute debate, ruling Democratic Progressive
Party presidential candidate Frank Hsieh and his rival Ma Ying-jeou of the
Kuomintang were asked 20 questions in pre-recorded videos submitted by members
of the public. The selected questioners were allowed to ask follow-up questions
at the debate.</P>
      <P>In the second part of the debate, the two candidates were required to answer
three questions from each other, and in the final part, they each gave a three-
minute conclusion.</P>
      <P>"Sunday's debate can hardly be called a qualified presidential debate, " Chan
said, calling for a real one so that "the two candidates' views on major issues
will be clear to the voters."</P>
      <P>He cited as an example that the two candidates only touched lightly on the
issues of national identity and Taiwan-centric consciousness, but were not able
to elaborate their views in depth.</P>
      <P>After anticipating the presidential debate for a long time, Chan said the group
was very dissatisfied with the performance of both candidates.</P>
      <P>He said scholars will pool their strength and form an alliance on March 1 to

the eastern Taiwan county of Hualien really want an expressway built to link
Hualien with Suao in neighboring Yilan County, a member of the Hualien County
Council said Monday.</P>
      <P>Frank Hsieh, presidential candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party,
and opponent Ma Ying-jeou of the opposition Kuomintang tiptoed around whether
they supported the Suao-Hualien Expressway project in their first televised
debate, preferring to discuss development in the eastern part of the country.</P>
      <P>Noting that the debate over the controversial issue in past years has failed to
yield conclusive results, Lin suggested that the best way to solve the issue is
through a county-wide referendum.</P>
      <P>Lin said the county council would need to complete appropriate legislation first
before a referendum could take place. Two previous attempts -- one by the
current county council and another by the previous county council -- to pass
rules and regulations on local referendums were unsuccessful.</P>
      <P>The proposed 86-kilometer four-lane expressway project, mapped out by the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications in 1994, was approved by the
Cabinet in 1998. The expressway, with 40 km of tunnels and 37 km of bridges,
would be part of a planned 259-km freeway linking Suao to Taitung in
southeastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Construction was to begin in 2003 and be completed in eight years at a cost of
NT$93 billion, but was halted because of strong opposition from some local
groups who voiced environmental concerns.</P>
      <P>Supporters for the project have contended that mountainous Hualien County, which
is relatively underdeveloped compared with counties to its west, needs the
expressway to stimulate the local economy.</P>
      <P>The debate over the issue has continued since then with both the central and
local governments unable to resolve the issue.</P>
      <P>To allay the concerns of environmentalists, project planners have changed the
route of the expressway to minimize the impact on the local  ecology.  A
committee  of the Environmental  Protection Administration is expected to meet
after the March 22 presidential election  to assess the project's  impact on
Hualien County's environment.</P>
      <P>Hualien County is linked to Suao by a 87-km provincial highway expanded in the
1980s. It is often blocked by landslides during the typhoon and rainy seasons.
The county is also served by a railway between Hualien and Taipei, but
passengers often complain that tickets are hard to get.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA predicts no more drastic rise in commodity price</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 25 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R. L. Chen said Monday that the prices of
major commodities are unlikely to drop in the near future, but he also believed
that the chances of a new round of drastic price surges are also slim.</P>
      <P>Speaking prior to the Executive Yuan's meeting on stabilizing consumer prices
Wednesday, Chen said he has asked the ministry's offices abroad to collect
information on major commodities, such as the planted area of soybeans, wheat,
and corn, the harvest rates, the planted area of biomass crops, and weather
conditions around the world.</P>
      <P>The MOEA has also begun to collect information concerning the measures taken by
other countries in dealing with surging prices of major commodities and raw
materials, he said.</P>
      <P>"Judging from the present situation, the chances of a resurgence in the prices
of major commodities are slim, but it will also be difficult for their prices to
fall," he said.</P>
      <P>Soaring crude oil prices, higher transportation costs and weather factors have
all contributed to the price increases for major commodities.</P>
      <P>But if prices continue to soar, consumers will seek other alternative
materials,  and the free  market  mechanism  will automatically play a role in
balancing supply and demand, he said.</P>
      <P>The government, however, has taken some short-term measures to try and stabilize
the situation. Responding to reports that many local bakeries have been forced
to shut down because of the recent surge in wheat prices, Chen said that the
government has purchased large volumes of soybeans and wheat to help reduce
prices.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the ministry had also imposed a ban on exports of reinforced
steel bar, or rebar, and billets for three months. Because only limited volumes
of the steel products are exported, the effect of the ban was largely
psychological and is not expected to have a big impact on local rebar prices.</P>
      <P>Addressing another of the construction sector's concerns on the soaring price of
gravel, Chen said that after the ministry had adjusted the supply of gravel, its
price had stabilized.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan not to follow Hong Kong in raising H5N1 alert level: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  25 (CNA)
02/25/08  23:43:35
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) will not follow Hong Kong's move to raise the
bird flu alert level despite the confirmation of yet another H5N1-inflicted
human fatality in China, a disease control official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin Ting, deputy director of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control (CDC), made
the remarks after Hong Kong announced earlier in the day that stricter epidemic
control measures will be imposed on its borders with China for four weeks
effective immediately.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong authorities took the move as Chinese authorities confirmed that a 44
-year-old migrant worker died Monday in the southern province of Guangdong after
apparently catching the deadly H5N1 virus.</P>
      <P>It was the third H5N1-related human fatality reported in China so far this year.
The other two cases were recorded in Hunan and Guangxi provinces. All three
victims had been in close contact with poultry before becoming sick, according
to Chinese reports.</P>
      <P>Lin said it is indeed unusual that China has reported three H5N1 deaths in less
than two months since the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>As Hong Kong is adjacent to Haifeng, Guangdong where the latest H5N1 death
happened, it is understandable that Hong Kong authorities heightened the alert
level, Lin said.</P>
      <P>But asked whether the DOH would follow suit, Lin said the CDC had no such a plan
at the moment, noting that Taiwan and China are separated  by the Taiwan Strait
and available medical reports consistently show that all H5N1 human cases
involve close contact with poultry.</P>
      <P>"Another reason is that the World Health Organization has not yet confirmed that
the H5N1 virus has mutated into a strain that can be easily transferred from
poultry to humans," Lin added.</P>
      <P>Lin said the CDC will nonetheless continue monitoring the bird flu situation in
China closely and that fever screening stations at Taiwan's main gateways will
remain in place to facilitate early detection of any suspicious cases.</P>
      <P>No H5N1 cases in humans or poultry have been reported in Taiwan to date.</P>
      <P>Lin reminded local residents intending to visit China and Southeast Asian
countries for business or sightseeing purposes to be on guard against contact
with poultry and wild birds.</P>
      <P>"China- and Southeast Asia-bound travelers should also refrain from purchasing
poultry and wild bird products and not to eat raw poultry and eggs, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>He added that those who have fever or develop cold-like symptoms should seek
medical attention as soon as possible and brief medical professionals on their
travel itinerary and history of contact with poultry or wild birds.</P>

      <P>Government Information Office Minister Shieh Jyh-wey, who is in the United
States on a private visit to campaign and raise funds for the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) presidential  candidate Frank Hsieh,  lambasted the
oppostition Kuomintang (KMT) for failing to reflect on its past wrongdoings in a
speech here Sunday.</P>
      <P>Shieh said that issues related to transitional justice in Taiwan have yet been
dealt with as the 61st anniversary of the 2-28 Incident of 1947, in which
thousands of people were massacred by KMT troops, is approaching.</P>
      <P>Shieh is in the United States at the invitation of more than 20 pro-DPP
expatriate Taiwanese groups to deliver speeches in five U.S. cities. Los Angeles
is his third stop.</P>
      <P>Claiming that over the past few decades, the KMT has never truely repented for
the harm inflicted on individuals during its former authoritarian rule, Shieh
said "the KMT still owes an honest apology to the 2-28 Incident victims for
their pain and suffering."</P>
      <P>Regarding the DPP's attempt to take legal action to retrieve the ill-gotten
assets amassed by the KMT during its five decades of rule, Shieh said he does
not pin any hopes on the bid as "it is almost impossible, given that the KMT
controls an absolute majority, with 81, or nearly three-quarters of the 113
seats, in the legislature."</P>
      <P>Mentioning  that he was able to see the first  televised presidential election
debate between Frank Hsieh and his KMT rival Ma Ying-jeou, Shieh gave higer
marks to Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Shieh encouraged Taiwanese expatriates to donate funds to the DPP's
standard bearer and his running mate Su Tseng-chang, while urging expatriates to
"turn their passion for Taiwan into action," through returning to Taiwan to

      <P>A portable microscope developed by a Taiwanese company has attracted the
attention of 100 companies involved in the aviation field at an airshow in
Singapore that concluded Sunday, according to a company executive.</P>
      <P>The microscope, developed by Taipei-based Lumos Technology Co. to help precision
industries with maintenance and quality control, drew inquiries from many
manufacturers of aircraft and related components, including Boeing and Airbus,
said company president Yang Chi-yi.</P>
      <P>It took the company nearly three and a half years to develop the high-
resolution,  portable microscope, which helps manufacturers monitor production
lines and effectively help them repair and check products, Yang said.</P>
      <P>One of its main advantages is that it can be installed on digital cameras, the
executive said, because the camera makes it easier for companies to discuss the
quality of products with their clients or employees, and keep records.</P>
      <P>The company's portable microscope is already being used by major semiconductor
companies, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and United
Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) , as well as European automakers, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Defense ministries in the United Kingdom and Germany have also purchased the
product to help them repair or check their military equipment, Yang noted.</P>
      <P>Japanese companies are the company's main competition, but Yang said Lumos'
product costs only half of that offered by its rivals while the quality is the
same.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Solve expressway issue through referendum: Hualien County councilor</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hualien  County,  Feb.  25 (CNA)
02/26/08  13:17:03
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A referendum should be held to determine once and for all whether residents in
the eastern Taiwan county of Hualien really want an expressway built to link
Hualien with Suao in neighboring Yilan County, a member of the Hualien County
Council said Monday.</P>
      <P>Frank Hsieh, presidential candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party,
and opponent Ma Ying-jeou of the opposition Kuomintang tiptoed around whether
they supported the Suao-Hualien Expressway project in their first televised
debate, preferring to discuss development in the eastern part of the country.</P>
      <P>Noting that the debate over the controversial issue in past years has failed to
yield conclusive results, Lin suggested that the best way to solve the issue is
through a county-wide referendum.</P>
      <P>Lin said the county council would need to complete appropriate legislation first
before a referendum could take place. Two previous attempts -- one by the
current county council and another by the previous county council -- to pass
rules and regulations on local referendums were unsuccessful.</P>
      <P>The proposed 86-kilometer four-lane expressway project, mapped out by the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications in 1994, was approved by the
Cabinet in 1998. The expressway, with 40 km of tunnels and 37 km of bridges,
would be part of a planned 259-km freeway linking Suao to Taitung in
southeastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Construction was to begin in 2003 and be completed in eight years at a cost of
NT$93 billion, but was halted because of strong opposition from some local
groups who voiced environmental concerns.</P>
      <P>Supporters for the project have contended that mountainous Hualien County, which
is relatively underdeveloped compared with counties to its west, needs the
expressway to stimulate the local economy.</P>
      <P>The debate over the issue has continued since then with both the central and
local governments unable to resolve the issue.</P>
      <P>To allay the concerns of environmentalists, project planners have changed the
route of the expressway to minimize the impact on the local  ecology.  A
committee  of the Environmental  Protection Administration is expected to meet
after the March 22 presidential election  to assess the project's  impact on
Hualien County's environment.</P>
      <P>Hualien County is linked to Suao by a 87-km provincial highway expanded in the
1980s. It is often blocked by landslides during the typhoon and rainy seasons.
The county is also served by a railway between Hualien and Taipei, but
passengers often complain that tickets are hard to get.</P>

that the chances of a new round of drastic price surges are also slim.</P>
      <P>Speaking prior to the Executive Yuan's meeting on stabilizing consumer prices
Wednesday, Chen said he has asked the ministry's offices abroad to collect
information on major commodities, such as the planted area of soybeans, wheat,
and corn, the harvest rates, the planted area of biomass crops, and weather
conditions around the world.</P>
      <P>The MOEA has also begun to collect information concerning the measures taken by
other countries in dealing with surging prices of major commodities and raw
materials, he said.</P>
      <P>"Judging from the present situation, the chances of a resurgence in the prices
of major commodities are slim, but it will also be difficult for their prices to
fall," he said.</P>
      <P>Soaring crude oil prices, higher transportation costs and weather factors have
all contributed to the price increases for major commodities.</P>
      <P>But if prices continue to soar, consumers will seek other alternative
materials,  and the free  market  mechanism  will automatically play a role in
balancing supply and demand, he said.</P>
      <P>The government, however, has taken some short-term measures to try and stabilize
the situation. Responding to reports that many local bakeries have been forced
to shut down because of the recent surge in wheat prices, Chen said that the
government has purchased large volumes of soybeans and wheat to help reduce
prices.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the ministry had also imposed a ban on exports of reinforced
steel bar, or rebar, and billets for three months. Because only limited volumes
of the steel products are exported, the effect of the ban was largely
psychological and is not expected to have a big impact on local rebar prices.</P>
      <P>Addressing another of the construction sector's concerns on the soaring price of
gravel, Chen said that after the ministry had adjusted the supply of gravel, its
price had stabilized.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan not to follow Hong Kong in raising H5N1 alert level: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  25 (CNA)
02/26/08  13:23:42
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) will not follow Hong Kong's move to raise the
bird flu alert level despite the confirmation of yet another H5N1-inflicted
human fatality in China, a disease control official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin Ting, deputy director of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control (CDC), made
the remarks after Hong Kong announced earlier in the day that stricter epidemic
control measures will be imposed on its borders with China for four weeks
effective immediately.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong authorities took the move as Chinese authorities confirmed that a 44
-year-old migrant worker died Monday in the southern province of Guangdong after
apparently catching the deadly H5N1 virus.</P>
      <P>It was the third H5N1-related human fatality reported in China so far this year.
The other two cases were recorded in Hunan and Guangxi provinces. All three
victims had been in close contact with poultry before becoming sick, according
to Chinese reports.</P>
      <P>Lin said it is indeed unusual that China has reported three H5N1 deaths in less
than two months since the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>As Hong Kong is adjacent to Haifeng, Guangdong where the latest H5N1 death
happened, it is understandable that Hong Kong authorities heightened the alert
level, Lin said.</P>
      <P>But asked whether the DOH would follow suit, Lin said the CDC had no such a plan
at the moment, noting that Taiwan and China are separated  by the Taiwan Strait
and available medical reports consistently show that all H5N1 human cases
involve close contact with poultry.</P>
      <P>"Another reason is that the World Health Organization has not yet confirmed that
the H5N1 virus has mutated into a strain that can be easily transferred from
poultry to humans," Lin added.</P>
      <P>Lin said the CDC will nonetheless continue monitoring the bird flu situation in
China closely and that fever screening stations at Taiwan's main gateways will
remain in place to facilitate early detection of any suspicious cases.</P>
      <P>No H5N1 cases in humans or poultry have been reported in Taiwan to date.</P>
      <P>Lin reminded local residents intending to visit China and Southeast Asian
countries for business or sightseeing purposes to be on guard against contact
with poultry and wild birds.</P>
      <P>"China- and Southeast Asia-bound travelers should also refrain from purchasing
poultry and wild bird products and not to eat raw poultry and eggs, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>He added that those who have fever or develop cold-like symptoms should seek
medical attention as soon as possible and brief medical professionals on their
travel itinerary and history of contact with poultry or wild birds.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's special envoys were barred from attending  South Korean President Lee
Myung-bak's  inauguration ceremony due to obstruction from the Chinese

      <P>Both Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and National Security Council
Secretary-General Tan Sun Chen arrived in Seoul Sunday in preparation to
represent Taiwan at Lee's inauguration the following day, Huang said on the

      <P>"However, neither of them made it as China's top representative Tang Jiaxuan
threatened to pull out of the ceremony if the South Korean government allowed
them to attend," Huang said.</P>
      <P>For the sake of harmony, South Korean authorities expressed hope that Wang and
Chen stay away from the ceremony.</P>
      <P>"The incident was yet another stark reminder of the gravity and ubiquity of
China's diplomatic suppression of Taiwan," Huang said.</P>
      <P>During their stay in Seoul, Wang and Chen made extensive visits to South Korean
officials, parliamentarians, and prominent figures, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Lee, a former mayor of Seoul and former CEO of Hyundai Group, was sworn in
Monday as the Republic of Korea's (ROK's) 17th president and the first "CEO
president." As such, he is expected to govern with hard-headed pragmatism and a

Rising costs and their impact on people's ability to make ends meet dominated
the start of this year's parliamentary debate on the Government's Budget.

Many of the 19 Members of Parliament (MPs) who spoke during the five-hour

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei City residents live longer than others in the country because of their
healthier lifestyle, but the national health insurance program has increased
life expectancy in all parts of the country, a researcher at the non-profit
National Health Research Institute said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Reporting the results of a study comparing life expectancies in 365 villages and
townships around Taiwan 10 years before the program in 1995 and 10 years after
it was launched, Wen Chi-pang said the life expectancy of Taipei City citizens
had risen to 81.21 years, from 76.89 years in 1985.</P>
      <P>The life expectancy of all Taiwan residents had also been extended over that
time, gaining an average of 2.39 years for men and 2.78 years for women, in part
because of the national health insurance program, but Wen said stark regional
differences remained.</P>
      <P>The difference in life expectancy for Taipei City and Taitung County residents
was still more than 10 years, even though the gap had been narrowed slightly to
10.03 years from 10.65 years a decade before the program was implemented.</P>
      <P>"The study showed that the least healthy residents could not make use of the
national health insurance program to narrow the gap in life expectancy between
them and their healthier counterparts, " Wen said.</P>
      <P>"This has to do with such habits as smoking, drinking and betel nut chewing,
which are harmful to one's health," he contended.</P>
      <P>Medical resources can only contribute 10 percent to the life expectancy of the
public, while poor habits affect 60 percent of one's health, Wen said, with
smoking and betel nut chewing typical examples.</P>
      <P>In Taipei City, only 36 percent of men and 5.6 percent of women smoke,
significantly lower than the 51 percent of Taitung County's men and 15 percent
of Taitung County's women who smoke.</P>
      <P>Betel nut chewing  is also far more more popular in the southeastern county,
with 33 percent of the county's men and 20 percent of the county's women chewing
betel nut compared to only 6 percent of the men and 0.1 percent of the women in
Taipei City doing the same.</P>
      <P>"The national health insurance program has contributed more to women than to men
in raising life expectancy, mainly because there are fewer women than men who
smoke, drink or chew betel nut, " Wen said.</P>
      <P>"There are seven times more men than women who have such unhealthy habits," he
said.</P>
      <P>Based on the study's findings, Wen suggested that the insurance program focus
not only on "treating disease, " but also on spending more time and funding to
help people "not get sick, " saying such a strategy  would truly promote
national  health and avoid the squandering of medical resources.</P>

      <P>With fuel prices continuing to rise and fishery resources declining due to

      <P>According to the program, owners of licensed fishing boats may apply to the
local fishermen's association between May 1 and Oct. 31 to get NT$8,000 for each
sampan, NT$10,000 for each fishing raft, and up to NT$100,000 for a fishing
boat, depending on the vessel's tonnage.</P>
      <P>Recreational fishing boats are excluded from the program.</P>
      <P>To qualify for a subsidy, a fishing boat must have spent at least 90 working
days fishing at sea and at least 130 days sitting idle at a port from Sept. 1
last year through Aug. 31 this year.</P>

      <P>Canada's beef exporters are hoping to revive its beef exports to Taiwan to a
healthy level after a four-year ban stemming from mad cow disease hurt trade,
industry officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>The industry's Canada Beef Export Federation Taiwan Office, sponsored a beef
cuisine promotional event in Taichung City Monday in hopes of boosting beef
imports to the island.</P>
      <P>The event, launched by a hotel in that central Taiwan City, aims to promote
Canadian beef in Taiwan, which imported more than 3,000 tons of the red meat
annually until 2003, when the Taiwanese government imposed a ban due to the
occurrence of mad cow disease in Canada.</P>
      <P>Authorities in Taiwan lifted the ban last June, but annual import volume remain
far short of previous demand, reaching around 500 tons last year, according to
Ted Haney, president of the federation.</P>
      <P>Haney said he is confident of Canadian beef's quality and said he hopes that
with the promotion this year's imports of Canadian beef to Taiwan will reach
1,400 tons, or about 3 percent of Taiwan's market for beef imports, which is
dominated by Australian beef.</P>
      <P>Canadian beef had a nearly 6 percent marketshare before the import ban was
imposed in 2003.</P>
      <P>The event held at the Landis Taichung Hotel in Taichung City introduces beef
cuisines along with other typical Canadian dishes to customers.</P>
      <P>Those who attend the event will have a chance at winning prizes such as coupons
for a free guest room in Landis Hotels around the island.</P>
      <P>Taiwan started importing Canadian beef in 1994. In addition to locally produced
beef, Canadian beef also competes with beef imported from the United States,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan could be the first country in Asia that abolishes the death penalty,
ruing Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Describing the abolishment of capital punishment as the global trend, Hsieh said
that it will be "a matter of time" for Taiwan to abolish the death penalty.</P>
      <P>He added that the government  should launch  supplementary measures, including
life imprisonment, and encourage the public to discuss related issues in an
educational manner.</P>
      <P>He did not say whether or how he would work toward abolishing the death penalty
in Taiwan if elected.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also lauded Taiwan's government for having moved in the right direction to
minimize the execution of criminals in recent years.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years, no prisoner in Taiwan was put to death.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's remarks came in response to questions from Lin Hsin-yi, head of the
Taiwan Alliance to End the Death Penalty, during a meeting with groups
consisting of local lawyers and legal experts.</P>
      <P>The groups also invited Hsieh's rival, front-runner Ma Ying-jeou, of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) . Ma did not attend the event but promised to meet
the groups on another day.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Hsieh said that when he helped draft the DPP's action plans
22 years ago, he proposed the idea of abolishing the death penalty.</P>
      <P>Back then, such an issue was very controversial because there was no
supplementary measure to satisfy the sense of social justice, he explained.</P>
      <P>Besides the death penalty issue, Hsieh promised to use various occasions to help
promote several important judicial reform bills that the legislature has failed
to pass if he is elected in the March 22 polls.</P>
      <P>In a separate matter, Hsieh also said that he would respect the KMT, which
controls three-quarters of the 113 legislative seats, in choosing a candidate
for premiership.</P>
      <P>He added that if elected, he will form a coalition government across the
political spectrum.</P>
      <P>However, he pointed out that it would be impossible to amend the Constitution to
address the defects of the new legislative electoral system of "single
constituency, two votes" as the KMT dominates the legislature.</P>
      <P>The system, which allows only one seat per constituency area, is widely believed
to have favored the KMT in the Jan. 12 legislative elections, even though the
DPP pushed for it.</P>
      <P>Citing as an example of problems in the system, Hsieh said that on the Taiwan-
held outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu, only several thousand voters were
eligible to vote for one legislative seat in their constituency district, while
in other parts of Taiwan, tens of thousands of voters voted for one seat.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also vowed to promote legislation to establish a national human rights
commission if he wins the presidency.</P>

years in the fourth quarter of 2007, with many people expecting prices to fall,
according to results of a quarterly survey released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the poll conducted by the non-profit Institute for Physical
Planning and Information (IPPI), the composite housing price confidence index
stood at 83 in the fourth quarter, down from 88 in the previous quarter.</P>
      <P>The level was the lowest since the survey was first conducted in the second
quarter of 2002.  Chang Chin-o, a professor at National Chengchi University's
Department of Land Economics, said although both presidential candidates from
the ruling and opposition parties proposed increasing exchanges between Taiwan
and mainland China to give a boost to the domestic housing market up, the latest
survey's results indicate the proposal did not raise public confidence about
property values.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the confidence index for housing prices in the future was slightly
higher at 87. Confidence that property prices will rise in the near future,
however, stood at a low 78.</P>
      <P>The figures suggest that consumers are expecting housing prices to rise a year
later, but not in the next few months.</P>
      <P>The IPPI survey for the fourth quarter of 2007 also found that 63.1 percent of
the "home seekers" who are looking to buy a home expected housing prices to drop
in the near term, up from the level of 44.9 percent in the third quarter of
2007.  For the following year, 47.5 percent of home seekers expected prices to
fall, while 40.6 percent of homeowners held the same opinion.  Regarding the
financial burden on home buyers, the survey results indicate that the average
cost of housing in Taiwan in the fourth quarter of 2007 was equal to seven times
the average annual income of local people, down from the level of 7.2 times in
the previous quarter.</P>
      <P>In the capital city of Taipei, the average housing price in the fourth quarter
dropped to a level equal to 8.6 times the average annual income of the city
residents, from that of 9.9 times in the third quarter.</P>
      <P>Home buyers in the city expect to spend an average 36.5 percent of their
earnings on mortgage loans every month, down from 43.6 percent in the previous
quarter.</P>
      <P>Chang said the change does not mean that the financial condition of home buyers
has improved, but that rich people have bought more homes.</P>
      <P>The survey was carried out from Jan. 1-15 on the clients of 322 branches of 16
banks, 170 branches of nine major real estate brokerage companies and the Tsui
Ma Ma Foundation for Housing and Community Services.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,963 people responded to the survey with the margin of error at
three percentage points.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's currency appreciation seen as result of healthy economy</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26 (CNA)
02/26/08  19:49:09
(By Yeh Fang-hsun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The recent surge in Taiwan's currency relative to the United States greenback
reflects the country's strong economic fundamentals and could help dampen
inflation concerns, said Thomas Yeh, the vice-chairman of the Council on
Economic Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan dollar closed Tuesday at NT$31.21 against the U.S. dollar, according
to Taipei Forex Inc., and an intraday high of NT$31.12 was the highest level the
currency has reached against the greenback since being quoted at NT$31.102 on
May 6, 2005.</P>
      <P>The currency has risen more than 3.5 percent since the beginning of the year,
the most of any Asian currency outside Japan, but Yeh said recently it was the
result of a healthy economy rather than the infusion of "hot money" by
speculators.</P>
      <P>"The Taiwan dollar has not appreciated to its potential, gaining only 3.6
percent in the 10 years from 1997 to 2006, during which time average annual
economic growth stood at 4.38 percent, " Yeh said Monday.</P>
      <P>That pales compared to the appreciation of other Asian currencies during the
same period, with the Japanese yen and Korean won rising against the U.S. dollar
by 22 percent and 78.7 percent during that time.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's currency averaged NT$32.34 to the U.S. dollar in December 1997 after it
having averaged NT$27.5 for much of the year before the Asian financial crisis
took hold. It is not gone lower than NT$30 to the greenback since then.</P>
      <P>Yeh argued that a rising currency could benefit Taiwan's economy by stemming
inflation concerns among local manufacturers, some of whom rely heavily on
imported commodities.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's manufacturing-based economy could easily be squeezed by the
skyrocketing prices of international raw materials such as oil, " Yeh said, but
an appreciating currency could somewhat offset those "import inflation"
pressures.</P>
      <P>By making imported finished goods cheaper, a stronger Taiwan dollar could also
boost the buying power of local consumers, he said, a welcome jolt in an economy
where consumer confidence is lagging.</P>
      <P>While exporters fear the appreciating currency could hurt their competitiveness,
Yeh felt those concerns were exaggerated as the export sector remains strong.
Taiwan's trade surplus grew 28.4 percent in 2007 to US$27.38 billion.</P>
      <P>Another factor spurring the currency's rise is the prospect of closer economic
ties with China, regardless of who wins the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lee-rong Wang, director of the Center for Economic Forecasting under the Chung-
Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER) , said the Taiwan dollar has been
undervalued as investors have hesitating investing in local capital markets
because of restrictions on cross-Taiwan Strait economic activity.</P>
      <P>"(The appreciation of the currency) is about rebuilding investor confidence that
had been dampened by the tighter cross-strait economic policy," Wang contended.</P>
      <P>"The currency is now gaining ground thanks to the cross-strait policies that
have been proposed during the presidential campaign, " she said.</P>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party candidate Frank Hsieh and his opposition
Kuomintang rival Ma Ying-jeou have both pledged more open policies,  including
direct flights  to China,  to strengthen cross-strait economic ties.</P>
      <P>A better-than-expected growth rate of 5.7 percent in 2007 has also prompted
foreign companies to redirect capital into the local market, she said.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's stock market is flat for the year, the market's benchmark
index has risen about 10 percent in the past two weeks, with foreign investors
buying a net of NT$82.35 billion in shares in February, reflecting newfound
confidence in the local market.</P>
      <P>Other analysts believe Taiwan's interest rates are driving the currency higher.
The Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) raised interest rates to
3.375 percent in December for the 14th straight quarter, and they are now higher
than those in the United States, discouraging interest in the greenback.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan has done decent job in mangrove conservation: scholars</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With mangrove coverage having diminished by 20 percent globally from 1980 to
2005, Taiwan, bucking the trend, has done a decent job in mangrove conservation,
according to local experts and academics.</P>
      <P>A recent report released by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) under
the United Nations issued another warning about the rapid disappearance of
mangroves, which are important in terms of the ecosystem as they give shelter to
many kinds of organisms such as young shellfish and crabs, and protect coastal
biodiversity.</P>
      <P>According to the report, global mangrove coverage has diminished by 20 percent
from 1980 to 2005, which means a disappearance of 3.6 million hectares. In Asia
alone, mangroves have suffered a decrease of 1.9 million hectares in 25 years,
mainly due to high population pressure and changes in land use.</P>
      <P>The deforestation of mangroves may lead to severe losses of biodiversity and
livelihood, in addition to salt intrusion in coastal areas and siltation of
coral reefs, ports and shipping lanes, pointed out FAO Director Wulf Killmann.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, however, mangroves occupied an area of about 280 hectares 10 years
ago, a coverage that has remained stable, said Mei-li Hsueh,  a researcher from
the Endemic Species Research Institute located in central Taiwan, who added that
the stability has been the result of joint efforts by local governments and the
private sector.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's success is not total surprise. Mangroves in Taiwan suffered great
losses in the 1970s, with one species, bruguiera gymnorrhiza, disappearing
altogether due to reconstruction work at the port of Kaohsiung in the south of
the island.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, some non-governmental organizations have tried to prevent
mangrove areas from being eradicated because of industrial development. At least
four natural reserves for mangroves were designated by the government as natural
conservation zones -- in Guandu, Zhuwei and Bali in northern Taiwan, and in
Sicao in the south.</P>
      <P>Hsueh warned, however, that in addition to the human threat, "now mangroves and
other wetlands in Taiwan face another threat, which is the change of the natural
coastlines." Land subsidence and shifting coastlines  have become problems for
the stability of wetland ecosystems, she noted.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is ahead of many countries in the area of ecological evaluation before
restoration, " said Chen Zhang- po, a researcher at the Research Center for
Biodiversity under Academia Sinica, adding that in general, Taiwan has done a
decent job in protecting mangroves.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's conservation of biodiversity has changed its direction from specific
species to entire habitats in order to protect various species, which represents
real progress," said Hsueh.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President urges voters to back referendums on U.N. bid</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian called on local voters Tuesday to give strong backing
to two referendums on Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations that will be held
alongside the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The president said that petitions  backing the referendums collected a
significant number of signatures, and that the two votes should be given the
"same respect and have the same importance attached to them."</P>
      <P>One of the referendums, initiated by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) on joining the United Nations under the name "Taiwan, " garnered more than
2.7 million signatures. The other, launched by the Kuomintang (KMT) on returning
to the world body under the nation's official name, the Republic of China, or
any other practical name, solicited more than 1.5 million signatures.</P>
      <P>Saying that the referendum is a "major step toward cementing Taiwan's democracy,
" the president said that the passage of the referendum, be it the DPP's, the
KMT's, or both, "will definitely be the biggest triumph and achievement of
Taiwan's people."</P>
      <P>"If the voters split the votes, causing both referendums to fail, then it will
be a result that we least want to see, " he said.</P>
      <P>"It would also send a very wrong message to the world, leading the world to
think that Taiwan's people don't care about joining the United Nations and
safeguarding their own basic human rights, " the president said.</P>
      <P>It will be the third time referendums have been held since 2004. The previous
referendums failed because turnout fell below the 50 percent of eligible voters
required.</P>
      <P>Chen said that to prevent the two referendums from being defeated, he had sought
to work with the legislature to pass a resolution on a "third" referendum
proposal that could be accepted by all parties to ensure its success.</P>
      <P>Chen said he "was forced to give up the idea, " however, because of various
factors.</P>
      <P>The United States, one of Taiwan's strongest supporters, voiced strong
disapproval of the holding of the DPP-initiated referendum, calling it an
"unnecessary provocation, " which will not help the nation.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while attending an event outside the Presidential
Office to promote a procession backing the U.N. bid sponsored by the National
Cultural Association, U.N. for Taiwan Alliance and other civic groups.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the 13-day procession featuring statues of deities or people
dressed up as traditional deities parading around the island is scheduled to
kick off Feb. 29 in Keelung before concluding in Taipei County March 12.</P>
      <P>The procession will tour villages and townships with the goal of awakening or
rekindling the public's passion for the nation's U.N. bid.</P>
      <P>The president said that the campaign was inspired by a Matsu procession in front
of U.N. headquarters in New York prior to the opening of the U.N. General
Assembly last September.</P>
      <P>That event was organized by a group of Taiwanese expatriates supportive of
Taiwan's U.N. bid, and the scene "touched the heart of everyone who attended"
and attracted a lot of foreign media attention, said the president, who
described it as a "successful and significant campaign."</P>
      <P>After Matsu was returned to her temple in Taiwan, many temple officials said
they also wanted to contribute to the U.N. bid, so the National Cultural
Association planned the procession that begins on Friday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An exhibition of ancient Chinese art treasures on loan from Taiwan's National
Palace Museum (NPM) opened at the Kunsthistorisches Museum (KHM) in Vienna
Tuesday, offering Austrian art lovers an opportunity to admire the beauty and
richness of traditional Chinese culture and arts.</P>
      <P>Addressing a grand opening ceremony held the previous evening, KHM curator
Wilfried Seipel said Austria has overcome many political barriers to make the
exhibition a reality.</P>
      <P>The Chinese government was not happy about the event, Seipel acknowledged,
adding that he met with Chinese officials to convince them that the name of the
exhibition is in compliance with Austria's official "one China" policy.</P>
      <P>According to Seipel, the KHM originally hoped that the exhibition could feature
ancient Chinese art masterpieces from both sides of the Taiwan Strait, but that
plan did not come to fruition.</P>
      <P>With patience, Seipel said he believes that political fences and obstacles
between Taiwan and China will eventually be broken down by their common culture.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, NPM Director Lin Mun-lee said the Vienna
exhibition follows similar shows from the NPM treasury in major cities around
the world, including New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Paris,
Berlin and Bonn over the past decade.</P>
      <P>"Although the collection in this exhibition is not the largest the museum has
ever sent abroad, it is the most comprehensive, including masterpieces that
connect the 5,000 years of China's history and demonstrate the vitality and
fusion of Chinese culture, " Lin added.</P>
      <P>Among the precious items, 88 are ancient artifacts, 23 are paintings and
calligraphy and five are rare books and documents, Lin explained, adding that 55
of them have never left Taiwan before.</P>
      <P>One of the most famous is a scroll painting titled "Along the River on the
Chingming Festival." The 11-meter handscroll masterfully depicts life and
customs in China's Soong Dynasty capital, Bianjing -- today's Kaifeng.</P>
      <P>"The Vienna exhibition marks the first time the 270-year-old painting has ever
been shipped abroad," Lin said.</P>
      <P>It took four years to prepare for the exhibition, Lin went on, paying tribute to
her colleagues and Austrian counterparts for their strenuous efforts to make the
show possible.</P>
      <P>The exhibition is part of a cultural exchange project between Taiwan and
Austria. The first phase of the program was an exhibition of Great Habsburg
collectors masterpieces of the Baroque period that opened at the NPM last
October and closed Feb. 24.</P>
      <P>Austria is the fourth foreign country to engage in cultural exchanges with the
NPM, home to the best of the 1,000-year-old art collection of China's emperors.
The museum is often compared to leading Western institutions like the Louvre in
Paris and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, Belgium has also reached a consensus with the museum on a
collaborative exchange program. Belgium has followed the example of the other
countries in passing legislation to guarantee that none of the NPM's priceless
artworks will be impounded due to China's sovereignty claim over Taiwan, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>More  than 800 Austrian  politicians,  cultural  and media personalities as well
as Taiwanese expatriates attended the opening ceremony. Among them was Michael
Spindelegger, second president of the Austrian parliament, who has visited
Taiwan on many occasions.</P>
      <P>The opening ceremony began with Reysi, a Paiwan aboriginal singer, singing a
tribal ballad to an accompaniment of drumming. Her performance was followed by
Taiwanese folk songs and a classical music performance presented by Taipei
Philpharmonic Orchestra, led by violinist Su Hsien-ta.</P>
      <P>At the end of the show, Seipel said he had discovered a lot about the diversity
and vitality of Taiwanese culture and he expressed hope that the two museums can
maintain long-term cooperation.</P>

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh
claimed Tuesday that opposition Kuomintang (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-
jeou will push Taiwan into "de facto" unification status with China if elected
president.</P>
      <P>Hsieh was quoted by the DPP's International Affairs Department Director Hsiao
Bi-khim after meeting with Randy Schriver, former U.S. deputy assistant
secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs and founding partner of
Washington-based consulting firm Armitage International, and Dan Blumenthal, a
co-director of the Taiwan Policy Working Group under the American Enterprise
Institute (AEI), who visited Hsieh at his campaign headquarters earlier that
day.</P>
      <P>According to Hsiao, Hsieh said the March 22 presidential election will involve
voters' strategic values and therefore the results of the election will have a
big influence on the strategic balance in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Hsieh noted that the DPP has advocated closer ties with Asian and Pacific
nations, as well as with the United States, a policy that he said differs very
much from that of Ma, who calls for as close strategic ties with China as with
the United States and Japan.</P>
      <P>"It would be a tremendous change in Taiwan's diplomatic strategy, " Hsieh was
quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan is already an independent and sovereign country,  Hsieh
said Ma will push Taiwan into the status of unification with China through the
establishment of a common market and the mutual recognition of diplomas if he
wins the presidential election.</P>
      <P>"Once Taiwan and China are on the status  of `de facto' unification, it will not
be difficult for the KMT to seek `de jure' unification with China,  given their
absolute majority in the legislature," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Unlike the DPP's long-term policy of seeking to strengthen Taiwan's national
security, Ma has advocated his three noes policy -- no unification, no
independence and no use of force -- as his planned approach to China, Hsieh
said.</P>
      <P>Noting that it is China that refuses to renounce the use of force in dealing
with cross-Taiwan Strait problems and not Taiwan, Hsieh said Ma's abandoning of
the opportunity to boost Taiwan's security forces will cause a big impact on the
strategic balance in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Hsieh expressed concern over these issues, with his guests saying that America's
policy-making  sector and congressmen have also expressed similar concern.</P>
      <P>According to Hsiao, a Taiwan policy report written by the AEI, which includes
suggestions to Taiwan and the United States governments, has much in common with
Hsieh's points of view. Hsiao suggested that the DPP and the United States
promote mutual trust between the two countries, given their shared views.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Schriver told Hsieh that although the U.S. government has expressed
its opposition to the DPP's plan to hold a United Nations bid referendum
alongside the March 22 presidential election as it sees the movement as a step
toward Taiwan's de jure independence, that does not mean that the U.S.
government has specific affiliation with either of the two campaign rivals in
the election.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian called Tuesday for the establishment of a security
consultative meeting between Taiwan and the United States patterned on one
already in place between Japan and the United States, to help ease possible
misunderstandings.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he received Randall G. Schriver and Dan
Blumenthal, co-directors of the Taiwan Policy</P>
      <P>Working Group that was formed by the American Enterprise Institute</P>
      <P>(AEI) and Armitage International, an organization that assists</P>
      <P>companies in the global marketplace.</P>
      <P>The group recently released a report in which it suggested the upgrading of the
level of Taiwanese and U.S. officials allowed to visit each other's countries.</P>
      <P>The group also suggested the establishment of a bilateral meeting between Taiwan
and the United States patterned on the Japan-U.S. Security Consultative
Committee, or 2+2 meting, referring to regular meetings between the U.S. and
Japanese foreign and defense ministers. These kinds of meetings could help ease
bilateral misunderstandings and differences, and will also help resolve other
issues of mutual concern," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president said Taiwan and the United States used to have a good high-level
dialogue mechanism, especially between national security officials, and
Schriver, who has served as deputy assistant secretary for East Asia and Pacific
affairs, took part in such meetings.</P>
      <P>But the United States has adjusted its mindset and approach after Steve Young,
director of the American Institute in Taiwan's Taipei Office, assumed his post
in 2006, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>The United States seems to think bilateral dialogue conducted between Taiwan's
representative office and the AIT are enough, Chen went on.</P>
      <P>The AIT is authorized by the United States to handle bilateral relations in the
absence of formal diplomatic relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The president noted that although Japan and the United States have full
diplomatic relations, the security consultative committee still exists.</P>
      <P>Chen also noted that the report does not address the issue of sovereignty and
said it is an issue that cannot be avoided whether one talks about Taiwan-U.S.,
cross-Taiwan Strait or U.S.-China relations.</P>
      <P>He cited the example of Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization and
the United Nations, saying that sovereignty is involved in these issues, as it
involves the political, health and collective human rights of the Taiwanese
people.</P>

      <P>In March, National Geographic will lead its viewers on a discovery of Taiwan's
transgenic and fluorescent pigs, black bears, kungfu, fighting crickets and
conservation of the horseshoe crab, a "living fossil."</P>
      <P>The kungfu secrets show traces the story not only of kungfu in Taiwan, but also
of a man who can pull an airplane with his penis, while another of the shows
features the Formosan black bear, the largest terrestrial animal in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked why they chose the topic of fighting crickets -- called "black dragons" in
Taiwan -- Spanish director Jose Miguel Garcia Sanchez  and producer  Sunny Han
said they found  the custom interesting.</P>
      <P>"The two-year production in China and in Taiwan was not only a cultural exchange
for us, but also a discovery of the biodiversity in Taiwan. We didn't know there
were more than 3,000 kinds of crickets in the world, and more than 100 in
Taiwan," Han noted.</P>
      <P>Through the documentary films, "we want people to `think again,' echoing the
slogan of NGC, about what they think they already know concerning the modern
world," said Mindy Lee, the marketing director of NGC's Taiwan office.</P>
      <P>Started in 2003, the program has already showcased four shows in late 2005 on
Taiwan's cockroaches, butterflies, racing pigeons and local beliefs. A third
series is underway.</P>
      <P>Broadcast in 34 languages, the series of five films will begin March 2 on NGC in
English with a show titled Super Pigs, a documentary about Taiwanese pigs.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian predicted Tuesday that China will not lessen its
oppression of Taiwan, no matter who is elected as Taiwan's new president.</P>
      <P>Chen said China oppressed Taiwan on anything involving Taiwan's sovereignty, and
its oppression can be traced back to the tenure of former President Lee Teng-hui
of the now-opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while receiving Randall Schriver, founding partner of
Washington-based consulting firm Armitage International and Dan Blumenthal,
resident fellow with the American Enterprise Institute, at the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, China's pressure does not alter with regard to Taiwan's
different political parties.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan's special envoys -- Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng,
a KMT member,  and National Security  Council Secretary-General Tan Sun Chen, a
ruling Democratic Progressive Party member -- were both barred from attending
South Korean President Lee Myung-bak's inauguration ceremony due to pressure
from China.</P>
      <P>"As long as Taiwan insists on its sovereignty, regardless of who is the new
leader what new name the country has, China will not ease off its oppression on
Taiwan," Chen said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition legislators said Tuesday they were not convinced by Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung's assurance that the so-called private company Taiwan Goal, set up
with public funds to handle arms deals with other nations, will be wound up.</P>
      <P>Answering questions from lawmakmers at the legislature, the premier said the
government will stop public funds from being transferred to Taiwan Goal, thus
making it impossible for the company to operate.</P>
      <P>Chang said the government decided to call it quits on the establishment  of
Taiwan  Goal  because  internal  confidential information about the private
company had been exposed, causing the company to lose the trust of its business
partners in other countries and making it impossible for the company to serve
its purpose.</P>
      <P>Claiming that it is beyond the power of the Cabinet to dissolve the company,
Chang said the Taipei city government can disband Taiwan Goal because it has
jurisdiction over the company.</P>
      <P>The premier gave his assurance that there were no irregularities because no
further capital had been invested in the company and because Taiwan Goal had not
signed any contracts with foreign firms.</P>
      <P>However, Legislator Fai Hung-tai, a whip of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
legislative caucus, pointed out that Taiwan Goal was registered with the
Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of the Interior, not the Taipei
city government, and that the central government, as the major capital provider,
definitely has the right to disband the company.</P>
      <P>Data from the Ministry of Economic Affairs shows that Taiwan Goal was set up
with capital totaling NT$1 billion (US$31.15 million) and paid-in capital of
NT$80 million, with the Ministry of National Defense contributing 45 percent of
the investment.</P>
      <P>According to the Cabinet, the initial funding of NT$80 million has been
collected,  including NT$50 million from China Steel Machinery Corp. -- a
subsidiary of the former state-owned China Steel Corp. -- and NT$30 million from
a subsidiary of Chunghwa Telecom.</P>
      <P>Another KMT legislator, Lai Shyh-bao, said the premier should not have told a
"blatant lie" that the Cabinet has no power to disband the controversial
company.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan Goal is a 100 percent state-owned company.  Chang Chung-hsiung can
dissolve the company by uttering only one word," he said.</P>
      <P>"Chang's statement today shows there might still be some kind of trickery
involved," Lai said, adding that "it is unclear what tricks they have up their
sleeves."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said it is "ridiculous" that the premier
has stated that it is up to the Taipei city government to disband Taiwan Goal.</P>
      <P>Yang Hsiao-tung, a spokesman for the Taipei city government, said the central
government ought to "clean up its own mess."</P>
      <P>Taiwan Goal was set up by registering with the economics ministry in secret Jan.
28. Earlier, on Jan. 21, the company obtained permission from the interior
ministry to engage in the import and export  trade  of  weapons,  industrial
explosives,  precision instruments, batteries of all types, and garments and
accessories.</P>
      <P>The government claimed that Taiwan Goal was established according to law, saying
that the private company was necessary to help the nation procure weapons from
abroad and obtain foreign technology to help upgrade Taiwan's arms industry.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmakers, who hold more than two thirds of the seats in the new
legislature, believe Taiwan Goal was founded in an attempt to avoid legislative
supervision over arms deals with other countries.</P>
      <P>The controversy became so heated that Defense Minister Lee Tien-yu resigned Feb.
23 to take responsibility for being unable to carry out the plan of the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government.</P>
      <P>Wu Nai-jen, a veteran DPP member and head of China Steel Machinery Corp. who
serves as chairman of Taiwan Goal, said he will call a shareholders meeting to
discuss disbanding the company.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Tourism-related businesses in the outlying county of Penghu are increasingly
concerned that the recent cold snap which is the worst in three decades and has
dealt a heavy blow the island's fish farming industry over the past three weeks,
might take its toll on the tourism sector.</P>
      <P>According to local business sources, tourism-related businesses in the country
might be badly affected by the recent cold weather, which has killed a great
deal of aquatic produce raised by local aquaculturists and has damaged natural
marine resources.</P>
      <P>After extensive media reports about the serious damage that the Penghu's fish
farming sustained during the Lunar New Year holiday, it will now be harder for
the local tourism industry to attract tourists for the coming peak spring season
in the months ahead, the sources said.</P>
      <P>The negative impression that such reports have caused among the general public
might also have affected many tourists' will to visit the islands, famous for
seafood, according to the sources.</P>
      <P>Fish farming and tourism are the two main businesses on Penghu, lying some 50 km
west of Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>Worse yet, sluggish tourism might also affect other sectors on Penghu, the
sources indicated, adding that most local shops are pessimistic about business
in the coming months.</P>
      <P>Yeh Chu-lin, chairman of the Penghu tourism association, said that the central
and local governments should tell Taiwan's people that "tourists will be able to
enjoy seafood just as they have in the past if they visit Penghu now."</P>
      <P>"It is true that some species of Penghu's fish were killed off by the recent
cold weather, but some of Penghu's other speciality fishery produce, such as
deep-sea fish, have not been affected, " Yeh pointed out.</P>
      <P>Tsai Wan-sheng, director of Penghu's marine studies center, also said a few days
ago that the damage done by the cold to the county's aquaculture industry and
its marine ecosystem has not been as severe as reported.</P>
      <P>Chen Tien-shou,  deputy  director-general  of the Fisheries Administration
under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture, inspected Penghu Feb. 23 at the
head of 11-member group to explore ways to help the county recover from the
fisheries plight.</P>
      <P>Chen instructed Cheng Ming-yuan, the county's fishery bureau chief, to step up
efforts to make the public realize that "Penghu is not running out of high-end
seafood" so as to mitigate the possible impact on local tourism.</P>
      <P>According to initial estimates made last week by Penghu's aquaculture industry,
the county suffered monetary losses of more than NT$180 million (US$5.6 million)
as a result of the fish killed by the cold snap -- about 1,537 metric tons.</P>

      <P>The public has no need to be jittery about reports of a junior high school
student confirmed to be an infectious tuberculosis patient but who continued to
attend school, an official of the Department of Health (DOH) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Ting, deputy director of the DOH Centers for Disease Control, said Taiwan
reports between 15,000 and 16,000 new TB cases annually, so "it is not strange
that one of the cases happens to be a junior high school student."</P>
      <P>Lin pointed out that there is a standard procedure for dealing with TB cases and
that "the public has no need to panic."</P>
      <P>Lin said that the family members, classmates and teachers who have had close
contact with the infectious student will be given x-ray checkups.</P>
      <P>He noted that TB is curable, adding that 7,000 TB patients that are diagnosed as
infectious cases annually can undertake two-week treatment in hospitals and then
take medicine daily for nine months to be completely cured.</P>
      <P>He said that although TB can be transmitted through the air, its transmission is
not as fast as a cold or typhus and only those who have close contact can become
infected.</P>
      <P>If patients wear masks and not stay in enclosed spaces for too long, then the
disease can be prevented in over 80 percent of cases, he went on.</P>
      <P>Health officials of the Taipei city government said that day that the school
attended by the infectious student has conducted an urgent disinfection of the
premises.</P>
      <P>Health officials were sent to the school to explain the situation to the faculty
and the parents and to arrange for their checkups.</P>
      <P>The school said the student's class has 35 students and 11 teachers and added
that it will work with the health authorities to conduct related checkups.</P>

      <P>China bars its nationals from visiting Taiwan despite its offical claim that its
has resolved technical problems with Taiwan, a high-ranking Taiwanese official
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The official of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) made the remarks after
the China News Service quoted Dai Xiaofeng, director of the exchange bureau of
the Taiwan Affairs Office under the State Council, as saying earlier in the day
that Beijing's Cross-Strait Tourism Association has reached an agreement with
its Taiwanese counterpart on technical problems surrounding visits by Chinese
tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The MAC official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that it is the
Taiwanese government's policy to allow Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan, adding
that they can come either by plane or by boat.</P>
      <P>Noting that "it takes two to tango, " the official blamed China for  preventing
a  group  of  Chinese  tourists  aboard  the British-registered ocean liner
Rhapsody of the Seas from landing in Taiwan in late February.</P>
      <P>A total of 659 Chinese tourists arrived in the northern Taiwan port of Keelung
on the luxury ocean liner Feb. 11, after the MAC relaxed local regulations to
allow the entry of Chinese nationals on ships arriving from ports outside China.</P>
      <P>The anonymous official further said that if Dai agrees that Taiwan and China
have resolved the technical problems, then the Chinese government should "let
them come."</P>
      <P>"Political reasons should not become barriers to a policy that will favor both
sides," the official urged.</P>
      <P>Bilateral negotiations  over the issue of allowing Chinese tourists to visit
Taiwan came to a halt following a negotiation meeting held in Macao last August.</P>
      <P>Taipei has repeatedly asked Beijing to restart the negotiations, but has failed
to receive any response from China.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese elderly who live alone would like most to "go out for some fun" and
would also like to take the bullet train to Taipei to visit Taipei 101, one of
the highest skyscrapers in the world, according to a survey released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The survey on the dreams of elderly people living alone was conducted by Nan
Shan Life Insurance Co. and Taichung City's Hongdao Senior Citizen's Welfare
Foundation.</P>
      <P>The two organizations launched a campaign to express concern for elderly people
living alone late last year and asked old people living alone in Taipei,
Taichung, Chiayi and Kaohsiung cities to voice their dreams.</P>
      <P>Following "going out for fun" is "obtaining necessities related to their lives,"
such as gas cookers, clothes dryers, clothes, rice, artificial teeth and
bicycles.</P>
      <P>Rounding out the top five are good health and visits by family and friends, as
well as health of their family members, showing that the elderly are afraid of
loneliness and long for companionship, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Under the "show concern for the elderly" campaign, volunteers accompanied 23
elderly people living alone in Kaohsiung and Chiayi Tuesday on a trip on the
high speed railway to Taipei and a visit to Taipei 101. Some of the old people
also got the chance to ride the Maokong gondola, which served its 3 millionth
passenger Feb. 17 after its launch July 4, 2007.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by the Ministry of the Interior, the population
aged 65 and above totaled 2.33 million as of October 2007, among whom, 320,000

      <P>Only the people of Taiwan have the right to decide Taiwan's future, a visiting
former U.S. official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Randall Schriver, co-director of the Taiwan Policy Working Group established by
U.S. think tank the American Enterprise Institute and Armitage International, a
company that helps other companies enter global markets, made the remarks during
a meeting with President Chen Shui-bian at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Schriver is a former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific affairs.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Chen said he noticed that a report delivered by the working
group avoided Taiwan's sovereignty issue.</P>
      <P>However, Chen said discussions on relations between the United States, Taiwan
and China cannot avoid sovereignty issues and focus only on human rights issues.</P>
      <P>Chen further said the people of Taiwan have the right to enter the United
Nations  and the right to join the World Health Organization, describing these
rights as facets of human rights.</P>
      <P>These  rights  inevitably  involve  the issue  of Taiwan's sovereignty, he
pointed out.</P>
      <P>In response, Schriver, co-writer of the report, explained that the report did
touch upon Taiwan's sovereignty issue, but in a vague manner.</P>
      <P>However, the report indicates that "Taiwan's future political status is the
purview of the citizens of Taiwan, " Schriver said, adding that other people
have no right to make such a decision.</P>
      <P>Schriver said the U.S. has the obligation to defend Taiwan and that no matter
what happens in the future, it is hoped that China or other countries in the
region will not make any non-peaceful responses.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's future belongs to the people of Taiwan, Schriver went on, adding that
the U.S. will do its utmost to ensure this principle, which nevertheless does
not mean that the options for the future of Taiwan should be thus increased or
limited.</P>
      <P>Dan Blumenthal, the co-director of the working group who was also present at the
meeting, said Taiwan is facing a growing Chinese military threat and that Taiwan
remains a potential international flashpoint for conflict.</P>
      <P>The U.S. could be dragged into a military conflict between Taiwan and China,
Blumenthal noted.</P>
      <P>For this reason, it is very important to have high-level dialogue between Taipei
and Washington, said the former senior Pentagon official.</P>
      <P>Such a dialogue mechanism could help both sides effectively understand or
collaborate on military or diplomatic issues, he went on, adding that it is
necessary to restore the dialogue mechanism between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The lack of a high-level dialogue only puts Taiwan and the U.S. in unnecessary
danger, Blumenthal warned.</P>

the local tourism industry to attract tourists for the coming peak spring season
in the months ahead, the sources said.</P>
      <P>The negative impression that such reports have caused among the general public
might also have affected many tourists' will to visit the islands, famous for
seafood, according to the sources.</P>
      <P>Fish farming and tourism are the two main businesses on Penghu, lying some 50 km
west of Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>Worse yet, sluggish tourism might also affect other sectors on Penghu, the
sources indicated, adding that most local shops are pessimistic about business
in the coming months.</P>
      <P>Yeh Chu-lin, chairman of the Penghu tourism association, said that the central
and local governments should tell Taiwan's people that "tourists will be able to
enjoy seafood just as they have in the past if they visit Penghu now."</P>
      <P>"It is true that some species of Penghu's fish were killed off by the recent
cold weather, but some of Penghu's other speciality fishery produce, such as
deep-sea fish, have not been affected, " Yeh pointed out.</P>
      <P>Tsai Wan-sheng, director of Penghu's marine studies center, also said a few days
ago that the damage done by the cold to the county's aquaculture industry and
its marine ecosystem has not been as severe as reported.</P>
      <P>Chen Tien-shou,  deputy  director-general  of the Fisheries Administration
under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture, inspected Penghu Feb. 23 at the
head of 11-member group to explore ways to help the county recover from the
fisheries plight.</P>
      <P>Chen instructed Cheng Ming-yuan, the county's fishery bureau chief, to step up
efforts to make the public realize that "Penghu is not running out of high-end
seafood" so as to mitigate the possible impact on local tourism.</P>
      <P>According to initial estimates made last week by Penghu's aquaculture industry,
the county suffered monetary losses of more than NT$180 million (US$5.6 million)
as a result of the fish killed by the cold snap -- about 1,537 metric tons.</P>

      <P>The public has no need to be jittery about reports of a junior high school
student confirmed to be an infectious tuberculosis patient but who continued to
attend school, an official of the Department of Health (DOH) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Ting, deputy director of the DOH Centers for Disease Control, said Taiwan
reports between 15,000 and 16,000 new TB cases annually, so "it is not strange
that one of the cases happens to be a junior high school student."</P>
      <P>Lin pointed out that there is a standard procedure for dealing with TB cases and
that "the public has no need to panic."</P>
      <P>Lin said that the family members, classmates and teachers who have had close
contact with the infectious student will be given x-ray checkups.</P>
      <P>He noted that TB is curable, adding that 7,000 TB patients that are diagnosed as
infectious cases annually can undertake two-week treatment in hospitals and then
take medicine daily for nine months to be completely cured.</P>
      <P>He said that although TB can be transmitted through the air, its transmission is
not as fast as a cold or typhus and only those who have close contact can become
infected.</P>
      <P>If patients wear masks and not stay in enclosed spaces for too long, then the
disease can be prevented in over 80 percent of cases, he went on.</P>
      <P>Health officials of the Taipei city government said that day that the school
attended by the infectious student has conducted an urgent disinfection of the
premises.</P>
      <P>Health officials were sent to the school to explain the situation to the faculty
and the parents and to arrange for their checkups.</P>
      <P>The school said the student's class has 35 students and 11 teachers and added
that it will work with the health authorities to conduct related checkups.</P>

      <P>China bars its nationals from visiting Taiwan despite its offical claim that its
has resolved technical problems with Taiwan, a high-ranking Taiwanese official
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The official of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) made the remarks after
the China News Service quoted Dai Xiaofeng, director of the exchange bureau of
the Taiwan Affairs Office under the State Council, as saying earlier in the day
that Beijing's Cross-Strait Tourism Association has reached an agreement with
its Taiwanese counterpart on technical problems surrounding visits by Chinese
tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The MAC official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that it is the
Taiwanese government's policy to allow Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan, adding
that they can come either by plane or by boat.</P>
      <P>Noting that "it takes two to tango, " the official blamed China for  preventing
a  group  of  Chinese  tourists  aboard  the British-registered ocean liner
Rhapsody of the Seas from landing in Taiwan in late February.</P>
      <P>A total of 659 Chinese tourists arrived in the northern Taiwan port of Keelung
on the luxury ocean liner Feb. 11, after the MAC relaxed local regulations to
allow the entry of Chinese nationals on ships arriving from ports outside China.</P>
      <P>The anonymous official further said that if Dai agrees that Taiwan and China
have resolved the technical problems, then the Chinese government should "let
them come."</P>
      <P>"Political reasons should not become barriers to a policy that will favor both
sides," the official urged.</P>
      <P>Bilateral negotiations  over the issue of allowing Chinese tourists to visit
Taiwan came to a halt following a negotiation meeting held in Macao last August.</P>
      <P>Taipei has repeatedly asked Beijing to restart the negotiations, but has failed
to receive any response from China.</P>

so profit by what you say to him as to change his conduct. If you speak to a man
in parables, he will probably be pleased with your story; but the important
point is that he should apply the moral to himself."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice reiterated Tuesday Washington's
opposition to Taiwan's upcoming referendum on joining the United Nations under
the name "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Rice, who is currently on a visit to China, said during a news conference held
in Beijing that the issue was raised during her meeting with Chinese Minister of
Foreign Affairs Yang Jiechi.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Rice said, she reassured Beijing that Washington is
committed to a one-China policy, opposes unilateral changes in the Taiwan Strait
and expects a peaceful resolution of cross-strait differences.</P>
      <P>"I also reiterated what I said in December, that the United States opposes the
proposed referendum because we believe that this referendum would not be
constructive and would, in fact, serve no useful purpose, " Rice said, according
to a transcript of the news conference released by the U.S. Department of State.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on Taiwan's decision to go ahead with the referendum in the
face of U.S. opposition, Rice said that Taiwan is a democracy and "will have to
make its own decisions."</P>
      <P>"But I think we've been very clear that we think that this referendum is not
going to help anyone and, in fact, it shouldn't be held," she said.</P>
      <P>Rice also reiterated Washington's belief that the "best way forward is when
there is the prospect for peaceful resolution of differences across the Taiwan
Straits."</P>
      <P>The United States has encouraged dialogue between Taiwan and China to achieve
that, she said, doing so within the context of Washington's commitment to a one-
China policy and to a strong belief that no one should try and change the status
quo unilaterally.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet will further expand its subsidized education program for five-year-
olds over the next three years, with 93 percent of children in the age group
expected to benefit by 2011, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The measure is intended to reduce the financial burden of raising children and
hopefully act as an incentive to encourage couples to have more children and
reverse a declining birth rate, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Children from households earning less than NT$600,000 per year were eligible for
the program's subsidies starting with the 2007-2008 academic year, but
eligibility requirements will be relaxed further under the Cabinet's plan.</P>
      <P>Households with annual income below NT$800,000 will receive subsidies beginning
with the 2009-2010 academic year and those with incomes below NT$1.1 million can
receive subsidies starting with the 2011-2012 academic year, Chang said during a
weekly Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>Under the existing program, children from the targeted households can be
enrolled in public kindergartens free of charge or receive subsidies up to
NT$20,000 per year.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet proposal calls for the maximum subsidy to be raised to NT$60,000 per
year starting with the 2009-2010 academic year, Chang said.</P>
      <P>A total of 110,000 five-year-olds have benefited from the program in the
2007-2008 academic year, excluding the number of children enrolled in private
kindergartens who received education vouchers of NT$5,000 per semester, Chang
said.</P>
      <P>The government-subsidized education program and private-school voucher program
will together benefit an estimated 181,000 children in the 2011-2012 academic
year, he said.</P>

      <P>Japanese travelers in Taiwan will now be able to take the train with more
confidence of finding their way following the introduction of public address
announcements  in Japanese at the Taipei Railway Station.</P>
      <P>"This new service is expected to benefit as many as 21,000 passengers per month
who only understand Japanese but want to travel by train, " said Lee Young-shen,
the station master of Taipei Railway Station.</P>
      <P>Japanese travelers find traveling by train to be one of the best ways to get
around Taiwan, Lee said, but they often run into problems because of a lack of
information provided in their native language.</P>
      <P>"We decided to announce train information in Japanese because Japanese tourists
often got lost, either taking the wrong train or getting off at a wrong
destination," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Noting that 90,000 passengers pass through Taipei Railway Station every day,
which creates a maze-like atmosphere for people not familiar with it, Lee was
confident that the station's "multilingual services benefit travelers of other
nationalities."</P>
      <P>With the introduction of Japanese, the station now announces each train's
departure  time,  platform number,  train number,  and destinations in five
languages -- Mandarin Chinese, Taiwanese, Hakka, English and Japanese.</P>
      <P>"The station even reminds Japanese travelers of approaching trains in Japanese
for their safety," Lee added.</P>
      <P>Train delays are not yet part of the station's  Japanese repertoire, but the
station master said the service would be improved with time and had already
received plaudits from travelers.</P>
      <P>"Local passengers are supportive of this service and foreign travelers have also
thanked the station for providing it," Lee said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) also hopes in the future to strengthen
the language skills of train conductors, Lee said, to help overseas travelers
get around Taiwan more easily and take any uncertainty out of their train travel
plans.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials from the Council for Cultural Affairs  (CCA)  urged  the public
Wednesday  to help protect 2,000-year-old stone carvings and sculptures in the
Central Mountain Range that have recently been damaged by unidentified
individuals.</P>
      <P>CCA officials, who visited the site with members of the Kaohsiung County
Government last week to determine if it should be designated as a national
historic site, confirmed that the stone carvings had been damaged by traces of
fire and an industrial adhesive, which may have been used to help with stone
rubbings.</P>
      <P>The officials believed that fires were lit to burn away the 3.3-centimeter-thick
moss covering the images cut into the stone, located in a remote area of Maolin
Township, Kaohsiung County in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tsao Chia-wen, head of a preparatory office for the planned CCA Cultural Assets
Management Department, said he and his colleagues could not be certain if the
damage was made by members of an academic organization as reported by a media
outlet a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Tsao said instructions and warning signs will be posted at the entrance of the
Wanshan mountain area to remind people of the archaeological and cultural values
of the Wanshan stone carvings and the importance of protecting it.</P>
      <P>The series of images were first discovered by mountain climbers in 1972, and are
believed to have been carved by the Rukais, one of Taiwan's 12 mountain-residing
indigenous groups, up to 2,000 years ago.</P>
      <P>The 14 groups of carvings include images of human faces, geometric patterns
composed of circles, and hundred-pacer snakes, a traditional symbol of the Rukai
people and are seen as treasures of aboriginal culture and history.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung county government designated the site as a county historic site in
2006, but Tsao was unsure Wednesday if the site would be upgraded to a national
historic site.</P>
      <P>He said a CCA ad hoc committee especially established for the matter recently
will meet again soon to discuss  the site's archaeological, ethnic, artistic and
architectural significance.</P>
      <P>A resolution on the site's status is expected to be made in late March, Tsao
added.</P>
      <P>According to the CCA Cultural Assets Management Department preparatory office,
organizations or individuals who are interested in probing or taking impressions
of the Wanshan stone carvings should first apply with the Kaohsiung county
government for a permit before attempting to enter the mountain.</P>
      <P>The site does not offer easy access and can only be reached by crossing
mountains and rivers.</P>
      <P>Violators could face fines up to NT$1 million or jail terms under five years,
the officials said.</P>

      <P>The so-called "election charter flight services" idea is a new issue that needs
to be negotiated by authorities from Taiwan and China before it can be launched,
Taiwan's top China policy planner said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Chen Ming-tong said Taiwan needs to
renew its cross-strait charter flight talks with Beijing on the launch of such
services prior to and after the March 22 presidential election, as it is a
"newly emerged issue."</P>
      <P>Noting that talks on technical issues surrounding  general cross-strait charter
flights have all been completed by the air carriers themselves over the past two
years,  Chen said that "cross-strait election charter flights could be launched
tomorrow if renewed talks on the issue were completed today."</P>
      <P>He urged Beijing officials to return to the negotiating table as soon as
possible for political talks on cross-strait charter flights for passenger and
cargo services.</P>
      <P>He said China-based Taiwanese businessmen, known as taishang, could return to
Taiwan by direct air routes to vote if political talks on cross-strait charter
flights for passengers -- every weekend as proposed by the MAC -- are completed
soon, with less than a month to go before the presidential election.</P>
      <P>He added that the core of concern among taishang is actually the convenience in
travel across the strait on a constant and long-term basis, not just for the
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Describing passenger charter flight services as an important milestone in terms
of the opening of full direct cross-strait air links, Chen said that if
passenger charter flight services are implemented as a result of successful
cross-strait talks, direct cross-strait air links can be expected to kick off in
one year.</P>
      <P>According to a local media report, some 250,000 China-based taishang are
planning to return to Taiwan to vote in the presidential election.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has instructed government agencies to study an amnesty
for companies that have invested illegally in China, but which might exclude
enterprises involved in producing items there not permitted by the government, a
Cabinet official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan Secretary-General Chen Chin-jun said the amnesty policy would be
based on previous attempts to get companies that violated rules on investment in
China to register their investments.</P>
      <P>"The government has allowed those Taiwanese businesses  to register their China-
bound investment in 1993, 1997 and 2002, and the amnesty policy will be based on
the regulations set during those three registration periods, " said Chen Chin-
jun.</P>
      <P>He said the president issued the instructions after attending a gathering with
representatives of Taiwan's six major industrial and trade groups Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Looking to encourage domestic investment, the president hopes that before he
leaves office in May the plan will lure back to Taiwan enterprises that invested
in China without the permission of the government.</P>
      <P>Without the amnesty, companies in violation of local investment laws could be
subject to fines ranging from NT$50,000 to NT$25 million if they were to return
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)  Chairman Chen Ming-tung,  some
30,000 Taiwanese businessmen  registered their investments in China with the
government during the three previous registration periods.</P>
      <P>The council has previously said that businesses making products in China that
were not among the categories permitted by Taiwan's government would not be
eligible for amnesty.</P>
      <P>The MAC chairman said Wednesday, however, that his agency was studying possible
amnesty for these enterprises as well, but he would not offer a timetable for
when a decision would be made.</P>

      <P>The waiting period for migrant workers transferring employers will be greatly
shortened and the chances of their finding new employers will be increased based
on new standards that will come into force Friday, the Council of Labor Affairs
(CLA) announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The amended  standards  governing  foreign migrant  workers transferring jobs
will become effective Feb. 29, with several new regulations that are expected to
benefit migrant workers.</P>
      <P>The new standards state that as long as consensus is reached among the migrant
worker, the old and new employers, or between the new employer and a migrant
worker whose old contract has been discontinued because of faults on the part of
the old employer, the new employer can skip the step of registering with the
employment service center and apply for transfer of the migrant worker directly
to the CLA.</P>
      <P>"It will shorten the waiting time for migrant workers to find new employers, " a
CLA official said, adding that in order to increase the opportunities for
migrant workers to transfer to new employers, they can change their jobs from
one industry to another, from one region to another and their employment can be
continued by new employers who have a recruitment permit or are qualified to
hire migrant workers.</P>
      <P>According to the new standards, migrant workers will have up to 60 days, as
opposed to the original six weeks at most, to find new employers before having
to leave.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Employment and Vocational Training under the CLA has established a
Web site and database for migrant workers and employers to register and look for
related information at http://www.evta.gov.tw, as well as offering the telephone

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung named himself as convener of the Executive Yuan's
commodity price stabilization task force Wednesday and pledged to do his utmost
to deal with inflation.</P>
      <P>Chang made the announcement at a meeting of the task force, which he attended as
host for the first time since taking the helm of the Executive Yuan last May.
During the meeting,  he called for cooperation among the ruling and opposition
parties in addressing the tough challenge of soaring consumer prices.</P>
      <P>Chang took the job from Vice Premier Chiou I-jen, who was the previous task
force convener, as Taiwan is facing rising inflationary pressure due to soaring
core consumer prices, rising grain prices and commodity costs.</P>
      <P>Core consumer prices, which exclude vegetables, fruit and fish, as well as
energy costs, registered a year-on-year growth of 1.35 percent in 2007, the
highest level since 1997, attributed to skyrocketing grain prices on the
international market.</P>
      <P>The consumer price index has also been projected to rise by more than 3 percent
year-on-year in the first and second quarters of 2008 after the U.S. Department
of Agriculture predicted that global wheat stocks will drop to the lowest level
in 30 years, while Kazakhstan, one of the world's largest grain producers and
exporters, has announced a tariff tax on wheat exports, according to Executive
Yuan officials.</P>
      <P>Facing the impact of soaring international prices of major raw materials and
crude oil, a common consensus has been reached among relevant government
agencies that restrictions should be imposed on exports of goods and materials
crucial to people's livelihoods, the officials said,  noting the government's

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou has proposed his
national security policy platform, which is positioned at using wisdom rather
than strength to win opportunities for Taiwan's future development.</P>
      <P>Ma presented his proposal at a roundtable meeting on national defense that was
also an annual assembly of the National Security Improvement Association,
composed of retired military officers.</P>
      <P>Borrowing from ancient Chinese philosopher Meng Tzu, Ma said Taiwan, as a small
country, has to deal with big countries such as China with wisdom instead of
strength.</P>
      <P>Ma named his policy "SMART" and said it contains ideas for dealing with cross-
Taiwan Strait relations, including "Soft Power, " "Military Deterrence, "
"Assuring the Status Quo " and "Restoring Mutual Trust," plus the name of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma described "soft power" as developments in culture and the economy, saying
that efforts to turn Taiwan into an axis of trade and culture in Asia will lead
to an improvement in security and to China's lessening its military threat
against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that if elected, he will try to mend relations between Taiwan and the
United States, which he said have been harmed during the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's time in office.</P>
      <P>Ma said his defense policy will be governed by the principle of "defensive
strategy." Under this principle, he will convince America to sell F-16C/D
aircraft to Taiwan as soon as possible, improve facilities at seaports and
airports, and strengthen the development of anti-missile systems, Ma said.</P>
      <P>He also promised to make national defense expenditure no less that 3 percent of
Taiwan's gross domestic product and to continue to buy arms from the United
States.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he vowed to make Taiwan a nuclear-free country and not to allow the
development of offensive weapons, although he did not give his definition of
this term.</P>
      <P>The roundtable meeting, hosted by KMT Legislator Shuai Hua-ming, was also
attended by former Premier Tang Fei, former National Security Bureau Director
Ting Yu-chou, former Ambassador to South Africa Loh I-cheng, former Defense

      <P>The radioactive waste stored on Orchid island is safely contained and there are
no risks of harmful radioactive release, the Atomic Energy Council (AEC) said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>AEC officials said radioactivity monitoring on Orchid Island's storage site over
the years has also shown that the environment and ecology around the island, a
volcanic island off the southeastern coast of Taiwan, has not been affected.</P>
      <P>The officials were responding to reports following an examination by the state-
owned Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) that some barrels of low-level solidified
radioactive waste stored in trenches have been seriously corroded and that some
have burst.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that Taipower started the examination Dec. 13 and had
examined 696 barrels of radioactive waste from the first storage trench as of
Feb. 20.</P>
      <P>Among them, 34 barrels, or 4.88 percent, were seriously damaged, while 577
barrels were slightly damaged and 85 barrels needed to have corrosion removed
and be repainted.</P>
      <P>The seriously damaged barrels will be smashed and their contents repackaged,
they said.</P>
      <P>"Although some storage barrels have become corroded or misshapen, they have
remained in the sealed trenches and there is no risk of radioactive release,"
they said.</P>
      <P>Taipower officials also assured the public that there is no cause for alarm.</P>
      <P>The disposal site on Orchid Island mainly accepts low-level solidified
radioactive  waste from the medical,  agricultural, industrial and academic
sectors and from nuclear power plants.</P>
      <P>The site began to operate in May 1982 and stopped accepting additional nuclear
waste in April 1996. A total of 97,672 barrels are currently stored in 23
trenches on the island.</P>
      <P>With the high temperatures, humidity and salt air on the island, some storage
barrels had shown signs of corrosion and the AEC had asked Taipower to re-
examine them as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Taipower are looking for a final
disposal site under a statute governing the establishment of a final disposal
site for low-level radioactive waste.</P>
      <P>After the inauguration of the final site, the waste currently stored on Orchid
Island and at Taipower's three nuclear power plants will be relocated to the
final storage site.</P>
      <P>Reports by the Taipei-based China Times said Taipower have chosen four possible
sites -- Mutan township in Pingtung County, Tajen and Tawu townships in Taitung
County and Wanan township on Penghu -- to establish the final storage site.</P>
      <P>The first three townships  agreed to let Taipower conduct geological exploration
surveys, but as the law stipulates that the establishment of the site will
require the consent of county citizens through a local referendum and not just
the consent of township citizens,  Taipower  "dared not" conduct  the prior
geological exploration, the reports said.</P>
      <P>Although Taipower has set its sights on Wanan township on Penghu, the county
magistrate, councilors and village chief have all voiced vehement opposition to
the plan, according to the reports.</P>

      <P>The center's scientists will study the unique nature of Taiwan's coral reefs,
which are found mostly in southern Taiwan, as well as off its outlying islands.</P>
      <P>"Alternate current movements in the western Pacific make the living  conditions
of Taiwan's  coral reefs better than many countries, " Fan Tong-yun, one of the
Taiwanese researchers in the team noted, saying that was a key reason why the
research center was set up.</P>
      <P>Waters off southern Taiwan's coast, such as near Kenting, have a much higher
coral cover rate -- 40 percent -- than the average rate of 20 percent in the
Indian and Pacific Oceans.  The phenomenon of coral bleaching, which turns the
normally colorful corals into a dull pale hue, is also less serious here.</P>
      <P>Coral bleaching is suspected to be caused by rising water temperatures and
pollution as a result of global warming.</P>
      <P>According to Fan, coral reefs all over the world, especially those in popular
tourist destinations such as Hawaii, Tahiti and the Caribbean Sea, have
seriously suffered in 2007 from coral bleaching.</P>
      <P>But coral reefs in the sea off Kenting city in southernmost tip of Taiwan has
escaped from the problem because there was an upwelling current in the sea,
which prevented the sea temperature from rising too much, Fan said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's know-how in coral conservation is ahead of many countries' in the
world, " said Fan, from the marine biology museum, whose experts are also part
of the team forming the coral reef center.</P>
      <P>"It may even be Noah's Ark of corals, " Fan said. "But to reach that conclusion,
we need to raise research on an international scale."</P>
      <P>Experts from the coral research center will also study coral reefs in other
parts of the world.</P>
      <P>The center's researchers will focus their research on the movement of the
currents and their influence on coral reefs, as well as coral ecosystems and the
symbiosis system between algae and coral reefs.</P>

      <P>The government is closely watching the situation surrounding skyrocketing steel
prices, a ranking Cabinet official said Wednesday, as local builders plan to
strike to vent anger over the problem.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun, secretary-general of the Executive Yuan, said the government is
paying close attention to the recent hikes in prices of steel products,
particularly round steel bars or rebars, in the domestic market.</P>
      <P>The government does not want to see an interruption in public construction
projects  and  a compromise  of the quality  of construction,  Chen said,
responding to a reporter's question regarding a strike planned by the Taiwan
Association of General Contractors.</P>
      <P>The association is planning to hold a three-day strike beginning on March 11 to
protest steel prices.</P>
      <P>The average price of rebars has surged from NT$8,000 (US$258) per ton two months
ago to slightly over NT$20,000 per ton currently.</P>
      <P>In light of the outcry from the domestic real estate development industry, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) on Feb. 20 announced a ban on the export of
rebars and small billets -- the main material used for the production of rebars
for construction.</P>
      <P>The ban is expected to last three months after it takes effect in two weeks.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ministry will also put exports of H-shaped steel and steel scrap
under supervision for three months.</P>
      <P>Lai Cheng-yi, chairman of the Shining Group, which is known for building high-
priced houses and resorts, complained earlier this month that builders cannot
buy steel rebars even if they have money.</P>
      <P>Lai expressed hope that the administration will investigate the surging prices
and warned that public construction projects and private developers will be
forced to suspend operations should the government not intervene in time.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation has received the green
light to set up a Tzu Chi Charity Foundation in China, Chinese authorities
confirmed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Answering questions at a regular press briefing, Fan Liqing, spokeswoman for the
Taiwan Affairs Office of China's State Council, said the Ministry of Civil
Affairs had formally approved the application by Tzu Chi to establish the
charity foundation in China.</P>
      <P>The new organization is the first foundation chaired by a legal representative
who is a non-resident of the mainland, Fan said, adding that the foundation will
fall under the jurisdiction of the State Bureau of Religious Affairs.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the foundation is expected to play an active role in
promoting cross-Taiwan  Strait exchanges in charitable affairs, she said.</P>
      <P>The Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, founded by Master Cheng Yen,
a nun, in 1966, is one of Taiwan's four major Buddhist sects, with its head
office located in Hualien, eastern Taiwan. It is actively involved in social
services, medical care and education, and disaster relief around the world.</P>
      <P>Tzu Chi is funded by donations from the private sector, and its workers are
mostly volunteers. Currently Tzu Chi has offices in 40 countries.</P>
      <P>The organization's first contact with mainland China was in 1990 when the
central and eastern regions were devastated by serious flooding. Tzu Chi's
relief programs helped flood victims in Henan province with NT$13.6 million in
timely aid, built 945 housing units for homeless flood victims in Anhui province
in 1991, and constructed 1,530 housing units for displaced families in Jiangsu
province in 1992.</P>
      <P>Since then, Tzu Chi's relief work in China has expanded to cover 17 provinces
and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Wednesday that it was "unwise" for
China to pressure South Korea to bar him from attending South Korean President
Lee Myung-bak's inauguration ceremony.</P>
      <P>The "oppression and obstruction are very unwise, " Wang told reporters.
"Because  of that,  Taiwanese  people feel China's intentional obstruction
everywhere."</P>
      <P>Beijing's oppression has also created a subject for international criticism,
Wang added.</P>
      <P>Wang returned from South Korea Tuesday after he and National Security Council
Secretary-General Tan Sun Chen, upon arriving in Seoul Sunday, were told to stay
away from the Monday inauguration after China's top representative Tang Jiaxuan
threatened to pull out of the ceremony if the Seoul allowed Taiwan's envoys to
attend.</P>
      <P>Wang said he had not expected he would be barred from that event. He said he was
informed officially last Friday that he may start preparing his trip to Seoul,
leading him to embark on the trip.</P>
      <P>In the past, Wang said it was not possible for him to visit the neighboring
country because of Seoul's denying to grant him a visa, even when he applied to
visit his South Korean counterpart.</P>
      <P>Wang advised China to act to "let Taiwanese people feel (its) warmth and
friendliness" because that will facilitate interactions and exchanges between
the two sides.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the legislative speaker suggested Taiwan and South Korea seek to
maintain and promote their exchanges, communications and cooperation through the
channel of both countries' legislatures in the absence of diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Despite being rejected from the presidential inauguration, Wang and Chen made
extensive  visits  to South  Korean  officials, parliamentarians and prominent
figures during their stay in Seoul.</P>
      <P>Wang was speaking Wednesday while responding to media inquiries about the recent
incident before he prepared to give a speech on the topic of "congressional
diplomacy" at the Diplomat Training Institute under the Ministry of Foreign

      <P>Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng vowed Wednesday to strengthen vocational
education and expressed hope that students can discover their talents and live
happily thanks to vocational education.</P>
      <P>Tu made the promise during a citation ceremony in honor of technical
professionals  involved with vocational education and training programs in
cooperation with the Ministry of Education (MOE) for more than 15 years.</P>
      <P>"Society attaches too much importance to diplomas and ignores students who have
difficulty gaining access to academic institutions but who have technical
skills," Tu said.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that the public will show much more respect to teachers and
professionals dedicated to vocational education and training in order to deepen
the country's vocational education.</P>
      <P>According to an official of the MOE's Department of Technological and Vocational
Education, the MOE began a program in 2006 to integrate the resources of the
industrial and academic sectors, providing vocational training to students
interested in the fields of yacht building, aviation, molding, processing and
semiconductors.</P>
      <P>"The program has attracted the participation of more than 5,000 students from 40
secondary vocational schools and 28 vocational junior colleges, as well as some
100 enterprises, " the official said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the MOE also presented a program in cooperation with local
enterprises in 2006, offering internships to junior high students from
underprivileged families who have difficulty passing entrance examinations for
senior high schools.</P>
      <P>To date, 10 schools have opened courses for molding, machinery, mechanical,

    <HEADLINE>DOH urges doctors to be cautious about working in China</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) urged local doctors Wednesday to "exercise
caution" before applying to practice medicine in China, as the Chinese
government is encouraging them to do.</P>
      <P>DOH Deputy Minister Chen Tzay-jinn made the remarks after the Taiwan Affairs
Office under China's State Council announced earlier Wednesday that doctors from
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau who have legally practiced medicine for at least
five years, are certified specialists, and are currently practicing in medical
institutions can apply to practice medicine in China.</P>
      <P>Chen said local doctors considering applying should take into consideration that
they may not enjoy the same legal protections as they do here.</P>
      <P>"The professionals going to China should consider the issue of the protection of
their interests" Chen said, noting that a lot of Taiwanese businessmen lost all
their money investing in China because the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have
yet to sign an investment protection agreement.</P>
      <P>"The same thing can happen to medical professionals," he warned.</P>
      <P>Chen said he was "not at all" worried about a possible exodus of Taiwanese
doctors to China.</P>
      <P>"The environment in which doctors practice in Taiwan is superior to that in
China," he said.</P>
      <P>Other officials from Taiwan's medical sector also echoed Chen's advice, urging
Taiwan doctors "not to be rash" in going to China.</P>
      <P>Lee Yuan-teh, an emeritus professor at the National Taiwan University who had
supervised doctors in China before, said China's move could be an attempt by the
country "to solve the problem of a serious shortage of Chinese doctors," instead
of a "goodwill gesture."</P>
      <P>Lee reminded local doctors they may be unfairly targeted for medical malpractice
lawsuits in China, saying "it could be worse than in Taiwan," because Taiwan
doctors could be treated as "outsiders."</P>
      <P>Lee said Taiwanese doctors should not be "rash" in going to China before
relevant systems and the medical environment are improved and both sides of the
Taiwan Strait sign an agreement.</P>
      <P>National Taiwan University Hospital's Superintendent Lin Fang-yu said that as a
doctor, he welcomes China's opening to Taiwanese doctors, but he wondered how
many Taiwanese doctors would go because of what he called "the lack of
incentives."</P>
      <P>Lee agreed, saying that medical resources in China are seriously skewed, with
most of the resources going to the urban areas while some remote areas did not
even have doctors.</P>
      <P>Doctors' salaries in China are also generally lower than that in Taiwan, said
Lee.</P>
      <P>But for some charity groups in Taiwan, such as the Buddhist Tzu Chi Hospital and
the Taiwan Root Medical Service Corp., China's putting out the welcome mat for
doctors could make it easier for Taiwanese doctors from such groups, who are
already interested in helping China's needy, to provide medical service in
remote regions in the mainland, Lee said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Executive Yuan unveils white paper on increasing birth rate</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan approved a white paper on its population policy Wednesday,
focusing on raising the country's falling birth rate to deal with an aging
society.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regular weekly Cabinet meeting after hearing a briefing by
Ministry of the Interior officials, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said the Cabinet
ironed out the white paper -- the first of its kind -- with the aim of resolving
several problems arising from the continued dropping fertility rate that
dwindled to an average of 1.1 babies born to each woman over the course of her
life in 2007.</P>
      <P>"The Executive Yuan hopes to increase the average ratio to 1.6 babies per woman
by 2015 -- the average fertility rate recorded among the member countries of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development," Chang said during the
meeting.</P>
      <P>The premier reported that the number of Taiwan's citizens aged 65 and older has
hit 10.2 percent of the country's total population.</P>
      <P>As society continues to age rapidly, one out of every 9.8 children is born into
families composed of Taiwanese citizens and foreign spouses, Chang reported,
adding that one in 5.5 marriages in this country is mixed-race.</P>
      <P>"Fewer births, a graying population and new immigrants are thorny issues facing
Taiwanese society," Chang said.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, shortly after he re-assumed the premiership in May last
year, he implemented a "10-year nursing system" for senior citizens based on the
"Republic of China's population policy guidelines" promulgated in June 2006.
Meanwhile, the government has projected to channel funds worth NT$81.7 billion
(US$2.6 billion) into the program, he added.</P>
      <P>The government has also increased its monthly stipend for elderly farmers to
NT$6,000 as part of its efforts to better care for minority groups and the
underprivileged, he said.</P>
      <P>To fully prepare Taiwan to embrace the global challenges ahead, the Executive
Yuan has also adopted a series of measures to help ease the financial burden on
households, including providing parents with subsidies for child day-care
centers and lowering the financial requirements for foreign spouses to get ROC
ID cards, he explained.</P>
      <P>In addition, he went on, the government is slated to open a retirement pension
system in October to help local society tackle its graying population and secure
sustainable growth.</P>
      <P>According to the premier, the Executive Yuan will hold public hearings and
seminars around Taiwan to explore public opinion on the population policies
outlined in the white paper. Chang said he has also asked the Ministry of the
Interior to periodically report to the Executive Yuan on how relevant agencies
are carrying out the policies.</P>

      <P>Employees hired by companies registered in Taipei City enjoyed an average
monthly salary of NT$41,135 (US$1,326) in 2007 -- the highest level among
Taiwan's all administrative areas, a municipal department reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to a report from the Department of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
under the Taipei city government, the figure is higher than the average of
NT$34,416 recorded by employees working for companies registered in the rest of
the country and the average of NT$36,863 registered in the northern region.</P>
      <P>The women's labor participation rate in Taipei City in 2007 hit 48.8 percent,
lower than their male counterparts' 63.4 percent, the department said.</P>
      <P>The labor force participation rate represents the percentage of working people
aged between 16-65 in an economy.</P>
      <P>Taipei City also had the country's lowest jobless rate of 3.7 percent for 2007
among all cities and counties. The country's largest city posted a 4.6 percent
unemployment rate in 2002.</P>
      <P>According to the department, a total of 1.16 million employees were hired by
Taipei City-based enterprises last year. In terms of professions, as high as
80.67 percent worked in the service sector, followed by 19.11 percent in the
industrial sector and 0.22 percent in the fishery, farming and forestry sector.</P>
      <P>Last year, some 34.6 percent of job seekers who had their household registration
in Taipei City said there were no job opportunities for them in the city -- down
by 12.48 percentage points from the 2006 level, the department said.</P>
      <P>Some 42.28 percent of job seekers around the rest of Taiwan said they found no
employment during the whole of 2007, while 40.5 percent of job seekers in
northern regions confessed to having encountered the same situation last year.</P>
      <P>The two ratios are higher than Taipei City's 34.6 percent -- an indication that
the city provides more jobs, according to the department.</P>
      <P>According to the department, 65.4 percent of Taipei's job seekers said they had
employment opportunities but did not get work last year due to various reasons.
Some 55.3 percent of these people said they did not take a job because of poor
pay, ahead of 10.8 percent who cited a lack of interest in the work on offer.</P>
      <P>In 2007, employment agencies affiliated to the Taipei city government offered an
average 0.94 jobs for each job seeker -- the lowest ratio in recent years and
below the ratio of one job for one job seeker for the first time.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Cabinet official said Wednesday it's unfair to criticize as a "scandal" the
government's tentative decision to allow a Middle East company to take a
majority stake in an ailing aircraft corporation, saying that the government is
simply trying to clean up a mess left over from a previous administration.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan Secretary-General Chen Chin-jun made the remarks after opposition
Kuomintang lawmakers criticized the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) for
planning to allow a venture capital company in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to
control 80 percent of the Texas-based Sino Swearingen Aircraft Corp. (SSAC) 's
total stocks with a relatively small investment.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China government holds a majority stake in the company.</P>
      <P>However, Chen said that the aircraft manufacturer has been operating in the red
over the years and that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration is
simply working to solve a problem left by the previous KMT administration.</P>
      <P>SSAC was established in 1995 as a partnership between Texas-based Swearingen
Aircraft Company and Sino Aerospace Investment Corp. of Taiwan, which was
managed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>Explaining the reason for seeking foreign investment, Chen noted that a
legislative resolution passed in March of 2006 stipulates that if the aircraft
company fails to generate profits by 2009, then the MOEA shall not increase its
investment in the Taiwan-U.S. joint venture.</P>
      <P>In addition, SSAC's private shareholders have no intention of making further
investment as they have obtained no returns from the company, Chen pointed out.</P>
      <P>The lack of funding will adversely affect SSAC's research and development
capabilities for future aircraft models, he added.</P>
      <P>Due to these reasons, the government sought foreign investors to help revive the
company, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen urged KMT lawmakers not to smear the government's efforts and mislead the
public.</P>
      <P>At a news conference held earlier Wednesday, KMT caucus whip Alex Fai and KMT
Legislator Lai Shyh-bao demanded the economics ministry immediately cancel the
foreign investment deal.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, the UAE buyer only offered an investment of US$50 million and
promised an additional future investment of US$100 million.</P>
      <P>However, the buyer will be allowed to gain up to 80 percent of the SSAC's total
shares,  Lai said,  describing  the deal as "unbelievably cheap."</P>
      <P>Furthermore,  despite  SSAC's promise to give its original shareholders a
royalty of US$70,000 per jet after it produces the 101th jet in the future, the
agreement did not specify who will get the royalty, Lai noted.</P>
      <P>Lai claimed that the DPP government has invested more than US$10 billion in SSAC
over the past eight years and that at a time when the company's technologies
have finally become mature, the government should not be selling stakes to
foreign firms.</P>
      <P>Noting that the company has received jet orders worth a combined US$40 billion,
Lai further questioned why the government is so eager to sell the company before
a new administration will come to power in May following the March 22
presidential poll.</P>
      <P>Also, Lai lambasted that the government holds a stake of 91 percent in SSAC, but
the company is not subject to the Legislative Yuan's control as it is registered
in the United States.</P>
      <P>The other KMT legislator Fai asked for an immediate halt to the trade deal,
warning that the KMT caucus will otherwise resort to legal action against top
economic officials.</P>
      <P>The KMT lawmakers made the criticism one day after Economics Minister Steve R.L.
Chen said that the ministry had planned to announce the bankruptcy of the
aircraft maker several times in the past.</P>
      <P>Now, the ministry has finally found a new investor who offers what he called
"the best deal, " Chen said, stressing that the government is not trying to sell
the company regardless of the price.</P>
      <P>Chen explained that the ministry began looking for new investors two years ago,
rejecting claims that the government was trying to finalize the deal prior to
May 20, when the new administration will be sworn in.</P>
      <P>The foreign investment deal is expected to help the company generate a
production value of NT$20 billion (US$641 million) over the next 10 years,
according to Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang.</P>

Fund, a government-run organization in charge of development aid to less
developed countries.</P>
      <P>Team leader Chen Chih-fu, who has visited Darjeeling often, told CNA reporters
in a phone interview that the team received a warm welcome on arrival and local
authorities sent more than 10 people to assist the team's service.</P>
      <P>The team, with its 13 health care members, including doctors, pharmacists and
nurses, is expected to help about 500 local people in one day. It will head to
India's Himalayan state of Sikkim Thursday and remain there for three to five
days before returning to Darjeeling, Chen said. The team will then arrive back
in New Delhi March 15, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Darjeeling, a popular travel destination for its cool weather and well-known for
its production of black tea, is currently experiencing riots stemming from an
indefinite strike called by the opposition party Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) ,
which is demanding the creation of a separate state comprising Darjeeling and
certain contiguous areas from West Bengal.</P>
      <P>The GJM is also asking for the removal of Subash Ghising from his position as
chairman of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council opposition party in Darjeeling.
Ghising is also the chairman of the Gorkha National Liberation Front, which the
GJM had separated from, according to local media reports.</P>
      <P>Riots stemming from the strike have caused economic shutdowns and chaos in the
local residents' daily lives. Blockades were set up on the road between
Darjeeling and Sikkim by GJM supporters.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan's medical team has received a pass approved by the GJM and
should be able to get to Sikkim unobstructed. The group sent to assist the
Taiwan medical team is not carrying any weapons to help protect the group, Chen
said, but he added that he believed the local authorities would ensure their
safety.</P>
      <P>Khedroop Thondup, local organizer for the medical team's schedule in India, said
Darjeeling is currently under curfew and that the team is staying in
Darjeeling's Salugara, which is about the same distance from Darjeeling's
airport and Siliguri where the strike is taking place.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's economy holds despite doubts over price inflation: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  27 (CNA)
02/27/08  23:04:48
(By Yeh Fang-hsun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic outlook stays sound despite government-compiled indications
showing a mild slowdown in January mainly because of inflationary pressures from
international raw materials and commodity prices, the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The CEPD's monthly monitoring indicators pointed to a slight cut- back in
January to 27 from 29 points for last December, CEPD Vice Chairman Thomas Yeh
said, adding that the figure represented agreen light rating on the CEPD's
evaluation scale that signaled stable growth for the third consecutive month
since last November.</P>
      <P>The monitoring indicators are composed of nine economic factors, including
direct and indirect finance, monetary aggregates (M1B), and wholesale, retail
and food services sales.</P>
      <P>The last factor represents the largest fall-back in the January indexes with
minus 3.2 percent in growth, indicating a shrinking local consumer market due to
increasing commodity prices, Yeh noted.</P>
      <P>Yeh attributed the decline to the result of global price hikes and the financial
turbulence following the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis which raises downside
risks to the local economy's prospects.</P>
      <P>Referring to economic cycles, in which there occur fluctuations of growth and
decline, Yeh noted that countries all over the world are lowering their
expectations of economic growth in 2008 after the highs they reached in 2007, as
Taiwan's government-projected number was also reduced to 4.8 percent this year
despite substantial growth at 5.5 percent in 2007.</P>
      <P>Global Insight, an international institute of economic and financial analysis,
predicts 4-percent growth for Taiwan's economy in 2008.</P>
      <P>As for countering the soaring prices of global commodities and raw materials,
Yeh noted Taiwan's recent strong rise in the value of its share prices and
currency could offset the rise of the Commodity Price Index (CPI).</P>
      <P>Taiwan's CPI in January was up by 3 percent, a relatively stable performance
compared with South Korea's 3.9 percent and China's 7.1 percent, he said.</P>
      <P>Yeh also said that to maintain the recent foreign fund inflows that are boosting
the country's currency and share prices, the government will be making economic
structural reforms to strengthen investors' confidence with measures including
lowering the corporate income tax to 17.5 percent from the current 25 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA suspends deal with foreign investor in ailing aircraft firm</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 27 (CNA)
02/27/08  23:34:15
(By T.C. Jiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A plan to allow a foreign company to take a majority stake in a debt-riddent
government-controlled aircraft company will be suspended to allay concerns about
the investment deal, a top economic official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Economics Minister Steve R.L. Chen said the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
will give a special report on the foreign investment deal to the legislature in
late March and that the deal will only proceed with the approval of the
legislature.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan will soon go into recess and the new legislative session
will not open again until after the March 22 presidential poll.</P>
      <P>Chen's announcement came one day after the MOEA announced that it has decided to
allow a venture capital company in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to control 80
percent of the Texas-based Sino Swearingen Aircraft Corp.'s (SSAC's) total
stocks with a mere investment of US$150 million. The government holds a stake of
91 percent in SSAC.</P>
      <P>SSAC was established in 1995 as a partnership between Texas-based Swearingen
Aircraft Co. and Sino Aerospace Investment Corp., which is managed by the MOEA.</P>
      <P>The decision was aimed at saving the company from bankruptcy, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>However,  the investment  deal soon sparked questions from lawmakers of the
Kuomintang (KMT) , the country's largest opposition party, who called it a
"cheap deal."</P>
      <P>After visiting the KMT caucus, Chen agreed to put the investment deal on hold
for the time being.</P>
      <P>Tu Tzu-chun, executive-secretary of Yao-Hwa Glass Co. Ltd. Management
Commission, which is managed by the MOEA and SSAC's largest shareholder, said
that the investment deal has gone through many rounds of negotiations and that
some business documents have been signed.</P>
      <P>The economics ministry is currently conducting damage assessments if it fails to
obtain the legislature's approval, continued Tu.</P>
      <P>The new investor has provided US$10 million in financing, which will help SSAC
sustain its operations until the end of March, Tu said.</P>
      <P>If the investment deal is canceled, SSAC will need to look for other sources of
funds, Tu added.</P>
      <P>The Middle East investor is the fourth company with which SSAC has sought
financial assistance since November 2006, Tu said, noting that the previous
three companies disagreed over the investment amount.</P>
      <P>SSAC needs US$10 million in capital  for three months of operations, Tu said.</P>
      <P>SSAC might have to announce bankruptcy because a legislative resolution passed
in March of 2006 stipulates that if the aircraft company fails to generate
profits by 2009, the MOEA shall not increase its investment in the Taiwan-U.S.
venture.</P>

      <P>As the Taiwan government has been expecting the United States to support
Taiwan's bid to participate in international organizations, Tung's background

      <P>The free trade agreement (FTA) between Taiwan and El Salvador is set to take
effect March 1, Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>This will be Taiwan's fourth FTA to come into force after those signed with
Panama, Guatemala, and Nicaragua, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began three-party FTA talks with El Salvador and Honduras in May 2006 and
reached an agreement in November the same year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan officially signed the FTAs with the two Central American allies in El

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Committee on Foreign Affairs under the U.S. House of Representatives adopted
Wednesday a resolution in support of Taiwan's upcoming presidential election.</P>
      <P>The resolution, which will be forwarded to the House for consideration,  calls
for the U.S. government to reaffirm its unwavering commitment to Taiwan's
democracy and security and for the encouragement of international delegations to
visit Taiwan to witness the March 22 election -- the fourth direct presidential
election to be held in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The resolution notes that Taiwan has made dramatic improvement in terms of its
human rights record and routinely holds free and fair elections in a multi-party
system.</P>
      <P>In particular, the 2000 presidential election marked the first transition of
power from one political party to another in Taiwan's history, it says.</P>
      <P>An unequivocal supporter of human rights and the democratic ideals of freedom of
speech, freedom of the press, rule of law, and free elections, Taiwan is one of
the strongest democratic allies of the United States in the Asia-Pacific region,
the resolution says.</P>
      <P>It also says Taiwan's stable democratic system and impressive economic prowess
have made the country stand apart from many equally young democracies whose
freedom and liberty have been severely challenged.</P>
      <P>The resolution was jointly initiated by the late committee chairman Tom Lantos,
who died Feb. 11, and vice chairwoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) .  It was co-
sponsored by more than 40 representatives.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's representative to the United States, Joseph Wu, said the passage of the
resolution has again highlighted the importance attached by the U.S. Congress to
Taiwan-U.S. relations and its support for the Taiwan people's pursuit of
democracy and freedom.</P>
      <P>In addition to expressing his appreciation to Lantos for the great attention he
had paid to Taiwan's democratic development during his life time, Wu also
thanked Ros-Lehtinen and Howard Berman (D-Calif.), acting chairman of the
committee, for their efforts and contribution to promoting Taiwan-U.S. ties.</P>
      <P>Wu said he is confident Taiwan's relations with the United States will grow even
closer and stronger in the future with the firm backing of its large number of
friends in the U.S. Congress.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Bob Yang, president of the Formosan Association for Public Affairs
(FAPA), a pro-independence Taiwanese expatriate group based in the United
States, said the next presidential election in Taiwan is critical to Taiwan's
future development and that the referendum to be held alongside the election on
joining the United Nations under the name Taiwan has further increased the
importance of the election.</P>
      <P>While the United States has risked disagreement with Russia to support Kosovo's
recent independence from Serbia, FAPA hopes the Bush administration would also
ignore China's opposition to supporting Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations,
Yang said.</P>

      <P>President Chen shui-bian said Thursday the people of Taiwan should understand
their history clearly and learn from past experiences to deepen and consolidate
the value of democracy.</P>
      <P>Chen made the rmearks while presiding over the opening of an exhibition of 228
Incident-themed artworks and documents at the 228 National Memorial Hall.</P>
      <P>Stressing that democracy is not given by past administrations with mercy or
through the asking of forgiveness from the victims and their relatives, Chen
said that "Taiwan's democracy is gained through the efforts of the champions who
sacrificed  their lives and well-being."</P>
      <P>"People of this land are able to decide their own destiny because of the
forerunners' struggles for democracy, freedom and human rights, " Chen said at
the occasion commemorating the victims of the 228 Incident which occurred on
Feb. 28, 1947.</P>
      <P>The incident was an anti-government uprising by local Taiwanese against the
Kuomintang government and was suppressed by authorities resulting in thousands
of deaths. The number "228" implies the day the incident began, Feb.28.</P>
      <P>Chen continued that every person of Taiwan is a part of Taiwan's destiny, adding
that "we must walk together without distinction between you and me to adamantly
defend our homeland and justice."</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said the definition of the 228 Incident in modern
society should not be associated solely with political meaning or sadness,
adding that "it also implies the strong will and courage of Taiwanese people who
are tolerant and want to guard the homeland."</P>
      <P>"We should maintain a more positive and honest attitude to face the grief of the
past, using a newer and more extensive thinking with different angles to give
the 228 Incident a broader meaning, " Chang said.</P>
      <P>Pointing to the budget allocated by the Ministry of Education to the Memorial
Foundation of 228 that is still pending in the Legislative Yuan,  Education
Minister Tu Cheng-sheng urged the legislature to approve the budget proposal
soon to allow the foundation to operate smoothly and educate the public about
the facts of the 228 Incident.</P>
      <P>In the "Themed Exhibition of 228 Massacre and Art Fare, " organized by the
Memorial Foundation of 228 and the 228 National Memorial Hall, the background of
the incident, Taiwan's democracy, and the cases of human rights violations in
other countries are presented through historical documents, pictures,
documentary films, and artistic works to make people better understand the
importance of justice in the process of democracy.</P>

      <P>The chances are slim that two referendums regarding Taiwan's bid to join the
U.N., scheduled to be held alongside the March 22 presidential election, would
be set to another date, a Central Election Commission (CEC) official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Noting that the decision to hold the referendums simultaneously with the
election was made by the commission after deliberate consideration, CEC
Secretary-General Teng Tien-yu said he does not see any necessity for the
commission to meet again to change the date unless there is sufficient reason to
do so.</P>
      <P>Such a change is not recommended especially when preparation for the referendums
has entered its final stage and the ballots are being printed, Teng said.</P>
      <P>Teng made the remarks in response to recent calls by opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union Chairman Huang Kun-hui that the referendums be postponed to
allow more time for the ruling and opposition parties to sort out their
differences over the referendums, so as to avoid their failure.</P>
      <P>The referendums were initiated respectively  by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) . While the DPP's
version advocates joining the United Nations under the name "Taiwan, " the KMT's
initiative calls for regaining U.N. membership under the name "Republic of
China" or any other "suitable" name.</P>
      <P>However, as all previous referendums failed because the turnout rates did not
reach the required 50 percent -- partly due to a boycott by the KMT, there have
been concerns that the upcoming referendums would also fail, especially when
voters who opt to take part in the KMT-initiated  referendum are likely to skip
the DPP-backed referendum, and vice versa.</P>
      <P>Concerned that a failure of the U.N. bid referendums would mislead the world
into doubting Taiwan's desire to join the United Nations, the DPP has recently
been calling on the public to take an active part in both referendums to ensure
their passage.</P>

      <P>A fugitive former senior executive of the bankrupt Chung Shing Bank convicted in
a banking scandal involving some NT$7.4 billion (US$239 million) worth of
illegal loans was repatriated from China Thursday, law enforcement authorities
said.</P>
      <P>Wang Hsuan-jen, a former general manager of the Kaohsiung-based bank who fled to
China last May, was repatriated from Fuzhou City in southern Fujian Province to
the Taiwan-held outlying island of Matsu earlier Thursday aboard the Chinese
ferry "The Strait."</P>
      <P>The repatriation happened under the "Kinmen Agreement" signed between Red Cross
Societies of Taiwan and China at the beginning of the 1990s.</P>
      <P>After arriving in Matsu, Wang was airlifted aboard a police helicopter from
Matsu to Taipei under the escort of Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB)
officials.</P>
      <P>The repatriation made Wang the first major economic criminal from Taiwan who was
repatriated from China since the two sides signed the agreement on Sept. 12,
1990 on the repatriation of hijackers, stowaways and other criminals.</P>
      <P>According to CIB Officials, Chinese authorities were originally scheduled to
repatriate Wang from Fuzhou to Matsu on Jan. 29, but his repatriation was
postponed due to inclement weather and rough seas in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Wang was arrested in Shanghai on Jan. 24.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese prosecutors have expressed appreciation toward China for its good will
in taking the initiative to arrest Wang.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors said hopefully, China will continue to cooperate with Taiwan in
fighting crime by repatriating many more notorious Taiwanese fugitives hiding in
China, including former Chung Shing Bank Chairman Wang Yu-yun and his son Wang
Chih-hsiung, a board director of the bank. Both the father and son were
convicted after the same banking scandal erupted in 2000.</P>
      <P>The repatriated Wang Hsuan-jen, who is not related to the other two Wangs, was
sentenced to six years and eight months in prison last April for his role the
illegal loan case involving Taiwan Pineapple Corp. (TPC) . He fled Taiwan before
he was to begin serving his time in prison on May 3, 2007.</P>
      <P>Wang Hsuan-jen was convicted of conspiring with the pineapple company's Chairman
Huang Tsung-hung to use dummy accounts to borrow money from the bank in
violation of an existing regulation that prohibits banks from lending more than
40 percent of their previous fiscal year's net worth to a single customer. The
total amount of the illegal loans connected to the scandal exceeded NT$7. 4
billion.</P>
      <P>The debt-ridden Chung Shing Bank was auctioned off by the government-run Central
Deposit Insurance Corp. to the Union Bank of Taiwan in 2005.</P>
      <P>Along with Wang Hsuan-jen, 24 other Taiwanese criminals were also repatriated
from Fuzhou to Matsu aboard the same ferry Thursday. The 24 comprised fugitives
on wanted lists and convicts who had done their time in China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Taiwan's prosecution  authorities repatriated  a criminal to China
Thursday - Chinese hijacker Wong Zhihua, who was sent from Taipei to Fuzhou via
Matsu.</P>
      <P>He and several Chinese accomplices hijacked a Chinese airplane destined for Hong
Kong in the early 1990s, forcing the pilot to fly to Taiwan. After serving time
in Taiwan for the hijacking, Wong and three other Chinese hijackers held a
Mainland Affairs Council official hostage and injured the official on Feb. 9,
1999 during a flight from Taipei to the outlying island of Kinmen when they were
about to be repatriated to China, landing him more time in prison.</P>
      <P>Wong recently completed his jail term in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Visitors Association (TVA) -- a non-profit Taipei-based tourism
promotion organization -- will take part in the National Association of Travel
Agents Singapore (NATAS) Travel Fair 2008 from Feb. 29 -March 2, in hopes of
luring 15 percent more Singaporean tourists to the island this year, compared to
last year.</P>
      <P>Shao Chung-hua, a TVA adviser and CEO in charge of the Southeast Asian market,
said that the group is aiming to attract at least 230,000 visitor arrivals from
the city state this year, up from 200,000 in 2007.</P>
      <P>The number of tourist arrivals from Singapore to Taiwan in 2007 grew by 12
percent year-on-year, beating the projected growth target of 7 percent set by
the TVA.</P>
      <P>At the NATAS fair, the association hopes to sell the island as a great travel
destination to Singaporeans, by focusing on Taiwan's fine cuisine and its
beautiful scenic spots, including those at Ali Mountain and Jade Mountain, as
well as Sun Moon Lake.</P>
      <P>Traditional art as well as modern Taiwanese attractions will also be used to
promote Taiwan, Shao went on, adding that hand puppet theater -- a centuries old
form of entertainment on the island -- will be introduced at the association's

tourists, so will long loved offerings from the island, including its famous
snacks, such as pineapple cakes, association officials said.</P>
      <P>In addition to tourists on package tours, the association hopes to lure more of
Singapore's backpackers  and other individual travelers who do not join a tour
to Taiwan, according to Cheng Chih-hung, director of the association's Singapore
office.</P>
      <P>Such Singapore tourists who visit Taiwan in 2008 on their own will be offered a
free metro or river cruise ticket on a one-day city tour in Taipei and
Kaohsiung, in conjunction with the tours designed by Taiwan's Tourism Bureau
under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications.</P>
      <P>Visitors may also receive a bag of fruits from Taiwan or a free ticket to
popular tourist destinations or recreational facilities scattered across the
country, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The special tours will lead Singaporean tourists to Taiwan's most popular scenic
and resort spots where they will enjoy classic landscapes and typical Taiwanese
food, coupled with in-depth travel programs featuring different themes such as
either spa, ecology, farming, culture, health, literature and medical or plastic
surgery treatment, Cheng explained.</P>
      <P>Individual travelers from Malaysia and Hong Kong will also be targeted for the
specially designed tours, according to Cheng.</P>

      <P>Two internationally well-known companies from England and France, an Israeli
vocalist, and some local leading businesses joined the latest project of the
Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation to build underground reservoirs in
western China, an indication that the Taiwanese Buddhist compassion relief
organization has won international recognition.</P>
      <P>The fundraising concert, called "Hear the Voice of Love" featuring Israeli
vocalist David D'or, is organized jointly by Wedgwood, one of England's finest
porcelain companies, L'Occitane, the pioneering French retailer of skin care
products, Shiatzy Chen, one of Taiwan's top fashion designers, and Taiwan's Hai
Pa Wang chain restaurants, in order to assist the Tzu Chi Foundation in
providing aid and relief to people in stricken areas due to climate change.</P>
      <P>"We'd like to take a cooperative social responsibility in this fundraising
concert," said Tom Wedgwood, who lives in Japan and is in charge of the family's
business in Asia, quoting his grandfather that "a good business should always
serve human beings in other areas, not just in business."</P>
      <P>David D'or, deeply inspired by Tzu Chi's ideas and efforts, is the first foreign
musician composing songs dedicated to the Buddhist charity, and has already
visited Taiwan several times since 2006 for the foundation's humanitarian
causes.</P>
      <P>According to Charlie Ke, the supervisor of public affairs for the Tzu Chi
Humanitarian Center, many of the businesspeople sponsoring the concert are
already voluntary workers of the foundation, while Wedgwood supports Tzu Chi's
campaign by providing its fine bone china for a charity bazaar.</P>
      <P>"All funds raised will be used to help people in need, starting with the people
in Gansu province in western China, where the residents endure constant drought
and have to carry water barrels from the foot of mountains to their uphill
villages, an eight or nine-hour labor," said Ke.</P>
      <P>The Tzu Chi Foundation is a non-profit Buddhist charity founded by Master Chen
Yen, a nun, in 1966, since then it has been devoted to social and community
services,  medical care,  education,  and humanitarian assistance in Taiwan and
beyond. Tzu Chi has been active in such places as Tibet and South America, as
well as South Asia during the 2004 tsunami disaster, and even New York during
the 911 terrorist attacks. It has won the reputation of "Taiwan's conscience"
for its contributions to humanitarian aid.</P>
      <P>The Chinese authorities confirmed Wednesday that the Taiwanese charity
foundation will be the first one conducted by a legal representative who is a
non-resident of the Mainland.</P>
      <P>Tzu Chi began its humanitarian aid in Gansu in 1998. With the funds raised from
the concert, people in Gansu will be able to build reservoirs in their environs
to collect rainwater during the short rainy season.</P>

      <P>Around 1,500 Christians commemorated the 228 Incident Thursday by begging for
the victims and their relatives to forgive their persecutors and urging people
to cure the wounds left by the incident with love and sympathy.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident, which occurred Feb. 28,  1947,  was an anti-government
uprising  by  local  Taiwanese  against  the then-Kuomintang (KMT) government
and was brutally suppressed by the authorities, resulting in thousands of
deaths.</P>
      <P>At the commemoration ceremony held at the Bread of Life Church in Taipei, the
believers prayed for better consolidation of all churches followed by an
exercise of self- communion in which the participants reflected upon whether
hatred of other ethnic groups existed in their minds.</P>
      <P>The ceremony was held simultaneously with another organized by the Presbyterian
Church.</P>
      <P>Pan-Liu Yu-shya, a pastor and the director of the National Prayer Network,
reconciled different views on the 228 Incident and said that "only the love and
sympathy of Jesus Christ can cure the wounds and heal Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Expressing his remorse for not being brave enough to show love to his uncle, a
victim of the White Terror persecution that the KMT conducted in the years
following the 228 Incident, Chou Shen-chu, pastor of the Bread of Life Church,
prayed for help for himself and all Taiwanese people to give assistance and
consolation to the victims and their relatives.</P>
      <P>Ko Shao-en, chairman of the Good News Broadcasting Association, admitted that he
never consoled his parents who also suffered during the White Terror and urged
everyone to eliminate indifference with God's help.</P>
      <P>Pan-Liu added that the churches have been silent on the incident due to lack of
courage and said that "churches in Taiwan should not keep silent anymore." He
expressed hope that "from now on, churches will be representatives of truth and
justice."</P>

    <HEADLINE>CDC develops enterovirus test kit</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has developed a test kit for the
Coxsackie A group viruses, the most common enteroviruses that infect children in
the country, with an accuracy rate of up to 97 percent, according to a health
official.</P>
      <P>The test kit is the result of an eight-year research project aimed at saving
time and costs for identifying the viruses, said CDC Deputy Director-General Lin
Ting Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, 22 of the 66 kinds of known enteroviruses are categorized as
Coxsackie A group, which infect some 50 percent to 70 percent of Taiwan's
children every year.</P>
      <P>Up to now, Taiwan has mostly used an imported tester that can only identify
certain types of enteroviruses, which results in over 50 percent of the virus
samples not being accurately identified, Lin said.</P>
      <P>To determine the cause of illness, the samples often need to be further analyzed
by local labs, a process that takes a month and costs NT$500 (US$16.2), Lin
pointed out.</P>
      <P>By contrast, the new test kit will only cost NT$35 and the test result is
available in three hours, Lin said, adding that the accuracy rate falls within a
range of 83 percent to 97 percent.</P>
      <P>The CDC has provided the test kit to 13 of the CDC's contract labs, and plans to
sell the kit to Japan and Southeast Asian countries, where the enterovirus
epidemic is also mainly caused by the Coxsackie A group viruses, Lin said.</P>
      <P>He predicted that the kit could generate an annual production value of at least
NT$500 million.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin said that the CDC is currently developing a test kit on
enterovirus type 71 (E71) , the deadliest type of all enteroviruses, which
infected 405 children, 78 of whom died, in the summer of 1988 in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In another E71 outbreak in 2005, 145 children were infected, with 15 killed.</P>
      <P>Symptoms of enteroviruses include fever and rash.</P>

      <P>A Council of Agriculture official assured Thursday that rice prices will be
stable later this year due to more rice crops being cultivated and more imports
from abroad.</P>
      <P>You Sheng-feng, deputy director of the council's Agriculture and Food Agency,
gave the assurance amid recent price hikes in many agricultural products,
including rice, wheat, vegetables and fruits.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, the prices of different varieties of rice have increased by 5
percent to 10 percent in February compared to the same month last year, due to
decreased supply caused by typhoons in the second half of last year.</P>
      <P>"To balance the prices of rice, the COA has been releasing 38,000 metric tons of
stored rice onto the market and encouraging more farmers to cultivate rice," Yu
said.</P>

      <P>Former ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Lin Tai-hua has been
appointed to head the National Youth Commission, a ranking Executive Yuan
official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin, 35, is expected to assume office next week as the new National Youth
Commission minister, replacing Cheng Li-chiun, whose resignation was approved by
Premier Chang Chun-hsiung Feb. 20, said Executive Yuan Secretary-General Chen
Chin-jun.</P>
      <P>The premier approved Cheng's resignation after a main opposition Kuomintang
legislator charged Cheng for having "occupied herself with campaigning for DPP
presidential candidate Frank Hsieh instead of devoting herself to the problems
of jobless youth."</P>
      <P>Cheng, who took over the post in 2004, said she had tendered her resignation
before joining an islandwide walk to campaign for Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Chen said Lin, who served two terms as a DPP legislator between 2002-2008,  will
make an efficient  minister,  given her good educational  background  --  with a
master's  degree  in mass communications from the United States -- her close
connections with youth, and the positive image she has built during her stint as
a lawmaker.</P>
      <P>Chen said although Lin's tenure is likely to be short as the administration of
President Chen Shui-bian will be bowing out in less than three months, he is
positive that Lin would be able to secure the greatest possible benefits for the
country's youth in the remaining months.</P>

      <P>The 2008 Taiwan Lantern Festival that opened Feb. 21 in Tainan County, southern
Taiwan, is expected to attract more than 500,000 visitors during its 11-day run,
the Tourism Bureau said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Tourism officials urged members of the public who have not yet seen the show to
grab the opportunity in the final days before the festival closes March 2.</P>
      <P>The festival is being held to celebrate the arrival of the Year of the Rat at
Solar City, a special zone in the Southern Taiwan Science Park,  in a 88-hectare
showground.  The Tainan county government, organizer of the show, said the
exhibition this year is larger than all past festivals in terms of the number of
lanterns on display.</P>
      <P>There are six theme areas for religious lanterns, artistic lanterns, traditional
lanterns, historical lanterns, dynamic lanterns and lanterns submitted for
competition.</P>
      <P>The centerpiece of the festival is a giant lantern in the shape of a spinous
country rat -- a species of rodent endemic to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 15-meter papier mache rat, standing on its hind legs and holding a gold
ingot to its chest, is mounted on a three-meter pedestal and the whole piece
weighs 25 metric tons.</P>
      <P>Tony Wheeler, founder of Australia's Lonely Planet, one of the largest
independently owned travel guidebook publishers in the world, praised the
festival as "fantastic." He also said that Tainan, a city with many historical
relics, is an ideal place for backpacking tourists.</P>
      <P>Chuck Y. Gee, dean emeritus of the School of Travel Industry Management of the
University of Hawaii at Manoa, said the festival was well-planned, with each of
the six exhibition area having an clear-cut theme, impressing visitors not only
with the works' beauty but also with their large numbers.</P>
      <P>Over 55,000 red and yellow lanterns have been used to form giant Chinese and
English characters that read "Taiwan Peace" -- the central theme of the
festival.</P>
      <P>A memorial was held Thursday on the exhibition ground to mark the Feb. 28
incident of 1947. The incident, triggered by a dispute between Monopoly Bureau
officials and an illegal cigarette vendor, led to the death of an innocent
bystander and prompted clashes all over Taiwan between locals and recent
immigrants for China. An estimated 30,000 people died during a subsequent
crackdown by troops brought in from China by the then-ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>In addition to the exhibition of lanterns, the organizers have invited
performing arts groups from Japan and France, as well as domestic troupes, to
entertain visitors with 42 performances.</P>
      <P>A flower show covering 10 hectares is also being held at the same time. Visitors
will be treated to a total of 27 fireworks shows and can enjoy a wide range of
delicacies on a gourmet food street.</P>
      <P>The organizers will have given away 120,000 hand-held lanterns featuring the rat
motif as gifts to visitors by the end of the festival.</P>

launched by the NPA earlier this year to press overweight police officers to
exercise.</P>
      <P>According to the campaign, obese police officers should jog, cycle, hike, or run
marathons. Playing badminton, table tennis or basketball are also recommended
activities, said Yin.</P>
      <P>The agency has also established health-related courses as part of the campaign,
Yin added.</P>
      <P>Yin recently began leading a group of overweight police officers on an after-
work daily six-kilometer jog in the vicinity of the Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport.</P>
      <P>He also plans to head a police team that will compete in the 2008 Taipei County

      <P>Cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and heart disease, as well as

    <HEADLINE>Road construction stopped to protect red-crowned cranes</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A construction project to broaden the roads in Jinshan township, Taipei County,
has been suspended recently in order to protect endangered red-crowned cranes
wintering in the area, according to the Construction and Planning Agency (CPA)
under the Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>Planning for the roadworks started in 1990, but the CPA did not begin the actual
work until December 2007, whereupon it almost immediately encountered unexpected
problems when the four cranes were spotted in the area, having migrated there to
spend the winter.</P>
      <P>The red-crowned crane is found only in eastern Asia and is traditionally
considered by Chinese and Japanese people to be a propitious bird, representing
longevity and fidelity.</P>
      <P>It is now on the "red list" of endangered species compiled by the International
Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, which estimates that
only 2,400 of the birds remain in the wild.</P>
      <P>A migratory bird, it travels in general from Siberia to Japan and southern China
and is rarely observed in Taiwan, with the last recorded sighting in 2003, and
the previous sighting dating back to 1932.</P>
      <P>"We must try to find a win-win solution for both ecological conservation and
traffic needs, " Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei said after approving the
suspension of the roadworks.</P>
      <P>"There are already more than 200 bird species that pass through the Jinshan
wetlands during the migration season, " said Lin Yao-guo, director-general of
the Society of Wilderness, a non- government organization. "If the wetland can
be designated as a nature reserve, more migratory birds would stop in Taiwan, "
he predicted.</P>
      <P>According to the CPA, the wetland is "not an important one recognized by the
nation, " but in order to avoid damaging the ecosystem in favor of improved
traffic flow, the CPA is willing to suspend the work until an acceptable
solution is found by the relevant agencies.</P>
      <P>At present, only two wetlands -- one at the mouth of the Tsengwen river and the
other in Sicao, both in southern Taiwan -- are designated as international
nature reserves, with 39 others designed as national reserves.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese students in Belgium push Taiwan's U.N. bid</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Taiwanese students studying at a Belgian university have continued
making efforts to rally support for Taiwan's bid to enter the United Nations as
a full member.</P>
      <P>After launching a "U.N. for Taiwan" drive Feb. 12, members of a Taiwanese
student association at the French-language Universite Catholique de Louvain in
Belgium, set up a stand Saturday to promote the drive.</P>
      <P>The drive is aimed not only at letting Taiwan know that Taiwanese students in
Belgium support U.N. membership for the country, but also at soliciting support
for the bid from other foreign students studying in Belgium and members of the
international community, said members of the student group.</P>
      <P>The students will send reports and images that they gather during the drive back
to Taiwan in the hope of rekindling the Taiwanese people's passion for seeking
U.N. membership for Taiwan -- a passion, they said, that "has increasingly died
down as a result of political bickering between the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) in the runup to
the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The students want all Taiwanese people to go to the polls March 22 and vote in
two U.N.-bid referendums that will be held at the same time -- one proposed by
the DPP on joining the U.N. under the name Taiwan, the other proposed by the KMT
on rejoining the U.N. under the name Republic of China or any other "suitable
name."</P>
      <P>As the Republic of China, Taiwan lost its seat in the world body to the People's
Republic of China in 1971, and has reapplied unsuccessfully for membership in
the body every year since 1993. Last year was the first time Taiwan tried to
apply for a U.N. seat under the name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a written statement that the Taiwanese students issued Feb. 12 when the drive
was first launched,  they said Taiwan has an independent constitutional system
under which its people enjoy free and dynamic political lives.</P>
      <P>Claiming  that the international  community  has not fully understood the
"collective mindset" of the Taiwanese people, the group said Taiwan's U.N. bid
is a first, critical step in getting the world to learn more about Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's people, whether they live in Taiwan or abroad and irrespective of their
political persuasions, should say out loud with a single voice that "Taiwan
deserves U.N. membership, " the statement urges.</P>
      <P>Should the referendums fail -- which will be the case if 50 percent of eligible
voters do not cast ballots on the referendums -- it will send a message to the
world that Taiwan's people do not want to enter the U.N. and even worse, that
they "want to be ruled by the People's Republic of China government," according
to the group.</P>
      <P>While some foreign governments do not support Taiwan's holding of the
referendums, "many foreign friends here in Brussels support the idea of Taiwan's
being admitted into the U.N.," the statement says.</P>
      <P>The Louvain student group has printed  handouts  of "U.N. membership for Taiwan"
in Chinese, English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish, Italian, Japanese,
Vietnamese and Malaysian to solicit global support for Taiwan's U.N. bid.</P>

      <P>A Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official confirmed Thursday that a group of
Taiwanese and Chinese police officers and Red Cross officials conducted the same
day an exchange of prisoners from either side of the Taiwan Strait on the
outlying island of Matsu.</P>
      <P>The official  said that during the exchange,  the Chinese authorities
repatriated 25 Taiwanese criminals, including a former general manager of a
bankrupt bank who was involved in a loan scandal, while receiving Chinese
airplane hijacker Wong Zhihua and 205 stowaways detained by Taiwanese police.
The exchange was conducted based on the principles and spirit of the Kinmen
Agreement signed by the Red Cross societies on both sides of Taiwan Strait in
1990.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the exchange was originally scheduled for late
January. However, it was postponed due to the weather and strong winds over the
last month.</P>
      <P>To date, there are still some 780 Taiwanese fugitives on the run in China,
including 80 criminals involved in major economic crimes, the official said.</P>
      <P>He expressed gratitude to the Chinese authorities for their cooperation in the
repatriation of the Taiwanese fugitives, calling on them to continue the task in
the future in accordance with the spirit of the Kinmen Agreement.</P>
      <P>The official also expressed hope that the Chinese authorities can discuss with
their Taiwanese counterparts concrete ways to jointly fight crime.</P>
      <P>MAC statistics show that cross-strait crime has shown a shift from fishing
disputes, ilegal immigration and hijacking to smuggling and telephone fraud.</P>

      <P>Instead of lowering the national flag to half mast to mark 228 Peace Memorial
Day Thursday, the outlying Kinmen county government flew three county flags atop
its building in a gesture to urge the central government to mark two battles
fought on Kinmen against Chinese communists that saved Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In defiance of an order issued by the Ministry of the Interior that cities and
counties around the country should lower the national flag to half mast,  the
Kinmen county government,  acting on instructions from Magistrate Lee Chu-feng,
raised three county flags on the top of its headquarters.</P>
      <P>"The central government also should observe two significant battles in which
Kinmen residents fought back against Chinese communists at the cost of their
lives," Lee told reporters recently.</P>
      <P>Lee was referring to the battle of Ku Ning Tou Dec. 25, 1949 and the Aug. 23
Artillery War of 1958 (commonly known as the 823 Artillery Bombardment) , in
which Republic of China troops emerged victorious and secured peace for Taiwan
for almost 60 years.</P>
      <P>"The dates of these two significant battles should also be designated as a
national holiday like the 228 Incident, " he said, pointing out that "if the
Kinmen people had not made such a huge sacrifice in the two battles, the Chinese
communists would have been able to cross the Taiwan Strait and invade Taiwan
proper."</P>
      <P>"Against such a backdrop, it is pointless to discuss whether the Kinmen county
government should fly the national flag at half mast or not mark the 228
Incident should the central government fail to mark the two battles with
national holidays, " he argued.</P>
      <P>Lee also suggested  that the central  government  organize exhibitions to help
Kinmen people gain a better understanding of the 228 Incident.</P>
      <P>"In that case,  lowering  the national flag on Kinmen in commemoration of the
tragedy would be much more meaningful, " he explained.</P>
      <P>Lee said he fully respects  the Taiwan people's need and willingness to heal
their souls by commemorating the 228 Incident, in which thousands of Taiwanese
elite were killed following an uprising against the then-Kuomintang regime.</P>
      <P>Although the Kinmen county government did not fly the national flag at half
mast, most schools and public agencies on the island did do so to pay respect to
the victims of the incident.</P>

      <P>China-based Taiwanese companies, which have felt increasing heat as a result of
the changing investment climate in China, are being forced to change in order to
survive, Guangdong Province-based Taiwanese businessmen said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The businessmen said during an exchange event that in order to survive in China
-- often described as the world's factory -- they will have to either upgrade
their manufacturing operations in China or head to inner provinces to explore
new markets.</P>
      <P>Guangdong Province is one of the Chinese coastal provinces that plays host to
the greatest number of Taiwanese companies.</P>
      <P>An increasing number of Taiwanese businessmen operating in China have returned
to Taiwan since late last year to launch new investment projects as China's
business climate has become less favorable to them.</P>
      <P>They are now facing additional challenges as China has implemented new economic
policies, including the cancellation of an export tariff rebate, implementation
of a new labor contract act and a new business income tax law.</P>
      <P>Yeh Chun-jung, president of a Taiwan investment association based in Dongguan
City, said it is hard to speculate on how seriously Taiwanese companies are
being impacted by the new, stricter Chinese regulations, adding that "the
problems will emerge in six months or one year."</P>
      <P>In the face of the adversity, Yeh said, Taiwanese companies have only three ways
to go: upgrading their manufacturing operations, getting out of China, or
closing down their businesses.</P>

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT)  vice presidential candidate Vincent Siew said in
southern Taiwan Thursday that he had never said he wanted to establish a "one-
China common market," rebutting a claim made by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Speaking at a ceremony to inaugurate a KMT election campaign office in Chiayi
County, Siew said that what he has been calling for is a "cross-Taiwan Strait
common market" modeled on the European Union partnership, which he said would
create a mutually beneficial situation for both sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>Siew,  the running mate of KMT presidential  candidate Ma Ying-jeou, said he had
never used the phrase, "one-China common market" and that it was the DPP that
coined the phrase and falsely attributed it to him.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, DPP presidential candidate Frank Hsieh, who doubles as DPP
chairman,  reiterated his opposition to Siew's proposal, claiming that a one-
China common market would lead to de facto and de jure unification with China.
He also expressed fear that Siew's plan would harm domestic industries and cause
Taiwan's unemployment rate to go up.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks after Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Chen Ming-tong

      <P>The government has repatriated the last of 18 Chinese hijackers to China, the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said in a press release Thursday,
urging Beijing to start negotiations with Taiwan over cross-Taiwan Strait crime
as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The press release came after officials of the semi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) and the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China handed over
Wang Zhihua, who hijacked a plane to Taiwan in 1993, to their Chinese
counterparts at a port on the Taiwan-held outlying island of Matsu.</P>
      <P>Wang was one of 18 Chinese citizens who hijacked planes and came to Taiwan
between 1993 and 1998, the press release said.</P>
      <P>He had been scheduled to be repatriated in 1999 but attacked a SEF official on
the flight to his repatriation and was re-arrested, the press release noted.</P>
      <P>Wang's final repatriation came Thursday after he finished his prison term for
the attack, the press release went on.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Beijing have had several rounds of negotiations on fighting cross-
strait crime, but have failed to ink an agreement, the press release said.</P>
      <P>The trend in cross-strait  crime has shifted from fishing disputes, illegal
immigration and hijacking to smuggling, fleeing criminals and telephone fraud,
the press release continued.</P>
      <P>The MAC also called for the establishment of a cross-strait cooperation
mechanism for crime fighting.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of an official  agreement,  Thursday's repatriation was
conducted in line with the principles and spirit of the Kinmen Agreement signed
by the Red Cross societies on both sides of the strait in 1990.</P>

Thursday at Liberty Square in front of the National Taiwan Democracy Memorial

spread the message of peace and love through their music.</P>
      <P>The "Reborn with Love" concert, organized by the Council for Cultural Affairs
and the National Taiwan Symphony Orchestra (NTSO) , was aimed at "rekindling the
public's passion for reform through music," organizers said.</P>
      <P>To make the concert truly memorable, the organizers invited Hungarian conductor
Tamas Vasary to conduct performances by the NTSO, the Taipei Philharmonic
Orchestra, the Taipei Century Symphony Orchestra and a chorus of more than
1,000.</P>
      <P>The concert also featured works from different ethnic groups in Taiwan,
including Hakka composer Chen Shu-hsi's Ping Ban, aboriginal musician Kao Yi-

Ty-zen, a Taiwanese musician with an international reputation as "Taiwan's
Rachmaninov, " with lyrics written by Li Min-yung.</P>
      <P>The repertoire also covered Finnish composer Jean Sibelius' Finlandia -- a
symbol of Finnish nationalism, and a piece dubbed Taiwan, performed by a chorus
of 1,000-plus voices and accompanied by orchestra.</P>
      <P>The concert culminated in Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 - Choral which was sung by
the chorus in Taiwanese, with Schiller's German lyrics replaced by those of
local poet Hsiang Yang.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident, which began Feb. 27, 1947, refers to a brutal crackdown on the

      <P>The head of the opposition New Party (NP), an offshoot of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT), is seeking support from the KMT to urge voters to boycott two
referendums to be held alongside the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>NP Chairman Yok Mu-ming told reporters Thursday that he had met with KMT
Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung to discuss the issue but had not received a definite
answer from him.</P>
      <P>The two referendums -- one introduced by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
and the other by the KMT -- would ask voters whether they support Taiwan
applying for United Nations membership under either the title, the Republic of
China, or as Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yok said he will try to convince KMT legislators to support the proposed
boycott.</P>
      <P>"The New Party has indicated consistently that we will refuse to take part in
the referendums, and we expressed our position clearly in a Feb. 26
advertisement, together with other civic groups," he said.</P>
      <P>"Failure to pass the referendums would neither cause Taiwan to lose face, nor
inflict any harm to the KMT," he added.</P>
      <P>Yok disagreed  with the concept that failure to pass the referendums would give
the world community the impression that the people of Taiwan do not want U.N.
membership. He said Taiwan will only lose face when it is still barred from
entering the U.N. even after both referendums have passed.</P>
      <P>Yok and his party initiated a campaign to boycott two previous referendums tied
to the Jan. 12 legislative elections. One of them, proposed by the DPP, was
about recovering the KMT's ill-gotten assets, while the other, proposed by the
KMT, was about empowering the legislature to investigate government corruption.
Both were defeated because only 26 percent of the electorate took part in the
voting.</P>

      <P>The government has repatriated the last of 18 Chinese hijackers to China, the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said in a press release Thursday,
urging Beijing to start negotiations with Taiwan over cross-Taiwan Strait crime
as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The press release came after officials of the semi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) and the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China handed over
Wang Zhihua, who hijacked a plane to Taiwan in 1993, to their Chinese
counterparts at a port on the Taiwan-held outlying island of Matsu.</P>
      <P>Wang was one of 18 Chinese citizens who hijacked planes and came to Taiwan
between 1993 and 1998, the press release said.</P>
      <P>He had been scheduled to be repatriated in 1999 but attacked a SEF official on
the flight to his repatriation and was re-arrested, the press release noted.</P>
      <P>Wang's final repatriation came Thursday after he finished his prison term for
the attack, the press release went on.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Beijing have had several rounds of negotiations on fighting cross-
strait crime, but have failed to ink an agreement, the press release said.</P>
      <P>The trend in cross-strait  crime has shifted from fishing disputes, illegal
immigration and hijacking to smuggling, fleeing criminals and telephone fraud,
the press release continued.</P>
      <P>The MAC also called for the establishment of a cross-strait cooperation
mechanism for crime fighting.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of an official  agreement,  Thursday's repatriation was
conducted in line with the principles and spirit of the Kinmen Agreement signed
by the Red Cross societies on both sides of the strait in 1990.</P>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) drummed up support for its
presidential ticket at an evening rally Thursday in Taipei that was opened by
members of a walking group and families of the victims of the 228 Incident.</P>
      <P>At the rally, kicked off by a "democracy torch, " heads of the walking group --
which had just concluded a 22-day, 500-km walk from the country's southernmost
tip to the north -- and the victims' families called for support for DPP
presidential candidate Frank Hsieh and his running mate, Su Tseng-chang.</P>
      <P>The group, mainly consisting of young DPP supporters, launched the walk in early
February to help raise the profile of the DPP ticket prior to the March 22
election.</P>
      <P>Thursday was also a national holiday in memory of the 228 Incident of 1947 in
which thousands of Taiwan's elite were killed following an uprising against the
then-ruling Kuomintang regime.</P>
      <P>The rally came after Hsieh and Su met with the walkers at the DPP election
campaign headquarters before leading them, along with tens of thousands of
supporters, to Chungshan Soccer Stadium in the city for the evening rally.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New Party chairman calls for boycott of March 22 referendums</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 28 (CNA)
02/29/08  10:42:18
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the opposition New Party (NP), an offshoot of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT), is seeking support from the KMT to urge voters to boycott two
referendums to be held alongside the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>NP Chairman Yok Mu-ming told reporters Thursday that he had met with KMT
Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung to discuss the issue but had not received a definite
answer from him.</P>
      <P>The two referendums -- one introduced by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
and the other by the KMT -- would ask voters whether they support Taiwan
applying for United Nations membership under either the title, the Republic of
China, or as Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yok said he will try to convince KMT legislators to support the proposed
boycott.</P>
      <P>"The New Party has indicated consistently that we will refuse to take part in
the referendums, and we expressed our position clearly in a Feb. 26
advertisement, together with other civic groups," he said.</P>
      <P>"Failure to pass the referendums would neither cause Taiwan to lose face, nor
inflict any harm to the KMT," he added.</P>
      <P>Yok disagreed  with the concept that failure to pass the referendums would give
the world community the impression that the people of Taiwan do not want U.N.
membership. He said Taiwan will only lose face when it is still barred from
entering the U.N. even after both referendums have passed.</P>
      <P>Yok and his party initiated a campaign to boycott two previous referendums tied
to the Jan. 12 legislative elections. One of them, proposed by the DPP, was
about recovering the KMT's ill-gotten assets, while the other, proposed by the
KMT, was about empowering the legislature to investigate government corruption.
Both were defeated because only 26 percent of the electorate took part in the
voting.</P>

      <P>More than 30 tribal communities from eight of the 13 recognized aboriginal
tribes around Taiwan organized a series of ceremonies Thursday in which they
sent up smoke signals to underscore their sovereignty claim over their
traditional homelands.</P>
      <P>Clouds of smoke billowed into the sky in the 30-plus tribal communities,
including Pinuyumayan tribe's Kati community in Taitung County, the Paiwan
tribe's Majia community in Kaohsiung County, the Rukai tribe's Haocha community
in Pingtung County, the Bunun tribe's Namahsia community, the Amis tribe's Tulan
community, the Atayal tribe's Smangus community, the Tsou tribe's Tapang
community in Alishan and the Tao tribe's homeland Orchid Island or Lanyu.</P>
      <P>After the smoke signals,  each participating  group staged traditional rituals
or Christian prayer services at venues where significant events in their
respective tribal communities have occurred, to declare their determination to
uphold their tribal sovereignty over their homelands.</P>
      <P>The release of smoke signals is the first step of a campaign to press the
central government to substantiate the Aboriginal Basic Law and underline their
sovereignty claim over their traditional homelands, organizers said.</P>
      <P>According to the organizers, various aboriginal tribal groups are scheduled to
travel to Taipei March 8 to present their appeals to President Chen Shui-bian.
If their petition fails to receive a positive response, the organizers said they
will take further protest moves until the central government makes a formal
apology and recognize their tribal sovereignty over their homelands.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No timetable for turning Grand Hotel into corporation: premier</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Friday that there is no timetable for turning the
government-owned Grand Hotel into a private corporation.</P>
      <P>Chang also said there is no "legal basis" for the government to compel the
hotel, which is operated by a government-controlled foundation, to transfer
itself into a corporation.</P>
      <P>Chang denied a Taipei-based China Times report Monday that the Duen Mou
Foundation of Taiwan -- a non-profit organization founded by the then-ruling
Kuomintang in 1952 and now under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of
Transportation and Telecommunications -- is planning to set up a corporation to
run the Grand Hotel chain prior to May 20, when a new administration will be
sworn in.</P>
      <P>The China Times report also speculated that once the corporation is founded, the
Duen Mou Foundation of Taiwan, now controlled by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) administration, is also planning to appoint its
chairwoman Christine T.Y. Tsung as head of the new Grand Hotel Company to
operate the Grand Hotel chain -- which includes the Grand Hotel Taipei, the
Grand Hotel Kaohsiung, the Yuan Shan Club in Taipei and the Yuan Shan Club in
Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Tsung is believed to maintain close connections with members of the DPP
administration.</P>
      <P>The Grand Hotel Taipei -- built on the orders of the late President Chiang Kai-
shek and first lady Soong Mei-ling in the 1950s with public funds, on public
land, without having to pay tax -- is a Taipei landmark and used to be a major
venue for state banquets.</P>
      <P>Describing the Grand Hotel matter as an "issue left behind by history, " Chang
said the Executive Yuan is not sure whether if any change could be carried out
prior to May 20.</P>
      <P>Also commenting  on the China Times report,  Minister  of Transportation and
Telecommunications  Tsai Duei said it is a "long-established policy" that the
Grand Hotel chain be incorporated as privately run companies.</P>
      <P>Due to legal difficulties, Tsai said, it will not be easy for the Grand Hotel
chain to be privatized anytime soon.</P>

      <P>Most consumers responding to a recent survey admitted that inflation has
affected their buying behavior, with many now preferring to shop at
hypermarkets, where prices tend to be cheaper.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted online Feb.  12-14 by Ding Ding Integrated Marketing
Service Co. (DDIM) -- an associate company under the Far Eastern Group and the
issuer of the Happy Go bonus-point shopping cards -- among 11,459 cardholders.</P>
      <P>The survey reveals that 95 percent of respondents have obviously felt a rise in
consumer prices or a decrease in the volume of the products they bought, and 82
percent of these respondents said the situation has changed their attitude
toward buying daily necessities.</P>
      <P>Fifty-seven percent of respondents now make hypermarkets their priority choice
when shopping for daily necessities, compared with 22 percent who prefer to shop
at convenience stores, 13 percent who favor supermarkets and 8 percent who
prefer to buy at traditional markets.</P>
      <P>The results show that 75 percent of the respondents spend most of their earnings
on daily necessities besides food and transportation, and that 60 percent of
respondents will try to save some of their earnings for financial investment.</P>
      <P>Cash remains the prize that the largest number of respondents -- 83 percent --
wish to win in a lucky draw, and the percentage far exceeds those preferring a
free tour around the world or video/audio home appliances, according to the
results.</P>
      <P>On the personal data of the respondents, 64 percent of them were men and 36
percent were women, with those aged 25 and under accounting for 17 percent,
those aged 26-30 accounting for 26 percent, those aged 31-35 accounting for 24
percent, those aged 36-40 accounting for 15 percent, those aged 41-45 accounting
for 9 percent, and those aged 46-50 accounting for 9 percent.</P>
      <P>Having attracted 4.5 million members since its launch in 2005, the Happy Go card
is now accepted at more than 5,000 stores covering more than 700 brands,
including department stores and retail stores owned by the Far Eastern Group and
other contracted stores, according to DDIM officials.</P>
      <P>Spending by Happy Go cardholders totaled more than NT$12 billion in 2007, with
each holder spending NT$25,000 per year and NT$1,500 per transaction on average,
company officials said.</P>
      <P>A total of 1.3 billion bonus points were awarded to holders in 2007, with 60
percent of the points having been exchanged, they said.</P>

      <P>The Police Radio Station -- the only broadcasting company in Taiwan to offer
free lost and found listings and services -- said that about one-third of the
lost items handed in by taxi drivers are mobile phones.</P>
      <P>According to the radio station, 3,808 lost items were found in taxi cabs by taxi
drivers and handed in to the Police Radio Station last year. Of the total, 1,245
items or 33 percent, were cellphones.</P>
      <P>Other major items ranged from 660 wallets, representing 17 percent of the total,
to bags of all kinds at 604 pieces, or 15 percent, according to the radio
station.</P>
      <P>Other commonly  lost belongings  include cameras,  notebook computers,
certificate cards,  keys,  spectacles,  watches and medications, Public Radio
System officials said.</P>
      <P>They said that last year, the radio station received phone calls concerning
12,938 belongings left in taxis. Of the total, however, only 3,808 were handed
over by taxi drivers, who are allowed by law to keep anything they find in their
cabs if it has not been claimed within six months.</P>

      <P>The air quality over Taiwan is expected to worsen over the next three days due
to a sand storm -- one of the largest to hit Taiwan since 2006 -- the
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) forecast Friday.</P>
      <P>The EPA advised people with cardiovascular or respiratory disease and those with
weak immunity, such as children and the elderly, to avoid being outdoors during
the period.</P>
      <P>The sand, blown from northern China, will arrive in Taiwan along with a cold air
mass this weekend, causing severe pollution, said Chang  Shun-chin,  a
technician  at the EPA's  Department  of Environmental Monitoring and
Information Management.</P>
      <P>The storm is also expected to bring along a lot of industrial waste from China,
increasing the concentration of air pollutants such as particulate matter and
sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere, Chang went on.</P>
      <P>In particular,  the concentration of particulate matter is expected to rise to
up to 400 micrograms per cubic meter per hour, 6-10 times as much as normal
readings, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP plans to hold round-Taiwan human chain March 16</HEADLINE>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) announced Friday that it will hold
a "Democratic Taiwan, 100 Action" parade March 16 and that it wants to summon 1
million people to encircle Taiwan before walking along the island and voicing
their determination to protect Taiwan with democracy.</P>
      <P>Participants will be asked to walk along the coastline in an anti-clockwise
direction when the march kicks off at 3: 14 p.m. under the slogan "protecting
Taiwan with democracy, joining the U.N. and opposing a one-China market, " DPP
Secretary-General Lee Ying-yuan said at a press conference.</P>
      <P>Lee explained that the planned activity originates from the party's 2004 "Hand-
in-Hand To Safeguard Taiwan" and recent "Reversing the Tide: Protecting Taiwan"
campaigns. They hope to "walk toward the bright future of Taiwan" and "show the
international community Taiwan's existence," Lee said.</P>
      <P>"100" means voting for the DPP presidential and vice presidential ticket, which
is listed No. 1 on the ballot, while the two zeroes represent the vote to
support two referendums related to the nation's bid for its seat in the United
Nations, Lee noted.</P>
      <P>While March 14 marks the third anniversary of China's adoption of its anti-
secession law, which gives Beijing a legal excuse to invade Taiwan by force, Lee
added that one of the purposes of holding the event is to declare the party's
determination to "protect Taiwan with democracy."</P>
      <P>Lee said there will be two 500 kilometer chains separately lining Taiwan's
eastern and western coasts. Gathering points for the chains, provisionally named
"high five, " will be set up every five kilometers.</P>
      <P>Lin Kuo-ching, director of the campaign department of DPP presidential candidate
Frank Hsieh's election campaign headquarters, said the southernmost points of
the eastern and western lines will be Fugang, Taitung County, and Donggang,
Pingtung County respectively.</P>
      <P>The two lines will join up in Taipei.</P>
      <P>After the two lines are formed, participants will begin a five-kilometer walk at
3: 14 p.m., moving in a counter-clockwise direction around Taiwan, Lin said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan could be leader in clean energy industry: e-Parliament</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  29 (CNA)
02/29/08  17:26:40

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan, with some of the world's best engineers and advanced technologies, could
emerge as an important player in the clean energy field, the head of the
e-Parliament said Friday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is a country that is "perfectly positioned to be a leader" in the area of
clean energy, said Nicholas Dunlop, founder and secretary-general of the non-
profit organization that links together the world's democratic members of
parliament and congress into a single forum.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Central News Agency, Dunlop said Taiwan has some of the
best wind resources in Asia, and some of the world's best engineers and
companies, leaving it well-positioned to compete in the areas of solar power,
wind power and other forms of renewable energy.</P>
      <P>Renewable energy is one of the group's main issues of interest, along with
climate change and freedom of expression on the Internet. It has tried to raise
awareness of climate change and provide policy suggestions to decision-makers.</P>
      <P>As the consequences of climate change become clear and calls mount for the
government to tackle the issue, a debate has raged in Taiwan over how to apply
renewable energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions without jeopardizing its
economic development.</P>
      <P>Dunlop stressed that "in terms of economic growth versus actions on climate
change, there is really no contradiction between the two," because the countries
and companies that take the lead on clean energy can benefit economically.</P>
      <P>Those that fail to do so will have to spend money buying other people's
technologies in the years and decades to come, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is not a signatory of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change and Kyoto Protocol, but has felt pressure from developed countries to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, even if formal negotiations on mitigating
climate change have proceeded at a glacial pace.</P>
      <P>Dunlop  attributed  the slow  pace of progress  in global negotiations to the
"simple lack of political will."</P>
      <P>"Not many governments have really understood the importance of a very rapid
shift to clean energy if we are going to ensure a stable planet for our future,
" he said.</P>
      <P>Governments around the world need political vision while citizens need
incentives for the two to tackle the problem together, he noted, with many
examples of good programs already existing.</P>
      <P>Germany enacted a new law to promote renewable energy seven years ago that
guaranteed a good price for electricity generated from renewable energy, Dunlop
said.</P>
      <P>"The result of that law has been that Germany now has 55 percent of the global
surface of photovoltaic solar panels just in that country, not even a very sunny
but a cloudy country," he said.</P>
      <P>Spain also has a similar law to encourage companies to build solar thermal power
plants, which use mirrors to concentrate the sun's heat to boil water and drive
steam turbines, he added.</P>
      <P>"So there are two examples of countries that are not just talking about the
problems but really getting on building industries in their countries that can
one day help to save the world," he said.</P>
      <P>He acknowledged that e-Parliament is not any position to tell Taiwan what to do,
but said it wanted to make sure that Taiwanese lawmakers were fully aware of
success stories in other parts of the world.</P>
      <P>According to Dunlop, one important way to spread public awareness is by working
with parliamentarians who constantly communicate with those who elect them, and
likewise, citizens can participate and encourage their representatives to do
something.</P>
      <P>"Instead of a vicious circle of climate change, we can create a virtual  circle
of  mutual  education  between  citizens  and representatives," he said.</P>
      <P>The mission of e-Parliament, created in 2001, is to bring together legislators
from around the world to educate them about the problems and policy options that
have been tried in other countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to
make economies more environmentally friendly.</P>
      <P>The group will hold a two-day forum in Taipei beginning March 1 focusing on
climate change and what it means for Asia, both in terms of the dangers of
climate change and the opportunities for building clean energy industries in
Asia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cutting business tax is not only measure against inflation: MOEA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  29 (CNA)
02/29/08  17:38:04

    <TEXT>
      <P>Cutting business tax is only one of the tools that can be used to stabilize
currently rising inflation, not the only solution, said Minister of Economic
Affairs Steve R.L. Chen Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen said in a statement that some news media misinterpreted his comments at a
recent briefing with the opposition party Koumintang (KMT) caucus in the
Legislative Yuan, when he asked lawmakers to approve a business tax cut.</P>
      <P>The media reports said he intended to contain inflation only with a tax cut, and
that he had promised the tax cut will reduce commodity prices within a week.</P>
      <P>Chen said what he meant was that if the business tax on imported commodities,
such as corn and wheat, is cut to zero from the current 5 percent, his ministry
will demand that importers reduce domestic prices accordingly "within one week".</P>
      <P>Thomas Yeh, vice chairman of the Council of Economic Planning and Development,
downplayed the effectiveness of the tax cut, as he estimated only a 0.08 percent
decline in CPI would be achieved by such a cut in taxes this year.</P>
      <P>Yeh added that the real purpose of the tax cut is to boost consumer confidence
in the domestic market.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's consumers are suffering from sky rocketing global prices of raw
materials, with the country's consumer price index (CPI) rising 3 percent since
January.</P>
      <P>In addition to asking for the tax cut, the economic ministry has asked lawmakers
to adopt other measures to control inflation, including imposing export controls
on steel, sand and stone.</P>
      <P>Some of the measures have already been implemented, including setting up a
special fund that offers Taiwan's 4,300 small and medium size enterprises an
expanded amount of financing to help them offset their soaring import costs.</P>
      <P>Total financing for the enterprises is expected to reach NT$10.7 billion, which
will provide a lending equity of up to NT$15 million for each company which
applies for the assistance.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two tea dealers based in the southern county of Chiayi were convicted of fraud
Friday for conning Chinese tourists into buying their tea leaves at unreasonably
high prices.</P>
      <P>According to judges from the Chiayi District Court,  Wang Cheh-chien, 51, a tea
dealer based in Leyeh Village of Chiayi County's Alishan Township, was
discovered to have purchased ordinary tea leaves that were machine-collected
from tea fields in low-lying areas in the central county of Nantou since July
2005.</P>
      <P>He paid prices between NT$160 to NT$450 per 600 grams and then, after simply
processing the products, sold the tea leaves to visiting Chinese tourists at
more than 10 times the price he paid -- between NT$4,000-8,000 per 600 grams.</P>
      <P>Wang presented the leaves as hand-picked Oolong tea originating from the Alishan
mountains.</P>
      <P>Forty-five percent of the proceeds from the sales were paid to travel agents as
commissions for bringing the Chinese tourists to his shop, the judges said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Pai Ming-hui, 43, another Alishan Township tea dealer, was discovered
to have also purchased machine-collected, average tea leaves from low-lying
areas at NT$400 per 600 grams since early 2006 and then resold the products to
Chinese tourists as "Alishan high mountain Oolong tea" at prices ranging from
400 Chinese yuan (NT$1,550) to 480 yuan per 600 grams.</P>
      <P>Both Wang and Pai, who were charged in September 2006, admitted to conning the
Chinese tourists, according to the Chiayi judges.</P>
      <P>The judges decided to cut the sentence for Wang from one year and 10 months in
jail to 11 months, with three years' probation, after he expressed remorse and
offered to donate NT$450,000 for public interests.</P>
      <P>The 18-month sentence for Pai was also reduced to nine months in prison, with
three years' probation after he also expressed remorse and offered to donate
NT$300,000 to help the public, the judges said.</P>
      <P>Alishan is one of the tourist attractions that the Chinese tourists consider as
a "must see" in Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on
Friday accused main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-
jeou of adopting a "two-faced" approach to dealing with the 228 Incident of
1947.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference called by several DPP lawmakers, legislative
caucus whip Lai Ching-teh said that Ma's words have not matched his actions on
matters related to the 228 Incident, in which tens of thousands of local
Taiwanese were massacred in a crackdown by the KMT regime.</P>
      <P>Lai pointed out that although Ma has said the KMT should bear responsibility for
the 228 Incident and that he has promised to apologize to the family members of
the victims, he has still not made public any of his party's documents related
to the incident, adding that the party has frozen the Memorial Foundation of the
228 Incident's budget.</P>
      <P>Lai further said that Ma has not appointed Chang An-man, a family member of a
228 Incident victim, as a legislator-at-large despite saying that he would do
so, and that despite promising to establish a new national 228 memorial hall,
his party's lawmakers have frozen two-thirds of the budget for the existing 228
national memorial hall.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the news conference, DPP lawmaker Lin Shu-fen noted that KMT
lawmakers have also obstructed the budget for the Statute for the Handling of
and Compensation for the 228 Incident and have frozen NT$300 million (US$9.72
million) of the 228 foundation's budget.</P>
      <P>In response to Ma's blaming the Cabinet for listing the budget under the
Ministry of Education instead of the Ministry of the Interior, Lin noted that
the foundation's role according to the spirit of the law is to strengthen
education related to the incident and that this is the reason why its budget was
listed under the education ministry, claiming that Ma's comments that it was an
allocation error on the part of the Cabinet is a lie.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Legislator Chen Ting-fei, in response to Ma's remarks that the
truth behind the 228 Incident should be revealed, said that "the truth of the
matter is that the KMT doesn't want to face reality."</P>
      <P>At the time of the 228 Incident, many innocent people, including elite members
of society,  were blacklisted  and consequently victimized, Chen said, urging Ma
to make public the party's records so that people can know who compiled the name
lists that led to so much pain victims and their family members.</P>
      <P>She further  urged the KMT to use its assets to provide compensation to the
family members of victims of the incident to help bring them peace and closure.</P>
      <P>On Ma's remarks the previous day that corruption in the late President Chiang
Kai-shek's government led to the 228 Incident, DPP caucus whip Lai said that the
massacre did not stem from the authorities' attempt to suppress an uprising, but
rather from the KMT's desire to consolidate its control over the country, adding
that he suspects Ma may have been intentionally trying to "tamper with
historical facts."</P>

      <P>PC Home Online ranked the third on the list for its online shopping and home
delivery services which promise delivery within 24 hours.</P>
      <P>A total of 21 community Web sites joined the Top 100 list because of their

      <P>Most Taiwanese workers see China as a possible place of employment, with those
with backgrounds in the electronics, financial, insurance and medical fields the
best positioned to find work there, according to the results of a survey
released Friday.</P>
      <P>People  with  experience  in the  travel  and  recreation, international trade,
wholesale, retail, and information technology sectors were also considered to be
in advantageous positions, the results showed.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted Jan. 21-29 by the online employment broker 104 Job Bank
among 1,150 Taiwan businesses and 3,078 workers.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 18.6 percent of surveyed workers have had experience
working in China, 16.9 percent are looking for job opportunities in China and
45.1 percent have thought of working in China but have not made any move because
of various concerns. Only 19.4 percent have never considered working in China.</P>
      <P>While attracted to China's potential job market, many respondents were worried
about the lack of suitable job opportunities for them and about the difficulty
of finding information on China's job market, the results showed.</P>
      <P>Most respondents agreed that workers with managerial, trade, marketing, project
management and human resources expertise are in highest demand in China.</P>
      <P>However, although 16.8 percent of surveyed workers believed production and
manufacturing talent will remain popular in China, only 10.2 percent of surveyed
businesses think so.</P>
      <P>While 31.2 percent of surveyed workers thought those experienced in the
manufacturing industry enjoy good career prospects in China, only 20.7 percent
of surveyed businesses shared this opinion, the survey revealed.</P>

      <P>Nantou County has aggressively promoted itself as a relaxing tourist getaway
graced with natural beauty and cultural variety, and one of Japan's biggest
broadcasters seems to have gotten the message.</P>
      <P>A crew from the Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) , one of Japan's three major
television networks, recently visited one of the county's tea-growing centers,
Songboling Recreation Area in Mingjian Township, to film a program that will
spotlight Taiwan's tea culture and tea production process.</P>
      <P>The two-hour show on "Taiwanese tea" is scheduled to be broadcast in Japan on
March 11.</P>
      <P>The county's Sun Moon Lake is already a favorite destination of Japanese
tourists. But the county's promotion of its tea culture and scenic areas has led
even more Japanese and international travel agencies to make Nantou part of
their travel itineraries, said Hung Wen-neng, the director of the Nantou County
government's Bureau of Tourism.</P>
      <P>"Japan's biggest travel agency (JTB) alone expects to arrange tours to Nantou
this year for more than 3,000 Japanese travelers," Hung said.</P>
      <P>That number could easily go up, Hung said, after Japanese viewers get a good
look at the county's mountainous  vistas and tea plantations featured in the
program.</P>
      <P>The tourism official said the program's focus on Taiwanese tea confirmed Nantou
County Magistrate Lee Chao-ching's belief that, "the best tea in the world is in
Taiwan, and the best tea in Taiwan is that produced in Nantou County."</P>

      <P>Candidates will answer questions from five local media outlets and have a chance
to challenge each other in the second presidential debate slated for March 9,
debate organizers said Friday.</P>
      <P>The organizers agreed at a preparatory meeting Thursday that the second  debate
between  ruling  Democratic  Progressive  Party presidential candidate Frank
Hsieh and his Kuomintang rival Ma Ying-jeou would adopt the traditional debate
format used in the 2004 debate.</P>
      <P>The main difference is that media representatives will be asking the questions
rather than academics and experts, as was the case in 2004.</P>
      <P>Also, unlike in the first presidential debate on Feb. 24, the candidates will
not know the questions that are going to be asked beforehand.</P>
      <P>The debate, to be held at Public Television Service (PTS) , is expected to last
2 hours and 20 minutes, according to PTS Chairman Cheng Tung-liao.</P>
      <P>Based on the drawing of lots, Ma will open the debate with a six-minute
introduction and be followed by Hsieh, while at the end of the debate, Hsieh
will be the first to present a six-minute conclusion, followed by Ma, said Grace
Tu, a senior PTS producer.</P>
      <P>Following the candidates' opening statements, the candidates will both be asked
five questions,  one each from the five media representatives. The candidate to
whom the question is directed will have three minutes to answer, with his
opponent allowed one minute for a rebuttal.</P>
      <P>The questioners will come from five of the six co-organizers of the debate.
Those expected to be on the panel are Central News Agency President Liu Chih-
tsung, China Times President Lin Sheng-feng, Liberty Times Vice President Yu
Kuo-chi, United Daily News Group spokesman Hsiang Kuo-ning and Apple Daily
President Tu Nien-chung, Grace Tu said. PTS will moderate the debate.</P>
      <P>In the next section of the debate, the candidates will rotate in asking each
other five questions, with the person answering having 90 seconds to respond.</P>
      <P>The organizers are also taking the perceived shortcomings of the first encounter
between the two candidates into consideration in establishing the set for the
March 9 debate, Tu said.</P>
      <P>There were complaints that a 15-centimeter high stand that Hsieh stood on
actually made him appear taller than Ma but also caused him physical discomfort.</P>
      <P>"We want to create a more comfortable debate environment for the two cadidates
where they can feel free to speak, drink water or take notes," Tu added.</P>
      <P>In the first televised debate held Feb. 24, the two presidential candidates
answered  questions  from 20 citizens in 30-second pre-recorded video clips.</P>

      <P>Winter is a period of high incidence for urological problems, a health expert
said Friday, advising people traveling long-distance, especially the elderly, to
make plans to avoid having to withhold urination for a long period of time.</P>
      <P>Chou Gu, director of the Department of Urology at the Reshining Clinic in
Taipei, told reporters he has treated many cases of urological problems
involving mostly old people this winter.</P>
      <P>One patient was a 70-year-old man who had difficulty urinating after a five-day
overseas trip during which he had to withhold his urine frequently for long
periods.</P>
      <P>Another factor for the high incidence of urological disorders during winter is
that many people tend to hold urine longer than they should under a warm quilt
at night, not wanting to brave the cold air to get out of bed to take a leak,
Chou said.</P>
      <P>The health expert warned that the urinary bladder of an adult can hold about 400
c.c. of urine and that any amount more than that could lead to a urinary
retention disorder -- an accumulation of urine within the bladder because of the
inability to urinate.</P>
      <P>Withholding urination might also lead to renal inflammation or even kidney
failure, he said.</P>
      <P>Chou advised people who must travel for a long time on a transportation vehicle
without a toilet to avoid drinking large amounts of liquid two hours before
setting off.</P>

      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) forecasted Friday that temperatures in Taiwan
will tend to be near normal in the three months between March and May, offering
a reprieve after the country experienced abnormally chilly weather in February
due to the effects La Nina.</P>
      <P>The weather bureau also reported that near normal precipitation will be very
likely during the next three months.</P>
      <P>However, a high probability of below normal rainfall in March for the central
and northern parts of Taiwan may occur, the report said.</P>
      <P>Since last fall, the La Nina phenomenon has been dominating the tropical Pacific
Ocean, according to the bureau.</P>
      <P>Citing historical data, it said an occurrence of La Nina generally causes a
stronger winter monsoon in East Asia that may bring about colder weather down
south. But such a pattern may give rise to a high probability of a relatively
drier environment over Taiwan during early spring.</P>
      <P>The weather bureau reminded the public that heavy rainfall and thunderstorms
still could occur in March and April as the two months are typically part of
Taiwan's spring season and frontal systems with strong convective cells usually
form around Taiwan during that time, inducing rain.</P>
      <P>Additionally, dense fog would quite likely appear in this season along West
Taiwan, the CWB said, reminding drivers to be cautious on the road.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Legislative speaker calls for resolution of U.N.-bid dilemma</HEADLINE>

02/29/08  19:59:48

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng called for bipartisan efforts Friday to
deal with the potential dilemmas Taiwan will face regardless of the outcomes of
two proposed referendums on the country's bid for United Nations membership.</P>
      <P>Wang said that for the sake of safeguarding national interests, he hopes members
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) could work together to seek a pragmatic solution to the issue.</P>
      <P>As the Republic of China, Taiwan lost its seat in the United Nations to the
People's Republic of China in 1971, and has reapplied unsuccessfully for
membership in the world body every year since 1993.</P>
      <P>Last year was the first time Taiwan tried to apply for a U.N. seat under the
name "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Two referendums on the U.N. bid will be held alongside the March 22 presidential
election -- one initiated by the DPP on joining the U.N. under the name "Taiwan,
" the other proposed by the KMT on rejoining the U.N. under the name "Republic
of China" or any other "suitable" name.</P>
      <P>Wang said passage of the two referendums would cause jitters around the world,
but if the two measures were to fail, the damage would be even greater as the
international community would get a message that "Taiwan's people do not want to
enter or return to the U.N."</P>
      <P>That, Wang said, would give Beijing a fresh excuse to say that Taiwan's people
have not demanded sovereignty for the island and see it as merely a province of
China.</P>
      <P>He disclosed that officials from the Taipei Office of the American Institute in
Taiwan -- which represents U.S. interests in Taiwan in the absence of formal
ties between the two countries -- visited him last week to gain a better
understanding of the latest developments regarding the holding of the
referendums.</P>
      <P>The DPP recently called on the KMT to support each other's U.N. bid referendums
due to concern that the referendums might fail.</P>
      <P>As a result of that concern, there were voices calling for President Chen Shui-
bian to initiate a "defensive referendum" as a solution, but the president
rejected the idea on Feb. 26.</P>
      <P>Another possible option, having the Legislative Yuan initiate a new referendum,
is no longer viable because the legal deadline for proposing a new referendum
has passed.</P>

      <P>A 22-year-old student, suspected of inadvertently shooting a female college
student after firing his gun to prove it worked, turned himself in to the police
in Taipei Friday, law enforcement officials said.</P>
      <P>The police said that the suspect, a night student at a vocational school in the
northern city, fired the shot Tuesday from a classroom as class was in session
to prove to a friend that he possessed a workable modified pistol.</P>
      <P>The teacher, who saw the gun, thought it was a toy pistol and told the student
to put it away.</P>
      <P>Ignoring the warning, however, the student fired the gun a few minutes  later
and then ran from the classroom.  The teacher immediately reported the incident
to the police.</P>
      <P>The vocational school, Kainan High School of Commerce and Industry, is located
just across from the street from National Taiwan University's College of Law.</P>
      <P>It might be the first gunshot case on campus in the city, said Lin Teng-jiao,
the deputy chief of the city's Department of Education, Thursday.</P>
      <P>News of the incident emerged after the victim, a female student at National
Taiwan University was taken to the hospital after the errant bullet grazed her
abdomen, according to the police. They said the bullet was later discovered in
the dorm.</P>
      <P>The college student was standing by the window and chatting with a classmate in
her dorm room when the bullet hit her, police said.</P>
      <P>Under fire for the incident, education officials said there was little teachers
or schools could do to prevent random shootings.</P>
      <P>Wang Fu-lin, director of the Ministry of Education's Department of Military
Training Education, said Thursday that to protect students' rights, the ministry
bars teachers from searching students' schoolbags unless they have sufficient
evidence.</P>
      <P>Chen Kuo-liang, head of the city's Military Education Office, also said Thursday
that the ministry's regulations make it difficult for schools to prevent campus

      <P>The New Taiwan dollar may follow its gradual uptrend in the near future, with a
foreign exchange executive predicting Thursday that the currency may close at
NT$29 or NT$28 against the U.S. dollar later this year.</P>
      <P>The New Taiwan dollar has appreciated significantly during the last two weeks,
closing at NT$30.929 against the U.S. dollar on the Taipei Foreign Exchange
Wednesday, the highest level in three years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's currency has increased by NT$1.5 against the U.S. dollar since early
January, or 4 percent, a scale that trails only that of the Indonesian rupiah in
Asia.</P>
      <P>The currencies in Singapore and Malaysia also registered their record highs
since 1997.</P>
      <P>An executive of the Taiwan branch of a European bank who preferred to remain
anonymous attributed the strong New Taiwan dollar to the inflow of international
"hot money" to Asia, which pushed up most Asian currencies.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by the Securities and Futures Bureau under the
Financial Supervisory Commission, foreign capital worth US$3.44 billion has
poured into Taiwan from Feb. 1-22.</P>
      <P>Unlike last year when Taiwan's  Central  Bank adopted  an intervention policy to
constrain the appreciation of the New Taiwan dollar, this time the bank adopted
a "let go" policy to see its currency up after the Chinese Lunar New Year
vacation between Feb. 6-11, as it clearly perceived the rapid flow of
speculative capital in the local monetary market, the bank executive said.</P>
      <P>In addition to the outside factor of international "hot money, " the executive
pointed out, many countries in Asia have been inclined to allow their currencies
to appreciate  to resist "imported inflation" amid surging prices of imports,
such as crude oil, metals and cereals.</P>
      <P>Another factor attracting speculative capital to Taiwan is that the average
price-earnings ratio of Taiwan stocks stood at only 13.57 as of late January
compared to 15.31 registered in late December of last year, which makes
investing in Taiwan's stock market more profitable than ever, the executive
noted.</P>
      <P>"It is expected that we will see a continued strong New Taiwan dollar before
Taiwan's March 22 presidential election, but the value of the New Taiwan dollar
will still have to depend on the attitude of the Central Bank and international
economic environment," he added.</P>

      <P>Fifty-six publishers, writers, scholars and art performers, led by Locus
Publishing Chairman Rex How, launched a campaign called "Our Hopemap" Friday, in
a call for people around the country to refrain from stirring up ethnic
conflicts three weeks before the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Tuan Yi-kang, a spokesman for the campaign headquarters of the presidential
ticket of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, and his counterpart Chiu Shu-
ti of the opposition Kuomintang attended a press conference presided over by How
to accept the call, promising to undertake peaceful campaigning for their
party's respective candidate.</P>
      <P>Addressing the campaign, How said a Web site at www.hopemap.net was launched at
2: 30 p.m. Friday on which a "map of Taiwan's future" is under formation with
people urged to write down their hopes, opinions and suggestions to the
presidential candidates of the two parties.</P>
      <P>How said that he wants to raise the consciousness of fellow citizens through the
online Hopemap, which is composed of digital light dots.</P>
      <P>With the number of people writing down their wishes increasing, the size and
shape of the map will change, How said, noting that they hope to collect 3
million hopes from Friday to April 11 and to publish a book compiling the hopes,
presenting it to the new president at his inauguration on May 20 as a reference
for his future administration.</P>
      <P>At the press conference, How voiced three common hopes from all the Hopemap
campaign initiators, which include a hope that no one will act to stir up ethnic
conflicts; a hope for no war of words and malicious  smears during election
campaigns  and for the two presidential candidates to tell voters concretely how
they will help people build a better future if elected; and a hope for a
peaceful election on March 22.</P>
      <P>After the election, How further said, there are also two common hopes -- one
regarding expectations on the president-elect and the other involving giving
support to the candidate who loses the election.</P>
      <P>The campaign allows "the presidential candidates to hear another kind of voice
ahead of the election, and after the election may let us remind each other that
we still have a common future that need everyone to create together," How said.</P>

      <P>In what was described as a surprise move by many, opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou called on two key figures of the pro-
independence Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Friday.</P>
      <P>Meeting with surgeon Chien Cheng-shan and his wife and former TSU Legislator
Chien Lin Huei-chun in Tainan, southern Taiwan, Ma said the encounter was "not
an attempt to undercut the support base" of the "pan-green camp" comprised of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the TSU.</P>
      <P>He said that after the March 22 presidential election, a clean government is the
top priority.</P>
      <P>"Neither the belief in unification or independence will get anywhere," Ma said,
adding that "it is better to put one's efforts on common beliefs and values."</P>
      <P>"The urgent tasks for Taiwan are to improve the economy, a clean government,
social justice and cross-strait peace," Ma said.</P>
      <P>The Chiens, who hold considerable sway in the medical sector and at the
grassroots level in Tainan County and who maintain close relations with Lee
Teng-hui, the former president and the TSU's spiritual leader, have championed
Taiwan independence for years.</P>
      <P>Their meeting with Ma from the pro-unification KMT, caught many by surprise, but
Chien, while presenting Ma with a plaque inscribed with the words "wishing Ma
success, " refrained from openly endorsing him.</P>
      <P>Chien said that this meeting "was his own, " and he had not reported to Lee, the
spiritual leader of the TSU, and the TSU beforehand.</P>
      <P>Chien noted that he was the first doctor in Tainan's Doctor Association who took
to the streets and joined the DPP, and he had insisted on Taiwan's independence,
but with the rapid progress in society, he should not insist on his views of
more than 20 years ago.</P>
      <P>He said that "the transfer of power between different parties should be a normal
practice, and the solution to the root problem of corruption in politics."</P>
      <P>He stressed that he was not switching allegiance from "pan-green" to "pan-blue,"
saying that he belongs to "neither camp, " and that he is "Taiwanese."</P>
      <P>DPP presidential candidate Frank Hsieh for his part tried to play down the
significance of the meeting, saying that this does not mean that the former
president is endorsing Ma.</P>
      <P>"If Lee does take sides, many will follow suit, and not just the Chiens will
support Ma," Hsieh suggested.</P>
      <P>William Lai, caucus whip of the DPP in the legislature, said that the meeting
was an "individual act" of the Chiens, and not indicative of who Lee would
support.</P>
      <P>The KMT's playing up the meeting was a campaign gambit, Lai said.</P>
      <P>With more and more influential figures taking sides in the runup to the
presidential election, Ku Kuan-min, a former Presidential Office senior adviser,
said Lee was a "speculator, " referring to the coattail effects of the KMT
winning a huge victory in the Jan. 12 legislative election.</P>
      <P>Huang Kun-hu, president of a Lee Teng-hui supporters group, urged Lee to
publicly endorse Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Huang said that Lee has always advocated Taiwan identity, and Hsieh shared the
same view, and which is starkly different from Ma's view.</P>
      <P>Lee should not "keep quiet" at this critical time, but "should lend Hsieh
support by openly speaking up for him."</P>

      <P>The New Taiwan Dollar fell against the U.S. greenback Friday on central bank
intervention, but analysts believe that given the fundamentally weak dollar and
strong inflow of foreign capital, it may have been but a temporary blip in the
local currency's upward trend.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan dollar closed at 30.95 against the U.S. dollar (USD) , down 0.021
from its 30.929 close on Wednesday, but analysts believe the local currency will
test the 30.5 baseline in the near term. The local currency market was closed
Thursday, a national holiday.</P>
      <P>In Friday's trading, the Taiwan dollar surged in the morning on a net inflow of
foreign funds, hitting a high of NT$30.677 to the U.S. greenback. Turnover for
the morning session was US$1.644 billion (NT$50.9 billion), the second-highest
this year.</P>
      <P>In the afternoon session, however, the Central Bank of the Republic of China
(Taiwan) , intervened, buying as much as US$1 billion to reverse the Taiwan
dollar's rise for the day.</P>
      <P>The intervention by the central bank, which had taken a hands-off position since
the beginning of the year, pushed turnover for the day to US$3.498 billion, the
second highest in history.</P>
      <P>Despite Friday's small setback, the local currency has risen 4.6 percent for the
year.</P>
      <P>Michael Boyden,  managing director of Taiwan Asia Strategy Consulting, a Taiwan-
based consulting company, attributed the current surge in the local currency to
a potential political shift in Taiwan, saying that the upcoming presidential
election could be a decisive factor in whether so-called hot money will remain
in the local market.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan dollar gained only 3.6 percent from 1997 to 2006, a relatively mild
rise compared to Japan's yen and Korea's won against the U.S. dollar, which rose
22 percent and 78.7 percent during the same period of time.</P>
      <P>Referring to Taiwan's currency as undervalued by global investors in the past,
Boyden also stressed that Taiwan's companies are in fact global players that
have begun to catch the world's attention in recent years.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's companies are getting better in a lot of ways including product
branding, and have become the leading exporters among Asian countries," he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's trade surplus grew 28.4 percent in 2007 to US$27.38 billion.</P>

      <P>With Taiwan becoming an increasingly aging society, women and people between the
ages of 50 and 64 will be encouraged to join the labor force and maintain the
labor force participation rate, the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) said Friday.</P>
      <P>CEPD observed that although Taiwan's population is gradually aging, the overall
labor force participation rate has not come down, because more female workers,
especially those between 25 and 49 years of age, have joined the labor force
than in previous years.</P>
      <P>"If we can encourage people to work, the decline in the size of the labor force
due to an aging population structure could be held in check,  and thus the labor
force participation rate could be maintained, " a CEPD official said.</P>
      <P>The labor force participation rate is the ratio of the labor force to the
overall size of the national population in the same age bracket.</P>
      <P>Since 2002, the central government has encouraged women and people between 50-64
years old to join the labor market by creating job opportunities, ensuring
expectant mothers' rights and giving parental leave.</P>
      <P>The CEPD also vowed to improve vocational training and formulate a system that
would help workers to look after both their families and their jobs.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Friday that the growth of Taiwan's Consumer Price
Index (CPI) is relatively low compared to that of other countries.</P>
      <P>In response to a question from ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
legislator Wang Hsing-nan, Chang indicated that Taiwan's CPI growth was 2.96
percent in January, lower than the 6.6 percent registered in Singapore, 4.4
percent in the United States and 3.9 percent in South Korea.</P>
      <P>Citing the example of South Korea, Chang said that although it enjoys a higher
per capita annual income than that of Taiwan, its real purchasing power is lower
than that of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The premier also noted that while South Korean President Lee Myung-bak had
promised to keep South Korea's CPI growth under 3 percent, the DPP government
hopes to control Taiwan's CPI growth under 2 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said the government has adopted several measures to prevent the
price of reinforcing steel bars, or rebars, from rising higher, including
allowing duty-free treatment for rebar imports and temporarily  banning exports
of Taiwan-made  rebar beginning March 5.</P>
      <P>Chang provided the assurance after many builders complained that they were
having difficulty continuing their construction projects due to the soaring
price of steel products.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Amid a cold snap that has lingered in Taiwan for about three weeks, the fish
farming industry in the southern county of Tainan has sustained an initial loss
of over NT$16 million (US$516,000) in February, the county's agricultural
affairs bureau reported Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the latest statistics compiled by the bureau, damage of aquatic
products has been reported from the county's townships, including Cigu
Jiangjyun, Syuejia, Beimen and Madou.</P>
      <P>Fish and other sea products died as a result of continuous low temperatures
which hit Taiwan since the beginning of this month and still remained.</P>
      <P>Among the various species of high-value fish raised by local fish farmers,
milkfish, farmed in a total area of about 174-hectare fishing ponds, posted the
most serious loss of NT$11.6 million.</P>
      <P>Damage sustained by fishermen who raise Taiwan tilapia and grouper meanwhile
reached more than NT$1.5 million, the bureau reported.</P>
      <P>Farmers who raise other sorts of sea creatures such as perch, blackfish and clam
also suffered losses ranging from tens of thousands of New Taiwan dollars to one
million New Taiwan dollars, according to the bureau.</P>
      <P>The damage suffered by the industry has driven up prices of seafood. The price
of a popular Taiwanese dish, oyster omelet, for example, has risen from NT$40 to
NT$50 per dish.</P>
      <P>Reprieve is unlikely to come soon, as the bureau warned farmers that a fresh
cold spell will hit in the coming days.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's aquaculture industry is clustered in Yunlin, Tainan and Chiayi counties
in central and southern Taiwan, as well as the outlying Penghu Island. The
island's losses had amounted to at least NT$180 million by Feb. 20.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's state-run petroleum company, CPC Corp., Taiwan, signed a contract
Friday to purchase liquefied natural gas from Woodside Co., a leading
independent Australian oil and gas company, in a deal that could potentially be

Taiwan and Australia.</P>
      <P>CPC Chairman Pan Wenent and Woodside Chief Executive Officer Don Voelte signed
the deal at the Sydney Opera House, with Chen and Australian Minister for Trade
Simon Crean witnessing the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Under the deal, Woodside will begin exporting two million to three million tons
of liquefied natural gas a year to Taiwan, which would account for 25 percent of
Taiwan's yearly demand. The deal would last for 15-20 years.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and China should hold negotiations to facilitate the mobility of
professionals, industry and capital under the World Trade Organization (WTO)
framework to ensure the rights of Taiwan's professionals, Mainland Affairs
Council Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun said Friday.</P>
      <P>Liu called for negotiations after China announced Wednesday that it would allow
Taiwan's medical professionals to practice in China.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Affairs Office under China's State Council said that doctors from
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau who have legally practiced medicine for at least
five years, are certified specialists, and are currently practicing in medical
institutions can apply to practice medicine in China.</P>
      <P>Liu said, however, that China was unwilling to negotiate details on the movement
of professionals,  which would leave Taiwan's professionals who want to work in
China in the future vulnerable to risks.</P>
      <P>The MAC official cited the experiences of many of Hong Kong's doctors who
practiced in China after the signing of the Closer Economic Partnership
Arrangement (CEPA) in 2003.</P>
      <P>A number returned to Hong Kong, Liu said, because of disputes caused by the
disparity in the salary levels and medical systems of China and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>He also called on the government to be aware of the consequences of allowing
medical professionals to work in China, saying it would have the same effect as
Taiwan's export of agricultural products across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Liu said the exports have helped China learn Taiwan's advanced growing
techniques, enabling China to crowd out Taiwan's products with its own.</P>
      <P>The MAC official said China decided to allow Taiwan's doctors to work there in
order to resolve its shortage of medical resources and achieve its political
goal of unification with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liu pointed out that Article 33 of the Statute Governing Relations Between
People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area stipulates that Taiwanese people
who want to work in Chinese organizations have to obtain permission from the
government.</P>
      <P>He acknowledged, however, that Taiwan is a democratic country, and it is
difficult for the government to impose strict restrictions on the mobility of
professionals, industry, or capital.</P>
      <P>International organizations such as the WTO can help strive for legal
protections and rights that will benefit Taiwan's people, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh
Friday called on his rival not to boycott referendums supporting membership for
Taiwan in the United Nations, saying such a move would be contrary to the
Kuomintang (KMT) candidate's profession of his love for the country.</P>
      <P>Speaking during the second session of a campaign forum in which the two
candidates expound their platforms and attacked their rivals, Hsieh said that
KMT candidate Ma Ying-jeou should not repeat the KMT's boycott of referendums
held alongside the Jan. 12 legislative polls.</P>
      <P>The U.N. referendums -- proposed by both the DPP and the KMT, with each
supporting using different names for the country's bid -- will be held alongside
the March 22 presidential polls.</P>
      <P>Ahead of the January polls, the KMT urged eligible voters not to claim
referendum ballots, arguing that the DPP government tied the two referendums to
the elections to increase turnout among DPP supporters.</P>
      <P>The DPP-sponsored referendum early this year was aimed at recovering the "ill-
gotten" assets amassed by the KMT during its decades of authoritarian rule in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>By contrast, the KMT-proposed referendum was aimed at authorizing the
legislature to investigate corrupt top government officials.</P>
      <P>In the end, neither referendum had a turnout of 50 percent of eligible voters
required for them to be considered valid. The KMT won a landside victory in the
legislative polls, garnering 81 seats in the 113-seat legislature, nearly three
quarters, while the DPP only took 27 seats.</P>
      <P>The forum was the first of four Central Election Commission (CEC) organized
campaign forums.</P>

      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou put
forward a concrete timetable of direct  airlinks  with China Friday,  vowing
that weekend cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights will be launched starting July
1 if he is elected.</P>
      <P>Ma made the pledge in a written statement presented at a meeting with
representatives from the local hi-tech sector and investment companies.</P>
      <P>Pledging to immediately implement direct charter flights between Taiwan and
China from July 1 if he is elected president on March 22, Ma also promised that
daily charter flights and normal commercial flights between the two sides will
be realized in a piecemeal fashion.</P>
      <P>According to Ma's written statement,  the KMT presidential candidate stressed
that he will begin bilateral negotiations on the opening of direct Taiwan-China
airlinks as soon as he assumes the presidency on May 20, if elected.</P>
      <P>Apart from direct cross-strait charter flights on weekends from July 1, Ma
promised that daily charter flights across the strait will take off by the end
of this year and regularly scheduled flights between the two sides by June next
year.</P>
      <P>During a meeting with representatives from the construction industry and
architecture associations later the same day, the KMT presidential candidate
also delved into his program on welcoming Chinese tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with the establishment of direct airlinks across the strait, his
administration will bring about the opening of Taiwan to Chinese tourists as
quickly as possible upon his inauguration, Ma stated.</P>
      <P>If elected, Ma said, a maximum level of 3,000 Chinese tourists will be allowed
to enter Taiwan each day in the initial stage from July 1 this year. Moreover,
he added, the number will be raised to 5,000 people per day in the second year
of the opening, 7,000 people per day in the third year of the opening and 10,000
per day in the fourth year.</P>
      <P>More than one million Chinese tourists would be allowed to visit Taiwan in the
first year, and such an entry would generate NT$60 billion worth of revenues for
related businesses in the first year, Ma explained.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the opening to Chinese tourists, an additional 40,000 jobs could be
created in the first year and an additional 120,000 jobs in the fourth year, Ma
said in the statement, adding that Taiwan's economy would grow by at least six
percent each year.</P>
      <P>With an improved economy, Taiwan's jobless rate will fall below 3 percent within
four years from the current level of some 3.9 percent and an annual per-capita
income of US$30,000 will be achieved in eight years, up from the current
US$17,000, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>Ma voiced hope of turning Taiwan into a transportation hub for the Asia-Pacific
region and the rest of the world after cross-strait air and shipping links are
set up, enabling Taiwan to play a more prominent role for multi-national
enterprises and those seeking globalization.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's strategic location west of China, east of the United States, south of
Japan and north of the member states of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations will turn the country into a key business operations center if direct
China links are put in place, he contended.</P>
      <P>The KMT presidential candidate also reiterated his plans to improve Taiwan's
infrastructure, to ease the tax burden on the public and remove the disputed 40
percent ceiling on investment restrictions by Taiwanese companies in China.</P>

university professors.</P>
      <P>The statement said that both the ruling Democratic Progressive Party

related to Taiwan's future, leaving the group worried about the consequences of
the upcoming election.</P>
      <P>The alliance will ask hard questions of the two candidates in various forms to
force them to clearly state their positions and policies, enabling voters to
have clear choices.</P>
      <P>Questions to be asked include those about the two candidates' ethics, their
future teams, national policies, and positions on Taiwan's sovereignty, to let
the voters see the difference between the two candidates and their parties.</P>
      <P>According to the statement, the "snowball effect" seen in the media following
the KMT's massive victory in the legislative elections had prevented the silent
majority from having a voice, leading to a "collective anxiety."</P>
      <P>The Taipei Society called on intellectuals who have the ability to stand up for
silenced voters to join the alliance and challenge the two candidates over their
ability to be Taiwan's leader.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In their second face-to-face encounter before a national audience, Taiwan's two
presidential hopefuls bickered over a number of major issues, from personal
integrity, and the viability of their national development plans, to China
policy.</P>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou of the opposition Kuomintang and Frank Hsieh of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party conducted their first of four "policy forums"
organized by the Central Election Committee, in which each candidate had two
periods of 15 minutes to present their policies.</P>
      <P>In their initial presentations, Hsieh focused on "Taiwanese Reformation" while
Ma stressed building "a clean and competent government."</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that Taiwan's people have repeatedly defied the government throughout
the island's history when the island was ruled by the Dutch, the Ching Dynasty,
the Japanese and the KMT, because "people could not choose their own fate, nor
be the masters of their own."</P>
      <P>Describing the president as "the guardian of a country, " Hsieh said that the
Taiwanese should stand up together to safeguard their ancestor's  dream of
freedom and was therefore introducing  a "Taiwanese Reformation" modeled on the
Japanese Meiji Reformation of the 19th century.</P>
      <P>He strongly criticized Ma's policy of a "one-China common market," which he
claimed would allow for the free flow of people goods and information.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan does not need to sacrifice its dignity for 0.3 percent GDP growth,"
Hsieh said, saying that the country's 5.7 percent GDP growth in 2007 was only
0.3 percent below the 6 percent growth proposed by Ma.</P>
      <P>"Happiness is in our own hands, " Hsieh said, adding that only by uniting can
Taiwan have a bright future.</P>
      <P>He proposed to reform the tax system by reducing the inheritance tax and
corporate income tax rates as well as increasing the standard deductions claimed
by taxpayers to help women, the elderly, children and minority groups.</P>
      <P>Ma rebutted Hsieh's characterization of the "one-China common market, " denying
that he had ever proposed the concept.</P>
      <P>What he advocated  was forging  a "comprehensive  economic cooperation
agreement" with China and give "six assurances" to guarantee that Taiwan would
not be overwhelmed by Chinese laborers or goods.</P>
      <P>Among the assurances were promises that Chinese agricultural products would not
be allowed to enter Taiwan, Chinese workers would not be allowed to work in
Taiwan, and Chinese academic diplomas would not be recognized for people
applying for professional licenses.</P>
      <P>Ma said his goal was to "normalize" the economic relationship between China and
Taiwan and opening up the country to Chinese tourists would be his top priority
if he gets elected.</P>
      <P>Under Ma's plan, 3,000 Chinese tourists a day would visit Taiwan during the
first year, injecting an estimated NT$60 billion (US$1.9 billion) into the
economy, and increase 10,000 tourists a day in four years, creating 120,000 job
opportunities.</P>
      <P>"What we need is a clean and competent government, " Ma said, listing his main
priorities  as "a vibrant economy,  a clean government, a just society and
peaceful cross-strait relations."</P>
      <P>Ma said that opening up to China can bring great opportunities for Taiwan,
stressing that "it is time for change" from an indecisive, corrupt government to
one that is honest and just and can lead Taiwan to a brighter future.</P>
      <P>The roughly one-hour forum allowed the presidential candidates to make two
separate 15-minute presentations. Although there was no direct cross-
examination, both candidates seized every possible opportunity to question and
attack his opponent.</P>
      <P>It was the first of four Central Election Commission -- organized campaign
forums for the two rival presidential candidates with Public Television Service
providing a live broadcast of the event. The second televised forum is slated
for March 7.</P>
      <P>The two candidates had already faced off in a debate organized by six media
organizations in which Taiwanese citizens asked Hsieh and Ma pre-recorded
questions.</P>
