    <HEADLINE>US SENATORS EXPRESSING CONCERNS ABOUT BEIJING TOWARDS CLINTON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  July 31 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thirty-two US Republican senators have
written to President Bill Clinton expressing their concern that
"Beijing may be planning to take actions that would have the effect
of blocking Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization."</P>
      <P>In a joint letter dated July 27, Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) wrote
that according to press reports, the PRC recently offered a proposal
at the WTO calling for the organization to "recognize the PRC's
position that Taiwan is part of the mainland."</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is the United States' eighth largest trading partner, and
we support its admission to the WTO as soon as it meets the criteria
for membership," emphasized the senators.</P>
      <P>The letter noted that on several occasions, Clinton
administration officials have indicated that Taiwan's accession to
the WTO would closely follow the PRC's.</P>
      <P>For example, in response to a February statement by Sen. William
Roth, Jr. (R-Del.) that "there is a great concern that Taiwan might
be blocked from entering the WTO once China secures such membership,"
Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky testified that "the US would do
everything in its power to ensure that does not happen because
Taiwan's entry is also critical."</P>
      <P>The senators then asked Clinton to "clarify whether your
administration continues to believe that Taiwan's entry into the WTO
is critical, whether you remain committed to that goal, and whether
you remain convinced that Taiwan will enter the WTO within days after
the PRC's accession."</P>
      <P>Moreover, they asked Clinton, "is the administration aware of
any efforts by the PRC to impose extraordinary terms and conditions
on Taiwan's accession to the WTO? What specific assurances has
Beijing provided regarding the timing and substance of Taiwan's
accession to the WTO? And what action has your administration taken
to ensure that Taiwan will in fact join the WTO immediately following
the PRC's accession?"</P>
      <P>"We would appreciate a response to this inquiry by August 18 in
order to consider its contents prior to the Senate debate on
extending permanent normal trade relations to the PRC," said the
senators.</P>
      <P>Among those who signed the letter were Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott (R-Miss.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign
Relations Jesse Helms (R-NC), Chairman of the Committee on Government
Affairs Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.), and Chairman of the Energy Committee
Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska).</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOP PLATFORM REAFFIRMS COMMITMENTS TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Philadelphia,  July  31  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US Republican Party on Monday
reaffirmed its commitments to Taiwan and its firm opposition to any
use of force as a way of resolving the differences between the island
and mainland China.</P>
      <P>In a platform adopted by delegates meeting in Philadelphia for
the party's national convention, the GOP said that a Republican
president "will honor our promises to the people of Taiwan, a
long-standing friend of the United States and a genuine democracy".</P>
      <P>On the question of providing for Taiwan's self-defense, the
Republican Platform 2000 says that "Taiwan deserves American's strong
support, including the timely sale of defensive arms to enhance its
security".</P>
      <P>"We deny the right of Beijing to impose its rule on the free
Taiwanese people. All issues regarding Taiwan's future must be
resolved peacefully and must be agreeable to the people of Taiwan,"
says the platform.</P>
      <P>"If China violates these principles and attacks Taiwan, then the
United States will respond appropriately in accordance with the
Taiwan Relations Act. America will help Taiwan defend itself," it
continues.</P>
      <P>In line with the US position against any use of military force in
the Taiwan Strait, Paul Wolfowitz, a former undersecretary of Defense
and currently a key advisor to the GOP presidential candidate George
W. Bush, said Monday that if Beijing resorts to the use of force, the
result would be catastrophic.</P>
      <P>While acknowledging the good will the Republican Party shows
toward Taiwan through its platform, Chien-jen Chen, Taipei's
representative to the United States said platforms do not always
reflect the actual practices of US presidents.</P>
      <P>The GOP platform supports the accession to the World Trade
Organization of both mainland China and Taiwan, but also indicates
that it considers mainland China "America's key challenge in Asia".</P>
      <P>It says that Beijing represses political expression at home and
unsettles neighbors abroad and that mainland China is a country in
transition, so US policies toward Beijing should be "firm and
steady."</P>
      <P>The platform says that the United States hopes for the advent of
a free and prosperous China and that conflict between the two
countries is not inevitable.</P>
      <P>"Republicans support China's accession to the World Trade
Organization, but this will not be a substitute for, or lessen the
resolve of, our pursuit of improved human rights and an end to
proliferation of dangerous technologies by China," stresses the
platform statement.</P>
      <P>It says that mainland China is "a strategic competitor of the
United States rather than a strategic partner," a term used by the
current Democratic administration.</P>
      <P>It adds that a Republican government "will understand the
importance of China but not place China at the center of its Asia
policy".</P>
      <P>Elsewhere, the platform indicates that "America's foreign policy
in Asia starts with its allies," such as Japan, South Korea, and
Australia, which "are critical to building and expanding peace,
security, and prosperity in East Asia, and is joined by long-standing
friends like Singapore, Indonesia, Taiwan, and New Zealand."</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROLLER COAST MOST DANGEROUS OF ALL CARNIVAL RIDES: STUDY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, July 31 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The roller coaster is the most dangerous of
all amusement park rides, according to a new consumer study.</P>
      <P>The US Consumer Product Safety Commission released a study on
Monday that shows injuries from all amusement-park rides have been on
the increase, doubling over the past three years.</P>
      <P>According to the study, 7,260 people were injured on rides in
1999, an increase of 12 percent over 1998's level and an almost 50
percent increase over 1996's number of 3,720.</P>
      <P>Roller coasters were responsible for 15 of 49 deaths at US
amusement parks from 1987 to 1999. The next most dangerous type was
what the study called "whirling" rides, which killed 10 people since
1987, followed by water rides, which killed five people over the same
period.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WATER AND FOOD SHORTAGES POSE SECURITY THREAT TO ASIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  1  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Looming water and food shortage pose a
possible security threat to East Asian security in the near future,
warned a leading Australian expert on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The availability of food and fresh water is almost certain to
become a significant security issue for East Asia and Australia" in
this era of environmental scarcity, wrote Dr. Alan Dupont, the
director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Australian
National University in Canberra, in article published by The
Australian.</P>
      <P>He said the United Nations estimates that by 2025 most East Asian
states will experience serious water shortages unless strong action
is taken to reverse the trend.</P>
      <P>"Indonesia and China are of particular concern. Jakarta is
rapidly running out of potable water, while more than 300 cities in
northern China suffer from chronic water shortages," he said.</P>
      <P>"So much water is being taken from the Yellow River for
irrigation and industry that this great river, the cradle of Chinese
civilization, failed to reach the sea in 1972 for the first time in
3000 years," he added.</P>
      <P>"Less water for irrigation means less food, particularly in East
Asia, which due to its reliance on rice, depends on irrigated land to
a far greater extent than other regions of the world," he pointed
out.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS LOW APPROVAL RATING FOR FOREIGN MINISTRY PERFORMANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of local people are not
satisfied with the overall performance of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) over the past year, according to the results of a
recent public opinion poll released on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey of 1,158 randomly selected adult residents,
conducted by the MOFA from July 14-17, found that only 16.7 percent
of those interviewed said they were either "very satisfied" or
"satisfied" with the ministry's performance.</P>
      <P>In contrast, 59.8 percent said they felt that the MOFA's
general operation was either so-so, unsatisfactory or very
unsatisfactory. The remaining 23.5 percent either declined to answer
the question or said they had no opinion about the issue.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that the MOFA has conducted a public
opinion poll to gauge public views about the ministry's performance,
service quality, major policy goals and measures as well as attitude
toward the Republic of China's bid to join the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Poll results show that 36 percent of the respondents were
content with the MOFA's services in passport issue, document
verification and overseas emergency relief assistance; 18.6 percent
said they felt the ministry's operations in these fields were so-so;
13.7 percent said they were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with
the MOFA's services; and 30.1 percent didn't answer the question.</P>
      <P>"A cross-analysis of survey results finds that the comparatively
low approval rating for the ministry's overall performance mainly
because of local people's perception that the ROC faces an
unfavorable international situation due to Beijing's diplomatic
embargo against Taiwan," said Lo Chih-cheng, director of the MOFA's
Research and Planning Board.</P>
      <P>The analysis also found that the ministry's direct services to
local people have received a relatively higher approval rating. Lo
attributed the trend mainly to the fact that direct contacts have
helped the general public gain a better understanding of MOFA staff's
working attitude and service quality.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 33.72 percent of those surveyed said they saw almost
no change to the ROC's international profile over the past few years;
25.8 percent said they felt that the ROC's international stature is
gradually rising; while 18 percent said they found that the ROC's
status is declining.</P>
      <P>Touching on the new government's priority tasks in the
diplomatic domain, 36.9 percent said the top priority should be
given to seeking accession to major international organizations;
17.8 percent said "cementing existing diplomatic ties and forging
new formal relations with other countries" should top the MOFA's
work list; and 17.1 percent cited "strengthening ties with major
powers, such as the United States and Japan" as the most urgent
diplomatic task.</P>
      <P>Another interesting finding was that most of those who saw a
rise in Taiwan's international profile were supporters of the
Democratic Progressive Party, also the ROC's new ruling party, Lo
said.</P>
      <P>As for the relatively high percentage of the people who
selected "joining international organizations" as the top
diplomatic priority, Lo said the finding indicates that local
people are generally aware of Taiwan's diplomatic plights and
support the government's plan to enhance the nation's international
profile by increasing participation in government-to-government or
non-government international organizations.</P>
      <P>The same poll found that 46.3 percent think the government should
work even harder to promote Taiwan's UN bid; 21.8 percent said the
government should slow its UN promotional work; and 17.6 percent said
the government should suspend its UN bid and renew it at a more
opportune time in the future.</P>
      <P>Moreover, 51.9 percent said they don't think that the government
should compromise on its national title and sovereign status while
seeking to join official international organizations, but 33.3
percent throw support behind the proposal.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 48.1 percent said they think that
maintaining the number of the ROC's diplomatic allies at a certain
level is very important because a decrease in the number could affect
national interests and security. Nevertheless, 51.2 percent said they
feel that international humanitarian relief work should take
precedence over seeking new diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 82.9 percent support the MOFA's plan to
set up a diplomacy college to expand talent cultivation to join the
country's diplomatic corps. (BY Sofia Wu)</P>

(By Yolanda Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) on
Tuesday announced a reduction in oil prices, with an average
decrease of 1.66 percent, effective on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>This represents the first time the CPC has lowered oil prices
since April, 1999. Since then, it has increased oil prices nine
times.</P>
      <P>With the reduction, the price of gasoline will decrease by
NT$0.3O per liter and that of diesel by NT$0.20 per liter.</P>
      <P>The CPC oil price reduction is based on the price of import crude
oil, at US$21.80 per barrel, and on the currency rate of NT$31.02
against the US dollar.</P>
      <P>The new price of 98 octane unleaded gasoline will be NT$20.3 per
liter and that of 95 octane unleaded gasoline will be NT$19.3 per
liter.</P>
      <P>The CPC also cited the benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI)
oil price, which is now at US$28 per barrel. In addition, Saudi
Arabia is also increasing its oil production. As the international
oil price is expected to continue coming down in the future, the CPC
has decided to cut down domestic prices.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 80 percent of the people of Taiwan
support the idea of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) setting up
a foreign relations school, a MOFA official reported on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of a recent survey conducted by MOFA, C. C.

82.9 percent of Taiwan's populace back the ministry's idea of
establishing such an institute to help cultivate greater foreign
affairs skills in the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>As Foreign Affairs Minister Tien Hung-mao has consistently
reiterated his determination to promote "diplomacy for all the
people" since assuming his post on May 20, Lo said the poll indicates
a need to combine mainstream public opinion with the government's
foreign policy.</P>
      <P>According to Lo, the ministry has always wished to set up a
foreign relations school to allow more interested people to join the
foreign affairs camp, as it would allow the people to gain a better
understanding of the government's difficulties in promoting foreign
relations and diplomatic missions.</P>
      <P>In the future, MOFA will actively coordinate with relevant
government agencies, such as the Ministry of Audit and the

    <HEADLINE>FULL TEXT OF PRESIDENT CHEN SHUI-BIAN'S PRESS CONFERENCE (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
held his second press conference at the Office of the President on
Monday. The following is the full text of the conference, including
his opening remarks and replies to questions:</P>
      <P>I. Remarks by Secretary-General Chang</P>
      <P>Mr. President, Deputy Secretaries-General Chen and Chien,
Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen from the Local and Foreign
Media: First, on behalf of the Office of the President, I would like
to welcome you to today's presidential press conference. Time passes
quickly, as it has been more than a month since the last press
conference. During this time, several changes have taken place both
at home and abroad. Internationally, the leaders of the eight major
industrialized nations have convened a summit meeting and issued a
joint declaration. Domestically, political, economic, and social
development has entered a new phase and urgently demands that the
government carry out its agenda with greater efficiency and team
spirit. In cross-strait relations, we are moving towards an even more
moderate direction. In foreign relations, the president wants Taiwan
not only to stand up but also to reach out overseas. How this nation
and society will further develop is a common concern of all our
citizens, and you are all certainly interested in the president's
views on these issues. This is the main purpose of today's press
conference. Let us first invite the president to deliver his address
and then open the session to questions by our friends from the media.</P>
      <P>II. Opening Remarks by President Chen</P>
      <P>Secretary-General Chang, Deputy Secretaries-General Chen and
Chien, GIO Director-General Chung, Ladies and Gentlemen from the
Media: Good morning!</P>
      <P>Thank you for taking time from your busy schedules to attend my
second press conference since assuming office [as president]. A week
ago, in this room, the Office of the President held its monthly Dr.
Sun Yat-sen commemoration session. Together, we listened to a special
report on Taiwan's human rights by writer Bo Yang and watched a
20-minute documentary entitled "Farewell to the Age of Weeping
Mothers." The film showed the human rights monument on Green Island,
and beneath each of the many names on this monument was written the
time of imprisonment. These might have been only numbers, yet they
represent the innumerable nights of darkness and the countless
numbers of mothers who cried alone through endless nights. I believe
that although this period of "white terror" is now history, memory of
the blood and tears of that time still burn in the hearts of many
people, even today. This serves as a reminder and a reflection for
our government. As Mr. Bo Yang has said, we can understand,
accommodate, and even forgive the wrongs and sins that the government
committed in the past. But we definitely cannot forget, for if we do,
history may repeat itself, and some events may happen again.</P>
      <P>I have a very strong sense of mission. Therefore, I made it a
special point in my inaugural address on May 20 that the Republic of
China must be formally included in the international human rights
system, and our people must have the opportunity to contribute their
best to safeguarding international human rights. We hope that we will
have the opportunity to abide by the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as
well as the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the
World Conference on Human Rights.</P>
      <P>This is why I say that we must include international human rights
in our legal code, so that it will become part of our own
institutions after approval by the Legislative Yuan. In other words,
we must have a Taiwan human rights code that grows and advances with
the rest of the world. Most important, we must push for the
establishment of a national human rights committee. Whether it is to
be placed in the Office of the President, the Executive Yuan, or the
Control Yuan, I believe that we must overcome all difficulties and
make our best effort to quickly realize this goal. In order to ensure
that a national human rights committee is established as soon as
possible, we must set up a national human rights advisory committee
in the Office of the President. I hope to find a suitable individual
who is interested and willing to sacrifice, contribute, and research
human rights. This person will lead the committee and invite local
and foreign experts, scholars, human rights organizations, and their
volunteers to work with us in a committed effort to make the Republic
of China a new model of human rights in the 21st century.

    <HEADLINE>PRESS CONFERENCE (II)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Of course, we must still remember what Mr. Bo Yang once told us,
that we have taken a big step forward in the areas of democracy and
human rights, and, as long as the government can continue to accept
the most severe criticism from the people and thus nourish itself, we
will have the opportunity to become a truly democratic country. The
people must also continually reflect and learn. Only then can the
wonderful dream of democracy and human rights be sustained.</P>
      <P>We have learned from the 921 earthquake that we must always be
prepared for the attacks and trials of nature. The July 22 Pachang
River incident taught us a painful lesson; that is, when our citizens
encounter danger and life-threatening obstacles, they want to know
where their government is. Just as they seek help from Matsu, Buddha
and God, people also want the government to save them in time of
need. The Pachang River incident claimed four precious lives and left
four families with everlasting sorrow. More important, the incident
reflected that the new administration had inherited old bureaucracy,
old ways of thinking and old attitudes from the previous
administration. Certain public employees continue to think in old
ways regardless of the birth of a new administration. As the leader
of the nation, I was very upset and very ashamed to see the tragic
scenes of this incident. How could something that is not supposed to
happen be allowed to occur?</P>
      <P>On behalf of the government, I would like to again express my
deepest sympathy to the victims, their families, and the general
public. I am very sorry that our government allowed this accident to
happen. I firmly believe that their deaths should not be in vain. Our
Vice Premier, Yu Shyi-kun, has already stepped down to take political
responsibility for this incident. However, I believe that even if we
take political responsibility, these four precious lives can never be
restored. In addition to assuming responsibility, the government must
take good care of the families of the victims. We must learn a lesson
from this, and review any deficiencies in the government. We
sincerely hope that this kind of accident will never happen again.</P>
      <P>The Disaster Prevention and Relief Act was finally enacted and
put into force on July 19. Yet within three days of my signing it
into law, this unfortunate incident occurred. Our Vice Premier Yu
Shyi-kun has stepped down to shoulder political responsibility.
Although the Disaster Prevention and Rescue Committee is not yet
formally in operation, it does not mean that there is nothing we can
do. The incident revealed major problems in the disaster prevention
and rescue system as well as in the communication and coordination
system of our government. Certain contradictory, vague and gray areas
exist in the current disaster prevention and rescue system.
Nevertheless, these are not reasons for the government to evade
responsibility. We will never shirk responsibility. Instead, the
government should criticize itself and examine its mistakes. We have
seen from this incident that there are problems in the attitudes and
thinking of many government officials. As an old saying goes, "Laws
cannot enforce themselves." More regulations and laws will still be
useless if we don't conduct enough training and cultivate the ability
to respond to problems. I believe that if our government officials,
from the central to the local level, cannot bear the highest
principle that "human life is precious and saving life is the first
priority," then similar incidents may happen again. By that time, it
would be too late for government officials to apologize and resign
from posts. As a result, I believe that we need to make great efforts
and do better in certain areas. I would like to remind our government
officials that we are not doing very well and it is true that we have
let the public down.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>However, we should not let this one incident affect our
determination to strive harder in the future. In other words, all
civil servants should realize the meaning of a "government for all
people." In a "government for all people" the government exists for
the people, and without them, there would be no government. The
people not only supervise the government, but also place great
expectations on it. Although no one government can handle everything
with its limited powers, it would certainly let the people down when
it failed to completely shoulder its responsibility. Despite this, I
would still like to encourage, and boost the morale of all civil
servants. We should aim at easing the worries of the people, so we
can regain their confidence in the new administration. The other day
I especially mentioned to Premier Tang Fei that we really need to
work harder to eliminate serious problems in areas such as the system
of communication. In the future, the premier should receive immediate
reports on any major disaster or accident, be it fire,
transportation, security or serious crises. Not only the premier, but
also the president should be notified without delay. As long as the
two of us are given reports, I believe all the relevant ministers
will be informed, and, thus, all of the grass-roots level civil
servants would be mobilized instantly. Starting from consolidating
this system, we will improve the effectiveness of this administration
and begin to strengthen the system of communications. We will never
let anyone down again.</P>
      <P>To improve cross-strait relations, I recall that in my May 20
inaugural speech and in the June 20 press conference, I repeatedly
expressed sincerity and good will. However, the Chinese mainland has
so far only replied with a minimum amount of good will. Many of our
citizens have told me that we have made enough concessions and shown
our sincerity to the fullest, yet have received little positive
response from the Chinese mainland. They told me not to make any more
concessions. But I wish to say that we should have more endurance and
patience. We should not give up and are not giving up hope. I think
both sides of the strait have played too many meaningless word games
in the past. It was really unnecessary. Today, I would like to urge
Beijing to work together again, based on the existing foundation and
spirit of the 1992 meeting, and create positive cross-strait
interactions.</P>
      <P>Of course, the "1992 spirit" corresponds with "dialogue,
exchange, and shelving disputes." We believe that as long as there is
dialogue, there is exchange; as long as there is exchange, there can
be consensus. If there can not be any consensus, then, we would
rather put aside disputes temporarily.</P>
      <P>It is the long-standing wish of the people and also the
unavoidable moral responsibility of the leaders on both sides to
improve cross-strait relations. Where it broke off, we should
re-connect. We hope that the two sides can begin to "agree to
disagree," through a process of "dialogue, exchange, and shelving
disputes," and finally reach an acceptable consensus and conclusion
for both, so the "agree to disagree" can become an "agreement of
consensus." The idea and aim of the new administration is to
eliminate mutual suspicion. I believe this is also the common wish
and expectation of the more than one billion people who live under
the rule of the Chinese communists.</P>
      <P>Before the presidential election was held on March 18, 2000,
everyone clearly knew that this would be a very competitive election.
Because of this election, 1999 was also a very tense and
confrontational year for every candidate. This is a very normal
phenomenon during a democratic election. Now that the election is
over, why don't we work together to calm the passions that arose
during the election and let our life return to normal as soon as
possible? We are confident that in the midst of the competition among
political parties, there is also room for cooperation.</P>
      <P>There is only one Republic of China, and only one Taiwan. We have
only one country. There is only the interest of the nation and the
people. No matter how much we talk about national interests and the
people's interests, they should be placed above the interests of
political parties and any individual. Why can't the ruling and
opposition parties sit down together, shake hands, make peace, and
discuss national affairs?

    <HEADLINE>PRESS CONFERENCE (IV)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is newly established and immediately faces
numerous national issues that are like thousands of threads and loose
ends. These problems cannot be solved by just one person or one
political party. With my utmost sincerity, I am facing the present
difficulties of our country. I am also considering how to further
improve relations between the two sides of the strait, upgrade
economic development, and enhance the people's welfare. These are
what the whole population earnestly expects us to do. I believe these
are not only the responsibility of the ruling party, but also the
common obligation of all opposition parties.</P>
      <P>This is why last week I asked Secretary-General Chang to deliver
my personal invitation to Chairman Lien of the KMT, Chairman Soong of
the People First Party, and Chairman Hsieh of the DPP to attend a
round-table conference. The reason for this conference is to show
that all political parties have no relative superiority or
inferiority. All parties are equally important and indispensable to
the country. We hope that the issues discussed in this conference
will be the result of respecting the different opinions of
participating leaders from the major political parties. Issues on
relations between the two sides, financial and economic policies,
constitutional reform, social security, and other reform measures are
all very important. Perhaps the political leaders still have
divergent opinions. However, we have no pre-established positions or
objectives. We are willing to make any changes on issues to be
discussed in accordance with the valuable opinions of the chairmen.</P>
      <P>As for the time of the conference, we know that Chairman Lien is
traveling abroad on August 3 and Chairman Soong will follow suit on
August 9. Therefore, we do not expect to hold the conference in early
August. In order to set up a time suitable for everyone, we are
willing to hold a preparatory meeting before the conference. We hope
that the staffs of these political parties can reach a consensus on
the way the conference is to be held, issues to be discussed, and
things we should have considered but failed to do so. I am bound to
accept all opinions with an open mind.</P>
      <P>If sending Secretary-General Chang with my personal invitation
fails to show my respect and politeness, I am willing to visit
Chairman Lien at the KMT headquarters opposite the Office of the
President in my capacity as national leader. Thus, I wish to show my
deep respect for him and express the new government's utmost
sincerity and goodwill in holding a round-table conference of all
parties. I believe that reconciliation and cooperation among all
parties after the election is a major step toward ending
confrontation among political parties.</P>
      <P>I hope all leaders can understand this situation and appreciate
what I am trying to do. I am confident that the change of ruling
party is absolutely a trend of the future. I have been given an
opportunity to serve the people today. I am sure that one day all
political parties will have the same opportunity to contribute to the
welfare of the whole nation. I hope that my sincerity and goodwill
can gain your support and encouragement. This is the great
expectation of the people and the common ideal and goal of the ruling
and opposition parties for a long time.</P>
      <P>We know that when the Legislative Yuan finishes interpellation,
it will be more than two months after the new government was
established. During these past two months, Premier Tang was
supervised, questioned, and counter-balanced by the legislature. I
myself have also done my best to address such issues as bilateral
relations, foreign affairs, national defense, and military affairs.
At present, the political situation, bilateral relations, and
diplomatic situation have been stabilized, and the army's morale has
been raised significantly.</P>
      <P>Next, we will focus on the reform of domestic affairs. I believe
that in August, Premier Tang will set other new policies to be
carried out, for which I am very pleased and thankful. Premier Tang's
performance in the Legislative Yuan this past month is praiseworthy.
I completely affirm what he has done in the past and have great faith
and confidence in the new cabinet led by Premier Tang, although I
know we still have much work to do on many things.

    <HEADLINE>PRESS CONFERENCE (V)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>For example, there has been no progress in the investigation of
the 1993 death of Captain Yin Ching-feng. It was later learned that
this was not purely a homicide case, but also related to much
corruption in military procurements. These corruption cases led to
the homicide. I formerly served in the Legislative Yuan as convener
of the defense committee. In 1994, because I sincerely wanted to
assist in the investigation of the Yin case, I worked very hard on
the committee. During an entire session, I convened eight meetings in
a row concerning this case. Later, I left the Legislative Yuan to
campaign for the office of Taipei mayor, and consequently was unable
to attain my goal. I fell short of success for lack of a final
effort. However, after eight special case reports, similar to public
hearings, my conclusion was that the Yin case was extremely
complicated and involved highly sensitive levels. My conclusion then
was that the case mainly stemmed from one fraud, be it the military
purchase fraud of mine sweepers, Lafayette frigates, or survey ships.
We still felt that it involved many government layers and high
levels. My conclusion was that more than one person was involved.
Later, as I left the Legislative Yuan to be the mayor of Taipei for
four years, I had no right to investigate the case. Even when I was
serving as convener of the defense committee, because I had no right
of investigation, the effectiveness was limited. Now, the whole
situation is different. From serving as a legislator in the past, I
have become the new leader of the country. What I keep in my mind
constantly, as several generals have told me privately, is that if we
are unable to solve the case, it will not only be a disgrace for the
military, but also cause great damage to the credibility of the
judiciary and the country's authority. Perhaps it is the spirit of
Yin Ching-feng in heaven that helped put me in the Office of the
President.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I am officially announcing today the immediate
establishment of an "investigation task force" for the Yin case and
other related frauds. To elevate the investigative level, Public
Prosecutor General Lu Ren-fa will lead the task force, along with the
procuratorial, investigative, military, and police branches to make
all-out investigations. All prosecutors and investigators taking part
in the case and related people in the military are allowed to put
aside their original duties and focus their attention on this case. I
do not believe that there is no way to achieve good progress and
results. I am officially announcing today that all the procuratorial,
investigative, military, and police organs involved in the
investigation of this case should make a concerted effort. In
particular, the military. No matter whether it is the Ministry of
National Defense, the General Staff Headquarters, the Navy General
Headquarters, or any other related organizations -- none should
resist or refuse to cooperate. All should work to meet the needs of
the investigation group. No matter how high the government level or
how wide the scope, or whether persons involved are now in important
positions, there will be no exceptions made for the full
investigation of the case until the truth is determined.</P>
      <P>I have already conveyed this decision to the Executive Yuan, and
expect all government branches to work together without hesitation.
Yet, I clearly know in my mind that there will be obstruction, even
boycotts and resistance. Nevertheless, as long as the public is
willing to encourage and fully support the investigation team and be
its backup force, we are confident the case will be solved. We are
also confident that we will be able to bring the persons involved to
justice.</P>
      <P>Eradicating "black gold" activities is a priority of the new
government. We hope this case is just a start, for we can collect
evidence for other cases. Where there is evidence, a case will be
pursued. I believe now is the time. We should no longer wait or
hesitate. Citizens have become impatient and are showing some
disappointment from their high expectations of the new government,
for they cannot see more action or progress by the new government to
eradicate "black gold" activities. I must remind the new government
that we have been given a chance to serve, and we must spare no
effort. We should not allow ourselves to fail and be cast aside or
replaced by the people. Otherwise, I am afraid it will be too late.

    <HEADLINE>NCO TO FORM BACKBONE OF ROC'S MILITARY MANPOWER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Noncommissioned officers (NCOs) will form
the backbone of the Republic of China's armed forces in the future, a
senior Ministry of National Defense (MND) official said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chung-po, deputy head of the MND's Manpower Department,
made the remarks at a public hearing on how to recruit
first-rate talent to build up a modern defense force.</P>
      <P>Noting that establishing an elite deterrent force is the ultimate
goal of the military's manpower development plan, Chen said the
military's current manpower cultivation policy is characterized by
several principles, including "small number, high quality,
long-service term and stringent training."</P>
      <P>As for the military's manpower structure, Chen said, the
military's desired ratio of officer to NCOs and enlisted men is
1:4:2 (1 officer: 4 NCOs: 2 enlisted men).</P>
      <P>Chen said NCOs are playing an increasing role in the
ROC's armed forces and will become the mainstay of all those in
uniform in the future.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen said, the military faces difficulties
recruiting an enough number of NCOs serving on a volunteer basis
because the military cannot offer good pay.</P>
      <P>For instance, Chen said, the military currently needs a total of
120,000 NCOs. "However, we now have only 70,000-plus voluntary NCOs.
We have to make up for the shortage by recruiting conscripts to serve
as NCOs," he said, adding that low pay is a main obstacle to
attracting local youths to serve as NCOs on a volunteer basis.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the military has launched many promotional
efforts to court NCO hopefuls. "So long as we can recruit an
adequate number of voluntary NCOs, the service term for conscripted
servicemen can be cut from the current two years to 18 months or even
shorter," he noted.</P>
      <P>The public hearing was called by Kuomintang Legislator Chiang
Chi-wen, with the participation of scores of MND and Education
Ministry officials, scholars and experts.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Yao Chiang, director of the MND's
military education department, said since the passage of the
military education bill, the MND has smoothly integrated
several military colleges into the National Defense University and
set up a think tank to conduct in-depth research on national
security and cross-Taiwan Strait issues.</P>
      <P>Yao said the MND will unveil a package of regulations within six
months to encourage military servicemen to use their leisure time to
do advanced study at the National Defense University as part of the
military's manpower upgrading efforts.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tan Chuang-yi, a professor at Tamkang University's
Strategic Study Institute, said the government should improve pay
for servicemen to attract youths to serve in the military. In
addition to launching promotional programs in urban areas, Tan said,
the military can also extend its manpower recruitment target to rural
youths.</P>
      <P>Tan said the military should develop a professional skill
certification system to facilitate cultivation and recruitment
of voluntary NCOs.</P>
      <P>In line with a shift in the ROC's military build-up policy from
equally stressing offense and defense to simply assuring defense,
the MND has been implementing a 10-year troop reduction plan aimed
at trimming the number of the country's servicemen to less than
400,000 by 2003 and increasing the ratio of combat troops to overall
military manpower.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Finally, I want to let our citizens and members of the media know
about my trip to Central America and Africa starting August 13. This
is my first trip abroad since my inauguration as president, a trip
for our "democratic diplomacy and friendship." We will transit Los
Angeles to the Dominican Republic, the Republic of Nicaragua, and the
Republic of Costa Rica for official visits. Thereafter, we will fly
to Africa for official visits to the Republic of the Gambia, Burkina
Faso, and the Republic of Chad. We expect to return to Taiwan on the
night of August 25, making it a 13-day trip altogether. Excluding the
transit in the US, we will spend an average of less than two days in
each country. Some people joke that this is an "ascetic's trip?around
the world, however, we believe foreign diplomacy is symbolic and
representative of our nation's sovereignty. Taiwan must stand up, and
it must reach out to the world. In reaching out, Taiwan can see the
world and, hopefully, the world can see Taiwan, the Republic of
China. My first trip abroad has several meanings:</P>
      <P>First, in the 2000 presidential elections, the people of Taiwan
established a new record and turned a new chapter in Taiwan's history
with their ballots and love of country. In particular, we were able
to make it possible for the peaceful transfer of power on May 20, so
that Taiwan, the Republic of China, can stand at the center of the
international stage. This is an outstanding achievement in democracy
by the people of Taiwan. Therefore, my first visit abroad will not
only draw the attention of the international community, it will also
be a symbolic manifestation of this sovereign state.</P>
      <P>Second, I will visit the Dominican Republic to attend the
inauguration of President Mejia. The Dominican Republic also made its
first transfer of power to a different political party in 14 years.
The Republic of China was not absent in this trend of changing
political party rule, and we are therefore proud of ourselves. As an
incumbent head of state, after the change of political parties, I am
paying a very significant visit to the Dominican Republic. Since
Nicaraguan President Aleman was here for my May 20 inauguration, I
wish to show my gratitude by especially adding this stopover in
Nicaragua. As for my visit to Costa Rica, there will be a meeting of
ROC ambassadors and representatives posted in Central and South
America. Our other diplomatic partners are very important too.
Although I am unable to visit each nation on this trip, I am sure we
will have the opportunity to visit in the future.</P>
      <P>Third, we have eight diplomatic allies in Africa, and have always
placed special emphasis on relations with friendly nations in Africa.
Most important, in the past, no president of the Republic of China
has visited West African nations. Former President Lee Teng-hui,
despite a promise to visit these countries, was unable to do so for
certain reasons. We certainly apologize to these nations and have
overcome all difficulties this time to make such a visit successful.
I am also the first ROC president to officially visit nations in West
Africa. We hope to consolidate our friendship with these countries so
that they may better understand and trust the ROC's foreign policy.</P>
      <P>Of course, some people say that if possible, I should not go. I
would like to tell you that communication is needed among relatives
and friends to establish close relations. This is also true with
countries. Many leaders, delegations, and special envoys from other
countries came to Taiwan to attend my inauguration on May 20. As a
sovereign state, the Republic of China also has to emphasize
leadership diplomacy, and it is very important to have mutual visits
between heads of state. It is inappropriate for them to come here
only, and for us not to visit them. I hope our compatriots will
understand and extend their support and encouragement to us. I want
to tell you once more that the arrangement of this visit was done two
months ago, and our advance group has just returned home. I can tell
you they experienced great hardships during the process.</P>
      <P>Countering the interference by the Chinese communists, we still
face many difficulties and obstructions when dealing with our
diplomatic allies. However, we will do everything possible to
overcome difficulties. Therefore, we know the itinerary cannot be
changed randomly. We also think there is no relevant problem
concerning the timing of this trip. Through careful evaluation by our
national security and diplomatic services, we believe this coming
visit to foreign countries will not endanger national security or
domestic stability. I am confident that Premier Tang is the best and
most reliable head of the Cabinet.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>III. Question and Answer Session</P>
      <P>Q1: When you were discussing the cross-strait issue earlier, you
did not mention "one China." Does this imply a change in your
attitude toward the "one-China" issue? Or does it mean that it is
only a topic for cross-strait dialogue? Can you please elaborate
further?</P>
      <P>A: I especially emphasized earlier that Taiwan and the Chinese
mainland have wasted too much time for too long playing word games.
In 1992, Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation and the mainland's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits discussed the
"one-China" issue without reaching a unanimous conclusion.
Nonetheless, the spirit of the 1992 meeting is very important, and we
especially mention it, because it covered dialogue, exchange, and
shelving disputes. If we can build on the existing foundation of the
1992 spirit, I believe that it will definitely be a very good
beginning to re-establish positive interactions between the two
sides. It will also be a common experience for the leaders and
governments on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Otherwise, we will only be repeatedly emphasizing areas of
discord and dispute, with each side standing by its own views, never
reaching a consensus with the other and arriving at no conclusion in
the short term. Under these circumstances, if may be very difficult
to have everyone sit down to calmly devote their best efforts to
improving cross-strait relations. This is why I again mentioned that
if we build on the existing foundation in the 1992 spirit, we will
have a chance to improve cross-strait relations and resume
cross-strait negotiation.</P>
      <P>Q2: Will constitutional reform solve the problem of
constitutional government system?</P>
      <P>A: We have no such intention or plan. However, it is clear that
the subject of a constitutional government system is still a common
concern of both the ruling and opposition parties. This is why we
hope to convene a round-table discussion. One of the subjects for
discussion is constitutional government. This type of discussion will
draw on collective wisdom and useful ideas. Is the present, improved
presidential-premier government the best constitutional government
system? Or is the presidential government, three-power government,
and the single-parliament government that many people promoted in the
past feasible? I still feel its worthwhile for the people in Taiwan,
especially the legislators who have the right to promote
constitutional reform, consider this matter.</P>
      <P>Currently, the problems for our re-examination include the
bilateral interaction between the legislative and the executive
branches, as well as the interface of the Presidential Office between
the legislative and the executive branches, especially the
President's sense of propriety with the Executive Yuan Premier and
the executive departments. These problems are derived from a change
in ruling party for the first time after the implementation of
constitutional government. All these problems are significant and
genuine and cannot be explained in a few words. The fact is there are
problems. However, I do not mean that we should immediately begin
constitutional reform. This is a very serious task; therefore, I
would particularly note that, before the end of this year, it should
not be the priority.</P>
      <P>Unless the three-party round-table discussion develops a
consensus that we should convene a similar constitutional reform
conference on national affairs or national development, we still feel
we can improve and strengthen through communication and coordination.
I also hope, when Secretary-General Chang assumes his new post in the
Executive Yuan, he will build good bridges between the Executive Yuan
and the Legislative Yuan, between the Office of the President and the
Executive Yuan, and between the Office of the President and the
Legislative Yuan. Thank you very much.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Q3: Mr. President, during your election campaign you stated that
"if A-bian is elected, the TAIEX will soar above 10,000." Now that
the new government has taken power, however, the stock market has not
only failed to rise, but instead has witnessed a series of plummets.
In particular, in the face of these turbid economic conditions, the
financial sector has reduced the money supply to such an extent that
many traditional industries are struggling to survive. What measures
will you implement to help alleviate the financial difficulties
currently plaguing the nation?</P>
      <P>A: First of all, I would like to point out that during the
campaign period prior to the presidential election, certain political
parties and individuals said that should I be elected, the stock
market would collapse or fall beyond control. Some stated that it
would drop to 3,000 points, retaining only one-third of its original
value; others, being even more bold and audacious, predicted that the
market would plunge to a new all-time low of only 100 points. In the
two months since I took office, however, none of these things have
happened.</P>
      <P>I am sure that not everyone is happy with the present conditions
of the stock market. However, as most people know, the stock market
generally experiences a "low season" almost every year between the
months of July and August. Thus, in the end, the level attained by
the stock market during this time period will always be different
according to people's expectations and wishes, and I am sure that
there is not any set standard on what the market level "should be."
In any event, the role of the government is to watch for all
non-economic factors influencing the stock market, and the new
government has paid very close attention to such factors. Indeed, the
amount of interference in the market caused by non-economic factors
following the election was quite significant, and immediately drew
our attention; thus, we know that we cannot lower our guard. One of
the basic focuses of the new government is the recovery of market
economy mechanisms in order to help maintain a market system.</P>
      <P>Regarding the difficulties currently facing the financial sector,
economic and financial problems have always been a major concern for
the government. As an island state, the sustainable development of
the economic and financial sectors is essential for the survival of
the Republic of China on Taiwan; it is our country's lifeline.
Personally, I am very concerned about the economic and financial
developments occurring in Taiwan. However, as the head of state, I
must respect our country's constitutional system and can only express
my private concerns and offer assistance as an observer. Premier Tang
knows our requirements and expectations, and a series of financial
and economic meetings have already been scheduled for August. At that
time, substantive measures to help the traditional industries, the
real estate market, and other areas will be discussed. I am sure that
the executive branch will perform its duties responsibly, formulate
effective measures to promote economic prosperity, and maintain the
people's confidence.</P>
      <P>Q4: What do you think about the recent disturbance caused by the
secret envoy issue between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait? At
present, the communication channels between the two sides do not
function well. Under this condition, is it feasible to send someone
reliable to secretly communicate with Mr. Jiang Zemin in order to
extend our goodwill and further enhance bilateral relations? Will
frequent visits and exchanges at the current stage be favorable to
mutual understanding between the two parties? Why are legislators
paying visits to the Chinese mainland being labeled as Beijing's
representatives stationed in Taiwan? Please elaborate on the new
government's attitude and position toward its interaction with the
Chinese mainland.

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A: I'd like to thank former President Lee Teng-hui for his great
assistance and advice to the new government, including myself, during
the process of peacefully transferring political power from one party
to the other. Former President Lee told me much about the issues of
national security, mainland affairs, and what we have done to develop
our relations with the US and Japan. However, he has never mentioned
anything about the secret envoys between the two sides of the strait.
Right now, related agencies are investigating whether there are
secret envoys between the two sides or not. They have issued an
official letter to the Office of the President, asking for our help
to find the file on secret envoys. So far, we haven't found any. We
are also trying to determine whether there is a confidential file on
this issue. However, since former President Lee has never told me
anything about the secret envoys between the two sides, we have no
comments on whether this matter is important or even if it is true.</P>
      <P>I deeply understand that before the Koo-Wang Talks were held, the
two sides did not have a direct communication channel. We don't know
if there were secret envoys at that time or not. If the answer is
yes, I believe that the communication channels between the two sides
have developed progressively from exchanging secret envoys at that
time to establishing the current dialogue mechanism. Therefore,
whether it is necessary to continue the communication channel of
sending secret envoys still requires our careful consideration.</P>
      <P>However, one thing is very clear. That is that the new government
still believes that the Straits Exchange Foundation and the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits are the best
institutions for conducting dialogue between the two sides. They are
also the most reliable agencies that I highly trust. If you ask who
my best secret envoy is, I'd say that we should respect the current
mechanism. In other words, I think that the chairman of the Straits
Exchange Foundation, Mr. Koo Chen-fu, is the best candidate for my
envoy and representative.</P>
      <P>All of us hope that the two sides can resume dialogue and re-open
consultation channels at an early date. Sometime ago, Mr. Koo told me
that someone from the private sector expressed his intention to
represent the SEF in visiting the Chinese mainland. Mr. Koo asked for
my view, and we have discussed this issue during the staff meetings
of the National Security Council. I don't think it is right to brush
aside Chairman Koo and ask someone who is irrelevant to the SEF to
represent the SEF or Mr. Koo in talking with the Chinese mainland.
Since we have such an established institution, the Chinese mainland
should talk to the SEF, if they are to hold talks with Taiwan. We can
ask the SEF to send a representative, delegate Chairman Koo himself,
or assign other high-ranking SEF personnel. All these people are
qualified representatives from an established official system. Why
should we give up these people and choose a third party? This is why
I always hope to resume the dialogue mechanism between the two sides
as soon as possible and make everything open and clear, under the
supervision and checks-and-balances of the parliamentary bodies, the
entire populace, and the media. This is my faith and my ideal of
holding dialogue between the two sides. I proposed it only for your
reference.</P>
      <P>We cannot deny the fact that the Chinese communists have been
hoping to set aside the dialogue mechanism between the two sides.
They even try to denigrate it and make it nothing more than an empty
shell. I think this is a very bad idea. They have been trying every
way to achieve this goal. For example, they spent much time and
energy on our national assemblies, political parties, ROC offices in
foreign countries, overseas Chinese organizations, and commercial and
industrial sectors. This is what our fellow countrymen must watch.
However, as long as we can work together with one heart, I am
confident that we can do something to further improve bilateral
relations. The problem we have is that we now are being thrown into
confusion by ourselves. This is very dangerous. I earnestly solicit
your support for my ideal, so that the dialogue mechanism between the
two sides can begin functioning as soon as possible. Thank you.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Recently, somebody suggested to me that it would be better for me
to allocate more time to working in the Presidential Office instead
of going out to rural townships. Regarding this matter, I would like
to tell you that I work more than 12 hours a day. If my working time
is calculated from 9 am to 5 pm, I only make three visits to rural
townships a week, occupying only a quarter of my time. Similarly, if
I have to work until nine or ten o'clock at night, I only choose
three times a week, half a day each time, to make visits to rural
areas. This only occupies one-sixth of my office time, while I spend
five-sixths of my time in the Presidential Office. I am sure that
this arrangement will not have any adverse effect on the conduct of
state affairs.</P>
      <P>Moreover, I come from the grass roots and the countryside and was
elected by the people. I fully understand that there should not be
any distance between the government and the people. I cannot confine
myself to an air-conditioned office, but need to share the joys and
sorrows of the people and identify local problems and difficulties. I
think some local problems cannot be understood simply by reading
official documents.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I deal with fewer than 30 documents a day, most of
which concern cross-strait, diplomatic, military, or national defense
affairs. Those that are related to the Executive Yuan are only laws
passed by the legislature and require my signature and promulgation.
The official documents of the Executive Yuan are not sent to the
Office of the President. Therefore, you can understand that I am
determined to be a president for all the people, a president who will
accept the supervision and checks and balances from the public and
offer service to all citizens.</P>
      <P>Perhaps some people think that it is inappropriate for me to
attend the graduation ceremonies of some schools. I cannot understand
the motive behind such criticism. Many people would not attach any
importance to this matter. I can only tell you that the process of my
personal struggle has had a significant impact on my life, including
receiving a county magistrate's award during my graduation ceremony
from elementary school. The county magistrate granted the award to me
in person, which made me understand that even as a boy from a poor
family, I could receive an official honor, as long as I worked hard.
Likewise, a lecture by Huang Hsin-chieh, the former chairman of the
DPP, also changed my life. Therefore, I would like to spend some time
attending the graduation ceremonies of schools, hoping to provide
more encouragement to the young graduates.</P>
      <P>My personal experience would perhaps give them some
enlightenment, even though I do not have much charisma or influence.
However, I am confident that some personal experience will provide a
good example and give enlightenment to many, especially those
children who live in remote rural areas, receive special education,
or experienced the 921 earthquake. I need to share joys and sorrows
with all of you. Perhaps I have not been right in doing so, but I
hope you understand my intentions. I do not want to show off, and the
focus of attention is always our children, the young graduates. I
merely wish to offer more encouragement to them.</P>
      <P>I am very grateful to all of you for attending this second press
conference. We hope the new government will not disappoint you. The
new government will do its best to work hard. I hope mothers will
weep no more, people will not worry, the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait will not suspect each other, ruling and opposition parties
will not be in conflict, the truth will be revealed to the public,
and Taiwan will go out to the world. I convey my heartfelt
appreciation and best wishes to each of you once more. Thank you.

    <HEADLINE>PRESS CONFERENCE (XI)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Q5: The former administration held a policy of "patience over
haste" with respect to cross-strait trade and economic exchanges.
According to recent reports, however, the new administration is
planning to re-evaluate this policy. Mr. President, what new ideas do
you have regarding the "three direct links" and "patience over haste"
policies? In addition, the current and former US Secretaries of
Defense Cohen and Cheney both mentioned phrases of "six months." Does
this mean that your administration is planning some big breakthrough
or other major action in cross-strait negotiations before the end of
the Clinton administration?</P>
      <P>A: First, I believe that the issue of establishing "three direct
links" or "three small direct links" is very important for
cross-strait affairs. It is an issue that cannot be avoided forever;
sooner or later, we will have to face it. It is for this reason that
I stated before that we would promote the establishment of three
direct links by the end of the year. Pleases note, however, that the
promotion of three direct links does not imply that implementation
will be carried out immediately; it simply reflects our true
sincerity to see the three direct links realized. Indeed, we not only
feel that now is the right time to promote the three direct links,
but we also feel that it is a necessity to do so. Under the paramount
premise of maintaining national security, we will seek to establish
policies on the three direct links that can be implemented
independent of any time frame, while upholding basic proportional
principles, reciprocal principles, and relevant trade laws. If the
Chinese mainland is unwilling to sit down and talk with us, and
despite our determination to see things through, a substantial amount
of time will still be required to develop such policies. Regarding
the preliminary "three small direct links," the problem we face is
the same: If both sides cannot calmly sit down with one another, it
will be difficult to have any breakthroughs on even minor matters,
such as customs and quarantine issues. Thus, I feel that we already
have good policies for the three small direct links and must actively
plan for their possible implementation. Hopefully, cross-strait
relations can then progress and improve.</P>
      <P>Regarding US Secretary of Defense William Cohen's hope that
dialogue between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait be resumed within
six months, I know for a fact that -- based on the Six-point
Guarantee of 1982 -- the United States will not be a mediator in
cross-strait relations. However, I do hope that the United States can
play a more active and constructive role as a stabilizer and balancer
to maintain peace in cross-strait relations. Indeed, not only do we
feel it necessary that the US take a greater role, but the US
government itself appears to be already doing so. In particular, US
Secretary of State Madeline Albright's visit to the Chinese mainland
and the subsequent visit there made by US Secretary of Defense
William Cohen affirm this. Those visits obtained several positive
reports on the status of cross-strait relations: first, that the
situation wasn't tense; second, that matters weren't pressing; and
third, that there wasn't any threat at the time. These reports
reflect how the situation appears to the US and explain why Cohen
hoped the two sides could resume dialogue within the coming six
months. Please note that these were the hopes and expectations of the
United States, not ours. For our part, we have been ready to resume
dialogue and negotiations all along and do not want to wait six
months before beginning. We are very grateful for this question, and
we hope that everyone can give the new government more encouragement
and support. Thank you!</P>
      <P>Q6: Mr. President, earlier you emphasized your resolution to
investigate the death of navy Captain Yin Ching-feng. However, if the
case ends up involving many high-ranking officials in either the
current or former administration, are you determined to follow
through with it to the very end? In addition, regarding the fixed
network shares issue, it is quite probable that many legislators will
be involved in such transactions. Given such a situation, how does
the government plan on carrying out its policy of eradicating "money
politics?"

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A: Regarding the death of Yin Ching-feng, I am sure that everyone
understands one of the main reasons for announcing it today in such a
fashion was to demonstrate the new government's willingness and
determination to resolve the case. At the same time, I want to tell
everyone that this case has been on my mind for the past two months.
The decision to investigate was the natural outcome of what I
understood to be the military's desires, which I have learned from
many private discussions and consultations with various military
personnel, who have served or are currently serving with different
military agencies. Indeed, military authorities have told me that
they want to see this case solved; otherwise, they will be unable to
maintain their dignity. Moreover, the few individuals involved in the
case have disgraced almost everyone in the military, and this is
quite unfair.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the case has dragged on for so long because it is
complex and involves many sensitive issues. Although the military had
the spirit and desire to solve case, it did not possess the necessary
strength or power to do so. Thus, it was the military's hope that I
would create an ad hoc committee to unify the investigations of the
case. Although the military is unable to directly handle the case
again, they are willing to fully cooperate with the ad hoc committee.</P>
      <P>I am confident that this investigation will be successful. We
cannot allow such involvement of a few persons to affect our national
and military image, the government's authority, and the public's
trust of the judiciary. I have already prepared myself personally for
the task ahead. I had prior consultations and discussions with
relevant agencies seeking their opinion on the matter, and they all
felt that it could be done. Thus, I have taken the opportunity of
this second presidential press conference to announce our will and
determination to solve the Yin Ching-feng case. And again, as I
especially stated just now, I will continue with the investigation
regardless of who it involves -- whether they are high officials who
are currently in power or not. I assure you, the investigation will
continue without exception, leniency, and concern.</P>
      <P>Regarding the fixed network shares issue, we have received
reports from relevant agencies and are trying to find out if any
crimes or illegality are involved in the process. Obviously, we are
very cautious in identifying the nature of any crime and gathering
evidence. The relevant agencies are actively conducting the
investigation. I have not received the final report on how many
people in the Legislature may be involved in this case. There is
still no final decision for what and how they will be prosecuted.
However, we will be very careful in gathering evidence and
identifying criminal activity.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, I have never said that we will immediately file this
case, nor does it mean that we will not prosecute, because I have not
said so. How it should be conducted is not within the president's
authority, the administrative departments must coordinate the
investigation of this problem, and the judicial agencies should make
greater efforts. Therefore, what I said about the special
investigation group concerned the Yin case and not the case of the
fixed network shares. Thank you.</P>
      <P>Q7: Mr. President, in his book Asia Strategy, former president
Lee Teng-hui said the Republic of China is the "second" republic. Do
you agree with this view? Do you feel that after your election and
the change of ruling parties that the Republic of China has reached
the stage of the second republic?</P>
      <P>A: Regarding Asia Strategy, I have not read this book, so I am
not able to fully understand former president Lee Teng-hui's
strategies and some of his fundamental views on the future of Taiwan.
The "second" republic is not a term that appeared recently. I know
that several years ago in promoting constitutional reforms, somebody
proposed a draft constitution for the second Republic of China.
Therefore, as I have said about constitutional issues, we will take
note of it. We also hope that our citizens interested in
constitutional reforms, academics and scholars, different political
parties, the ruling and the opposition, should all pool their wisdom.
It is very clear that I am elected as the tenth-term president in
accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of China. Today, it
is still the Constitution of the Republic of China and not that of
the second Republic. Therefore, whether this strategy of the second
republic is feasible will be left for everyone to think about and
discuss, pooling their wisdom to form a basis for future
constitutional reforms.

    <HEADLINE>PRESS CONFERENCE (XV)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Today, we want to ask our citizens, if we do not build the fourth
nuclear power plant, will we surely suffer a power shortage? This is
a very important issue. Our international friends believe that the
fourth nuclear power plant must be built or power shortages will be
inevitable. However, related data and statistics show that this may
not be so. The same logic applies here. Is the construction of the
fourth nuclear power plant the only choice? Is there no other
substituting source of energy? Many scholars and experts, as well as
groups from various sectors, have excellent opinions on this issue.
We believe that we should convey every fact to our countrymen. We
cannot deceive ourselves and others that the construction of the
fourth nuclear power plant is the only option or the very last resort
to resolve power and energy supply problems. Besides, we still have
the problem of final disposal of nuclear waste. This is a serious
question.</P>
      <P>Whether you agree or not, this issue cannot be avoided. We may
not have an answer at this moment and maybe we never will. We may
want to dump it on our neighbors. But does this comply with our
adage: "Do not do unto others what you would not have done unto you"?
I believe that it would be very unethical to take advantage of the
ignorance of some countries and people and deceive them. Therefore,
let us patiently wait for the evaluation results on whether the
fourth nuclear plant should be built. We hope that we will have an
answer to this question very soon.</P>
      <P>Q12: The name list for the inter-party committee is about to be
decided. However, the KMT and the People First Party still refused to
participate. If these two parties do not change their attitude in the
long run, will the committee continue to operate? In addition, when
you received the legislators some time ago, you talked about adding
another vice president to the Legislative Yuan and another vice
premier to the Executive Yuan by revising the constitution. Will you
ask for the support from all sectors in order to achieve this goal?</P>
      <P>A: According to my understanding, it shouldn't be long before the
composition of the inter-party committee will be decided. Naturally,
there have been some difficulties, for which there are active
remedial measures. In fact, the goal of the inter-party committee is
quite clear. That is, we hope its members will reach a minimum
consensus or common denominator on the cross-strait policy between
the ruling and the opposition parties and among different parties.
Thus, we can consolidate the strength of the people on Taiwan to
negotiate with the Chinese mainland for the best interests of the
people and the country.</P>
      <P>Despite resistance, reservation, or even disdain for the
committee, I believe its operations in the future will not be
affected. In fact, the original plan did not require political
parties to formally designate representatives. However, later some
people suggested that political parties dispatch members to
participate in the inter-party committee. In such a difficult
position, Dr. Lee Yuan-tseh, as the convener of the committee, took
great pains, with the determination to do things for the country, the
people on Taiwan, and the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and his
efforts should not be questioned. People should not resisted or
refuse to cooperate with Dr. Lee, because of their personal
prejudices.</P>
      <P>I just mentioned that it is not time for constitutional reform.
Perhaps conditions are not mature enough. However, I have no special
opinions on the content and subject of the reform. I just want to
point out that two years ago, I also suggested adding another vice
premier to the Executive Yuan and one more vice president to the
Legislative Yuan. Our considerations were very clear. We all know
that the Taipei City, Kaohsiung City, and many large counties have
two deputy mayors or two deputy county chiefs. As the highest
administrative organ of the country, the Executive Yuan has only one
vice premier. Perhaps the workload of former Vice Premier Yu was too
heavy. He told me recently that he has to work very hard, because
there was only one vice premier.</P>
      <P>Since the Vice Premier is not able to handle so many economic and
trade matters, the Premier usually asks the Secretary-General to
handle them. Yet, the related executive departments seem to have some
opinions about this arrangement, therefore discouraging heads of the
executive departments from attending meetings personally.

PRESS CONFERENCE (XIII)</P>
      <P>Q8: Does the new administration have any new plans regarding
reentry into the UN or will it instead seek to apply for initial
admission as a sovereign state?</P>
      <P>A: The ROC on Taiwan sincerely desires the opportunity to fulfill
its duties as a member of the international community. As such, it is
only natural that we hope to play a more active role in international
organizations, including the UN. Whether they are governmental or
non-governmental organizations, we hope to work through such groups
to contribute even more to the international community. In my May 20
inaugural speech, I particularly mentioned that we hope to use
humanitarian assistance programs, economic cooperation, and cultural
exchanges to increase our participation in international
organizations. The UN is just one of these organizations, however,
and it is definitely not the only one.</P>
      <P>As the new administration has only been in office since May 20,
we have had a very limited amount of time to prepare for the UN
General Assembly meeting in September. Thus, although a team has been
continuously examining the situation and seeking methods, based on
the existing foundations, to regain the ROC's entry into this world
body, we do not expect to make any significant breakthroughs in such
a short span of time. I truly realize the people's concern regarding
this issue. Many public opinion polls have shown that most people on
Taiwan support our reentry or admission into the UN. It is what the
people want. However, we must understand that there are many
obstacles before us, and it will not be an easy task to accomplish.</P>
      <P>I am certainly not saying that we should quit because of these
obstacles or because the path will be difficult. On the contrary, the
most important thing is not to give up. I reiterate that Taiwan must
"stand up" and "reach out" to attain its goal. Not only do we want to
see the rest of the world, but we also want the world to see the ROC
and Taiwan. Thus, we will not forsake our goal of reentering the UN;
instead, we will work harder and more vigorously. Hopefully, our
compatriots will grant us their consent on this issue by giving the
new administration the complete support that it needs. Thank you!</P>
      <P>Q9: You just mentioned the special group to investigate the
murder of navy Captain Yin Ching-feng. Is the special group placed
under the Office of the President? Is Prosecutor General Lu Jen-fa
directly responsible to you? Will this become an established practice
in dealing with serious criminal cases in the future? Will the case
of Chen Wen-cheng's death and the murder of the Lin families have
similar action?</P>
      <P>A: I did not say that the special group belonged to the Office of
the President, neither could it be. The whole investigation should
belong and return to the judicial system. We just ask Prosecutor
General Lu Jen-fa of the Supreme Court to be the convener of the
special group. Because the case involves many agencies, including the
military and police, we think the special group will experience some
difficulties in investigation if it is not upgraded to a higher
level. Therefore, as a result of prior communication and
coordination, we deem it appropriate to establish a special
investigation group led by Prosecutor General Lu Jen-fa. I do not
want any misunderstanding. We respect the judicial system. We will do
our best to investigate the case as long as it is necessary. In other
words, if we make any breakthrough in investigating previous criminal
cases, we will let you know. Thank you.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Q10: Mr. President, the Tang cabinet might become incapable of
implementing major policies, if the opposition parties reject the
government budget for next fiscal year. If the Democratic Progressive
Party fails to obtain a majority of the seats in the legislative
election next year, would it be possible to form a coalition cabinet
under such circumstances?</P>
      <P>A: We have reiterated that the coalition cabinet is not an option
so far. Premier Tang has also made this point very clear in the
Legislative Yuan several times. It is obvious that our government for
all people is not contrary to multi-party politics. We formed the
government for all people on the basis of multi-party politics. The
government for all people does not equal the cabinet for all people.
Instead, it means that the general public are shareholders of the
nation company. The president of the nation company was elected by
the people, and then the premier CEO was appointed by the president.
Forming a government for all people means recruiting capable
individuals to serve in the government regardless of party
affiliation, geographic identity and gender.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the government for all people is supervised by the
general public and the legislature. The Democratic Progressive Party
is the ruling party now, but it is a minority party in the
Legislative Yuan, with less than one-third of the seats. However, it
does not mean that we must form a coalition cabinet. Obviously, the
congress supervises the government and the policy of executive
departments. It is no wonder that boycotts and resistance from the
opposition parties, which are often seen in democratic countries,
sometimes occur.</P>
      <P>Some people believe that they should bring down the cabinet if
they disagree with the new administration and the new cabinet, while
others think that refusing to participate in the cabinet will be
sufficient. We hope to strengthen the interaction and communication
between the ruling party and opposition parties in the future,
especially on the issue of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>I personally believe that our legislators will consider the
interests of the nation and the general public when reviewing the
government budget. I will put the interest of the nation and the
general public above party and personal interests. I believe that we
will act positively towards criticism and budget cutting. We will
never let the review of the government budget interfere with the
development of the nation, especially the prosperity of economy, the
welfare of the people, and the security of the nation.</P>
      <P>This is not to say that by returning the government budget the
legislators can overturn the cabinet. The current constitutional
structure and laws have certain mechanisms to overcome such
difficulties. Therefore, even if the government budget is returned, a
coalition cabinet is still impossible. Our citizens are not fools,
and the indirect checks and balances from the general public still
exist. Our fellow countrymen supervise and check both the new
administration and the legislature. We hope the cabinet and the
Legislative Yuan can work together in the future. Thank you.</P>
      <P>Q11: Taiwan Power Company recently announced that it would
continue to cooperate with North Korea to establish facilities for
handling low-level nuclear waste. The previous government regarded
such a plan as a usual commercial transaction. I am not sure whether
the new government sees it in a new way or perhaps has a new
approach. If you do not call off plans for the fourth nuclear power
plant, will you take a more vigorous approach?</P>
      <P>A: This question is closely related to whether we will continue
with the construction of the fourth nuclear power plant and also to
the final disposal of nuclear waste from the power plants. I am sure
that everyone knows we do not have the best solution for disposing
nuclear waste. In other words, no country in this world has a truly
perfect and safe way for the final disposal of nuclear waste. This is
the crucial reason why so many people are opposed to the fourth
nuclear power plant and its continued construction. Ironically, while
the fourth nuclear power plant is under construction, however, we
still do not have a truly effective and safe way to dispose of
nuclear waste from our existing power plants. We find this
incredible. Whether the fourth nuclear power plant will continue to
be built is under evaluation. The Ministry of Economic Affairs hopes
to reach a decision in four months' time. And we would not want too
much interference by my remarks.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Even former Vice Premier Yu felt a need to add another vice
premier post to the Executive Yuan. It would be helpful to the
Premier. The Legislative Yuan is in the same situation. Korea has two
parliamentary speakers. One of them is from the largest opposition
party. In fact, the consideration of slowly cultivating parliament
leaders has its merit. Just like the present executive departments,
which have experienced unprecedented party change.</P>
      <P>Who can guarantee which party will one day become the majority in
our parliament or our Legislative Yuan. It is difficult to predict.
Therefore, we should consider it as it stands. Perhaps we should
consider adding another vice president post to the Legislative Yuan.
Many people think about this. I just raise it and ask for your
advice. I have no specific prejudice. I mean we all should put
considerations to constitutional reform. I have no prejudice against
subjects for discussion on constitutional reform. I am willing to
listen to you all.</P>
      <P>Q13: Mr. President, questions about domestic and foreign affairs
and the cross-strait relationship have already been raised, so I want
to ask about problems occurring within the Office of the President,
that is, your communication with the Vice President. The Vice
President has criticized your attitude in handling the Pachang River
incident, and you made a response accordingly when receiving foreign
guests the next day. Don't you think that the broadcast dialog
between the president and the vice president of the country
represents a problem in communication? Or, do you think a more
serious style of communication should be taken to ensure
clarification?</P>
      <P>A: Not long ago I noticed that a member from the media
interviewed the president of Latvia, who is a woman. At the end of
the article, a similar question was asked: "As a woman president,
what do you think is the greatest obstacle in politics?" The Latvian
president answered that the question was in fact a matter of
personality and not a matter of gender. Unless everyone has
forgotten, at my June 20 presidential press conference, I also
addressed this same question. I made it clear that even though I am
quite clear on the issues between us, it is a matter of personality
rather than gender. Personality needs some time for adjustment. I am
a patient person, and I am willing to coordinate and make some
adjustments.</P>
      <P>Everybody has extremely high expectations and demands of the Vice
President, and she also has very high expectations of herself. We are
willing to provide her with opportunities and occasions to show her
ability. But the functions we have are determined according to the
constitutional system. As a matter of fact, in many cases we have
already overcome past areas of ambiguity, and even some taboos. For
example, in the second military affairs meeting that will be held
this afternoon, I have, just as in the first meeting, broken
precedent by taking the initiative in personally inviting the Vice
President to join me at the meeting. Therefore, in the present and in
the future, there are many occasions where I will need to ask for the
Vice President's support. Gradually, people will understand that the
Vice President can play an even more active role in handling many
government affairs, and she can do it very well. I would like to ask
everyone to do as I have, by patiently encouraging, and supporting
Vice President Lu. Thank you.</P>
      <P>Q14: Mr. President, based on your previous statement, I believe
that everyone can clearly perceive your goodwill and sincerity --
whether it is with respect to improving finance and economics or
cross-strait relations. However, although we can sense your goodwill
and sincerity, you have yet to give us a clear idea about what your
specific policies are since taking office. Specifically, what is your
actual position for Taiwan in cross-strait relations? During the
presidential campaign when former President Lee Teng-hui stated his
policy on the two sides was based on "special state-to-state
relations," you firmly insisted on Taiwan's independent sovereignty.
Has your stance on this changed any since then? Thank you.

    <HEADLINE>PRESS CONFERENCE (XVII)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A: I already outlined my cross-strait policy in my May 20
inaugural address, and I expounded upon it during my June 20 press
conference. To this day, there still have not been any changes or
advancements made with respect to cross-strait policy. To refresh
everyone's memories, I clearly stated that: First, we will definitely
maintain our nation's sovereignty, dignity, and security while
seeking the greatest welfare for the people; and second, we feel that
both sides of the Taiwan Strait should respect the people's freedom
of choice. I never used the term plebiscite, nor did I use the term
of right of resident self-determination. Again, what I stressed was
respecting the people's freedom of choice. In other words, regarding
Taiwan's future, only the 23 million people on Taiwan have the right
to make that final choice and decision. This point is completely
consistent with the remarks made by US President Clinton that any
resolution of cross-strait relations must have the consent of the
people on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>I have continuously stated that we hopes the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait can improve their relations and deal with the future
question of "one China" according to the principles of peace,
democracy, and parity. The resolution of cross-strait relations is
the unavoidable responsibility of the leaders on both sides, and my
words on this matter have already been made extremely clear. However,
it is impossible for me to tell you choices in a multiple-choice
question or which is right in a true-or-false problem each time
immediately after I am given the test paper.</P>
      <P>I only hope that everyone can understand my sincerity, goodwill,
and sense of responsibility. Indeed, our current cross-strait policy
has not only met with the approval of the majority of the people on
Taiwan, but is also acceptable to both the ruling and opposition
parties. Thank you.</P>
      <P>Q15: Everyone is concerned about the president's trip abroad next
month. In a company, whenever the president leaves on business, the
question on everyone's mind is always: who will be left in charge,
the vice president or the general manager? With respect to future and
past policies, can you clearly expound upon the responsibilities that
will be given to the vice president while you are away? Will she be
given more power to deal with domestic affairs during your absence?</P>
      <P>A: The president will still exist; he won't simply disappear just
because he is abroad. As the president and commander-in-chief of the
armed forces of the Republic of China, the powers that I hold will
not be affected in the slightest by an overseas trip. Indeed,
considering how developed connections and communications are in
today's world, there are absolutely no obstacles that could hinder me
from carrying out my duties in governing domestic affairs while
outside of Taiwan. Similarly, whenever US President Clinton is
outside of the United States, he is still the president of the United
States no matter where he goes. There is no problem of finding an
"acting president." The same is true for former President Lee
Teng-hui -- wherever he went or whatever countries he visited, he was
always the president of the Republic of China, and his powers as
president and as commander-in-chief of the armed forces remained
perfectly intact.</P>
      <P>My visit abroad next month has already been carefully planned and
coordinated by the national security and foreign affairs department
to the best of their ability, and the "command post exercises"
ensuring our country's security have already been carried out by the
Ministry of National Defense. Thus, everyone feels that the timing is
right, and I am confident of embarking on my first "friendly journey
for democratic diplomacy" next month. I hope the trip can gain the
support of the people and the affirmation of both the ruling and
opposition parties. While on my trip, if you should have any further
questions, please feel free to offer them to me at anytime. I promise
to do my best to take your suggestions into consideration. Thank you
again, and I invite all of you to take the trip with me next month.</P>

      <P>Zhong Gong, a spiritual sect similar to

      <P>Zhang was preliminarily granted political asylum status by US

the status for him has been delayed because China has asked the US
to deny him the status.</P>
      <P>US authorities in Guam said in a recent immigration hearing that
the Chinese embassy has alleged in a letter that Zhang fled China
illegally and that he is a suspect in a criminal case.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and
Democracy said Tuesday that the Zhong Gong organization, which is
said having an estimated membership of 38 million in China, has sent
an open letter to President Bill Clinton, requesting the US
government to grant him political asylum.</P>
      <P>The organization said that Zhang did not commit any crime in
China and that the Chinese embassy made the allegation in order to
undermine his application for political asylum in the US.</P>
      <P>The Chinese government has arrested at least 600 leaders and
closed 3,000 training bases of Zhong Gong since it began to crack
down on the organization in 1996, according to the letter.</P>

scheduled on Wednesday, KMT Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng said on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lin stressed that there will be no change in the planned

    <HEADLINE>OFFSHORE KUEISHAN ISLAND FORMALLY OPENS TO TOURISTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ilan,  northern Taiwan, Aug. 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kueishan Island off Taiwan's
northeastern coast was partially opened to tourists on Tuesday after
24 years of military control.</P>
      <P>More than 400 people, including 100-plus Kueishan Island
residents, 160 tourists from various parts of Taiwan, 68 journalists
and 70-plus government officials embarked on the maiden voyage from
Ilan County's Wushih fishing port to the newly opened offshore
island.</P>
      <P>Mao Chi-kuo, vice minister of transportation and communications,
and Ilan County Magistrate Liu Shou-cheng jointly presided over a
prayer service at Wushih in celebration of the opening of Kueishan
Island for pleasure trips.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the occasion, Mao said the lifting of the tourist ban
is the result of many years of concerted efforts of the Ilan County
Government and elected representatives at various levels, as well as
the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of the Interior and
several other government agencies.</P>
      <P>"We appreciate their contributions and will make continued
efforts to conserve Kueishan Island's beautiful natural scenery and
wildlife," Mao pledged.</P>
      <P>Led by Mao, a total of 10 boats left Wushih at 10:20 a.m. on the
maiden voyage, with their sirens blaring and colorful balloons
bobbing in the breeze.</P>
      <P>When the visitors arrived at a newly completed mooring on the
island, indigenous residents performed drum and gong dances to
welcome their arrival.</P>
      <P>Mao then officiated at an inaugural ceremony for a newly
completed travel service center. Mao said the inauguration of the

      <P>Kueishan Island, a volcanic island formed 200,000 years ago, has
an area of 2.9 square kilometers. It is rich in tourist resources,
including strangely shaped steep cliffs, spas and wildlife. Pleasure
trips to the island were banned after the military took control of
the island in 1977.</P>
      <P>As the island, which is said to resemble a turtle in shape,

    <HEADLINE>ONE ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HAZARD REGISTERED EVERY 6 MINUTES IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  1  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One environmental public hazard was
registered every 5.6 minutes in Taiwan last year, according to
statistics released on Tuesday by the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA).</P>
      <P>The EPA statistics show that there were a total of 93,555
complaints of environmental public hazards in Taiwan last year, with
illegal trash dumping and excessive noise making up most of the
cases.</P>
      <P>Complaints of illegal dumping reached 32,135, the majority of
which were cases of dumping trash and vehicles, as well as abandoning
dogs, according to the statistics.</P>
      <P>Complaints of excessive noise totaled 22,306 last year, with
factory-generated noise pollution accounting for more than 30 percent
of the total, the figures show.</P>
      <P>EPA officials said that the public has become more concerned
about environmental problems such as improper trash disposal and
excessive noise.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, complaints of repulsive odors in the air have
increased as high as 250 percent over the last 7 years.</P>
      <P>The statistics also found that industrial pollution accounted for
25.6 percent of last year's complaints, followed by residential
pollution, and commercial-sector pollution, in this order.</P>
      <P>Taipei City was the location of most complaints of public hazards
last year, accounting for more than 20 percent of all cases among
cities in Taiwan, according to the same figures.</P>
      <P>EPA officials urged the public to be on guard and actively inform
the agency of any illegal pollution, adding that more evidence is
helpful for prosecuting cases. Citizens can now use e-mail to inform
the EPA of any environmental crimes, they added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINESE  NABBED FOR ELECTROCUTING FISH IN KINMEN WATERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Aug.  1  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Four mainland Chinese were handed over to
the Kinmen District Prosecutors' Office on Tuesday on charges of
electrocuting fish near Kinmen and illegally entering Republic of
China waters, sources from Kinmen Coastal Patrol Squad reported.</P>
      <P>Kinmen coastal patrol forces discovered more than 30 mainland
Chinese fishing boats converging on an inner channel between Kinmen
Island and neighboring Liehyu Islet the previous day. After the
mainland vessels dispersed later in the day, patrol officers found
that four mainland men had landed near the inner channel and were
poaching fish with electrification gear.</P>
      <P>The four were then brought to a nearby police station for
interrogation and their gear was confiscated.</P>
      <P>According to Peng Ju, described as the leader of the four,
mainland fishermen pay about 20 renminbi each to skippers who take
them to Kinmen, located just 2.4 km off the mainland Chinese coast,
where they go electro-fishing and then sell their catches on the spot
to Kinmen residents.</P>
      <P>The four mainlanders' daring deeds were considered only the tip
of an iceberg of illegal transactions across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>According to private business sector sources in Kinmen, mainland
people have become increasingly active in recent months, sailing
frequently to Kinmen where they conduct "small scale" trade with the
locals.</P>
      <P>This "small scale" trade activity is so easy and prevalent that
some Kinmen-based travel agencies have even incorporated it into
their tourist itineraries for visitors from Taiwan -- if the tourists
are interested in taking a look at the illegal trade, the travel
agency simply makes a phone call, and within half an hour, mainland
fishing boats arrive at a predetermined spot where the tourists are
not only entertained by watching the transactions, but can also make
purchases of their own.</P>
      <P>Over the past month, the Kinmen coastal patrol forces have
confiscated over 8,000 kg of mainland-originating agricultural
products, including wheat, rice and peanuts.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen County government has decided to make the confiscated
products into fertilizer.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Education Minister Ovid
Tzeng, who was impeached by the Control Yuan on Monday, said on
Tuesday that he has no intention of relinquishing his current post.</P>
      <P>He told reporters that he respects the decision of the Control
Yuan, but added that he would not resign because the country's
educational reform should not be delayed or come to a standstill.</P>
      <P>Tzeng was in Hsinchu to preside over a meeting of the national
educational administration that was attended by chiefs of education
bureaus from all the island's counties and cities.</P>
      <P>He said that he will make a full explanation to the Judicial
Yuan's Committee on Discipline of Public Functionaries if he is
required to do so.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan decided 9-1 on Monday to impeach Tzeng for his
failure to forsake his American citizenship, as required by law, when
he took posts as dean of the College of Social Sciences under
National Chung Cheng University and as vice president and president
of National Yang Ming University from 1992 to May 2000.</P>
      <P>The case came to light after Tzeng was appointed education
minister last May. He then applied to renounce his American
citizenship at the American Institute in Taiwan in June, and
completed the procedure in mid-July.</P>
      <P>Although the Nationality Law was revised in February of this year
to allow holders of dual citizenship to serve as president of a
national university, but Tzeng had broken the law before the revision
was made.</P>
      <P>Prior to the revision, high-level university officials were
considered to be government-level officials and therefore prohibited
from holding more than one passport.</P>
      <P>People First Party Legislator Chin Hui-chu (Taipei City) said on
Tuesday that Tzeng should step down because as a lawbreaker, he is
not qualified to serve as a model for the country's educators and
public servants.</P>
      <P>Chin expressed her support for the Control Yuan's impeachment,
and added that the Control Yuan should also investigate the dual
citizenship issue among the senior presidential advisors and national

    <HEADLINE>7 INDICTED FOR PACHANG CREEK TRAGEDY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Chiayi,  Taiwan,  Aug.  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Seven people were indicted on
Tuesday on charges of involuntary manslaughter or other offenses for
the recent Pachang Creek tragedy which claimed four lives and ended
the honeymoon for the country's two-month-old government.</P>
      <P>The Chiayi District Prosecutor's Office said the seven people --
a private contractor, a foreman and five public functionaries --
should receive criminal penalties for the deaths of the four riverbed
clean-up workers.</P>
      <P>The indictment accused Chang Yung-hui, the contractor for the
Pachang Creek clean-up project, of violating labor security and
health management laws for forcing the workers to work in the creek
on July 22 after the Central Weather Bureau had issued a warning of
thunderstorms for that afternoon. Chang was also charged with
involuntary manslaughter.</P>
      <P>Kuo Ching-shen, the foreman overseeing the conduct of the
riverbed project, was accused of involuntary manslaughter for
allegedly failing to take any precautionary measures to protect the
safety of the deceased workers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, five duty officers with the Chiayi County Government
fire department, the National Fire Administration's (NFA's) command
center in Taipei and the Police Airborne Squadron's Taichung branch
were charged with either involuntary manslaughter or criminal
negligence of official duties and document forgery.</P>
      <P>If convicted, all seven will face three-to-10-year prison
sentences in line with Taiwan's current Criminal Code.</P>
      <P>According to the indictment, Yo Ching-hung, a squadron leader
with the Chiayi County Government fire department, and Chen Feng-jen,
a member of Yo's team, were charged with involuntary manslaughter for
failing to provide rescue ropes to the ill-fated workers.</P>
      <P>NFA duty officers Hsu Ching-hui and Lu Wen-tsun were charged with
criminal negligence of duty which resulted in a serious disaster.</P>
      <P>Yang Tao-hung, the helicopter captain with the Police Airborne
Squadron's Taichung branch, was charged with criminal negligence and
document forgery for making a false report regarding the time the
distress call was received.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Chiayi prosecutor's office asked military
authorities to punish Chen Meng-hung, a duty officer with the Air
Force's Seagull Rescue Center, in line with relevant military laws
for alleged criminal negligence of duty due to a delay in reporting
the distress call.</P>
      <P>On July 22, people in Taiwan watched in horror and anxiety as
live TV beamed the image of four hapless workers huddled together in
the raging Pachang Creek in the southern county of Chiayi waiting for
rescue helicopters until they finally lost their footing and were
swallowed by the surging current.</P>
      <P>For more than two hours, the three men and a woman waited for a
helicopter rescue which was only a five-minute flight away, as the
Air Force's Seagull Rescue Team is stationed nearby. However, the
various authorities -- firefighters, police and military -- were
unable to agree as to who was responsible for rescue, and the petty
bureaucratic wrangling of low-level pen-pushers led directly to the
death of all four people. Their deaths triggered a public uproar and
shaved about 20 percentage points off President Chen Shui-bian's
popularity ratings.</P>

Taiwan's social stability and economic prosperity if it was tied in

      <P>He added that while it would not be suitable to allow mainland
communist central and state enterprises to invest in Taiwan,
consideration could be given to allowing mainland local governments

to become tools of warfare or to disrupt Taiwan's financial system.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's crime rate climbed in the first six
months of this year, while the rate of police crackdowns on crime
dropped, sources from the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting

      <P>DGBAS officials said the number of reported crime cases totaled
roughly 196,000 in the first six months of 2000, equivalent to 844
reported cases for every 100,000 people, up 31 in number, or 4.4
percent, over the figure posted in the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>Theft topped all the crimes in the six-month period, followed by
drug abuse and trafficking, drunken driving, and violence, in that
order, DGBAS officials noted.</P>
      <P>The number of cases involving drunken driving and reckless
driving under the influence of drugs increased the most, up 3.3-fold
over the year-earlier period. DGBAS officials attributed the sharp
increase to the formal inclusion into criminal records of such

      <P>The panel, led by State Public Prosecutor General Lu Ren-fa,
consists of prosecutors from the Ministry of Justice (MOJ),
detectives from the Investigative Bureau under the Ministry of
Justice and the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB), and the director
of the Military Justice Bureau Maj. Gen. Liu Chin-an.</P>
      <P>Lu said after the one-and-a-half-hour meeting that the probe into
the death of Capt. Yin Ching-feng will be led by the CIB, which has
been in charge of the case even since the crime's perpetration in
1993 -- despite the fact that it has made absolutely no headway in
the investigation in all that time.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile the Investigative Bureau will look into alleged
irregularities in the navy's purchase of four minesweepers from
Germany and six Lafayette-class frigates from France in the 1990s,
which could led to Yin's murderer, as Yin was the executive director
of the navy's weapons purchase program before his death.</P>
      <P>The detectives from both the Investigative Bureau and the CIB
will be subject to the supervision of MOJ prosecutors, said Lu.</P>
      <P>Lu said the panel has received a promise from the Ministry of
National Defense (MND) to hand over all information related to Yin to
the panel within one week. The MND also promised to produce any other
documents in its possession needed by the panel.</P>
      <P>In order to get to the bottom of the case, the panel is also
empowered to interview military officers regardless of rank, said the
national head of prosecutors.</P>
      <P>The case opened in 1993 when Yin's body was found floating in
northern Taiwan's Suao Harbor after he began collecting evidence of
irregularities in the navy's weaponry purchase program.</P>
      <P>Yin's death was first determined by the navy to be a suicide, but
evidence came to light afterward suggesting that he had been murdered
because of his knowledge of the irregularities in the navy's purchase
of warships. No one has ever been arrested for Yin's murder.</P>
      <P>Recent reports from Paris that US$500 million in kickbacks were
paid to Taiwan in the deal for the six French frigates fueled
speculation that the navy was conducting a large-scale cover-up.</P>
      <P>In a related development, Yin's widow Lee Mei-kuei and Legislator
Lee Ching-hua questioned the appropriateness of having Maj. Gen. Liu
Chin-an on the panel.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Liu himself had tried to cover up the case while
investigating Yin's death as the head of navy legal department in
1994, they argued his inclusion in the panel will only undermine its
credibility, given his previous fruitless probe.</P>
      <P>Liu said he understood Lee's grief over the loss of her husband
and her anguish over the military's failure to hunt down the murder
or murders, but he claimed his participation in the panel will
"definitely benefit the investigation."</P>
      <P>The MND said on Tuesday that Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen had
named Deputy Defense Minister Chen Pi-chao as the panel's MND contact
and that he will cooperate fully in the investigation.</P>
      <P>Vice Chief of the General Staff Gen. Wang Han-ning was appointed
the panel's contact at the General Staff Headquarters, and Lt. Adm.
Chang Chih-hua as the contact at Navy General Headquarters, said a
spokesman for the MND.</P>

mainland Chinese hi-technology workers to develop the knowledge-based
industry on Taiwan, a CEPD official said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Under the draft proposal on the development of knowledge-based
economy approved by the CEPD on Tuesday, the government should tap
overseas skilled technologists, especial those from mainland China,
to develop the island's economy.</P>
      <P>The proposal also suggests that the government streamline its
education system to facilitate the development of the
knowledge-oriented industry by revamping the courses available at
local schools to produce broadly educated people rather than people
specialized in a single field.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PM ACCEPTS RESIGNATIONS OF TWO ADMINISTRATORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei on Wednesday accepted the
resignations of the chiefs of the police and the fire administrations
over the Pachang Creek tragedy on July 22 in which four riverbed
clean-up workers were washed away in a flash flood because of a
bungled rescue effort.</P>
      <P>Ting Yuan-chin, director-general of the National Police
Administration (NPA), and Chen Hung-yi, director-general of the
National Fire Administration (NFA), submitted their resignations soon
after the river rescue fiasco. After about a week of consideration,
Premier Tang accepted their resignation proposals.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tang also approved Ting and Chen's successors proposed
by Interior Minister Chang Po-ya on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wang Chin-wang, 53, currently director of the Taipei City Police
Headquarters, will succeed Ting as NPA director-general. Wang, who
has received more than 500 citations during his 27-year police
career, was highly recommended for his integrity and ability.</P>
      <P>Wang's being nominated as the new police administrator was
considered natural as he had a good working relationship with Chen
Shui-bian during Chen's tenure as the mayor of Taipei between 1994
and 1998.</P>
      <P>Chao Kang, 55, holder of a master's degree in public
administration from New York University, is currently a lecturer at
Central Police University and Chaoyang University. Chao was formerly
director-general of the Fire Department of the Taiwan Provincial
Government.</P>
      <P>Chao's nomination as Taiwan's top fire official was welcomed by
former Taiwan provincial governor and opposition People First Party
Chairman James Soong as a wise decision, jointly made by the
Presidential Office, Premier Tang Fei, and Interior Minister Chang
Po-ya.</P>
      <P>Chao had been a key campaigner for Soong during the 2000
presidential race, in which Soong lost to Chen Shui-bian by a narrow
margin.</P>
      <P>On July 22, people in Taiwan watched in horror and anxiety as
live television cameras beamed images of the four hapless workers
huddled together in the raging Pachang Creek in the southern county
of Chiayi waiting for over two hours for rescue helicopters that
never came until finally losing their footing and being swallowed up
by the surging current.</P>
      <P>Their deaths triggered a public uproar and shaved about 20
percentage points off President Chen Shui-bian's approval ratings.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW ROC RULING PARTY TO BOOST EXCHANGES WITH BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Aug.  2  (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's new ruling party
will not change its basic stance on Taiwan's independent sovereign
status, but is willing to promote exchanges with mainland China in a
flexible manner, a Japanese daily reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Mainichi Shimbun said Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Frank Hsieh has repeatedly emphasized the ROC's status as
an independent sovereign state in a recent interview with the
paper.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the paper said, Hsieh has also expressed the DPP's
willingness to forge ties with mainland China in a flexible
attitude.</P>
      <P>Hsieh was quoted as having told the Japanese paper that if
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can maintain good relations, the
DPP will take active steps to boost exchanges with the mainland.
"But if Beijing remains hostile toward Taiwan, the DPP may change
its strategy and suspends its reconciliation efforts," he added.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, a human rights lawyer-turned-politician, further said the
DPP is likely to revise its pro-independence party platform if
mainland China renounces its attempt to use force against Taiwan and
the cross-strait atmosphere becomes increasingly peaceful.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has ruled out any party-to-party contacts
with the DPP unless the ROC's new ruling party scraps the
pro-independence plank in its party charter.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who concurrently serves as mayor of Kaohsiung, Taiwan's
second largest city, said he personally favors increased
cross-strait exchanges to enhance mutual understanding and foster
rapprochement.</P>
      <P>Hsieh criticized the new ROC government's disapproval of his
plan to visit Xiamen, a southeastern mainland Chinese port city
located opposite Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The disapproval reflects the government's conservative attitude
toward breaking the current cross-strait impasse," Hsieh noted,
adding that both sides of the Taiwan Strait should encourage
city-to-city interchanges to help revive the long-stalled
quasi-official cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said both Kaohsiung, also Taiwan's largest sea port, and
Xiamen play a pivotal role in the existing direct cross-strait
transshipping service. "Against this backdrop, the two cities
should be allowed to engage in exchanges in various fields," he
noted.</P>
      <P>Touching on President Chen Shui-bian's recent criticism of
opposition lawmakers' craze for visiting mainland China, Hsieh said
he personally does not oppose such visits so long as Taiwan's
legislators can maintain dignity in their engagement with mainland
officials.</P>
      <P>"It's not bad that Taiwan's elected representatives travel to
the mainland and inform Beijing officials of Taiwan people's
mainstream opinions and aspirations concerning cross-strait
relations," Hsieh explained.</P>
      <P>President Chen, also a DPP stalwart, has branded his
administration as a "government for all people" and has pledged to
put overall national interests above personal and partisan
interests.</P>
      <P>As the DPP's new chairman, Hsieh said he will hold regular
consultations with Chen's administration. "But if the government's
policy seriously contradicts the DPP platform, we'll firmly uphold
our party platform," he stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO HOLD ECONOMIC CONFERENCE WITH FIVE LATIN ALLIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China is scheduled to hold
an economic conference with five of its diplomatic allies in Central
and South America on Aug. 27 in an effort to further bolster economic
and trade ties with that part of the world, Vice Economics Minister
Chen Ruey-long said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Vice ministerial-level economic and trade officials from Costa
Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and the ROC are
expected to get together in Guatemala City beginning Aug. 27 to
explore the feasibility of further cementing trade, business, and
investment exchanges between the ROC and its five diplomatic allies,
Chen noted.</P>
      <P>The six-nation economic conference, the first of its kind, will
come on the heels of President Chen Shui-bian's state visits to Costa
Rica, the Dominican Republic, and Nicaragua between Aug. 13-25, Chen
added.</P>
      <P>The president's first overseas tour since his inauguration on May
20 will also take him to the African nations of Gambia, Burkina Faso,
and Chad.</P>
      <P>Major topics expected to be discussed during the conference
include the signing of agreements on double-tax exemption, temporary
admission of goods, simplification of entry visa processing
procedures, and also how to strengthen bilateral economic and trade
relations, as well as how Taiwan should further expand sales to
Central and South America, said Chen.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs on Wednesday convened the first
preparatory meeting for the cross-border conference with officials
from the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development,
the Council of Labor Affairs, and the Ministries of Finance, Foreign
Affairs, and Transportation and Telecommunications.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF CALLS FOR `SUBSTANTIVE CONTACTS' WITH ARATS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The vice chairman of Taiwan's intermediary
body with mainland China, the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF),
called on Wednesday for "substantive contacts" between the SEF and
its Beijing counterpart to help resume cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>SEF Vice Chairman Shi Hwei-yow said that only when negotiators
from the SEF and the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS) return to the negotiating table will the cross-strait
dialogue get back on track.</P>
      <P>Shi suggested that the two quasi-official bodies begin with
actual contacts and gradually proceed toward a resumption of the
long-stalled cross-strait dialogue, which was unilaterally suspended
by Beijing last July when then-President Lee Teng-hui redefined
cross-strait ties as a "special state-to-state relationship."</P>
      <P>Shi made the remarks on the eve of the first board directors
meeting of the SEF since the new ROC government was inaugurated on
May 20.</P>
      <P>During Thursday's meeting, SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's top
appointed negotiator with mainland China, is expected to repeat
Taipei's sincerity in its invitation to ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan to
visit Taiwan for the second round of Koo-Wang talks since 1993 and to
reiterate the consensus reached in 1992 by both sides on separate
verbal interpretations of the "one China" principle, according to
Shi.</P>
      <P>Shi noted that without written confirmation of the 1992

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT HAPPY TO SEE INTER-PARTY ENGAGEMENT: DPP CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  2  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian is happy to see
increased engagement among Taiwan's major political parties,
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Frank Hsieh said on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks after a weekly lunch meeting with Chen,
who is also a DPP stalwart.</P>
      <P>Hsieh had just ended a high-profile meeting with opposition
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan before his lunch meeting with the
president.</P>
      <P>"I briefed President Chen on my meeting with Lien," Hsieh said,
adding that Chen was pleased to learn that the unprecedented DPP-KMT
summit meeting "turned out to be a success."</P>
      <P>Chen was quoted as having told Hsieh that he is convinced that
constructive inter-party engagement can help promote inter-party
harmony and is also conducive to domestic political development.</P>
      <P>"President Chen also said he hopes that the Hsieh-Lien meeting
will mark a start toward the establishment of a sound inter-party
consultative mechanism to facilitate the formation of a national
consensus on major national policy issues," Hsieh told reporters.</P>
      <P>The new DPP chairman further said Chen does not think that
traditional party politics contradicts his ideal of making his
administration "a government for all people."</P>
      <P>Hsieh said Chen has encouraged him not to confine his inter-party
engagement to any specific party. "The president has encouraged me to
arrange meetings with the leaders of other major opposition parties,"
he noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsieh told Chen that he had come to terms with Lien on
several technical details concerning the holding of a preparatory
meeting for a Chen-proposed roundtable discussion with the top
leaders of the ruling and opposition parties.</P>
      <P>"Chen said he will appoint a deputy secretary-general to the
president to contact the KMT and other major opposition parties and
arrange a preparatory meeting to set the agenda and timing for the
much-anticipated inter-party roundtable," said Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Chen swept to power in the March 18 presidential election and
his election victory marked an end to the KMT's 55-year political
monopoly in Taiwan. The KMT, however, still controls a majority in
the Legislative Yuan, Taiwan's parliament. A lack of communications
between the DPP and the KMT has hindered the operation of Chen's
administration since it was inaugurated on May 20.</P>
      <P>In addition to the inter-party interaction issue, Hsieh said he
also exchanged views with the president on other major domestic
problems, including the government's anti-black gold politics
campaign to eradicate official corruption and gangster involvement in
politics.</P>
      <P>"Chen also reiterated his determination to probe the high-profile
Navy Captain Yin Ching-feng murder case," Hsieh added, referring to
the controversial case in which Yin's body was found in eastern
Taiwan's Suao Harbor in 1993.</P>
      <P>Yin had been in charge of the navy's weapons procurement program
and had reportedly been on the point of blowing the whistle on a
massive corruption and kickback scam involving the purchase program.
No one has ever been indicted in the case, but a new panel set up
on the order of Chen on Monday is hoping to shed more light on the
issue.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug. 2 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The International Olympic Committee (IOC)
is set to approve the testing for the presence of the hormone
erythropoietin (EPO) in atheletes competing at the 2000 Olympic Games
in Sydney, according to organizers.</P>
      <P>They told reporters that a team of IOC doctors and scientists is
poised to approve testing for the presence of EPO following two days
of intense scrutiny of the science underpinning two EPO test methods
-- a urine test established by French scientists and a blood test
created by Australian scientists.</P>
      <P>It appears that the IOC is set to implement a test using both
procedures in time for the Sydney Olympic Games in mid-September.</P>
      <P>Sports experts said the two tests combined provide a solid and
reliable test for EPO, but if applied singularly, may only give
lawyers a very small chance to contest the validity of the tests in
court.</P>
      <P>"If the science can be shown to be flawed, then any athlete would
be entitled to contest it just as they did in the early days with
urine testing," said Brian Doyle, who represents the Australian and
New Zealand Sports Law Association.</P>
      <P>The IOC, which is facing pressure to present a clean Olympic
Games and whose reputation hangs in the balance, has demanded an
infallible test.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US WOULD UNLIKELY STAND BY IF CHINA ATTACKED TAIWAN: US COMMANDER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  1 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing would have a difficult time if
it attempted an invasion of Taiwan, and it is unlikely US forces
would stand idly by if an unprovoked attack occurred, said Adm.
Thomas B. Fargo, commander of the US Pacific Fleet.</P>
      <P>Fargo told the Naval Submarine League annual conference held
recently in Alexandria, Virginia that he envisions two possible
courses in US relationships with Communist China. "We could develop
closer economic ties, which is what we would like to see happen. The
alternative would be a zero-sum game where what is to our advantage
equates to their disadvantage and vice versa," he said.</P>
      <P>Fargo is scheduled to visit mainland China this month, reported
the magazine National Defense in its latest issue.</P>
      <P>His plan is to treat Communist China the same way a shepherd
treats his camel, he said. As the story goes, the shepherd goes to
Mohammed asking whether tying up his camel means he has lost his
faith in God. Mohammed's answer is, "trust in God, but you'd better
tie up your camel too. I think that is how we need to treat China,"
said Fargo.</P>
      <P>Fargo also believes there is a "growing recognition that our
military interests are shifting to the Pacific." And top US
priorities in the Pacific today include maintaining a balance of
power that will preclude the rise of government-sponsored military
buildups, and providing US military presence for regional security.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Men have biological clocks, and they start
ticking once a man hits his 30s, according to a major British
research study of 8,515 couples, reported The Sydney Morning Herald
on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The study confirmed for the first time that a man's age affects
his ability to procreate. It also found the likelihood of a couple
conceiving in the first 12 months of trying for a baby drop 3 percent
for every year the male partner is over 24, reported the daily.</P>
      <P>A report published by the journal Human Reproduction said the
probability of it taking more than 12 months for a couple to conceive
a baby is 8 percent for men aged under 25, but by the time men have
reached the age of 35, that probability rises to 15 percent.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted Dr. Chris Ford, the research leader, as saying
that "the study tells us that to some degree that men as well as
women have a biological clock that starts ticking as they get into
their 30s."</P>
      <P>"It also indicates that paternal age is another factor to be
taken into account when doctors are looking at the prognosis for
infertile couples," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Representative to
the United States Chen Chien-jen on Tuesday hosted a party in honor
of scores of US and foreign dignitaries attending the Republican
nomination convention here, including a group of ROC lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Addressing the occasion, Chen welcomed the presence of the
10-member ROC legislative delegation headed by Kuomintang Legislator
Hung Yuh-chin and his counterparts from three other major political
parties in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the ROC lawmakers were in Philadelphia to gain
a better understanding of US democratic practices by taking part in
activities sponsored by the Republican Party and also "to celebrate
democracy, freedom and human rights with their American friends."</P>
      <P>Senator Craig Thomas (R. Wyo.), head of the Senate Asian affairs
committee, said he does not think that there will be any changes in
Washington-Taipei-Beijing relations if Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
Republican Party's presidential nominee, is elected as the next US
president in November.</P>
      <P>Thomas said the United States will continue to maintain its

that Taipei and Beijing should try to resolve their problems on their
own, he added.</P>
      <P>Representative Dana Rohrabacher (R. Cal.) told reporters from
Taiwan that the first thing the new US government will handle when it
is set up in January 2001, will be to decide whether Washington will
provide adequate anti-missile equipment to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Stressing his strong belief that Bush will win the election, he
said the Texas governor and son of former US President George Bush is
more in favor of providing Taiwan with sufficient defensive weapons

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>People convicted of catching protected local
insect species might face jail terms of up to five years and fines of
up to NT$1 million, sources from the Council of Agriculture (COA)
reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Officials from the COA's Wildlife Protection Task Force said 18
species of insects and arachnids, most of them indigenous to Taiwan,
have been listed as protected species that must not be taken except
for academic research and education purposes.</P>
      <P>The protected species are: broad-tailed swallowtail butterfly;
highland red-bellied swallowtail butterfly; bird-winged butterfly;
Heng-chun bird-winged butterfly; large purple fritillary; Formosan
giant cicada; Watanabei's lanternfly; jumbo dragonfly; brilliant
jewel beetle; rainbow sheath click beetle; Formosan long-armed
scarab; Formosan giant stag beetle; Formosan long-fanged stag beetle;
Wu-she blood-spotted longhorn beetle; Formosan snail-eating ground
beetle; Lan-hsu giant katydid; and big-headed stick insect, said COA
officials.</P>
      <P>People caught capturing the protected insects will face jail
terms from six months to five years and fines of between NT$200,000
and NT$1 million, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>Illegal capture of other insects and arachnids which are not
listed as protected will also be dealt with the country's wildlife
protection codes, they added, with poachers facing fines ranging from
NT$60,000 to NT$300,000.</P>
      <P>Ignorant of government regulations, many Taiwan residents still
use lights and nets to catch insects randomly, the officials said.</P>
      <P>On July 14, a Japanese man surnamed Tanikado was detained by
Chiang Kai-shek airport police for trying to smuggle out Taiwanese
indigenous insects that were either protected or biologically
invaluable, including an 8-cm Formosan giant stag beetle which
reportedly has a street value of about 10 million yen in Japan, where

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR IN FINLAND TO LEARN FROM `VIRTUAL HELSINKI' PROJECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Helsinki,  Aug.  1  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou arrived in
Finland on Tuesday to learn about the ongoing "Helsinki Arena 2000"
virtual city project in the hope of building Taipei into a
competitive "networked city."</P>
      <P>Ma said on the last stop of a European tour that although Taiwan
may have limited natural resources, it abounds in talented people. He
added that information technology represents the best competitive
edge for Taiwan in the future, and that Taipei has already been
ranked as the most influential high technology center in the Asia
Pacific region by a recent report in the US magazine Wired.</P>
      <P>Ma listened to a briefing on how to integrate existing network
communication tools to make "ubiquitous network communication"
possible. He then proposed plans for exchange visits by high school
students from Taipei and Helsinki so that each side could learn about
the other's virtual city.</P>
      <P>Risto Linturi, founder of Helsinki's virtual city project,
described for Ma an interactive virtual replica of the city of
Helsinki and envisioned permanent links between home and office that
would allow users to control all kinds of appliances and equipment at
any time.</P>
      <P>Linturi, who last visited Taipei in June to speak at the 12th
World Congress on Information Technology, added that his project
would let a user "walk" to his next-door neighbor's house on the net
and ring a virtual doorbell.</P>
      <P>Mobile phones become remote controls for use around the house,
and everything from opening the door, turning off the light, going
shopping, and doing business at the bank can be done through the
network, he said.</P>
      <P>Some of Linturi's other virtual city ideas are electronic "heads
up display" windshields that allow drivers to see a virtual road and
virtual traffic signs and -- when everyone in Finland carries a
mobile phone as will soon be the case -- streetlights that turn off
automatically when there are no mobile phones nearby.</P>
      <P>Finland has a 70 percent mobile phone penetration rate and is
widely expected to be one of the first countries to reach 100
percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL FAMILIES CRITICIZE NEW FOREIGN LABOR POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  2  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In the face of a new foreign labor policy
planned by the government, local hirers complained on Wednesday that
the planned measures will create problems for Taiwan families that
need someone to take care of seriously ill family members.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar sponsored by the Employment and Vocational
Training Administration (EVTA) under the Council of Labor Affairs
(CLA), Lan Liang Hsiao-chuan, head of an association of local
employers of foreign laborers, said that 80 percent of those families
will no longer be able to hire foreign care givers if the "harsh" new
restrictions are implemented.</P>
      <P>Under the new measures, only those families with comatose family
members, or about 20 percent of the total, will be qualified to hire
foreign care givers, a situation which Lan warned will force many
career women to quit their jobs.</P>
      <P>Accusing the government of having caused pain to many Taiwan
families with its new plan, she criticized the government for
targeting local families rather than the high-tech sector in its bid
to cut the number of foreign workers in Taiwan, despite the fact that
it is the local hi-tech industry that actually employs the bulk of
foreign laborers on the island.</P>
      <P>According to CLA statistics, only 76,000 of the nearly 300,000
foreign workers in Taiwan are care givers, while the number of
foreign housemaids totals only around 7,000.</P>
      <P>EVTA Director-General Lin Tsong-ming said the government decided
to reduce the number of alien workers in an effort to lower Taiwan's
unemployment and he added that the government had fully communicated
with local employers organizations before deciding to adjust the
foreign labor policy.</P>
      <P>A special government ad hoc group made a final decision on July
31 to slash the number of alien workers by 15,000 each year to
fulfill a campaign promise made by President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>In the future, quotas for alien laborers in major public
construction projects will be reduced from the current level of 50
percent to 30 percent, while the number of foreign care givers will
be slashed by 6,400 each year.</P>

      <P>The Asian Witness Center

record-setting fathers on Wednesday as part of celebrations for
Father's Day, which falls on Aug. 8.</P>
      <P>One of the record-breakers is Lo Tseng-wen, who has five children
serving as police officers, and the other is Chang A-piao, a
centenarian who is living with four generations of offspring under
the same roof.</P>
      <P>Lo, 78, lives in the northern Taiwan city of Hsinchu. He is
himself a retired policeman and has six sons, five of whom have
followed in their father's footsteps to join the country's police
force. His eldest son is a career military officer. It is rare in
Taiwan that so many family members would be willing to work in the
police community.</P>
      <P>Lo said he took pride in his police job and is very pleased that
his children have chosen the same career path to help maintain law
and order and protect the safety of their fellow countrymen.</P>
      <P>He said that although his children now work and live in different
places, they maintain a close, intimate relationship. "The family
meets regularly to share its joys and experiences. And issues related
to public order, crime and the police community are common topics of
our chats," he said with a smile.</P>
      <P>Also honored was Chang A-piao, a 103-year-old resident of
Fengyuan, Taichung County. The centenarian had also received a
citation in June for his 55 years of service as a grassroots
neighborhood chief in his hometown.</P>
      <P>Chang is the oldest neighborhood chief in Fengyuan, but as he has
practiced Chinese martial arts since childhood, he is still in good
health despite his age. He has maintained good living habits and
consistently rises at 5 a.m.</P>
      <P>Chang has one son, three daughters and "countless" grandchildren,
great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren, all of whom live
under the same roof.</P>
      <P>Chang said his current greatest wish is that Taiwan can enjoy
sustained development and stability.</P>
      <P>The Asian center of the Guinness Book of World Records said it
is seeking other record-setting fathers in Taiwan as part of
celebrations for Father's Day.</P>
      <P>"We are still seeking the island's most productive father, the
oldest child-breaing father and the oldest father," said Tai

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan is scheduled
to visit KMT chapters and overseas Chinese organizations in the
United States and Canada during a 14-day trip that begins on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lien will initially spend three days in San Francisco, where he
will be the first KMT chairman to visit the KMT's US headquarters.
The office was established before the founding of the Republic of
China in 1912.</P>
      <P>Lien will be accompanied by a delegation, including his wife and
KMT spokesman Jason Hu, who said that the visit will not involve any
"political activities."</P>
      <P>The trip will be Lien's first visit to the United States since
stepping down from his previous post as Republic of China vice
president. He was defeated in the March 18 presidential election as
the KMT's presidential candidate.</P>
      <P>Some analysts see the trip as a mission to consolidate KMT
support in the Bay Area. People First Party (PFP) supporters appear
to be increasing rapidly there after PFP Chairman James Soong spent
over a month in San Francisco, following his defeat in the same

    <HEADLINE>MAC DEPUTY HOPES FOR QUICK RESUMPTION OF CROSS-STRAIT TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  2  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior Republic of China official in
charge of mainland China affairs expressed his hope on Wednesday that
two sides of Taiwan Strait should soon resume their dialogue and
conduct negotiations on the basis reached between the two sides in
1992.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-tung, deputy chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), said that the summit between the two Koreas
last month is an indication that reconciliation and negotiations have
become the watchwords of the modern world.</P>
      <P>In response to this worldwide trend, both Taipei and Beijing must
temporarily shelve their so-called "one China" ideological dispute
and resume talks based on the spirit of the agreement reached between
the two sides in 1992, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a seminar for legislative aides on
mainland China policy and cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that two sides of the strait have spent a lot of time
in the past discussing the controversial issue of reunification or
Taiwan independence. Last month's historical summit between the two
Koreas has shown the entire globe that negotiations to overcome
disputes between conflicting sides is the trend for the future, he
added.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the Chen administration hopes that it will be
able to put aside the dispute over reunification or independence, and
work towards the future.</P>
      <P>He said that both Taipei and Beijing reached an understanding
about "one China," in which both sides are able to form their own
interpretation of what that means, in a meeting held in 1992. The
"one China with separate interpretations" basis is sufficiently vague
to provide ample space for negotiations in the future, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Several ROC allies, including the United States, have been
pushing the two sides of Taiwan Strait to begin talks as soon as
possible, he said, adding that the ball is in Beijing's court, as
Taiwan's new government is already prepared to resume talks with
Beijing.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian and Premier Tang Fei have repeatedly
tied cross-strait relations to the frame of a "future China" in which
both sides of the Taiwan Strait has a share.</P>
      <P>President Chen has expressed his hope that he will play a
historic role in normalizing cross-strait relations during his
four-year tenure in office, as Richard Nixon had done for US-China
relations.</P>
      <P>Both Taipei and Beijing should do their best to carry out a
reconciliation with good will and mutual cooperation, so as to create
a permanent peace for a future China, Chen added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT, DPP LEADERS HOLD LANDMARK MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  2  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The top leaders of Taiwan's new ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the leading opposition
Kuomintang held a landmark meeting on Wednesday as part of their
efforts to improve inter-party relations.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan, who ended his stint as vice president on
May 20, led a delegation of senior KMT officials to pay a courtesy
call on his DPP counterpart Frank Hsieh at the DPP headquarters in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>The Lien-Hsieh meeting drew much attention in local society as it
came amid growing rows between the DPP-led government and the
KMT-controlled Legislative Yuan (parliament).</P>
      <P>Lien, who lost to DPP candidate Chen Shui-bian in the March 18
presidential election, seemed to be happy at the meeting.</P>
      <P>"This is a milestone in the history of domestic party politics,
and I hope it will help lay a foundation for mutual respect and
mature interaction among major domestic political parties,"
Lien said.</P>
      <P>Under the mechanism of democracy, Lien said, competition among
political parties may be unavoidable, "but it should be a must that
all political parties work together to bring about benefits for the
general public."</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Hsieh echoed Lien's view, saying local political
parties should shelve unnecessary ideological and emotional
confrontation and forge a consensus on major policy issues in order
to upgrade the quality of domestic politics.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said major political parties have their own social
responsibilities. "If they have different opinions, they should
hold a rational debate and present policy proposals for public choice
through rational debate instead of indulging themselves in political
wrangling. By so doing, we can establish a healthy party politics
system and improve government efficiency and national
competitiveness," he noted.</P>
      <P>Hsieh went on to say he hopes that his meeting with Lien can
contribute to constructive interaction between the KMT and the DPP.</P>
      <P>During their 30-minute talks in a friendly atmosphere,
Lien and Hsieh agreed to name the top managers of day-to-day affairs
of their respective parties to work out details for a "roundtable
meeting" proposed by President Chen.</P>
      <P>Lien previously turned down Chen's proposal that a summit be held
by heads of the domestic political parties on national issues,
ranging from long-stalled cross-Taiwan Strait ties to
possible constitutional amendments, and financial and economic
topics.</P>
      <P>But Lien told Hsieh that if President Chen makes clear his
basic attitude or bottom line for the proposed roundtable, the
KMT might not oppose such an inter-party summit meting.</P>
      <P>Hsieh suggested that a preparatory meeting be held to set
the agenda for the roundtable meeting. Lien agreed to Hsieh's
proposal and named KMT Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng to work
out details with his DPP counterpart Wu Nai-jen.</P>

    <DATELINE>Seoul, Aug. 2 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of South Korean social activists will
meet with their Taiwan counterparts in Taipei in September to draw up
a written accusation against Japan for the Imperial Japanese Army's
practice in World War II of forcing many Asian women to serve as sex
workers for its soldiers.</P>
      <P>Chi En-hee, a South Korean advocate for the former so-called
"comfort women", said on Wednesday that a group of South and North
Korean activists will met with their Taiwan counterparts in Taipei
between Sept. 15-17 to work out a symbolic indictment against Japan's
government.</P>
      <P>The indictment will be presented to a moot international tribunal
organized by a civilian group in Tokyo to underline Imperial Japan's
brutality and press demands for the Japanese government to pay
compensation to the former comfort women.</P>
      <P>Thousands of Asian women were forced or lured into prostitution
by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. Instead of
officially apologizing and paying them appropriate compensation, the
Japanese government has only offered symbolic compensation through
private funds.</P>
      <P>Tokyo's stubborn refusal to admit its liability for the former
comfort women -- most of whom are in their seventies or older and
living in poverty -- has angered international human right activists.
A group of them are planning to stage a mock trial of the Japanese
government in Tokyo later this year, after fruitless attempts to the
win the women's claims for damages through the Japanese judicial
system.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior official said on Wednesday that the
government's ongoing review of the existing "go slow, be patient"
policy on mainland China-bound investment has nothing to do with a
proposal for opening the door to mainland capital.</P>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Lin Yi-fu made the remarks after
new Central Bank of China (CBC) Deputy Governor Chen Shih-meng
suggested on Tuesday that the government allow a "proper amount" of
mainland Chinese capital to flow into Taiwan for selected investment
projects.</P>
      <P>Lin said he couldn't make any comment on Chen's proposal before
gaining a better understanding of the full content of Chen's speech.
Nevertheless, Lin stressed that one thing is certain that the
government's current review of the "go slow, be patient" policy has
nothing to do with the proposed inbound flow of mainland capital.</P>
      <P>The "go slow, be patient" policy is designed to regulate
Taiwan investment in mainland China, Lin explained, adding that the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) and other relevant government
agencies are still discussing whether to ease the policy to offer
local entrepreneurs a freer hand in launching investment projects on
the mainland with a view to enhancing competitiveness in the world
market.</P>
      <P>Lin said the MOEA is mulling some major issues regarding the
adjustment of the "go slow" policy, such as the new fields to be
open for local companies to invest on the mainland.</P>
      <P>"Before we come up with a new liberalization package, we must
conduct extensive discussion with local industries," Lin said,
adding that a new version of regulations governing mainland
China-bound investment is expected to be finalized by mid-September.</P>

parties, although the KMT said it will positively respond to the

      <P>The KMT head, who was defeated by Chen in the March 18

suggested that the two reschedule the so-called "roundtable

should open up to investment from mainland China in phases and in

      <P>On the second day on his post, Chen said that higher tariffs
should be charged for short-term capital investment than those for
long-term investment, and that personal investors and mainland
non-state institutional investors with good records in the past
should be the first to be legalized because they would be less likely
to be used by Beijing for "united front operations."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN TO DINE PARLIAMENTARY LEADERS FOR BETTER TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   3  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will dine
parliamentary leaders of all political stripes on Monday in an effort
to improve interaction between the executive and legislative
branches, the Presidential Office said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>This will be the first time that President Chen holds direct
face-to-face talks with influential Legislative Yuan figures since
he took office on May 20.</P>
      <P>Chen's 20-plus guests will include Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng, Deputy Speaker Yao Eng-chi, and leading members of the
legislative caucuses of various political parties or groups.</P>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei and Vice Premier Chang Chun-hsiung will also
attend the dinner at the Taipei Guest House, a government estate
near the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Chen Tze-nan, deputy secretary-general to the President, visited
the Legislative Yuan, Taiwan's parliament, to distribute invitations
on behalf of the president.</P>
      <P>Chen said the dinner is scheduled for Monday as the
parliament is now in recess. "President Chen will take advantage of
the dinner to exchange views with parliamentary heavyweights on
major policy issues," Chen said while extending an invitation to
Speaker Wang.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that the president will not set any limit to
topics to be discussed at the dinner. "There will be neither ceiling
nor bottom line for the agenda," he added.</P>
      <P>All party whips from across the political spectrum said
they accept the president's invitation with great pleasure. Hsu
Tien-tsai, convener of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
legislative caucus, said he hopes the dinner will mark a good
start for better interaction between the DPP-led government and the
opposition-dominated parliament.</P>
      <P>Opposition New Party whip Lai Shih-pao said he hopes the dinner
can bring about substantive results and will not be just a social
function.</P>
      <P>President Chen, a DPP stalwart, won only 39.3 percent of the vote
in the March 18 presidential election, and his party controls
barely one-third of seats in the legislature. In contrast, the
island's long-ruling Kuomintang still controls a majority in the
parliament after losing the presidency.</P>
      <P>President Chen has rejected opposition calls for a coalition
government and formed what he calls "a government of all people,"
naming Tang Fei, a stalwart of the rival KMT, as premier. But
KMT legislators have refused to go along and have blocked the
Cabinet's policies at every turn.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, DPP sources said, President Chen has
arranged the dinner as part of his efforts to improve communication
and coordination among the Presidential Office, the Cabinet and the
Legislative Yuan in order to ensure smooth operation of his
administration.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN CALLS FOR PLANNING NEW-GENERATION OF WARPLANES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,    Aug.    3    (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on
Thursday directed the Republic of China's Air Force to draw up a
forward-looking blueprint for developing a new generation of
warplanes to ensure supremacy in the sky over the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>President Chen gave the directive during an inspection
tour of the Air Force General Headquarters (AFGH) in Taipei
in his capacity as the ROC military's supreme leader.</P>
      <P>Noting that air defense plays a crucial role in the ROC's overall
defense system, Chen said he is pleased to see the commissioning of
the country's second-generation warplanes to help safeguard national
security.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen said, mainland Chinese air force's combat
capability is expected to be greatly beefed up after 2005 with the
maturity of its airborne early-warning system, airborne fueling
and electronic warfare technology and automatic command system as
well as mass production of its new warplanes. "The advancement
in mainland China's air combat capability will certainly affect
military balance across the Taiwan Strait," the president noted.</P>
      <P>In the face of this challenge, Chen said the ROC air force should
draft a plan for development or acquisition of a new generation of
warplanes for use in the 2010s and even in the 2020s.</P>
      <P>Chen said the air force should also continue upgrading the
new-generation warplanes' air-to-surface and air-to-sea assault
and reconnaissance capabilities to maintain its air supremacy and
ensure air defense security.</P>
      <P>The ROC began to prepare for replacing its aging air fleet with
second-generation warplanes in the 1980s. In addition to developing
IDFs (indigenous defense fighters) on its own, the air force has
also managed to purchase 150 F-16 advanced jet fighters from the
United States and 60 French-made Mirage 2000-5 jet fighters. The
three types of high-performance fighter planes and several other
sophisticated reconnaissance and early-warning aircraft now form the
backbone of the air force arsenal.</P>
      <P>In his speech to AFGH staff, Chen further said mainland
China's refusal to renounce the use of force against Taiwan is the
greatest threat to the ROC's security.</P>
      <P>Noting that the development of cross-strait relations will not
only affect the well-being of the people on both sides but will also
have a significant impact on peace and stability in the entire
Asia-Pacific region, Chen said he has repeatedly held out olive
branches to Beijing and called for resumption of dialogue and
consultations to ease animosity and resolve disputes.</P>
      <P>In view of the prevailing world trends, Chen said the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait can no longer afford to waste energy, wisdom and
limited resources on mutual suspicion, squabbling and confrontation.</P>
      <P>In preparation for negotiation with mainland China, Chen said,
the ROC must simultaneously strengthen its military muscle to
guarantee its national security. "Only when our national security
faces no threat can we develop constructive interaction with the
mainland," he explained.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Chen encouraged all air force staff to develop a
healthy internal operation, management, control and supervisory
system to ensure efficiency and high-performance of all weaponry
systems.</P>
      <P>The air force must also cooperate with other military branches
to perfect its combined service combat capability because amphibious
and three-dimensional warfare have become the mainstay of modern
war, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He also encouraged the air force to devote more energy to
research and development and overcome all obstacles and difficulties
in training exercises in order to maintain air supremacy and upgrade
overall defense capabilities.</P>
      <P>Chen further said he felt very regret that the recent Pachang
Creek rescue fiasco has tarnished the Air Force's Seagull Rescue
Team's reputation and even the military's overall image.</P>
      <P>Chen attributed the tragedy, which claimed four lives and led to
the resignation of vice premier and several other senior officials,
mainly to the outdated rigid emergency rescue system and
"bureaucratic thinking and mentality" on the part of relevant
personnel.</P>
      <P>"The government has taken mend-fencing steps to improve our
emergency rescue system and I hope similar tragedy will never
recur," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president also stressed the importance of flight safety in
his speech, urging all air force staff, including maintenance
personnel, to make every effort to prevent any flight mishaps.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The American Conservative Union (ACU) on
Wednesday applauded the strong language in the Republican party's
platform passed by the Republican National Convention on Monday
regarding the United States' ongoing relationship with the government
and people of the Republic of China on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The American Conservative Union worked very hard to make certain
that the position of the Republican Party towards our friends in
Taiwan is very clear," said Patricia Fava, ACU Legislative director.</P>
      <P>She emphasized that "to state in no uncertain terms that `America
will help Taiwan defend itself' is a clear message that the
Republican Party and Governor George W. Bush understand the
importance of maintaining a strong relationship with Taiwan and
ensuring that the freedom loving people of Taiwan continue to prosper
in a democratic society."</P>
      <P>Additionally, Fava noted, the Republican Party Platform states
that the United States recognizes the growing importance of the
Republic of China on Taiwan in the global economy and that "we
support their accession to the World Trade Organization and other
multilateral institutions."</P>
      <P>"The people of Taiwan deserve the support and assistance of the
United States whenever and wherever possible. The democratically
elected government and the people are a beacon of freedom in an area
of the world where threats to their national security are part of
daily life," she said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW TEST FOR BANNED EPO SEEN MAKING SYDNEY OLYMPICS CLEANER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  3  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian Olympic Committee (AOC)
stated that it believes the new test for the presence of
erythropoietin (EPO) in athletes, approved by the International
Olympic Committee (IOC) on Tuesday, will help weed out users of
performance-enhancing drugs and make the 2000 Olympic Games a cleaner
sports event.</P>
      <P>"To have a valid test now will cause a number of drug cheats to
have second thoughts," AOC Secretary-General Graig McLatchey told
reporters on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Brian Doyle, president of the Australian and New Zealand Sports
Law Association, said that "who knows, we might even see a spate of
injuries," implying that some athletes may withdraw from competition
feigning injury rather than risk facing an EPO test.</P>
      <P>Organizers said at least 3,000 out of the more than 10,000
athletes participating in the Olympic Games will face EPO testing
before and during the event, which gets under way in mid-September.</P>
      <P>Nicki Vance, doping control manager for the Sydney Organizing
Committee for the Olympic Games, said that testing equipment has
already been purchased and that a clinic in Homebush, one of the
Olympic venues, has been modified for blood collection.</P>
      <P>Sporting authorities said they believe EPO, which can increase an
athletes performance by up to 15 percent, is being widely used by
athletes, particularly in speed sports.</P>
      <P>Athletes most likely to benefit from the use of EPO are those who
experience a high oxygen uptake during competition, such as middle
and long distance runners, swimmers, cyclists, and rowers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN URGES CSF STAFF TO RESIST TEMPTATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Thursday urged
all Combined Service Force (CSF) staff to resist temptation, maintain
integrity and serve as a model for the new government's campaign for
establishing clean politics.</P>
      <P>Chen made the appeal during an inspection tour of the CSF
General Headquarters in his capacity as the supreme leader of the
Republic of China's armed forces.</P>
      <P>Chen said CSF staff have many opportunities to deal with the
business and industry community for various military procurement and
construction projects.</P>
      <P>In the highly competitive business world, Chen said, it is
understandable that businessmen and construction contractors will
offer various forms of benefits to temp CSF officers for securing
procurement or construction contracts.</P>
      <P>"I hope all relevant CSF staff members can strictly abide by the
existing laws and regulations in handling those projects," Chen
said, adding that all CSF personnel should resist temptation to avoid
offending laws and official ethics and help eradicate corruption and
establish clean politics.</P>
      <P>Chen's advice was seen very significant as some CSF officers were
convicted of corruption and kickback scandals in handling military
construction and procurement projects in the past. His "resist
temptation" call also coincided with Chen's order for the
ormation of a special task force to probe the 1993 murder of
Navy arms acquisition officer Yin Ching-feng. The high-profile
murder case was suspected of links to several naval arsenal
procurement scandals.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Chen further said the CSF headquarters will form
the mainstay of the future military supply system to be formed under
the newly passed National Defense Law and the Organizational Law of
the MInistry of National Defense.</P>
      <P>"And the new military supply system will also become one of the
most important parts of our overall national resources application
and military production systems," Chen explained, adding that he
hopes all CSF staff members can work hard to establish an efficient,
high-quality and self-sufficient logistic mechanism.</P>
      <P>Chen also encourged the CSF headquarters to pool all military
and civilian resources to help upgrade Taiwan's defense technology
and industry and cultivate more technological manpower.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the president stressed importance of adopting an
active approach to improve logistic support and services to officers
and men in other military branches. He further said the CSF
headquarters should take precautionary measures to avoid
environmental pollution and ensure public and workplace security.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Chen also made a similar inspection tour of
the Air Force General Headquarters (AFGH) and lunched together
with all AFGH staff.</P>
      <P>Since taking office on May 20, Chen had presided over several
major military commissioning ceremonies and a joint cadets exercise
as well as visited some military units. He will also supervise a
massive annual combined services training drill, code-named Han Kuang
No. 16 Exercise, after ending his Aug. 13-25 overseas visit, which
will take him to six of the ROC's diplomatic allies in Central
America, the Caribbean and Africa.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT 3RD MOST INFLUENTIAL MAN IN GREATER CHINA: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
is the third most influential figure in the Greater China area
comprising Taiwan, mainland China and Hong Kong, according to the
results of a recent survey released on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin tops the list of the 50
most influential people in the three Chinese societies rated in the
survey.</P>
      <P>Jiang is immediately followed by mainland Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji, according to the "Power 50" survey, conducted jointly by
Taiwan's "The Journalist" weekly paper, the Hong Kong-based Ming Pao
daily and the New City radio station.</P>
      <P>A panel of 90 judges from mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong
were invited to select the 50 most influential or powerful people
from a list of 150 candidates chosen from political, business,
religious, media and pop culture circles in the three societies.</P>
      <P>A total of 18 Taiwan celebrities make the "Power 50" list along
with Chen, two of whom rank among the top 10 most influential --
former President Lee Teng-hui, in seventh place and Academia Sinica
President Lee Yuan-tseh, also a Nobel laureate, in 10th.</P>
      <P>The survey found that entrepreneurs play a very important role in
capitalist Hong Kong and Taiwan, with business magnates accounting
for more than a quarter of the listed figures.</P>
      <P>Noted Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing trails the ROC president as
the fourth most influential figure in the three Chinese communities,
ahead of even Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hua, who only made
ninth.</P>
      <P>Taiwan business barons on the "Power 50" list include Formosa
Plastics Group Chairman Wang Yung-ching (12th); Koo's Group Chairman
Koo Chen-fu (17th), who is also Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland
China; Evergreen Group Chairman Chang Jung-fa (33rd); Acer Group
Chairman Stan Shih (35th); and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Corp. Chairman Morris Chang (42nd).</P>
      <P>The heads of Taiwan's three major political parties all make the
list -- opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong (11th);
ruling Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Frank Hsieh, also mayor
of Kaohsiung (20th); and opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, a
former vice president (21st).</P>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei, a four-star general-turned-politician, ranks
27th, while Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou is rated the 13th most
influential.</P>
      <P>The key figures in charge of cross-Taiwan Strait relations all
rank among the top 50 influential people, indicating that
cross-strait relations are an issue of "great concern" in the three
areas. Wang Daohan, mainland China's No. 1 negotiator with Taiwan
ranks 8th, even though his ranking in Beijing's official hierarchy is
not high.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs
Council which charts Taiwan's policy toward the mainland, ranks 44th.
Apart from Premier Tang Fei, she is the only Taiwan Cabinet member to
make the list.</P>
      <P>Although women account for 50 percent of the total population of
Greater China, they make up only 10 percent of the most influential
people.</P>
      <P>The respected Buddhist Master Cheng Yen is the highest-ranking
influential woman, placing at 18th, while Annette Lu, the ROC's first
female vice president, ranks 24th. This indicates that female
influence in Chinese society remains weak.</P>
      <P>Another interesting finding is that "gun barrels" have greater
influence than "men of letters," with senior mainland Chinese
military officials ranking far ahead of media executives in Hong Kong
and Taiwan.</P>

Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC) Co.</P>
      <P>Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, and India take the top four spots in
the PERC evaluation report, while Taiwan is followed by Malaysia,
South Korea, mainland China and Indonesia, in that order.</P>
      <P>The PERC survey was conducted in the performance fields of
banking systems, central bank and financial management, stock
transaction regulations, and parliamentary and judiciary
institutions. Zero was the best possible score on the 10-grade
scaling system, while ten was the lowest rating.</P>
      <P>Taiwan garnered 5.05 points for its banking system, 5.01 points
for the performance of its central bank and financial management;
5.09 points for stock transaction regulations, six points for the
performance of its legislative sector; and five points in the
category of social order and the judiciary.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Taiwan and South Korea have transformed
from authoritarian regimes into democratic institutions. At the same
time, mainland China has also achieved noticeable progress over the
past ten years in group management initiated by former mainland
Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.</P>
      <P>Although Singapore has been criticized for being too centralized,
the report also points out that the country's stable institutional
system, led by a group of elite rather than just one strong-man, has
ensured its continued development, and enjoys high marks among
foreigners working here.</P>

      <P>A military spokesman said on Thursday that
Taiwan is closely watching the "routine" maritime exercises currently
being conducted by mainland China's coastal troops.</P>
      <P>Maj. Gen. Kung Fan-ding said that the Republic of China's
Ministry of National Defense (MND) is "closely monitoring" the
troops' every movement, and he urged the public to rest at ease.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's official Xinhua News Agency reported on
Wednesday that the Nanjing Military Region is currently conducting
its largest maritime exercises in recent years on the Yellow and East
China Seas.</P>
      <P>Xinhua reported that as many as 110,000 soldiers are involved in
the exercises.</P>
      <P>Kung said that the mainland's littoral forces conduct training
exercises at sea every year from June to August, and that the drills
include maritime first-aid, barehanded swimming, long distance
swimming, and full-gear swimming.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the MND's Office of the Deputy Chief of the
General Staff for Operations said that no "unusual circumstances" are
behind the exercises, which he said are simply "swimming drills"
planned to coincide with the seasons.</P>
      <P>He added that the exercises are already being closely monitored,
and that Beijing clearly meant to play up its "verbal attacks and
saber rattling" again by announcing the news through Xinhua. He urged
the public not to be influenced by the intimidation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI, BEIJING SHOULD BUILD UP 'MEANINGFUL POLITICAL TIES': MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait
should sit down to talk and forge a "meaningful political
relationship," the Republic of China's top mainland policy planner
said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council, which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China, made
the remarks at a parliamentary aides training camp.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the new ROC government is endeavoring to seek "common
grounds" with mainland China in order to achieve a breakthrough to
the long-stalled cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Tsai said if Beijing thinks the 1992 cross-strait consultations
were meaningful to both sides, the ROC government is willing to
carefully review the meeting results in a positive direction and
manner,</P>
      <P>Basically, Tsai said, the ROC thinks that the true spirit
reflected in the 1992 consultations was "exchange, dialogue and
shelving disputes."</P>
      <P>Tsai said so long as the two sides can shelve disputes over the
definition of "one China" and successfully conduct dialogue and
exchanges, then the "objective environment" can gradually change.</P>
      <P>"Should that be the case, it will become relatively easier to
resolve the thorny 'one China' issue," Tsai noted.</P>
      <P>The international trade law expert-turned-official pointed out
that such terms as Taiwan independence, unification, or maintaining
the status quo are too vague to define.</P>
      <P>To her, Tsai said, the people of Taiwan have only one choice in
the future. "That is to develop a meaningful political relationship
with mainland China," she explained, adding that from the viewpoints
of culture, history, geography and race, no human force can cut
cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>The sophisticated policy planner further said people on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait should avoid simplifying or narrowing
the "one China" concept.</P>
      <P>Tsai said "one China" can be a system under which the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait co-exist peacefully and prosperously over the
next five or 10 years.</P>
      <P>"So long as both sides have confidence and mutual trust, there
can be infinite room and flexibility for the development cross-strait
relations," Tsai noted.</P>
      <P>She rejected opposition criticism that the new government's
mainland policy is in disarray or like "a car parked in neutral."</P>
      <P>Noting that cross-strait relations are currently in a "relatively
stable" condition, Tsai said if cross-strait ties move at a
"first-gear" speed during the Kuomintang era, the new government
will move at a faster "second-gear" speed in promoting cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the new government is accelerating review of various
existing regulations or measures concerning cross-strait relations
and is also studying various possibilities for future development.
"Some new measures or policies are taking shape," she added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman
Koo Chen-fu said on Thursday that he hopes to meet his mainland
Chinese counterpart soon and seize the opportunity to forge normal
relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>As a meeting with Chairman Wang Daohan of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) is of key
importance in promoting bilateral exchanges, Koo said he wishes to
meet Wang as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Saying that "the factor preventing Wang from visiting Taiwan no
longer exits," Koo called on the ARATS chairman to make the trip as
soon as possible. "I sincerely wish to meet Mr. Wang in Taiwan, the
sooner the better. Taiwan has never halted its preparations for his
visit here," he added.</P>
      <P>Koo further pointed out that Taiwan and mainland China should
first hold a preparatory meeting prior to the much-anticipated
second Koo-Wang meeting, and that the SEF has decided to first
invite vice-secretary-level ARATS officials to visit Taiwan for that
purpose.</P>
      <P>The SEF chairman, Taiwan's No. 1 negotiator with mainland China,
contended that "there is still a chance that Wang will visit Taiwan,"
since "we will not mention again the `two-states' theory."</P>
      <P>He was referring to the "special state-to-state relationship"
theory aired by former President Lee Teng-hui in July 1999 to
describe Taiwan-mainland ties that angered Beijing and stalled Wang's
planned trip to Taiwan, originally scheduled for September of the
same year.</P>
      <P>Stressing that it requires efforts from both sides to create a
favorable climate for the resumption of bilateral talks, Koo said the
current administration of President Chen Shui-bian has displayed a
high degree of goodwill and that it is willing to discuss cooperation
with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Koo made the remarks while answering questions from reporters
following a meeting on a reshuffle of the SEF board and supervisory
members.</P>
      <P>Addressing the meeting, the SEF head detailed how Taiwan and
mainland China reached the so-called "1992 consensus," and emphasized
that the spirit of the consensus is to "communicate, talk, and put
aside disputes."</P>
      <P>Based on that spirit, the two sides were able to hold the
landmark 1993 Koo-Wang meeting in Singapore -- the first of its kind
in cross-strait contacts in 50 years -- which clinched four
agreements, he noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a mainland Chinese source close to ARATS told CNA that
Wang has not given up on his plan to visit Taiwan, but added that a
positive climate and sound foundation are necessary before such a
trip can take place.</P>
      <P>According to the source, the precondition for Wang's Taiwan trip
is that "Taiwan must recognize the `one China' principle," which is
Beijing's foundation for the resumption of bilateral dialogue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROSECUTOR THREATENS TO SEARCH MILITARY HEADQUARTERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 3 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A prosecutor assigned to probe the death of
a navy captain and alleged irregularities in the navy's arms
purchases threatened on Thursday to search military agencies if they
kept resisting producing documents needed for his investigation.</P>
      <P>Hung Wei-hua, a prosecutor of the Prosecutor's Office under the
Taiwan High Court, warned the military authorities: "Don't try to
trifle with, resist, or block the investigation, let along conceal
any leads."</P>
      <P>He issued the ultimatum after six agents dispatched by his office
to the military authorities to collect documents in connection with
the case were given only two small cases of paperwork.</P>
      <P>The prosecutor said he reissued an urgent memorandum on Thursday
to the Navy General Headquarters, The Military Legal Bureau under the
Ministry of National Defense (MND), the General Political Warfare
Department under the MND, The Corps of Anti-intelligence under the
MND, and the Headquarters of Taipei Military Police, asking them to
hand over all related documents to his office within a week.</P>
      <P>If the documents passed over to him are insufficient to piece
together the whole case, Hung said he will consider exercising his
legal investigation power "in due course of law," which would mean a
search of related military agencies.</P>
      <P>Later on Thursday, Vice Chief-of-General-Staff Gen. Wang Han-ning,
who was named as the investigation team's contact at the General
Staff headquarters, called on State Public Prosecutor-General Lu
Ran-fa, who is Hung's supervisor and the head of the special panel
charged to look into the case.</P>
      <P>Wang would not comment on Hung's warning after the meeting,
saying only that he would "try to understand" Hung's complains.</P>
      <P>Hung was assigned by Lu to investigate the death in 1993 of
navy Capt. Yin Ching-feng, who at the time was the executive director
of the navy's weaponry acquirement program.</P>
      <P>Yin's body was found floating in Suao Harbor in northern Taiwan
on Dec. 9, 1993 several days after he had been collecting evidence
about alleged irregularities concerning the navy's procurement of
four German-made minesweepers and six French-made frigates.</P>
      <P>The investigation into his death has bogged down over the past
six years since several arms brokers competing for contracts to
provide the navy with the warships fled the island shortly after
Yin's death.</P>
      <P>Recent reports from Paris that huge kickbacks were paid to Taiwan
officials for the deal of six frigates fueled speculation that Yin's
death was just the tip of an iceberg, and that there was a ploy to
cover up massive corruption involving senior military officers and
government officials.</P>
      <P>The investigation of Yin's death got a shot in the arm after
President Chen Shui-bian on July 30 ordered the establishment of an
ad hoc panel, with Lu Ren-fa as its head, to look into the case.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Rear Adm. Liu Chin-an, director of the Military Legal
Bureau under the MND, quit the panel on Thursday after he was accused
by Yin's widow and Legislator Lee Ching-hua of trying to cover up the
alleged plot behind Yin's death while probing the case as head of the
navy's legal department in 1993.</P>
      <P>Given Liu's involvement in the previous botched investigation,
Lee said his participation in the new panel would only undermine its
credibility.</P>
      <P>After consulting with Minister of National Defense Wu Shih-wen,
Liu said he decided to withdraw from the panel and have an acting
deputy director of the MND Military Legal Bureau, Maj. Gen. Hsu
Ho-ping, take his place.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman
Tsai Ing-wen said on Thursday that far from considering the lifting
of a ban on capital from mainland China, the government has not even
assessed the impact of such capital inflow.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with a group of lawmakers' aides, Tsai said
that once Taiwan is admitted to the World Trade Organizaiton,
it will be obliged to open its service market to foreign service
providers, which will inevitably bring in outside capital.</P>
      <P>However, she went on, capital inflow from Beijing would not be
ordinary capital movement on markets seeking profits, but capital
used for non-commercial purposes and therefore requiring special
control, which the government has not considered.</P>

(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
told visiting foreign ministers of the ROC's four Caribbean allies on
Thursday that there will be "continuity and stability" in Taiwan's
foreign policy under his government.</P>
      <P>Chen added that Taiwan will further strengthen its substantive
relations with the Commonwealth of Dominica, Grenada, Saint
Christopher and Nevis, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, by
continuing bilateral cooperative exchanges in agriculture, trade,
news, and culture.</P>
      <P>He also thanked the ministers for their countries' long-term
support of the ROC in the international arena and for coming to
Taiwan to attend the fourth meeting between the ROC foreign minister
and his Caribbean counterparts, to be held in Taipei on Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen asked for their understanding for his being unable to visit
their countries during his upcoming trip to Central America, South
America, and Africa due to his tight schedule, but he expressed hope
that he will meet the leaders of the Caribbean nations at the
inauguration ceremonies for the Dominican Republic president during
his trip.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, ROC foreign minister Tien Hung-mao said after
meeting with the Caribbean visitors that while Taiwan provides
assistance to its allies, he hopes the allies will be able to assist
the ROC in carving out more space in the international community and
give Taiwan a hand when it seeks to join in various international
organizations.</P>
      <P>He added that mainland China's continued attempts to woo away ROC
allies is old news, and that the meeting of the foreign ministers
will strengthen mutual cultural exchanges and private visits among
government officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, VIETNAM AGREE TO INCREASE TWO-WAY PASSENGER TRAFFIC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  4  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Airline representatives from Taiwan and
Vietnam have agreed to increase the number of seats available for
flights between the two countries in order to meet soaring demand,
sources from the Taipei Association of Air Transportation Business
said on Friday.</P>
      <P>After a day of discussions on Thursday, airline carrier
representatives from Taiwan and Vietnam agreed to increase their
passenger load factor, or percentage of seats filled, by 50 percent
in the years to come beginning from this year.</P>
      <P>It was agreed that beginning this winter, 800 seats will be added
to the weekly Taiwan-Vietnam flights and return flights, with another
1,200 seats to be added by the winter of 2001. This is expected to
largely accommodate consumer demand, said the sources.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of discussions on Thursday, Taiwan negotiators
asked for an increase of 1,200 seats per week for this winter, while
their Vietnamese counterparts agreed to only a 600-seat increase.
Later in the day, they compromised and settled on an increase of 800
seats for this year. The two sides are expected to sign a formal
agreement on Friday.</P>
      <P>Currently, under the 1993 air pact signed between the two sides'
airline associations, Taiwan's China Airlines and EVA Airway together
operate 3,759 seats per week, while Vietnam Airlines and Vietnamese
Pacific Airlines offer 3,856 seats.</P>
      <P>These numbers could hardly meet the soaring demand, particularly
after Taiwan suspended direct air links with Manila and stopped
accepting more Philippine laborers in recent months, said the
sources.</P>
      <P>The number of Vietnamese laborers being introduced to Taiwan has
increased by leaps and bounds in recent months, making it one of the
reasons for the shortage of airplane seats for flights between
Vietnam and Taiwan, the sources added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The US Department of State said on
Thursday it is closely monitoring mainland China's current military
exercises along the southeastern mainland coast opposite Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the State Department said it has so far not seen
any indicators that raise its level of concern.</P>
      <P>According to mainland China's state media, the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) is conducting war games involving 110,000
troops along a wide arc of the eastern mainland coast opposite
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Beijing-based People's Daily said combined land, air and sea
forces of the Nanjing military district were holding drills along a
6,000 km (3,700 mile) length of the east coast provinces of Jiangsu,
Zhejiang and Fujian.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Communist Party paper quoted a military spokesman as
saying such exercises were "rarely seen in recent years in terms of
scope, number of participating troops and thoroughness."</P>
      <P>Maritime, amphibious and land drills involving submarines,
frogmen, gunboats, paratroopers and attack helicopters were
"necessary to prevail in future local wars under high-technology
conditions," the PLA spokesman was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, a State Department official who asked
not to be identified said, "as with all such exercises we are alert
for any indicators that warrant concern. So far we have seen no

actions which might increase tensions in the (Taiwan) strait," the

    <DATELINE>Philadelphia,  Aug.  3  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior advisor to George W. Bush,
the Republican Party's presidential candidate, indicated on Thursday
that a new Bush administration would firmly oppose any use of
military force in the Taiwan Strait while adhering to the one-China
policy.</P>
      <P>"The United States has and continues to have a one-China policy,"
said Robert Zoellick, a former White House deputy chief of staff
during the Bush administration and now a senior advisor on foreign
policy to the Texas governor.</P>
      <P>"What that platform emphasizes is the view that it's important to
make it clear to Beijing that any use of force would be
counter-productive in its relations with Taiwan and also its
relations with the United States," he said.</P>
      <P>He was referring to the language pertaining to cross-strait
issues in the Republican Party's platform adopted this week at the
party's national convention in Philadelphia.</P>
      <P>As Bush has frequently stated, Zoellick told reporters, he is
"resolutely committed to the Taiwan Relations Act, including helping
Taiwan defend itself."</P>
      <P>Zoellick said that while holding to the one-China policy, there
needs to be a recognition by both Beijing and Taipei that it is in
their interest to achieve a peaceful accommodation.</P>
      <P>However, he would not say whether an administration under Bush
would change its one-China position if mainland China attacks Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Republican Party platform says that the United States "has
acknowledged the view that there is one China". But it also says that
"our policy is based on the principle that there must be no use of
force by China against Taiwan".</P>

    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Aug.  3  (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The sun's brightness has been increasing
steadily for the past 3 years, but that's no reason for alarm because
the change has been expected and astronomers predict that the sun's
radiation levels will start reducing again after peaking this year.</P>
      <P>On Aug. 7, at the invitation of the International Astronomical
Union, Dr. Judith Lean of the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington
DC will explain how high precision instruments on board spacecraft
have been monitoring the sun for the slightest changes since 1984.</P>
      <P>Astronomers at ground-based observatories have studied the sun's
activity for the past 400 years by counting the number of dark
sunspots on its disk. Their records reveal a repeating cycle in which
the number of sunspots hits a maximum approximately every 11 years.</P>
      <P>Sunspots are dark and so reduce the sun's total radiation. But
another manifestation of solar activity, called faculae, is bright
and enhances the sun's output. Typically, the increase due to faculae
more than outweighs the decrease due to sunspots. Astronomers can
calculate the net effect of these two competing influences.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, the sun's activity and brightness has increased
steadily. Now, near the predicted time of maximum radiation, levels
are 0.06% higher than in 1996.</P>

from the ASEAN plus 3 grouping because of what he called "the
preference of some participants to restrict membership" -- a
criticism mainly of Malaysia's persistent rejection of Australian
efforts to join the regional body.</P>
      <P>ASEAN plus 3 was formed in Kuala Lumpur in 1997, and Malaysia's
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was the key factor behind the
exclusion of Australia. He also blocked Australia from taking part in
ASEM -- the Asia-Europe meeting.</P>
      <P>Calvert stressed that Australia has the right to take part in
ASEAN plus 3 because of its credentials, including its contributions
and intellectual input into regional bodies such as APEC, the ASEAN
Post Ministerial Council, and other regional bodies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SPECIALISTS CRITCIZE NUCLEAR POWER, RECOMMEND LNG AND WIND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   4  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A US-based energy systems research
specialist on Friday discounted Taiwan Power Company's statements
that the replacement of nuclear power would be too costly, saying
that Taiwan should end its reliance on this form of energy once and
for all.</P>
      <P>Dr. Chen Mo-shing, director of the Energy Systems Research Center
at the University of Texas at Arlington, said the development of
nuclear power worldwide seems to approach a dead end, adding that if
nuclear power is indeed irreplaceable as some claim, then "the world
is doomed."</P>
      <P>Chen, a member of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant Reassessment
Committee sponsored by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, made the
remarks during a hearing at the Legislative Yuan into possible
alternatives to completion of the fourth nuclear power plant by
Taipower.</P>
      <P>Chen refuted Taipower's statement that the cost of generating
electricity at its nuclear power plants averages NT$0.85 per
kilowatt-hour, compared with NT$0.89 per kwh at coal-powered thermal
plants, saying this claim is "definitely impossible."</P>
      <P>He added that Taipower officials had "righteously lied" by
compiling and publicizing calculations that seem to justify the use
of nuclear power.</P>
      <P>Chen, who also teaches at National Taiwan University, strongly
recommended that Taipower retain most of its existing facilities at
its three nuclear power plants and remodel them into thermal power
plants using liquefied natural gas (LNG) as fuel to generate
electricity.</P>
      <P>Chen said in the present situation, based on Taipower's
calculations, where 45.1 percent of Taipower's installed capacity is
provided by coal-powered thermal plants, 23.3 percent by nuclear
power plants, and 18.8 percent by thermal plants using LNG, it is
impossible for Taipower to maintain a clean environment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Lai Ching-lin
recommended that Taipower use wind as an alternative method of
generating electricity. As an island nation where wind is readily
available and costs nothing, Taiwan should abandon nuclear power and
use alternative energy sources that don't destroy the island's
environment and threaten the lives of the people.</P>
      <P>Lai added that Taipower actually already operates four
wind-powered generators on Penghu Island, and Taiwan's plastics giant
Formosa Plastic Group also has four similar generators to supply
electricity for the company's own use.</P>
      <P>Wang Ching-chuan, vice president of Chunghsing Electrical
Engineering and Machinery Corp., who was also present at the hearing,
said solar power should also be used for generating electricity,
pointing out that Taipower has already begun to cooperate with
privately-run companies to develop related facilities.</P>

    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Aug. 3 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lien Chan, chairman of the Republic
of China's opposition party Kuomingtang, arrived in San Francisco on
Thursday for the start of a 14-day North American visit.</P>
      <P>Lien and his wife, accompanied by Jason Hu, director of the KMT
Department of Cultural Affairs, were greeted warmly by about 200
overseas Chinese and KMT members upon their arrival.</P>
      <P>Also on hand to greet the Liens were Ting Shou-chung, a KMT
Central Standing Committee member and currently a visiting scholar at
Stanford University; Wang Neng-chang, director of the KMT Department
of Overseas Affairs; Chiao Jen-ho, former Minister of the Overseas
Chinese Affairs Committee; and Victor Tseng, director of the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Office in San Francisco.</P>
      <P>Lien did not answer any questions by reporters, but he did tell
supporters briefly that he was heartened by the warm welcome on his
first trip to the United States since stepping down from public
office in May.</P>
      <P>The former vice president said that although the KMT, which gave
up power to the Democratic Progressive Party after the March 18
presidential election, has encountered great difficulties, it has not
lost its ideals and will not shy away from its responsibilities.</P>
      <P>US customs accorded the Liens preferential treatment despite the
fact that Lien no longer holds public office.</P>
      <P>Lien made several transit stops in the US when he was the ROC
vice president, and the US always issued him a visa on an individual
basis and accorded him preferential treatment.</P>
      <P>The US State Department said that Lien's visa this time was
issued on an individual basis, but his movements while in the country
will not be subject to restrictions because he is no longer a public
official.</P>
      <P>It is understood that Lien, who wants to establish a good pattern
for future visits, is keeping a low-profile and not engaging in any
political activities during his trip.</P>
      <P>After a four-day stay in San Francisco, Lien will head for Los
Angeles where he will visit his son, who is currently studying at
Stanford University. On Aug. 9, he will leave for Vancouver, Canada
before returning to Taiwan on Aug. 16.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC ARMY AGREES TO PARTIAL DEMINING OF KINMEN COAST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,   Aug.  4  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Army General
Headquarters on Friday gave a green light to allow the removal of
some of the landmines scattered around a power plant that became
operational on the frontline island of Kinmen late last year.</P>
      <P>Army Commander-in-Chief Gen. Chen Chen-hsiang, who was making an
inspection tour of Kinmen, instructed the Kinmen Defense Command to
approve the demining application submitted by the Taiwan Power
Company (Taipower).</P>
      <P>Chen said the army's approval for Taipower to cooperate with
private demining companies to remove the landmines from the coast of
Tahshan does not necessarily mean that landmines in other coastal
areas will be also be removed, as coastal landmines still have a
certain value to deter invasion, particularly at a time when
cross-Taiwan Strait tension remains high.</P>
      <P>Between late last year and June 2, more than 80 anti-personnel
and anti-tank landmines have been found exposed on the coastal area
outside Taipower's Tahshan plant, where water discharged from the
plant has continuously washed away beach sand and exposed the mines.</P>
      <P>According to the Kinmen Defense Command, the military authorities
have since 1997 contracted noted British demining firm -- Specialist
Gurkha Services UK Ltd. -- to clear eight abandoned minefilds in
Kinmen villages that now have large civilian populations.</P>
      <P>Gurkha Services is staffed mainly by retired Nepalese veterans
from Britain's famous Gurkha Regiment. The company has undertaken
demining jobs in more than 10 nations around the world, including
Afghanistan, Cambodia, Kuwait and Mozambique.</P>

      <P>The Medical Students' Association of the
Republic of China (MSA-ROC) is to defend its membership of the
International Federation of Medical Students' Associations (IFMSA),
MSA-ROC Chairman Wang Shi-hsiou said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The IFMSA has proposed a revision of its membership regulations
that would require member countries to be United Nations members,
which means that while mainland China could be admitted, the MSA-ROC
would perhaps have to change its name or the status of its
membership.</P>
      <P>Wang said he will leave for Portugal with 11 Taiwan medical
students to take part in an upcoming IFMSA conference, where they
will try to convince other member countries of the "unreasonableness"
of the proposed new membership requirement.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that ROC is not a member of the United Nations,
and added that mainland China could use its political clout to edge
out the MAS-ROC membership of IFMSA. The delegates are scheduled to
meet officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before they make
the trip to Portugal, to discuss an acceptable name should the
MAS-ROC be forced to change its name.</P>
      <P>The IFMSA was founded in 1951 and is officially recognized by the
United Nations as a non-political, non-government organization. Its
membership includes students from more than 50 countries all over the
world.</P>
      <P>Its purpose is to promote international cooperation in
professional training and the achievement of humanitarian ideals. It
provides medical students with a forum to address related concerns
and an opportunity to influence the practice and development of

    <HEADLINE>MAC APPROVES SEF PLAN TO INVITE MAINLAND NEGOTIATOR TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) said on Friday it has approved a Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) proposal to invite a senior mainland Chinese negotiator to
Taiwan to resume the long-stalled dialogue.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Teng Chen-chung was responding to SEF Chairman
Koo Chen-fu's statement on Thursday that SEF will send a letter to
mainland China in a few days inviting a deputy secretary-general of
the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS) to Taiwan to set the stage for mainland China's top
negotiator Wang Daohan to visit this island.</P>
      <P>Teng said the MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward the
mainland and oversees SEF operations, fully supports Koo's proposal.
"We hope mainland China can make a positive response to Koo's
invitation," he said, adding that the Republic of China is
willing to exercise the greatest possible flexibility on the agenda
so long as Beijing agrees to resume talks.</P>
      <P>Koo made a landmark visit to Shanghai and Beijing in October 1998
and his mainland counterpart Wang promised to make a reciprocal
visit to Taiwan in 1999. However, Beijing announced an indefinite
postponement of Wang's visit last September in retaliation for
then-ROC President Lee Teng-hui's remarks that cross-strait
exchanges should be conducted on a "special state-to-state" basis.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, Koo urged Wang to honor his promise to visit
Taiwan. "The spring has come and gone, and now there is a new autumn
at our doorstep," he noted, adding that SEF will invite an ARATS
deputy secretary-general to come over for some consultations about
resuming dialogue and paving the way for Wang's Taiwan tour.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies authorized
by their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in
the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Koo's remarks, Teng said the new ROC government has
never ceased expression of goodwill toward the mainland since its
inauguration on May 20.</P>
      <P>Teng said both Koo's invitation and President Chen Shui-bian's
recent mention of "the spirit of the 1992 meeting" were part of the
new ROC government's efforts to foster an atmosphere favorable for
resumption of institutionalized SEF-ARATS dialogue.</P>
      <P>In 1992, SEF and ARATS officials held talks on the "one China"
issue. Although the two sides failed to reach a unanimous conclusion,
they agreed that each side could have its own definition of the "one
China."</P>
      <P>"And this is what President Chen calls the 'spirit of 1992'
which means dialogue, exchange and shelving disputes," Teng
explained.</P>
      <P>According to Teng, SEF sent a message to ARATS late last month
calling for talks on repatriation of illegal mainland immigrants and
issues related to a detained mainland boat suspected of involvement
in espionage. However, Teng said, ARATS has so far not made any
response.</P>
      <P>Teng said if ARATS sends a deputy secretary-general to Taiwan,
the two sides can discuss a host of practical issues closely related
to interests and well-being of the people on both sides, including
fishing disputes, emergency rescue and repatriation of illegal
immigrants.</P>
      <P>The two sides can even discuss technical details regarding
proposed opening of direct "mini three links" (trade, mail
and transportation) between Taiwan's outlying islands and several
mainland Chinese southeastern port cities, such as Xiamen or Fuzhou,
Teng said.</P>
      <P>As for Wang's Taiwan travel promise, Teng said, the ROC has
consistently welcomed the top mainland envoy's visit. "We hope Wang
can visit Taiwan as early as possible," Teng said, adding that
resumption of cross-strait dialogue needs joint efforts of the two
sides and that the timing of Wang's visit will largely be
determined by Beijing.</P>
      <P>Touching on a newspaper report that mainland China plans to
promote cross-strait exchanges of resident journalists, Teng said
the ROC will not oppose including the issue into the agenda if SEF
and ARATS resume dialogue.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An adult crested goshawk,
which was found on the brink of death more than two months ago in the
central Taiwan town of Puli, was released to back into the wild on
Friday in perfect health.</P>
      <P>The crested goshawk, a medium-sized diurnal bird of prey, is a
sub-endemic species that enjoys special protection in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The bird, a female, was found in a forest camp site in
mountainous Puli and rushed to an endangered species research center
run by the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture in the town of
Chichi.</P>
      <P>Believing that the bird had been poisoned, veterinarians at the
center treated and cared for it for more than two months until it had
fully regained its health.</P>
      <P>According to the vets, despite weakness and hunger, the bird
refused to eat anything for the first few days, but gradually began
to accept baby food and canned dog and cat food.</P>
      <P>The 45-cm long raptor bearing dark brown plumage with striking
horizontal barring on its breast, was recently let out of its cage
and was found to have retained its ability to hunt its normal prey of
small birds and animals, said the vets.</P>
      <P>Crested goshawks are considered an indicator bird of Taiwan's
environment, as it is a species at the top of the island's food
chain, which makes it very vulnerable to environmental pollution and
harm, according to bird specialists.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  4 (CNA)
(By Flor  Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taipei citizen lodged a lawsuit with the
Taipei District Prosecutors' Office on Friday against three ranking
government officials for illegally holding dual nationality.</P>
      <P>Hsu Mu-min sued Foreign Affairs Minister Tien Hung-mao, Education
Minister J.L. Tzeng and Yang Huang Mei-hsin, vice chief of the
Research and Planning Board under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
for fraud and for breaking the Republic of China Nationality Law by
holding passports of both the ROC and the United States.</P>
      <P>Hsu said he decided to file the lawsuit against the three
officials, because he believes that the three still possess US
nationality, although according to local media reports, the three had
applied at the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) to renounce their
US nationality in mid-May and June.</P>
      <P>Hsu pointed out that under US federal law, naturalized US
nationals wishing to abandon their US nationality are required to
complete the process by taking an oath under the witness of a US
ambassador or consul.</P>
      <P>He went on to point out that the AIT, the US representative
office in Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic relations between the
two countries, is not a US embassy, nor are AIT officials formal US
diplomats.</P>
      <P>Claiming that AIT officials had responded to his inquiry by
confirming that their office does not have the authority to legalize
such an act, Hsu said he suspects the three lied about their status
in order to acquire the government posts. Should they have failed to
renounce their US nationality, they would have already violated the
ROC Nationality Law and committed fraud, he noted.</P>
      <P>Citing Article 20 of the ROC Nationality Law, Hsu said: "Those
ROC nationals who possess foreign nationality are not entitled to
take ROC public office ... and those who have already served in the
government should be stripped of their public office."</P>

million), the Council of Agriculture (COA) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>A southeasterly airstream passing that has affected the island
since July 27 has packed extremely high humidity and has triggered
heavy precipitation in various regions of eight counties in central
and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The heavy rains have sparked mudslides in mountainous areas and
flooded many hectares of farmland on the western plains.</P>
      <P>The COA estimated that vegetables and fruit in Kaohsiung, Tainan,
Pintung, Nantou, Yunlin, Chiayi and Taitung counties have suffered
combined damage of about NT$178 million.</P>
      <P>The extent of the damage has make farmers in the eight counties
eligible for soft loans from the government, allowing them to borrow
NT$250,000 (US$8,064) for every hectare of their farmland at an
interest rate of 4.5 percent over five years, said the COA.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT OUTLINES POLICY GOALS IN INTERVIEW WITH WEEKLY (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New   York,  Aug.  3  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian said in a recent interview with a US business weekly that
the people of Taiwan expect his administration to take them back
into the United Nations.</P>
      <P>"Naturally, we face some difficulties, but we must not give up
(our UN bid). At the same time, we must try to participate in other
international organizations," Chen said in an interview with
Business Week Asia Regional Editor Mark L. Clifford.</P>
      <P>Chen gave the interview at his Taipei office on July 27 and
edited extracts were carried in the Aug. 14 issue of the weekly. In
the interview, Chen indicated his eagerness to talk with Beijing and
promote peace in the Taiwan Strait. He also presented his views on
Taiwan's diplomatic and security issues.</P>
      <P>The longtime opposition politician-turned-president made it
clear that despite Beijing's opposition and boycott, he will
continue the former ROC government's policies of visiting friendly
foreign countries, seeking Taiwan's representation in the UN and
other international bodies and supporting continued research into
the US-developed theater missile defense (TMD) system.</P>
      <P>Asked what he hopes to accomplish during his term in office,
Chen said promoting peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is
not only his top priority but also "a moral obligation."</P>
      <P>"Next, we need to clean up Taiwan politics," Chen said, adding
that he will work hard to terminate "black gold," or corruption and
gangster involvement in politics.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said his administration must ensure economic
prosperity and progress. "We will work to create an improved climate
for investment and business," he added.</P>
      <P>Touching on his campaign promise to "expand Taiwan's room
for survival in the international arena," Chen recalled that in his
inaugural speech, he said Taiwan stands up.</P>
      <P>"That means I must also go out into the world as the leader of a
sovereign and independent country...We hope to enhance the
substantial relationship between Taiwan and our diplomatic friends,"
Chen explained.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he is concerned that Beijing will be enraged by
his upcoming state visits abroad, Chen said: "I believe that as
President of a sovereign state, going abroad and exchanging meetings
with our diplomatic friends is my duty."</P>
      <P>Turning to the US role in the Taiwan Strait region, Chen said he
is convinced that permanent peace, security and stability in the
area are not only in the interests of Taiwan but also in the
interests of the United States.</P>
      <P>"I believe we can cooperate on this. I think the US can play a
more active role -- a balancer and stabilizer," Chen noted.</P>
      <P>He went on to point out that the issue of TMD exists because of
mainland China's deployment of missiles along its southeastern coast
opposite Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"This has been a threat to the peace and stability of the
Asia-Pacific region. This is why the US is considering the
development of TMD," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that TMD is not yet fully developed, Chen said it is too
early whether Taiwan would invest in this project. But he added that
the ROC government is seriously studying this policy.</P>
      <P>Chen further said the ROC government is fully aware that "TMD is
not absolute" in terms of resolving cross-Taiwan Strait problems.
"We must use creativity and wisdom to improve cross-Strait
relations."</P>
      <P>As for the current state of cross-strait ties, Chen said
although there are no significant breakthroughs, the situation has
not worsened.</P>
      <P>"In terms of cross-Strait relations, it is not seen as tense
right now. There is not a sense of urgency or of crisis... We hope
to sit down and resume negotiations. We can only do that by offering
goodwill and through the wisdom of leaders on both sides. I have
confidence that relations can improve. We feel it is most important
to sit down and talk without prejudice. We should put aside our
differences and seek a foundation that is acceptable to both sides,"
Chen said.

(By K. C. Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Asked whether Taiwan and mainland China can negotiate on the
basis of the 1992 consensus about "one China," Chen said that
according to Taipei's understanding, in 1992, there was discussion of
a so-called "one China."</P>
      <P>"However, there was a disagreement and no consensus. Most
Taiwanese people cannot accept Taiwan becoming a second Hong Kong or
a second Macau," Chen said, adding that the people of Taiwan
cannot accept the Beijing-proposed "one country, two systems" formula
applied to Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>Nor can the majority of Taiwan people accept the "one China"
principle if it is interpreted as Taiwan become part of the PRC
(People's Republic of China), Chen reiterated.</P>
      <P>Asked what mainland China can learn from his election victory,
Chen said the results of the ROC's March 18 presidential election
demonstrate that the PRC leadership does not understand the
Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>"Over the past two presidential elections, they have applied the
same methods of threats and intimidation. However, the choices of
the people of Taiwan have proven them wrong," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He further said the PRC doesn't understand his Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP). "Nor do they understand me. They believe
that a DPP victory would bring a declaration of independence. Thus
far, my cross-Strait policy has been supported by 70 percent of the
people in this country. It represents a consensus of the Taiwan
people... The PRC leadership listens to people who visit China and
often misleads them. The information they get is far from the truth.
This lead to miscalculations and misjudgments on their part. They
must learn from the election result. They need to get to know me,
and they need to get to know the DPP."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's desire to exchange resident
journalists with Taiwan is one example of a situation in which both
sides need to put aside their political disputes and seek to resolve
practical issues of mutual concern through systematic channels,
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman John Deng said on

answering questions from the local press about a report by mainland
Chinese media that Beijing is planning to discuss with relevant
Taiwan authorities the exchange of journalists, and that the
mainland's Central Office for Taiwan Affairs under the State Council
has already approved such an application by Xinhua News Agency.</P>
      <P>Xinhua, Beijing's official mouthpiece, reportedly will submit an
application for that purpose with the Taipei-based Government

    <HEADLINE>ROC LAUNCHES UN BID FOR 8TH TIME</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  4  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China has launched a new
push to join the United Nations as 12 of its diplomatic allies have
jointly submitted a proposal asking the world body to consider its
representation, a senior official said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Vice Foreign Minister Wu Tzu-dan told a news conference that 12
ROC allies presented the proposal to the UN Secretary General on
Aug. 3, requesting the UN to set up a working group to examine the
exceptional international situation pertaining to the ROC, and to
ensure the right of its 23 million people to participate in the UN
and its related agencies.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the 12 allies were Senegal, Grenada, the
Gambia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, the Marshall Islands,
Nicaragua, Swaziland, the Solomon Islands, Nauru, Burkina Faso,
Malawi and Honduras.</P>
      <P>Wu said the UN representatives of the 12 countries submitted a
joint letter to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on Thursday
requesting the inclusion of the proposal as a supplementary item in
the agenda of the 55th plenary session of the General Assembly
scheduled to open in September.</P>
      <P>The proposal bears the title "Need to examine the exceptional
international situation pertaining to the Republic of China on
Taiwan, to ensure that the fundamental right of its 23 million
people to participate in the work and activities of the United
Nations is fully respected."</P>
      <P>The ROC has launched an annual bid to seek UN representation
since 1993, but this year's drive was the first by the new government
under President Chen Shui-bian of the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party. Chen swept to power in March 18 presidential
election, ending Kuomintang's 55-year political monopoly in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu said an explanatory memorandum with the proper justification
for the proposal is attached to the joint letter to the UN Secretary
General.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the memorandum first pointed out that Tuvalu's
admission to the UN later this year will leave the ROC "the only
country in the world that remains excluded from the United Nations."</P>
      <P>It then indicated that the ROC and the PRC have coexisted for
more than 50 years on their respective sides of the Taiwan Strait,
with neither subject to the other's rule.</P>
      <P>"However, the UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 failed to
address this reality. The ROC has been excluded from all UN
activities, and even been blocked from participating in
non-governmental international activities," the memorandum
regretted.</P>
      <P>It further said the ROC completed its first-ever democratic
peaceful transfer of power between different political parties in
May. Moreover, the memorandum said, "the ROC has been playing an
active role in international cooperation programs and humanitarian
relief operations, and is willing to integrate itself into the
international human rights system spearheaded by the UN."</P>
      <P>The memorandum went on to stress that the ROC has continuously
expressed its good faith to the PRC with an aim to improve
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>"The ROC government believes that its participation in the UN
would enable both sides to work and cooperate in the UN and its
related agencies, and thus gradually build mutual trust and
accelerate the peace process in the Taiwan Strait," the memorandum,
adding that at the same time, the UN could live up to its principle
of universality and achieve its goal of preventive diplomacy by
accepting the ROC's participation.</P>
      <P>The memorandum also said the ROC has repeatedly stressed that
its bid for UN representation is not intended to challenge the PRC's
membership in the UN.</P>
      <P>"However, the PRC must acknowledge that Taiwan is a full-fledged
democratic society today. Threats and intimidation can only do harm
to the feelings of the people on both sides. Only when the PRC
acknowledges the existence of the ROC can cross-strait relations
develop in a positive direction and in a mutually beneficial way,"
it noted.</P>
      <P>Mainland China strongly opposes a UN representation for Taiwan
and has successfully blocked the island's membership bid each time.
President Chen said on Monday he did not expect the island to have a
significant breakthrough in its UN membership drive this year, but
said this was something the government had to do.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROUNDTABLE MEETING SHOULD NOT AFFECT DEMOCRATIC MECHANISM: KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Aug. 3 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan
will not refuse to meet with the heads of rival political parties in
a roundtable meeting called by President Chen Shui-bian, but the
public should not view the meeting as overly dramatic, a KMT official
said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Jason Hu, head of the KMT's Cultural Affairs Department, said a
gathering between heads of different political parties is a natural
thing, and that the public should not exaggerate or dramatize such a
matter.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the KMT is not opposed to a plan for a roundtable
meeting by President Chen Shui-bian, in which he would meet with
rival party leaders to discuss major national issues, Hu pointed out
that such a meeting should not turn out to be a formality, and would
not represent a sign of "political reconciliation."</P>
      <P>Calling on the public to give the KMT space, Hu said the KMT is
determined to play its role as an effective opposition party and
added that any "roundtable meeting" should not hinder the normal
systematic mechanism in a democratic country.</P>
      <P>Hu, who is accompanying Lien on a North American tour, made the
remarks upon arrival at the airport here.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, some local experts attending a seminar in Taipei
criticized Chen's idea of holding a roundtable meeting as a trick
which is only aimed at satisfying the goals of his "political
propaganda."</P>
      <P>Lin Cho-shui, a lawmaker of the ruling pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party, said Chen should do his best in the
planned meeting to forge a consensus with Lien and leaders of other
parties on issues such as national security, foreign policy and
cross-Taiwan Strait ties.</P>
      <P>In addition to that, the president should also try to find ways
with the heads of the opposition parties to dissolve the current
confrontation between the legislative and administrative branches of
the government, he added, warning that greater disorder for the
nation is in store if the situation continues.</P>
      <P>Y. C. Liu, an Academia Sinica researcher, said he highly doubts
that any conclusions made in the roundtable meeting would have any
legal basis.</P>
      <P>Liu predicted that the meeting would be only a political game, if
Chen and the heads of the three other major parties cannot even reach
consensus on Taiwan's political fundamentals and major problems.</P>
      <P>He suggested that Chen and Lien as well as People First Party
Chairman James Soong and New Party leader Hau Lung-bin hold a
closed-door meeting first to clear the way for a formal roundtable

      <P>Chung however said that the final decision will be based on the

      <P>Chung made the remarks in a reaction to a local news report that
Beijing has authorized its agency in charge of Taiwan affairs to work
out a plan under which Beijing will send journalists to be stationed

      <P>She said the GIO believes that the cross-strait journalist
exchange will be eventually implemented, pointing out that both the
GIO and the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) have already

stressed.</P>
      <P>Actually, a cross-strait exchange of permanently-stationed
reporters had been discussed during the previous administration,

    <HEADLINE>ROC FOREIGN MINISTER MEETS WITH COUNTERPARTS OF FOUR CARIBBEAN ALLIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  5  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An annual meeting of foreign ministers of
the Republic of China and its four tiny allies in the Eastern
Caribbean occurred in Taipei on Friday.</P>
      <P>The ROC offered aid to the allies and they in return
reaffirmed for their support for Taiwan's bid for access to
international organizations, according to a joint communique signed
by attending officials at the end of the annual conference.</P>
      <P>The meeting brought together ROC Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao,
Dominican Republic's Premier and Foreign Minister Roosevelt Douglas,
Saint Christopher and Nevis Vice President and Foreign Minister Sam
Condor, Grenada Foreign Minister Mark Issac, and Saint Vincent and
the Grenadines Foreign Minister Allan Cruickshank.</P>
      <P>Tien told a press conference after the meeting that Taiwan has
agreed to extend US$2.5 million in loans to Dominican Republic to
boost its sagging banana exports, the lifeline of that state.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also offered to each of the four states grants of
US$100,000 for the development of manpower resources, US$60,000 for
the purchase of computer equipment, and US$100,000 for the
improvement of medical equipment.</P>
      <P>Tien deliberately expressed thanks to Saint Vincent and the
Grenadines, Saint Christopher and Nevis, and Grenada for sponsoring a
United Nation proposal to put Taiwan's UN bid on the agenda of the
body's assembly this year.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is fully-qualified to be a UN member, Tien
disputed claims that Taiwan is engaging in "checkbook diplomacy", a
term which refers to paying tiny UN member-states to support Taiwan's
bids for UN access.</P>
      <P>Douglas echoed Tien's view by saying that his country supports
Taipei's UN bid because it believes the ROC and its 23 million people
deserve a seat at the UN.</P>
      <P>Asked by reporters about Beijing's ploy to lure the four ROC
allies away, Tien said he was confident that Taiwan's ties with the
four nations are secure and firm.</P>
      <P>Cruickshank supported Tien's view, saying at the press conference
that Saint Vincent and the Grenadines supports the ROC because they
share the same values of peace and democracy.</P>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei met with the foreign ministers of the four
states on Friday evening, and reiterated Taipei's willingness to
share with them the island's experience in development. Tang also
thanked them for their steadfast support of the ROC.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC'S LATEST UN BID WORDED DIFFERENTLY, BUT MEANING IS SAME</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  4 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's latest bid to seek
re-admittance into the United Nations is worded differently because a
new ruling party is at the helm, but Taiwan's stance remains
essentially the same, the ROC foreign minister said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao noted that changes in some of the
bid's wording and content happen every year, and added his hope that
people will not dwell too much on the words, because they are merely
"portrayals of the facts."</P>
      <P>Tien said that the bid stresses the hope of the 23 million people
living here to be seen as living in a sovereign state, and to join
the UN and other international organizations under this designation.</P>
      <P>Twelve of the ROC's allies filed the bid on Taiwan's behalf
earlier in the day. Last September, a similar proposal demanding that
the UN reconsider Taiwan's representation issue again failed to make
the agenda for the 1999 UN General Assembly plenary session due to
pressure from mainland China.</P>
      <P>This year's bid includes an explanatory memorandum, a draft
resolution, and a joint letter to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan
requesting the inclusion of the proposal as a supplementary item in
the agenda of the 55th plenary session of the General Assembly
scheduled to open in September.</P>
      <P>Tien said that Taiwan settled on the final version of its
proposal with "careful consideration" and included opinions from all
quarters within the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that this year's version does away with words
such as "the Republic of China on Taiwan," "the Republic of China in
mainland China," and "democratic reunification" so as to avoid
unnecessary speculation that the new ROC government may be trying to
tell mainland China about its position on cross-strait relations
through the documents.</P>
      <P>He added that the wording was also carefully chosen to avoid
contradicting newly-elected ROC President Chen Shui-bian's statements
on "a future one China," the "one China" issue, "one China,
respective interpretations," and the "1992 spirit" -- referring to
that year's consensus with mainland China.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China was a founding member of the United Nations
and has continually sought re-admittance to it since mainland China
took over the ROC seat in 1971.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING VOICES OPPOSITION TO CHEN'S TRANSIT STOP IN L.A.: PAPER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  4 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington, Aug. 4 (CNA): The Washington Times reported Friday
that Communist China has expressed to the United States its
opposition to ROC President Chen Shui-bian's scheduled "transit stop"
in Los Angeles on his way to visit Latin American countries later
this month.</P>
      <P>But the conservative newspaper quoted Clinton administration
officials as saying that the visit is not expected to touch off
another Taiwan crisis, as occurred following the 1995 visit to the
United States by Mr. Chen's predecessor, Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Upon arrival on Aug. 13, one day before the start of the
Democratic national Convention, Mr. Chen will be greeted by Richard
Bush, Board Chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan. The States
Department calls the visit a "transit stop" and does not expect the
new president to do public appearances or media interviews, said
Clinton administration officials who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.</P>
      <P>The Beijing regime, however, opposes the one-day visit and has
expressed its views to US officials in Washington and in Beijing,
Zhang Yuanyuan, press spokesman for the PRC embassy in Washington
told the newspaper.</P>
      <P>"Of course we're opposed to this kind of action on the part of
the US government," Zhang said in an interview. "Especially when the
new Taiwanese leader, since his coming to power last March, has not
embraced the one-China principle. This kind of action might send some
wrong singles to the forces in Taiwan that promote separatism and
independence."</P>
      <P>"They always make this kind of comment," retorted Eric Chiang,
information division director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Representative Office in Washington, when asked about Beijing's
opposition. "We don't think that helps to promote the atmosphere
between the two sides," he said.</P>
      <P>The Washington Times noted that although the State Department and
the White House said the stop was routine, but officials acknowledged
there could be political fallout from Beijing any time the leader of
Taiwan comes to the United States.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Mr. Chen is restricted from holding meetings or
giving press interviews, the State Department official said, "We
understand Mr. Chen's activities will be private and consistent with
the purpose of a transit stop." Such stops are granted for senior
Taiwan leaders' safety, comfort and convenience" on a case-by-case
basis. "We understand there will be no public and media events,"
added the official. (by Nelson Chung)</P>

    <HEADLINE>US MINIMIZES SIGNIFICANCE OF GRANTING ROC PRESIDENT VISA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug. 4 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Clinton administration officials Friday
minimized the political importance of the decision to allow ROC
President Chen Shui-bian to stay in Los Angeles overnight later this
month after Communist China lodged a protest against the move.</P>
      <P>The officials said there will be no official welcome for, or
meetings with, Taiwan's leader, adding that the granting of the
transit visa to Mr. Chen has ample precedent and signals no change in
the United State's China policy.</P>
      <P>Both the PRC foreign ministry and its embassy in Washington
lodged protests over the decision to allow Mr. Chen to make a
stopover in Los Angeles on Aug. 13 while on his way to visit six
Caribbean and African states that have diplomatic relations with the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Communist Chinese spokesmen pointed out that the visa decision
"may send some wrong signals to forces in Taiwan that promote
separatism and independence."</P>
      <P>However, the US State Department noted that Mr. Chen will have no
meetings with Clinton administration officials and that giving
permission for transit stops by senior Taiwan leaders is nothing new
and consistent with long-standing US policy and practice.</P>
      <P>Mr. Chen will be met in Los Angeles by Richard Bush, head of the
non-governmental American Institute in Taiwan, which handles
unofficial US relations with Taipei. American officials also said it
is "understood" that Mr. Chen will not hold any interviews with the

    <HEADLINE>ROC LEGISLATOR HOPES US WOULD REVIEW TAIWAN POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Aug. 4 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior Republic of China legislator on
Friday expressed the hope that a new US administration will
thoroughly review US policy toward Taiwan so as to remedy the damage
inflicted by President Bill Clinton's "Three Noes" policy statement
in Shanghai last year.</P>
      <P>When addressing the Washington-based Heritage Foundation
on "Cross-Strait Relations: A Taiwanese View," Parris Chang said it
would be even better if the new administration could discard the "one
China" notion as presented by Beijing.</P>
      <P>The former University of Pennsylvania professor pointed out that
by stating the United States does not support "two Chinas" or "one
China, one Taiwan," does not support the independence of Taiwan, and
does not believe Taiwan should be a member of international
organizations that require statehood for membership, Clinton "somehow
tried to determine Taiwan's destiny by himself."</P>
      <P>While the balance of power across the Taiwan Straits is tilting
in favor of Beijing, Chang accused the Clinton administration of not
only rejecting Taiwan's request to buy Aegis destroyers and other
advanced weapons systems to counter the growing Communist Chinese
missile threat, but also of not faithfully implementing the Taiwan
Relations Act with regard to Taiwan's defense needs.</P>
      <P>As to Taiwan's continuing efforts to join the United Nations,
Chang said denying Taiwan UN membership is a "violation of the human
rights of the 23 million people on Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"If Beijing really cares about the people of Taiwan as it claims,
then it should not block Taiwan's bid to enter such non-political
international bodies as the World Health Organization, World Bank,
and International Monetary Fund," he added.</P>
      <P>He emphasized that Taiwan is not a trouble-maker because the
government of President Chen Shui-bian has offered to resume
cross-strait dialogue, to improve bilateral relations with the
mainland, to establish direct communication links, and even to
discuss "the future one China" and peaceful reunification.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that Beijing has refused to respond positively to
these overtures and insist that Mr. Chen has not embraced the "one
China" principle. "It is Beijing's problem for not trusting Mr.
Chen," he said, adding that Mr. Chen deserves some encouragement for
his offers of constructive engagement with mainland China.</P>
      <P>However, Chang also noted that it is very difficult for the two
sides to discuss peaceful reunification right now, given the stark
contrast in political, economic, and social conditions across the
Straits.</P>
      <P>If the mainland democratizes and becomes a real free market
economy as Taiwan has already done, then the timing for peaceful
reunification would come naturally, he continued.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT VOWS TO IMPROVE KAOHSIUNG WATER QUALITY, NO NEW RESERVOIR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Aug.  5  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian pledged on
Saturday that his administration will spend NT$15 billion (US$483.87
million) over the next three years improving the quality of tap
water in the Greater Kaohsiung area in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen offered the promise during an inspection tour of a water
purification plant near the Chengching Lake on the outskirts of
the southern port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Chen also declared that he will honor his campaign check not to
construct a controversial reservoir in the beautiful Kaohsiung
County township of Meinung during his tenure.</P>
      <P>"So long as I'm in office, construction of the controversial
Meinung Reservoir will be nowhere in sight," Chen stressed.</P>
      <P>The president pointed out that the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) has drafted short-, medium- and long-term packages of
measures to ensure adequate tap water supplies for residents in the
Greater Kaohsiung area comprising Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung
County.</P>
      <P>"Instead of constructing a new reservoir in Meinung, broached by
the previous Kuomintang government, we will adopt other strategies
and substitute measures to resolve the Kaohsiung area's water
shortage problems," Chen explained.</P>
      <P>Noting that short supply and poor quality of drinking water have
troubled many residents in the Greater Kaohsiung area, Chen said his
administration is determined to carry out a number of programs to
ensure fully supply and improve water quality over the next three
fiscal years.</P>
      <P>The projects will include construction of a highly advanced
water purification facility, installation of new water quality
improvement and monitoring systems, renovation of the existing
Nanhua Reservoir and a Kao-Ping Stream dam, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said the government will streamline the
country's overall water management system to upgrade operational
efficiency. "We'll integrate all existing water administrative
agencies at various levels into a single unit in two phases. As the
first step, we will integrate the five water management
divisions under the MOEA into a single agency by the end of
this year," he pledged.</P>
      <P>Chen also urged all fellow countrymen to jointly launch a
"Clean Water, Clean River" campaign to protect and conserve water
resources.</P>
      <P>"The government alone cannot ensure clean water supply. The
public and private sectors should join forces to prevent
river pollution, particularly the upperstream of major rivers which
are primary source of drinking water supplies," Chen said, adding
that local companies should also abide by current regulations
governing treatment of waste water and chemical solvents.

    <HEADLINE>ROC ENVOY TO AUSTRALIA SEES ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, Aug 4 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There is room for an expansion in bilateral
relations between the Republic of China and Australia, said Dr. Liu
Polun, retiring representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office (TECO) in Canberra.</P>
      <P>Liu, who is stepping down after serving in the post for two years
and seven months, is making last-ditch efforts to encourage
Australian officials and politicians to exploit opportunities to
improve ties with Taiwan so that both countries can benefit.</P>
      <P>Liu told the CNA on Friday that he was interviewed by the
state-funded Special Broadcasting System (SBS) in Sydney this week in
which he earnestly urged the Australian government to take bolder and
more practical steps to better ties with Taiwan without being too
concerned about mainland China's reaction so long as the moves are in
the national interests of the two countries.</P>
      <P>He said the stumbling block behind closer ties between Australia
and Taiwan is mainland China because Canberra takes an extremely
cautious approach in order to not antagonize Beijing, adding that
this is resulting in its losses in business opportunities with
Taipei.</P>
      <P>"This is indeed unfortunate for Australia because it does not
understand much about the Taiwan market and about snatching at
business opportunities at the right time," he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan is a big and established market for
Australian liquified natural gas (LNG), but Australia only secured a
contract for the export of four-million tons of LNG through the
signing of an understanding of memorandum with the Tuntex Group. This
figure represents only half the amount that the Taiwanese
conglomerate had planned on importing per year.</P>
      <P>Liu continued by saying that Australia is not only complementary
to Taiwan in terms of economic considerations, but also in the fields
of science and education.</P>
      <P>Australia is rich in natural resources and Taiwan needs them to
fire its economic engines so that it can export more products to the
world. But Australia and Taiwan are also complementary in scientific
and educational fields because both sides can cooperate in research
and development, biotechnology, information technology,
telecommunications, aerospace, and other areas, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Through cooperation in these fields, businessmen from the two
countries can increase investment in each other's country, thus
broadening the scope of mutual interests and benefits, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WATER RATE MAY BE RAISED: MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) may
consider raising the water rate to reflect cost, Economics Minister
Lin Hsin-yi said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lin made the statement after accompanying President Chen on an
inspection tour of the seventh management center of Taiwan Water Co.
in the southern port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>During the inspection tour, Lin exchanged views on water fees
with Lin Hsueh-cheng, chairman of state-run Taiwan Water Co. which is
under MOEA jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Minister Lin said Taiwan Water Co. has incurred a debt of nearly
NT$50 billion (US$1.61 billion). "As the company will have to assume
part of the cost for improving tap water quality in the Kaohsiung
area, its financial status will worsen further," the minister noted.</P>
      <P>Lin attributed the water firm's huge debt mainly to
the island's unreasonably low water rate. According to Lin, Taiwan's
current tap water fee, NT$9.53 per liter, is one of the world's
lowest and far cheaper than that for a 1-liter bottle of mineral
water.</P>
      <P>Another reason behind the company's deficit was high water
treatment cost, Lin said. "Due to pollution in the upperstream of
major local rivers, our water company has to spend much money on
water treatment to ensure that the quality of our tap water meets the
standards of hygiene," he explained.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Lin said he thinks that there should be
room for upward adjustment of water rate. "We will consider
adjusting our water fee in accordance with our gross national
product (GNP) to better reflect our treatment cost," the minister
added.</P>
      <P>During the inspection tour, President Chen reaffirmed his
determination to honor his campaign promise not to construct a new
reservoir in Meinung, a Kaohsiung County mountain town rich in Hakka
cultural relic, natural scenery and wildlife.</P>
      <P>Following Chen's declaration of "no Meinung Reservoir
construction during his tenure," Minister Lin said the Cabinet
has approved an MOEA-drafted plan for improving tap water supply and
quality for residents in the Greater Kaohsiung area.</P>
      <P>Over the next three years, Lin said, the MOEA will launch a
number of improvement projects to ensure stable, adequate supply
of high-quality tap water for Kaohsiung residents.</P>
      <P>Lin said the Cabinet has agreed to set aside a budget of NT$15
billion (US$483.87 million) for various Kaohsiung water supply
improvement projects which are scheduled to be completed by 2003.</P>
      <P>"The projects were originally scheduled to be finalized by 2007,
but now we have decided to advance the completion to 2003 for an
early solution to the short supply and poor quality problem,"
Lin said.</P>
      <P>The improvement plan includes a Nanhua Reservoir-Kaoping Stream
Dam link-up project and construction of several highly advanced water
purification and softening facilities, Lin added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Aug. 5 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Most shipping-related organizations with
operations in Kaohsiung Harbor are satisfied with the performance of
the southern Taiwan port, a recent survey has found.</P>
      <P>According to the results of the poll conducted by the Kaohsiung
Harbor Administration in the first half of this year, 74 percent of
shipping companies and shipping agents are satisfied with the
harbor's services, up from the previous level of 69 percent posted in
the second half of last year.</P>
      <P>In a bid to upgrade the harbor's services and correct its
shortcomings, administration officials said they usually conduct a
poll on customer satisfaction each six months. According to the
officials, the administration also informs the customers of the
harbor's improvement results periodically as part of its efforts to
achieve the goal of "a total satisfaction" from the clients.</P>
      <P>The survey also pointed out that the prime complaints of the
shipping sector about Kaohsiung Harbor are its inadequate
environmental protection measures and scarce space for increased
volumes of operations.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Harbor is Taiwan's largest port and the world's
third-largest in terms of the handling of standardized 20-foot cargo
containers. It handled nearly 6.27 million TEUs (twenty-foot
equivalent units) in 1999.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette
Lu told Radio Free Asia on Friday that Taiwan's new government is
willing to strive for "a new page in history" together with mainland
China and maintain the status quo in cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Lu added that the people of Taiwan and mainland China are both of
the Chinese race, but the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are separate
political entities.</P>
      <P>"For the sake of cross-strait relations, let us put aside
nationalism. The two sides of the Taiwan Strait definitely have the
ability to establish peaceful and friendly relations," she said.</P>
      <P>Lu went on to say that although Taiwan has never been a part of
the People's Republic of China, Taiwan and mainland China should
respect each other.</P>
      <P>She said that she hopes to exchange views with mainland China in
a rational and friendly manner, adding that it is important for
humankind to display rationality and strive for peace.</P>
      <P>Recalling her last visit to mainland China in 1990 in search of
her roots, she said that the trip made her feel even more certain
that no matter how similar their language and racial heritage, the
two sides are vastly different in political thinking.</P>
      <P>She added that Taiwan values the "special racial and cultural
relationship" with mainland China and that Taiwan cannot deny the
fact that the two peoples are related to each other by blood.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  5  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's highest-ranking
military chief on Saturday told senior political warfare officers
that they must weed out corruption in arms purchases and other
military projects to avoid recurring problems.</P>
      <P>Gen. Tang Yao-ming, the ROC's Chief of the General Staff, said
that the damage done by a scandal involving alleged kickbacks
received in the French-made Lafayette frigate purchase case occurred
precisely because the anti-corruption measures were not properly
implemented.</P>
      <P>He added that the entire armed forces should cooperate with the
special task force that was recently appointed to investigate the
circumstances surrounding the Lafayette purchase scandal, which
allegedly led to the death of a navy captain who is widely believed
to have been trying to blow the whistle on corrupt officers.</P>
      <P>Tang made his remarks on the second day of the military's annual
review of political warfare affairs, which include counseling and
services for the nation's servicemen and their families, discipline,
safety, supervision and monitoring, and internal security.</P>
      <P>He said that the scandal actually represents an opportunity
because the sooner truth is revealed and the military fully redresses
past wrongs, the sooner the military's honorable image can be
rebuilt.</P>
      <P>The body of ROC Navy Capt. Yin Ching-feng, who was the executive
director of the navy's weaponry procurement program at the time of
his death in 1993, was found floating in a harbor in northern Taiwan
several days after he had been collecting evidence about alleged
irregularities concerning the navy's procurement of six Lafayettes
and four German minesweepers.</P>
      <P>The investigation into his death had been bogged down over the
past six years but received a shot in the arm after President Chen
Shui-bian on July 30 ordered the establishment of an ad hoc panel to
look into the case.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Foreign Minister Tien
Hung-mao said in Kaohsiung on Saturday that Taipei will take a
positive attitude toward participating in international activities.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while delivering a report at the invitation
of a Kaohsiung construction group on the new steps being taken by
Taiwan to expand its foreign relations.</P>
      <P>Tien noted that the basic guidelines for Taiwan's diplomacy are:
cementing relations with its diplomatic allies, improving substantive
ties with countries which maintain no formal relations with Taiwan,
and taking a positive attitude toward joining international
organizations.</P>
      <P>The scholar-turned foreign minister pointed out that ROC
President Chen Shui-bian has stressed the importance of maintaining
the continuity and stability of the country's diplomacy.</P>
      <P>As a result, he said that the new government, which was formed on
May 20, will continue honoring all treaties, agreements, and
cooperative plans signed by the previous government with foreign
countries.</P>
      <P>The ROC now maintains diplomatic relations with 29 countries
around the world, with about half being located in the Caribbean
area, and Central and South America.</P>
      <P>Tien said that Chen is set to leave on his first overseas trip as
president to some countries in the Caribbean and Central American on
Aug. 13, indicating that Taiwan attaches much importance to its
relations with its diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that more than 150 countries around the world
have no formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, but the ROC
maintains close economic and trade relations with them.</P>
      <P>Among these countries, Tien said, Taiwan has established 97
quasi-official organizations in 63 countries.</P>
      <P>According to Tien, after the inauguration of the new
administration, the US government lauded the democratic achievement
of Taiwan, with the Seoul and Tokyo governments voicing their
willingness to improve substantive ties with Taipei.</P>
      <P>He said that the European Union has also expressed its intention

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-PARTY TASK FORCE NOT RUBBER-STAMP BODY: NOBEL LAUREATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The newly formed cross-party task force for
the development of relations across the Taiwan Strait is absolutely
not a rubber-stamp body, the convener of the group said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh made the assurance at a
news conference where he unveiled a list of 25 members for the
high-profile cross-party task force.</P>
      <P>Lee, a co-winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize in chemistry, said he
personally looks forward to seeing the top leaders from both sides
of the Taiwan Strait sit down to talk.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, before an effective cross-strait dialogue channel
is forged, we can't predict when such a scenario can be realized,"
said the respected scholar.</P>
      <P>Lee said although the island's two largest opposition parties
-- the Kuomintang and the People First Party (PFP) -- declined to
name representatives to take part in the panel, the cross-party task
force is scheduled to hold its first meeting at the end of this
month.</P>
      <P>Asked how the task force will operate, Lee said he will fully
respect the opinions of all panel members. "At any rate, we will not
use voting to reach a conclusion," he added.</P>
      <P>As for the agenda, Taiwan's foremost scholar said, it's up to
all panel members to work out a priority list.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the opening of direct cross-strait trade, mail and
transportation links and a review of the existing "go slow, be
patient" policy on mainland China-bound investment will be priority
topics of discussion, Lee said President Chen Shui-bian has never
mentioned that any issue should be given priority.</P>
      <P>Lee said he once asked President Chen why the president
wanted him to organize a new cross-party panel instead of
restructuring the existing National Unification Council (NUC).</P>
      <P>"President Chen said the NUC had been dominated by the
KMT, Taiwan's ruling party until May 20, and 70 percent of
its members were government officials," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Quoting Chen, Lee said the government-dominated NUC was
unsuitable to serve as an advisory body to the president.
"Therefore, the president intends to form a new panel comprising
members from across the political and social spectrum to
facilitate formation of a national consensus on future
cross-strait ties," he added.</P>
      <P>Lee stressed that the new panel does not include any government
official as its member, nor will it rubber-stamp any government
decision on cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>Lee said the task force will offer counseling or advice
on the development of cross-strait relations for President Chen's
reference. "I believe that Chen will respect the views and opinions
presented by the panel."</P>
      <P>Lee further said the task force is not aimed at inviting
politicians for political consultations. "In face, the panel
comprises members from different political groups and professional
fields to work for peaceful development on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait and for ethnic harmony in local society," he added.</P>
      <P>Lee said the non-political members in the panel were selected
from more than 200 celebrities in various non-political fields. "I
believe that all panel members are competent and experienced
enough to assume their new job in the panel," he said confidently.</P>
      <P>In addition to legislators from the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party and the pro-unification opposition New Party, the task force
also include an independent lawmaker and sever KMT members who join
the panel on their own right, not as party representatives.</P>
      <P>Non-political members include a painter, a chicken tycoon, an
aboriginal clergyman, a medical expert, and several legal and
economics experts and presidential advisers.</P>

      <P>A new poll shows that Taiwan's urban women
now value personality and temperament over earning ability in
choosing a potential mate, indicating a shift away from traditional
values that rate bread-and-butter over other factors.</P>
      <P>The poll, which was conducted by National Sun Yat-sen University
on behalf of a pharmaceutical company that manufactures hair growth
drug, also revealed that looks do matter, with this consideration
coming in third behind personality and financial standing.</P>
      <P>Out of the 500 single women surveyed in Taipei, Taichung, and
Kaohsiung, 91. 8 percent said that they attach importance to a
potential mate's personality and temperament, 75.8 percent said they
look at earning ability, and 66 percent take appearance into
consideration.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 75 percent of those interviewed said they are
concerned about their mates' hair. Among the reasons stated were that
bald-headed men or men with little hair may give the impression of
lacking confidence or being advanced in age. Another reason mentioned
was that bald-headed men are not as attractive.</P>
      <P>Of the women surveyed, 61 percent said they will choose mates
with a full head of hair. Also, almost 60 percent said they would ask
their mates to undergo hair treatment if they started losing their
hair.</P>

officials of the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) on Saturday.</P>
      <P>After two days of discussions on Thursday and Friday, airline
representatives from the two countries agreed to increase passenger
capacity by 50 percent.</P>
      <P>It was agreed that beginning in late October, 800 seats will be

another 1,200 seats to be added by next October. This is expected to
largely accommodate consumer demand, said the officials.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan's China Airlines and EVA Airways offer a
combined 4,010 seats per week. According the new agreement, the two
sides will increase the number of seats to 6,010 by late October,
2001.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's negotiators also actively strived to introduce an
additional Taiwanese airline to the flight route. However, Vietnamese
officials declined the proposal, saying that Taiwan is already
receiving special treatment as other countries each only have one
appointed airline carrier company for flights to and from Vietnam.</P>
      <P>The officials also noted that demand for seats on the
Taiwan-Vietnam flight route has only recently increased, so it is
still to early to consider adding a third airline to the route.</P>
      <P>Because of the seat limits, China Airlines and EVA Airways can
only provide seven flights per week from Taiwan to Ho Chi Minh City.
Taiwan-Hanoi flights are expected to begin after the increase in the
number of seats under the agreement.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,   Aug.  5  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said on
Saturday that the Kaohsiung Harbor will be put under the
jurisdiction of the Kaohsiung City Government in the future.</P>
      <P>Chen made the announcement during an inspection tour of the
southern Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is aware that the merger of the Kaohsiung city and
harbor administration is a "dream come true" for Kaohsiung
residents.</P>
      <P>Chen said he has consistently advocated that the central
government delegates more power and resources to local
governments to ensure balanced development in various parts of
the island.</P>
      <P>"Sharing power and resources is the basis for the central and
local governments to forge a partnership and jointly push for
balanced national development," Chen explained.</P>
      <P>Chen said he hopes that the Kaohsiung City Government and the
Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau, which is now under the jurisdiction of the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC), can cooperate
closely to promote the development of the city and the harbor after
the merger.</P>
      <P>MOTC Minister Yeh Chu-lan, who accompanied Chen on his Kaohsiung
inspection tour, said the MOTC has formed a task force to promote
the long-talked-about Kaohsiung city-harbor merger plan.</P>
      <P>"According to our work scheduled, the ministry will refer a
draft bill on the city-harbor administration merger to the
Legislative Yuan for screening in September. As many legislators
have voiced support for the proposal, I believe that the bill will
pass the legislature smoothly to pave the way for the city-harbor
merger," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Under the MOTC-drafted bill, navigation administration will
still be handled by the MOTC, while harbor administration will be

    <HEADLINE>MEMBERS OF INTERPARTY TASK FORCE ON CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS ANNOUNCED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  5  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh
announced on Saturday the list of members for his interparty task
force on cross-strait relations, which he said will be an advisory
body for the President, not a policy-making unit.</P>
      <P>Drawing from across the political and social spectrum, the task
force comprises of legislators from different parties, legal and
economics experts, presidential advisers, academics, a media expert,
a painter, an aboriginal clergyman, and a chicken tycoon.</P>
      <P>Notably absent from the list of 25 members are appointed
representatives from opposition parties Kuomintang (KMT) and People
First Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>The KMT and the PFP have consistently refused to take part in the
committee since Lee -- the convener and a member himself -- was first
approached by newly elected Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian in May to form an advisory task force on cross-strait
issues.</P>
      <P>However, the KMT is unofficially represented by a legislator and
a former legislator who joined the team in their personal capacities.</P>
      <P>Lee said that he will keep four seats open in case the two
parties wish to participate in the task force one day, and he urged
those party representatives who have already joined the team to put
the nation's interests ahead of those of their respective parties.</P>
      <P>Lee went on to say that Chen had already reviewed the list two
days ago, and that Chen did not have any disagreeing opinions.</P>
      <P>He added that the task force is scheduled to convene for the
first time before Chen departs on his first official trip to the
ROC's Caribbean, Central American, and African allies at the end of
August.</P>
      <P>Lee said that Chen will be invited to attend the meeting, which
may involve discussions on the impending admission of both Taiwan and
mainland China into the rule-setting World Trade Organization and on
the "one China" issue.</P>
      <P>He added that the people of Taiwan and mainland China have no
deep-seated hatred for each other and that they share a common
history and culture, so they should cooperate with each other and
strive ahead "hand-in-hand."</P>
      <P>Billed as a presidential advisory body, the task force will not
be a policy-making unit nor an executive unit, Lee said, adding that
the group will consolidate public consensus and promote the
development of ethnic harmony and peace across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Given that the committee was formed at Chen's request, DPP
legislative whip Hsu Tien-tsai said that the task force should try
its best to help Chen collect information and provide valuable
advice.</P>
      <P>Hsu urged Lee's newly formed task force to refrain from publicly
announcing its views too often but instead stick to its role of
presidential advisor so that it will not unstabilize the political
scene.</P>
      <P>PFP spokesman Sun Ta-chien said that his party prefers to bring
up its views and opinions on cross-strait policies through official
channels within the system and through other opportunities such as
the interparty leadership roundtable that may be hosted by Chen in
the future.</P>
      <P>Sun added that just because the PFP did not appoint a
representative to join the task force does not mean that it does not
support trying to forge a domestic consensus on cross-strait
policies.</P>
      <P>KMT deputy secretary general Shao Yu-ming said that his party did
not want to be officially represented in the task force because of a
"basic distrust" of the DPP's position on cross-strait relations.
Therefore, he added that the KMT does not wish to be a part of the
committee simply to endorse the DPP's stance.</P>
      <P>As to whether or not the KMT will take disciplinary action
against the KMT members who joined the committee in their personal
capacities, Shao said that the KMT has yet to discuss the issue.
However, he added that the KMT "does not endorse" and "does not
support" their membership in the task force.</P>
      <P>The 25 members of the interparty task force on cross-strait
relations are: Academia Sinica president Lee Yuan-tseh, aboriginal
clergyman Pai Kuang-sheng, non-affiliated legislator Chu Hui-liang,
former National Tsinghua University president Shen Chun-shan, Public
Television Service chairman Wu Feng-shan, enterprise sector
representative Wu Tung-shen, National Taiwan University (NTU)
political science professor Ming Chu-cheng, Hua Nan Commercial Bank
vice chairman Lin Ming-cheng, DPP legislator Lin Cho-shui, NTU law
professor Lin Tzu-yi, lawyer Fan Kuang-chun, former KMT legislator
Hung Tung-kuei, New Party (NP) legislative whip Hau Lung-bin, painter
Liang Tan-feng, NTU economics professor Chen Tien-chi, United
Microelectronics Group chairman Tsao Hsing-che.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN ENCOURAGES MEMBERS TO REGAIN POLITICAL POWER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Aug. 4 (CNA)
(By Alice Liang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lien Chan, chairman of the Republic
of China's opposition party Kuomintang, on Friday urged KMT members
at the KMT's US headquarters in San Francisco to maintain party unity
and reclaim political power in the next presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lien said on the third day of his US visit that the KMT, which
lost to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the March 18 ROC
presidential election, has not lost its ideals and will not shy away
from its goals. He added that the KMT will regain power in the next
election three years from now.</P>
      <P>Lien is the first KMT Chairman to visit the United States and the
KMT's US headquarters. He also visited a memorial hall dedicated to
founder of the KMT and father of the ROC, Sun Yet-sen. He said that
he will follow Sun's against-all-odds spirit to reform the KMT and
prepare for its comeback.</P>
      <P>Lien added that the KMT has been actively promoting party reform,
saying that in the future, it will be a party filled with freedom,
democracy, and creativity.</P>
      <P>He went on to question the DPP government's ruling abilities,
pointing out that the DPP's public approval rating has dropped by
more than 20 percent over the past two months. He criticized the DPP
government as being "unpredictable and incompetent."</P>
      <P>Lien donated a wooden board with morale-boosting inscriptions to
the KMT's headquarters in San Francisco. He emphasized that overseas
Chinese people and the KMT are "as close as flesh and blood," adding
that they have to cooperate in order to win the next presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Many of the overseas Chinese and KMT members said that Lien's
speech and actions had strengthened their morale, adding that they
will work hard to help the KMT regain power.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The country's first group of
conscripts for alternative service began to receive basic
military training at Chengkungling, a military training base in
central Taiwan, on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The 1,800 young conscripts will receive 39 days of basic
training in shooting, patriotic education, combat expertise and
physical training at Chengkungling before they are distributed to
various social service positions according to their specialties.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Chang Po-ya presided over the opening ceremony
of the special training program. Chang encouraged all young
conscripts to cultivate a service-oriented attitude and
law-abiding spirit in preparation for taking up new social service
positions.</P>
      <P>After two years of joint planning by the Ministry of National
Defense and the Ministry of the Interior, the Republic of China
began to implement an "alternative service" conscription
system this year. Although many Western countries have long adopted
such a system, the ROC is the first Asian country to
implement it for better use of its manpower resources.</P>
      <P>A total of 5,000 young men have been selected for mandatory
service in social work rather than in the military this year.
Similar training programs for the second and third groups of those
conscripts will begin in September and November, respectively.</P>
      <P>Positions available for the young conscripts include those in
the police and firefighting forces, as well as that of environmental
protection worker, or nurse for the elderly and handicapped. Some
conscripts will work for reconstruction projects in the 921
earthquake-stricken areas in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>After the Chengkungling training program, the conscripts will
receive further training in professional skills related to their
future work, in addition to first aid skills and legal
regulations.</P>

(By Alice Liang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The July consumer price index (CPI)
increased by 1.45 percent, indicating that domestic commodity prices
continue to be on the rise moderately, according to the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>From January to July, the CPI was up 1.17 percent while the
agency expected inflation to rise 1.77 for the whole year. The
wholesale price index (WPI) in July registered a year-on-year
increase of 2.67 percent.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Central Bank of China (CBC) said that domestic
consumer prices are facing moderate inflationary pressure because of
recent increases in international commodity prices and decreases in
the price of local fruits and vegetables. However, the officials
added that international oil prices have declined in recent weeks, a
trend that is expected to help stabilize domestic commodity rate.</P>
      <P>Due to the lower international oil prices, import commodity
prices went down by 11.21 percent in July in the first registered
drop since April.</P>
      <P>The officials said that Taiwan-based industries have experienced
a continued drop in labor costs since 1995, another factor that has
also helped stabilize domestic commodity rates.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HIGHLIGHTS OF INTERVIEW WITH ROC VICE PRESIDENT (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 6 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette Lu
spoke of constitutional amendment and Taiwan's foreign and domestic
affairs, as well as the development of cross-Taiwan Strait relations,
in a recent interview with CNA. Following are highlights of the
interview:</P>
      <P>Q: Your recent remarks on the Pachang River incident might have
caused some misunderstanding. Do you have any further clarification?</P>
      <P>A: My comments were made in reply to questions raised by the
media. But some people exaggerated them as indicating a "division"
between President Chen Shui-bian and myself. In fact, I usually have
dinner with Chen on Fridays. It is actually the speculation about my
relations with him that represents a misunderstanding.</P>
      <P>In my talks with reporters, I said that a state affairs
conference should be convened to discuss all subjects relating to
domestic and foreign affairs, as well as constitutional revision to
resolve the existing embarrassing situation under which the premier,
who is not elected by public vote, has strong power, while the
president is not allowed to intervene, even though he may want to air
his views and take charge of the business.</P>
      <P>Q: The present constitutional system has created some political
bottlenecks and many different opinions have been voiced. What is
your opinion?</P>
      <P>A: Now that the Legislative Yuan has closed the general
interpellation session, I hope that different views can be voiced, or
that a public poll can be held to analyze the results. The scholars
should also study this issue thoroughly. A television station said
the other day that I hope to assume the premiership. In fact, I have
no interest in that at all, because it does not comply with the
constitutional system.</P>
      <P>Q: What do you want to do most as vice president?</P>
      <P>A: I am doing my job as a "promoter of conscientious business." I
do whatever I think I have to do. For instance, I went to see the
bereaved families of the victims of the Pachang River incident.
Wherever there is a problem, the people with power must be there.
They must be on the frontline because "wherever there is fire, they
have to fight the fire."</P>
      <P>Q: Is President Chen's plan to convene a roundtable meeting with
party leaders designed to find ways to resolve the constitutional
problem facing the new government?</P>
      <P>A: Listening to different opinions is a normal political
practice, but a single meeting is unlikely to resolve all problems.
The roundtable meeting, like the projected supra-party committee, is
a prelude to a state affairs conference. The ultimate goal is to
formulate a good Constitution.</P>
      <P>Q: But the Kuomintang seems to be less enthusiastic about the
roundtable meeting. What is your view?</P>
      <P>A: The Kuomintang's attitude is understandable, as it has just
become the opposition after holding power for a long time. President
Chen should display more sincerity to indicate his respect toward the
party.</P>
      <P>Q: Do your previous remarks indicate that the constitutional
dispute should be resolved through revisions to the Constitution?</P>
      <P>A: Regarding constitutional revision or formulating the
Constitution, I have no ideas. The best way is to hear views from
relevant quarters. The unresolved problems must be resolved before
next year's election of Legislative Yuan members.</P>
      <P>Q: As the Democratic Progressive Party holds only 30 percent of
the seats in the Legislative Yuan, is it better to amend the
Constitution now or after the elections?</P>
      <P>A: That is hard to say. There are two sorts of suggestions. The
first suggestion is to do it after the election, while the second
suggestion is to amend the Constitution now and let the voters
examine the results. Anyway, the next round of constitutional
amendments and the state affairs conference must be conducted with
sound planning.

    <HEADLINE>HIGHLIGHTS OF INTERVIEW WITH ROC VICE PRESIDENT (II)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 6 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Q: What kinds of government problems came to light in the Pachang
River incident?</P>
      <P>A: The incident was just a "trigger." If it had not happened,
something else would have occurred, sooner or later. The Kuomintang
handed over its 55-year-old ruling power, but the departments of the
government are still occupied by old faces. The old bureaucratic
system should be held responsible for the Pachang River incident.</P>
      <P>Q: Do you plan to arrange more speeches to spell out your ideals?</P>
      <P>A: I give speeches often. But at present I plan to focus my
attention on reconstruction of the earthquake-stricken areas. In
fact, I visited the hardest-hit areas recently, at the instruction of
the president. Basically, post-quake rehabilitation work has been
affected by two factors.</P>
      <P>In the first ten months after last September's temblor, the
government spent the first three months in rescue operations, and the
reconstruction work was then delayed by the campaigns for the March
18 presidential election, the hospitalization of Premier Tang Fei and
the general interpellation session. Concrete construction projects
will not be completed until the end of August.</P>
      <P>The second factor is that during the presidential election, local
political forces threw their support behind five different
candidates. Friction in the aftermath of the election also affected
reconstruction work. I am now pushing a plan to build fairly-priced
houses in disaster areas.</P>
      <P>Q: What is your opinion on the development of cross-strait
relations?</P>
      <P>A: Since winning the presidential election, Chen has been
extremely mild in his posture toward mainland China, and Beijing
leaders have found no excuse for using force against Taiwan. But
Jiang Zemin may be anxious to realize political negotiations with
Taiwan, as he is apparently to relinquish his presidency in 2001.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I want to remind the public that "our challenge has
just started, and the crisis is not over yet." Mainland China's
military intimidation was nothing but a boast, because the world will
not tolerate a mainland Chinese military attack on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Beijing will induce Taiwan to engage in negotiations, and Taiwan
has no ability or excuse to resist it. Why do I think a state affairs
conference must be convened? Because we have to discuss who is
qualified for the talks, to what extent he will be authorized, and
how much bargaining power we have.</P>
      <P>Q: What kind of posture should the government take in its bid to
join the United Nations?</P>
      <P>A: I feel that Taiwan joining the United Nations is not a dream,
but rather a kind of truth and justice. According to the various
charters of the UN and their spirit, Taiwan's failure to enter the
world body is the fault of the UN. The world refuses to allow Taiwan
to join the UN, only because of Beijing's opposition. This is a
violation of international justice.</P>
      <P>Q: Are you willing to visit mainland China?</P>
      <P>A: I am very willing, as I said before the presidential election.
I visited there in 1990.</P>
      <P>Q: Some people suggest that Academia Sinica President Lee
Yuan-tseh is a good choice to serve as cross-strait emissary. Some
speculate that he might have already made contact with Beijing
officials during his recent foreign trip. What is your view?</P>
      <P>A: I have no comment on this matter. I am not well acquainted
with Lee.</P>
      <P>Q: You said before that female voices should be added to
cross-strait affairs. Do you have any concrete plan?</P>
      <P>A: The president has already realized it. Both the Mainland
Affairs Council chair and the Government Information Office chief are
female, and I also occasionally voice my opinions.

    <HEADLINE>HIGHLIGHTS OF INTERVIEW WITH ROC VICE PRESIDENT (III)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 6 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Q: In addition to the UN, we are also trying hard to join the
World Trade Organization and the World Health Organization. What name
should we use when we seek to join international organizations? Do
you agree with the name "Taiwan Republic of China" as mentioned by
former President Lee Teng-hui?</P>
      <P>A: This is also a subject which should be discussed in a state
affairs conference. I think the new government should work out a new
foreign policy, a more strategic policy. It is important to cement
our relations with diplomatic allies. Therefore, I strongly support
President Chen's foreign trip.</P>
      <P>In the past, we considered our relations with the United States
to be more important than those with Asian and European countries. We
should now turn more attention to relations with our neighbors,
starting with Japan and South Korea. I think that Taiwan, Japan and
South Korea should work to enhance relations to establish to the
point where we can establish a free trade zone.</P>
      <P>I have learned something from the European Union. We should work
to form an Asian Union. Such a union will not be designed to counter
the power of mainland China, as mainland China will also be allowed
to become a member. This may also help us deter military conflicts,
because war must be avoided for the sake of economic interest.</P>
      <P>Q: What is the emphasis of your work for the immediate future?</P>
      <P>A: I hope that reconstruction work in the quake-stricken areas
will have had a good start before the first anniversary of the Sept.
21 quake. After that, I may pay more attention to women's welfare.</P>
      <P>I recently received women's representatives from all the island's
counties and cities to pave the way for convening a national women's
conference, with focus to be given to the protection of women's
safety, women's employment, and assistance for needy parents.</P>
      <P>Q: What score you will give over your performance as vice
president in the past two months?</P>
      <P>A: I have never given scores for myself, as it is too subjective.
I also do not care about results of public opinion polls. But I care
about votes, because at the moment of voting, a vote represents a
heart.</P>
      <P>I desire nothing. I am not thinking about getting reelected four
years from now. Therefore, I just do the things that I think are
meaningful. I work conscientiously with a dedicated spirit. Regarding
scores, let God write them.</P>
      <P>Q: What is your impression since assuming the vice presidency?</P>
      <P>A: I have encountered lots of challenges in my life, but the
current one is unprecedented in my experience, in terms of its
severity and cruelty.</P>
      <P>I think the public has gradually come to know Annette Lu. In the
past, many people did not know me, and they created an unreal Annette
Lu. In fact, Annette remains Annette. My style is always the same.</P>
      <P>The most wonderful thing about Taiwan society today is that it
has developed into a "very healthy organic entity." This can be seen
by the public's furious reaction to the loss of four lives in the
Pachang River incident. In comparison, people in mainland China do
not get angry over huge losses of lives in floods, because they have
become numbed.</P>
      <P>Our society has developed into a healthy organic entity. We can
call it a healthy organic entity because it is able to adapt to a

    <TEXT>
      <P>One day after torrential rain warnings were
lifted, Taiwan is expected to be influenced by the outward spiraling
cirrus of a typhoon, said the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The island is basking in sunshine on Sunday, as a southeasterly
airstream which packed with heavy humidity and triggered torrential
rain in central and southern Taiwan has passed Taiwan, with the
temperature hovering between 33 and 34 degrees Celsius, said the CWB.</P>
      <P>However, the outward spiraling cirrus clouds of a typhoon are
expected to reach Taiwan on Monday evening, bringing more rain to
northern, northeastern and central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A storm warning for mariners is expected to be issued as early as
Sunday night due to Typhoon Jelawat, the eighth typhoon in the
Western Pacific this year. Jelawat was centered 1,000 kilometers to
the east of Taiwan on Sunday at noon, and was moving westward at a
pace of 15 kilometers per hour, said the CWB, adding that the storm
is not likely to reach Taiwan, said the CWB.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition New Party legislative whip
said on Sunday that he expects President Chen Shui-bian will exchange
views on the general budget with the party whips of the various
political parties in the Legislative Yuan when he meets with them on
Monday.</P>
      <P>Lai Shih-pao, New Party (NP) whip, said that President Chen and
the opposition officials will probably discuss the overall budget,
and whether to increase government expenditures or borrowing,
although he added that the NP believes that both ideas will not work.</P>
      <P>Lai also said that his party will do everything possible to
screen the special funds in the overall budget, adding that the NP's
attitude will not be to oppose such expenditures simply to cause
gridlock.</P>
      <P>Monday's meeting will be held at the Taipei Guest House, with Hsu
Tien-tsai of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, He Chih-hui of
the Kuomintang, Lai Shih-pao of the NP, as well as Legislative Yuan
President Wang Jin-pyng, Vice President Jao Eng-chi, Premier Tang
Fei, and Vice Premier Chang Chun-hsiung expected to attend.</P>
      <P>Lai said that he would also suggest that President Chen review
the "no haste, be patient" policy toward investment in the mainland,
and undertake careful planning on the "three direct links" -- direct
trade, post and transport with the mainland.</P>
      <P>On the issue of a proposed roundtable meeting of various
political parties, he said that the NP will not attend the meeting if
it is simply an attempt to bury the political hatchet drawn during
the presidential election.</P>
      <P>The DPP won the March presidential election, ending the
Kuomintang's more than five-decade grip on political power. But the
KMT remains dominant in the 225-seat legislature, prompting the DPP
administration to plan a roundtable meeting to facilitate relations
between the executive and legislative branches.</P>

    <DATELINE>San  Francisco, Aug. 5 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT) was defeated by
itself, rather than by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the
March 18 presidential election, said KMT Chairman Lien Chan on
Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a dinner party attended by 1,500 KMT officials and
members residing in the San Francisco Bay area, the visiting KMT head
said that his party lost out in the March 18 election mainly because
of division among its rank-and-file membership.</P>
      <P>Lien, who stood for the KMT in the presidential race, got 23.1
percent of the votes, while his former comrade James Soong, who split
from the party and ran against Lien as an independent, won 36.8
percent of votes. Chen Shui-bian of the DPP won the race with 39.3
percent of votes.</P>
      <P>Lien also cast blame for his election setback on the KMT's
deviation from public opinion in making policy, its loss of vision
after ruling Taiwan for more than five decades, and its neglect of
young voters.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT spokesman Jason Hu, who accompanied Lien on the
visit, said it was too early to weigh the possibility of joining
hands with People First Party, formed by Soong after the March 18
election. He said that the top agenda for the party now is to win
next year's legislative and local government elections.</P>
      <P>Lien and his entourage arrived in San Francisco on Aug. 3. Their
trip is seen as part of efforts to rally the KMT's supporters.</P>
      <P>Judging by the huge attendance at Friday's dinner party, Lien was
successful in reclaiming the allegiance of the party's members living
in the Bay area.</P>
      <P>Lien and his entourage will leave San Francisco for Los Angeles
on Sunday afternoon, continuing his tour of the United States and
Canada.</P>

      <P>The Youth Department of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is planning to hold a cross-strait
youth summit to cultivate political awareness in the younger
generation, a DPP official said on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Wang Ming-yuan, director of the DPP Youth Department, said that

Taipei and Beijing by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>He also said that his department also plans to set up a "shadow

    <HEADLINE>PUBLIC IN FAVOR OF ROUNDTABLE MEETING FOR RECONCILIATION: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 81.44 percent of people in Taiwan are
in favor of a roundtable meeting of the major political parties to
help smooth out relations between the government's executive and
legislative branches, a poll showed on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by Eastern Multimedia Co., surveyed people
over 18 years of age around the island between Aug. 3 and Aug.4.
Effective samples totaled 1,088, and the poll carries a margin of
error of 3 percent.</P>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) defeated the Kuomingtang
(KMT) in the March presidential election, ending the latter's
five-decade-old grip on political power. But the KMT remains dominant
in the legislature, prompting the government to plan a roundtable
meeting to smooth out relations between the executive and legislative
branches.</P>
      <P>On the clashes between the executive and legislative branches,
30.33 percent of the people said that they have been caused by the
legislature, some 12.32 percent said that the executive branch is to
blame, while 27.76 percent believe that both branches should take the
blame.</P>
      <P>Some 54.96 percent of the poll's respondents said that they have
confidence in the new government's ability to solve the political and
economic problems of the nation, while 30.89 percent said they had no
confidence. Additionally, some 76.38 percent are in favor of party
reconciliation, the survey said.</P>
      <P>The poll also showed that 71.32 percent of the public are in
favor of convening an interparty task force to map out a new
cross-strait policy.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait relations have been in limbo since former President
Lee Teng-hui defined ties between the two sides as "special
state-to-state" in July 1999. Relations between the two sides were
further strained after the election of Chen Shui-bian of the
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, although Chen has
extended conciliatory gestures since his election.</P>
      <P>Hung Chao-nan, a KMT official, said that political parties are
all rivals to each other, and the opposition parties must monitor the
administration. He expressed the hope that the nation will return to
party politics, and that the Legislative Yuan will become the center
of national policy formation.</P>
      <P>Peng Shao-chin of the DPP said that the poll shows that the
public wants political stability, party reconciliation, and
cross-strait peace. Peng added that people still have confidence in
the new administration.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>One hundred couples across the island who
have been married for more than 60 years are celebrating their
diamond wedding anniversary on Chinese Valentine's Day, a spokesman
for the committee organizing the celebration said on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman for the Republic of China Senior Citizens' Club
said that the long-lasting marriages serve as an example for modern
society, in which mounting divorce rates prevail among the younger
generation.</P>
      <P>He said that the organizing committee had originally planned to
select 100 Taiwan couples with marriages greater than 50 years of age
to take part in the celebrations. However, the committee found 100
couples that have already been married for over 60 years, he said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the club has decided to hold a diamond wedding
anniversary celebration for them, he said.</P>
      <P>Among the top 100 couples selected, Lin Hao and Lin Cheng-chien
have been married for 79 years and seven months, the longest-lasting
marriage on the island. The couple now lives together with their
descendants of five generations.</P>
      <P>Asked about their secret for maintaining a long marriage, Mr. Lin
said that there is no secret method, but that he always showed his
concern for his wife.</P>
      <P>Although the marriage has not exactly been a continuous romantic
love story, the fact that they stood by each other throughout eight
decades is an example for younger generations to follow, he said.</P>

      <P>Due to unstable weather conditions
influenced by the outward spiraling cirrus of Typhoon Jelawat,
flights from Taiwan bound for Okinawa were canceled on Monday, air
traffic sources reported.</P>
      <P>China Airlines and Japan Asia Airways canceled all three of
Monday's Taipei-Okinawa flights as Jelawat, the eighth typhoon in the
Western Pacific this year, was looming somewhere east of Okinawa and
moving slowly in a westerly direction toward Taiwan, said the
sources.</P>
      <P>According to the Central Weather Bureau (CWB), Jelawat was
centered 1,000 kilometers to the east of Taiwan on Sunday at noon and
was moving westward at a pace of 15 kilometers per hour, but it began
slowing on Monday. Consequently, the issuance of a storm warning for
mariners, previously expected to be made Monday morning, was delayed
further.</P>
      <P>Jelawat's speed reduced from 15 km per hour to 11 km per hour at
around noon on Monday, thereby postponing its influence on the Taiwan
area, noted CWB weathermen.</P>
      <P>The chances for torrential rains on the island also decreased,
with only southern Taiwan forecast to be hit by occasional showers on
Monday and Tuesday, said the weathermen, adding that temperatures
should remain high islandwide, hovering between 32 and 34 degrees

    <HEADLINE>MACAO OFFERS 30-DAY VISA-FREE STAYS FOR TAIWANESE TOURISTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>To further attract more Taiwanese tourists,
Macao on Monday extended the length of visa-free stays for visitors
from Taiwan from 20 days to 30 days, reported the Macao Tourism
Bureau.</P>
      <P>The new 30-day visa-free treatment, taking effect on Monday, will
allow more Taiwanese tourists to visit Macao for a longer period of
time, particularly during this August when a gourmet food festival is
being held in the former Portuguese enclave.</P>
      <P>The number of Taiwanese tourists visiting Macao has substantially
increased since the visa-free policy was implemented and is expected
to further surge as Taiwan and Macao's airlines have agreed to add
300 flights between the two sides this summer, said officials from
the Macao Tourism Bureau.</P>
      <P>In addition to the food festival, the Ghost Festival, a
traditional Chinese festival devoted to bribing wandering souls of
the afterworld, is scheduled to kick off in Macao on Aug. 13. Also,
an international fireworks competition is slated for early September,
with contestants from more than 10 countries participating, the

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN SCIENTISTS DEVELOPING NEW LIGHT BULB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  7  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian scientists at Australian
National University in Canberra are developing a revolutionary light
bulb capable of shining for 50 years.</P>
      <P>Professor Chennupati Jagadish, the head of the research team,
told reporters on Sunday that the new bulb uses light-emitting
diodes, or LEDs, that produce white light. He said a diode producing
ultra-violet light is coated with phosphor, and the phosphor glows
white.</P>
      <P>But the light producing part of a modern LED is only about one
square millimeter and is not strong enough for home or office
lighting. The light must be 100 times stronger in order to be of
practical use, he noted.</P>
      <P>He said a possible solution could be to bundle from 50 to 100
white LEDs -- now worth about A$10 (US$6.30) each, adding that mass
production would cut the price of the light bulbs.</P>
      <P>Bulbs made from white LEDs would be more environmentally friendly
and far cheaper to run than conventional ones as they would reduce
power consumption by a factor of 10, he noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WANG CHO-CHUN TO HEAD TAIPEI CITY POLICE HEADQUARTERS</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wang Cho-chun, currently the director of
Taichung City Police Headquarters, will become the director of Taipei
City Police Headquarters, it was announced on Monday.</P>
      <P>Wang will fill the vacancy left by Wang Chin-wang, who will be
promoted to director-general of the National Police Administration.
Ting Yuan-chin, who was the original NPA head, resigned over the
river rescue fiasco earlier this month.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, in announcing Wang's new
position, said he hopes Wang will continue to work toward meeting the
high expectations of Taipei residents for a better and safer living
environment.</P>
      <P>Wang said he has been living away from Taipei for a long time and
will therefore need some time to fully grasp the situation and decide
the future direction of Taipei city's police force.</P>
      <P>Wang said that after he assumes his new post, he will first
visit with rank-and-file police officers to learn what their needs
and concerns are.</P>
      <P>He also stated that he will make social order and security his
top priority, saying that Taipei Mayor Ma attaches special importance
to the issue.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, he said he will be strict about internal discipline
and the auditing of the police officers.</P>
      <P>Wang, whose specialty is criminal cases, said that he feels some
regret about leaving Taichung, where some major crimes remain
unsolved, including the high-profile case of a pregnant woman being
shot in a downtown department store and the murder of the wife of an
American businessman.</P>
      <P>In addition, Wang pointed out that the problem of an insufficient
police force in Taichung has yet to be resolved and that police
relations with the people at the grassroots level are not ideal.</P>
      <P>Wang, 49, will become the youngest director to head Taipei City
Police Headquarters. After graduating from Central Police University
in 1975, he served in various rank-and-file jobs on the police force
before working his way up to deputy director of the Criminal
Investigation Bureau in 1994, and then director of Taichung City
Police Headquarters in 1996.</P>
      <P>Wang has followed in his father Wang Lu-chiao's footsteps. The
elder Wang served as the top police officer on the Taipei police
force between 1972 and 1974.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO SPECIAL ENVOY FOR ROC-US DIALOGUE: PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office on Monday denied a
press report that President Chen Shui-bian has appointed Chiou I-jen,
deputy secretary-general of the National Security Council (NSC), as
his special envoy for consultations with the United States.</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times, a Taipei-based Chinese daily, said in a
front-page report that former ROC President Lee Teng-hui's special
envoy with the United States Ding Mou-shih has offered to resign from
his current post as a "senior adviser to the President" because his
"special envoy" role has been replaced by Chiou.</P>
      <P>"The report was wrong," Deputy Secretary-General to the President
Chen Tze-nan said, adding that President Chen respects the Republic
of China's existing administrative system and would not name any
special envoy or "emissary" for dialogue with any other country.</P>
      <P>Under the present system, Chen said, the ROC's representative
office in Washington, D.C. is fully authorized to take charge of
Taiwan's relations with the United States.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen confirmed that Ding, a veteran career
diplomat, really has sent a letter to President Chen expressing his
intention to resign from the "senior adviser" post.</P>
      <P>"I think President Chen will respect Ding's personal desire,"
Chen said.</P>
      <P>Ding once served as the ROC's foreign affairs minister and
its representative or de facto ambassador to the United States.
During his stint as the NSC secretary-general, Ding traveled to the
United States annually to hold closed-door meetings with President
Bill Clinton's senior national security advisers on cross-Taiwan
Strait issues and the delicate Taipei-Washington-Beijing relations.</P>
      <P>Ding's role as a special security envoy with the United
States began in 1996 when mainland China test-fired missiles and
conducted live-fire war games in waters near Taiwan in an attempt to
influence the result of the ROC's first-ever presidential election.
Amid escalating tension in the Taiwan Strait, the Clinton
administration took the initiative to forge a high-level
communication mechanism with the ROC in the absence of formal
diplomatic ties</P>
      <P>Then-ROC President Lee assigned Ding to travel to New York
for behind-the-scenes meetings with senior US officials on
Taiwan Strait security affairs. Those meetings were believed to
have help stabilize the cross-strait situation, and such
high-level ROC-US dialogue mechanism has since been maintained.
Ding traveled to the United States once a year to meet senior US
security officials until Lee ended his presidential tenure on
May 20.</P>
      <P>According to the Liberty Times, President Chen has retained Ding
as a "senior adviser to the President" at the recommendation of his
predecessor in view of Ding's role in high-level ROC-US dialogue.</P>
      <P>However, the Liberty Times said, incumbent NSC Deputy
Secretary-General Chiou has gradually taken over Ding's "special
envoy" job since the inauguration of President Chen's
administration.</P>
      <P>For instance, the paper said, Chiou traveled to the United
States in mid-July to meet with US Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky to discuss issues related to Taiwan's accession to the
World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>During that trip, the paper speculated that Chiou might also
hold secret talks with US national security advisers and State
Department officials on the Taiwan Strait situation. The paper said
Chiou's US visit marked a quiet completion of personnel replacement
for the high-level Taipei-Washington dialogue mechanism.</P>
      <P>However, Chiou himself denied the report. "I'm neither President
Chen's special envoy for dialogue with the United States nor the
parallel unit for the ROC government's dialogue mechanism with the
US White House National Security Council," he stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT NEEDED BEFORE OPENING DOOR TO M'LAND CAPITAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  7  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan might open its capital market to
mainland Chinese funds in a prudent and gradual manner only after
carefully considering national security, management control, and
other essential issues, said a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
official on Monday.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Republic of China's opening of its doors to
mainland Chinese capital would have a greater impact on Taiwan
society than the establishment of direct trade, transportation, and
communications links with the mainland, Fu Dong-cheng, director of
the MAC's Department of Economic Affairs, said in-depth and
comprehensive assessments by all agencies concerned will have to be
conducted before the government decides on the issue.</P>
      <P>Fu pointed out that Taiwan currently bans the entry of mainland
capital in principle, but grants permission to a few applicants on a
case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>The stakes are high, particularly when mainland capital goes into
Taiwan's high technology industries and financial markets, Fu added.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that once mainland capital is permitted to
enter Taiwan, mainland Chinese handlers of those funds, as well as
their spouses and children, will also be allowed to come, saying this
will immediately result in the appearance of related education,
marriage, insurance, and health care issues.</P>
      <P>Fu made the remarks at a hearing hosted by New Party Legislator
Lai Shih-pao at the Legislative Yuan on the topic of whether it is
safe or not to allow mainland Chinese capital into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lai said that Taiwan's opening of its capital markets to mainland
Chinese funds should not be a forbidden issue, but added that the ROC
government should come up with a control task force to monitor the
flow of this capital in and out of the country.</P>
      <P>Lai said Taiwan should at least establish an "economic security
task force," manned by officials from all related agencies, to
monitor the applications, screening, control, and verification of the
activities of the mainland funds.</P>
      <P>Due to the different "political significance" behind mainland
Chinese capital and capital from other countries and areas, Taiwan
must come up with proper legislation governing mainland Chinese
capital so as to make the management of such transactions transparent
and legitimate, Lai added.</P>

      <P>Formosa Gasoline, an affiliate of Formosa
Plastics Group (FPG), is going to break the uniformity of gasoline
and diesel prices islandwide when it comes onto the market this
September.</P>
      <P>Wang Yun-ming, vice secretary-general of the Ministry of Economic

a license from the Energy Commission this week to operate its
naphtha cracking plant in the offshore Mailiao Industrial Complex in
Yunlin County, paving the way for an end to the state-run
Chinese Petroleum Corporation's decades-old monopoly on oil sales in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This means that each gas station will now be able to decide for
itself the price of its gasoline and diesel.</P>
      <P>Consumers will likely be able to purchase fuel more cheaply in
northern Taiwan than in other areas because of the keener level of
competition there.

liberalization is well-known in South Africa. He added that he was
glad to have experienced it and exchanged views with the Control
Yuan, the ROC's highest watchdog body.</P>
      <P>Lu told the South African visitor that she has long been

    <HEADLINE>JULY TWO-WAY TRADE HITS NEW HIGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's two-way foreign trade continued to
gain momentum in July with both exports and imports hitting new
single-month records, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) reported on
Monday.</P>
      <P>The country's export trade totaled US$13.60 billion in July, up a
whopping 36.5 percent over that posted in the same month of the
previous year, while import trade amounted to US$13.47 billion, a
sparkling increase of 41.9 percent, MOF officials noted.</P>
      <P>July's brilliant performance marked another two-digit monthly
growth in foreign trade -- the 10th month in a row -- cementing the
fact that Taiwan's foreign trade has been on a tear in recent months.</P>
      <P>With brisk performance in July, usually a slow month for foreign
trade, MOF officials predicted that Taiwan's annual growth of exports
for the year 2000 is expected to top 20 percent, while that of
imports will advance by an even larger margin of 25 to 26 percent.</P>
      <P>The MOF officials attributed the remarkable growth in export
trade in the first seven months of this year mainly to the ongoing
economic recovery in the Asia-Pacific region and the steadily
expanding economies in Europe and America.</P>
      <P>Between Jan. 1 and July 31, exports of electronics,
communications, machinery, steel and optical products as a whole grew
an annual 32.9 percent, while those of traditional manufacturing
industries and agricultural products edged up 9.8 and 18.5 percent,
respectively, compared to the previous year.</P>
      <P>During the same period, imports of capital goods surged 44.6
percent compared to the same period in 1999, while those of
agricultural and industrial raw materials increased an annual 35.1
percent, MOF officials added.</P>
      <P>The officials predicted that continuously expanding exports will
fuel further growth in imports and domestic investment in the latter
months of this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO INFLUENCE MAINLAND CHINA: EX-ROC PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Aug.  6  (CNA)
(By Tseng Chih-yuan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former ROC President Lee Teng-hui has
said in a recent interview with Newsweek that Taiwan is creating a
new culture which he believes will eventually influence mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Lee said although Taiwan is a small place vis-s-vis mainland
China, it is developing a new culture intending to influence the
Chinese mainland.</P>
      <P>"It may take a period of 'two to three generations' for the new
Taiwan culture to influence the mainland. I believe this scenario
will certainly take place," the outspoken former leader of the
Republic of China said.</P>
      <P>Touching on mainland China's reform programs, Lee said
"globalization" was taboo in mainland China three years ago. But,
today, the mainland leaders have begun to promote globalization. Lee
said he thinks mainland China will continue its reform path. But it
will take time for the mainland to complete its ambitious reform
programs.</P>
      <P>Lee further said it is important for the United States to
continue leading mainland China into the international community by
adopting an "engagement" policy.</P>
      <P>Turning to relations across the Taiwan Strait, Lee said Taiwan
is bound to adjust its trade policy toward the mainland after both
sides of the strait are admitted to the World Trade Organization
(WTO) in the near future.</P>
      <P>Lee said Taiwan's agricultural industry will certainly face a
serious challenge after its WTO accession as prices for
many mainland Chinese agricultural products are only half
or one-third of those for Taiwan-grown ones.</P>
      <P>Taiwan must also adjust its current "go slow, be patient" policy
toward investment in mainland China following its WTO entry, Lee
said, adding that Taiwan should make a prudent review before making
necessary adjustments.</P>
      <P>Asked about his views on Beijing's restrictions on
Taiwanese investors on the mainland, Lee said when Taiwanese
businesspeople make forays into the mainland market, most of
them are aware that they will face unfavorable treatment there. It's
not uncommon that Beijing leaders use business for political
purposes, he noted.</P>
      <P>Lee, an outspoken critic of mainland China's diplomatic embargo
against Taiwan, said Taiwan must impose some barriers or
adopt some measures in opening cross-strait shipping links.
Otherwise, Lee said he is afraid that Taiwan would become part of
the PRC.</P>
      <P>Taiwan still bans direct cross-strait shipping links. But
merchant ships from Taiwan make an estimated 1,300 visits to the
mainland by making a stopover at Okinawa annually.</P>
      <P>Lee made strenuous efforts to upgrade the ROC's international
profile and break the Beijing-imposed diplomatic isolation during
his 12-year presidential stint. He has retired from public service
since stepping down from the presidency on May 20.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  7 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) decided on Monday to modify current rules so as to impose more
restrictive conditions on visits to mainland China by ranking ROC
government officials.</P>
      <P>The MAC, while screening a draft worked out by the Interior
Ministry, decided to add the new act to current government
regulations regarding mainland visits by people from Taiwan. The new
rules demand that ranking government appointees and officials in
charge of national security and intelligence affairs inform the
Bureau of Entry and Exit of their scheduled retirements two weeks in
advance.</P>
      <P>In cases of early or unscheduled departure from public office,
government departments concerned will be required to report any
resignations to the bureau immediately, and send related documents to
the bureau before the official date that such officials leave their
posts.</P>
      <P>High-level retired government officials planning to visit the
mainland will be asked to submit their applications to the bureau at
least three weeks prior to their slated departure.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Chen Ming-tung admitted that the council's
decision to adopt the act was prompted by the arrest in July by
mainland Chinese authorities of a former ranking National Security
Bureau (NSB) official whose whereabouts remain unknown, despite
efforts by relevant government authorities and lawmakers to rescue
him.</P>
      <P>Pan Hsi-hsien, a former ranking NSB official and a personnel
manager for a Taiwan-invested company in Dongguan, in mainland
China's Guangdong province, was detained by mainland Chinese police
for unknown reasons in late June.</P>
      <P>The news shocked Taiwan, because Pan had headed for mainland
China on June 1, only three days after retiring from the NSB.</P>
      <P>Pan's wife, claiming that his husband had traveled to the
mainland for business purposes only, has asked the semi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) to help rescue Pan through its
connection with the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are intermediary bodies authorized by Taipei

mainland China adopted a "wait-and-see" attitude toward Taiwan after
the Republic of China's March 18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Much to Beijing's surprise, Chen Shui-bian, the standard bearer
of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), won the
presidency in the hotly contested race. The Beijing leadership then
said it would listen to Chen's words and watch his deeds in gauging
changes in Taiwan's internal politics and the DPP-led government's
policy toward the mainland.</P>
      <P>The MAC report said as the new ROC government has repeatedly
held out olive branches to Beijing since its May 20 inauguration,
mainland Chinese authorities have felt the pressure to respond to
Taiwan's goodwill appeal.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the MAC report said mainland China has
adjusted its double-handed strategy toward Taiwan since mid-July. On
the one hand, the report said, mainland China has softened its
rhetoric on Taiwan-related affairs and stepped up efforts to
court various Taiwanese groups, particularly subgroups in the ROC's
Legislative Yuan, or parliament.</P>
      <P>On the other, the report said, Beijing has continued its
diplomatic and military pressure on Taiwan and has also not stopped
its criticism of selected ROC officials for their stances on
cross-strait ties, such as Vice President Annette Lu and MAC
Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the MAC report said, mainland China has
returned to its old path of promoting "peaceful unification" of the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait as the gist of its policy toward
Taiwan. Nevertheless, the report said, Beijing is not expected to
cease its diplomatic embargo and military pressure against
Taiwan in order to force the island into negotiation for
unification.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ENDANGERED SEA BIRD SPECIES SPOTTED IN MATSU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  7  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>At least eight Chinese crested terns,
an endangered sea bird species, have been spotted for the first
time on Taiwan's frontline islands of Matsu, the Cabinet-level
Council of Agriculture (COA) announced on Monday.</P>
      <P>COA officials said as the total world population of Chinese
crested terns falls below 100, the latest discovery has caught the
attention of the international wildlife conservation community.</P>
      <P>The first-ever discovery of the rare bird in the Republic of
China territory came as a surprise, COA officials said.</P>
      <P>According to COA officials, Liang Chieh-teh, a noted Taiwan
nature photographer, first spotted a special sea bird with long
pointed wings and a forked tail in a wildlife reserve on the ROC-held
Matsu Islands in June this year.</P>
      <P>Liang informed the Institute of Zoology of Academia Sinica,
Taiwan's highest academic body, of the discovery, and a sea bird
researcher with the institute then traveled to Matsu for a field
study.</P>
      <P>The Academia Sinica researcher confirmed that the rare bird was
a highly treasured Chinese crested tern. The ROC Wild Bird Society
then informed the International Wild Bird Federation of the new
discovery.</P>
      <P>COA officials said major international wild bird organizations
and heavyweight wild bird researchers from several foreign countries
have expressed interest in the new discovery. Some international
news media have contacted the Lienchiang County Government, which
administers civilian affairs in the Matsu Islands area, for producing
a special film introducing the rare bird.</P>
      <P>COA officials said at least eight Chinese crested terns have so
far been detected in the Matsu Islands wildlife reserve and that
four relevant nests have been discovered in the area.</P>
      <P>The Chinese crested tern was discovered for the first time in
the world in 1863. Over the past 100-plus year, only five groups of
the bird have been recorded. The latest two records documented 10
Chinese crested terns discovered in Thailand in July 1980 and three
discovered in northern mainland China in September 1991.</P>
      <P>COA officials said there are still no detailed records
concerning the bird's natural habitats, outer features and habits.
The bird is listed as an "endangered species" in the World Wild Bird
Red Book.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the Chinese crested tern looks like
the greater crested tern, a rare migrant bird species found in
Taiwan's coastal region. But the Chinese crested tern is smaller
than the greater crested tern.</P>
      <P>COA Vice Chairman Lin Kuo-ching said the discovery of the
Chinese crested tern marks an achievement of Taiwan's wildlife
conservation campaign. "We should continue our efforts in this
regard to ensure our sustainable development," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KINMEN COUNCILORS VISIT MAINLAND FOR DIRECT 'MINI 3 LINKS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Aug. 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Kinmen County Council delegation left for
mainland China on Monday for a fact-finding visit aimed at promoting
an early opening of direct "mini three links" between Taiwan's
outlying islands and mainland China's southeastern port cities.</P>
      <P>As the Republic of China government still bans direct
transportation links across the Taiwan Strait, the delegation had to
traveled to Taipei first and then flew to mainland China's Fujian
province via Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Kinmen, an ROC-held defense outpost, is 150 nautical miles from
Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan, but the shortest distance from Kinmen
to Fujian is only 2.3 kilometers.</P>
      <P>Kinmen County Council Speaker Chen Shui-tsai, leader of the
delegation composed of six councilors and their aides, said the group
will collect first-hand information about mainland China's
preparations for the proposed opening of direct trade, postal and
shipping links (commonly known as mini three links) between Taiwan's
outlying islands and southeastern mainland port cities, such as
Fujian's Xiamen and Fuzhou.</P>
      <P>According to a bill passed by the Legislative Yuan early this
year, three outlying islands -- Kinmen, Penghu and Matsu -- will
be allowed to open direct "mini three links" with southeastern
mainland port cities to help boost the offshore islands' economic
development.</P>
      <P>In line with the bill, the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) is evaluating the feasibility of the proposed opening
of the "mini three links" with a view to maintaining a balance
between national security and practical needs of the offshore
islands.</P>
      <P>Noting that the opening of "mini three links" holds the key to
Kinmen's future economic development, Chen said he hopes the MAC can
give a green light to the liberalization proposal and complete all
necessary preparations as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>During its 10-day visit, the group will visit Fuzhou, Quanzhou
and Xiamen of Fujian province, which lies opposite Taiwan. In
addition to meeting with officials of the three cities, the
delegation will also tour major port facilities and local community
development projects.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONTROL YUAN TO PROBE 'EMISSARY' CASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  7  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Control Yuan said on Monday it has
decided to probe a high-profile "emissary" case involving two
officials of the former Kuomintang government in holding secret
talks with their mainland Chinese counterparts in the early 1990s.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China's highest watchdog body said it has
appointed three Control Yuan members to investigate the "emissary"
case involving Su Chih-cheng, former President Lee Teng-hui's
closest aide, and Cheng Shu-min, a former chairwoman of the
Cabinet-level Council for Cultural Affairs.</P>
      <P>The three Control Yuan members -- Kang Ning-hsiang, Lin Shih-chi
and Lee Shen-yi -- will investigate whether Su and Cheng had
violated the country's Civil Service Law, National Security Law,
Criminal Code and other related regulations, the Control Yuan said.</P>
      <P>"We want to know whether the Presidential Office, the National
Security Council, the National Security Bureau and other relevant
government agencies were aware of the "emissary" decision-making and
enforcement processes," Kang said, adding that the Control Yuan also
hope to know whether government funds had been legally used in
carrying out secret contacts with mainland China during Lee's
presidential stint.</P>
      <P>Kang said the probe is necessary to determine whether any civil
servants and government agencies should be held responsible for any
irregularities or negligence in the case in order to ensure
national security and the well-being of all fellow countrymen.</P>
      <P>News about Su and Cheng holding secret talks with mainland
Chinese representatives in Hong Kong and even several mainland
cities in the early 1990s to forge cross-strait rapprochement was
broken in July, roughly two months after the transfer of the helm of
the country from the KMT to the Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Su, now a deputy head of the Taiwan Research Institute, a
private think tank, and Cheng, chairwoman of the KMT-controlled
China Television Co., had confirmed press reports about their roles
in secret cross-strait contacts in the 1990s, but they declined to go

    <HEADLINE>PFP URGES GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO REDUCE SPENDING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  7  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>People First Party Vice Chairman Chang
Chao-hsiung on Monday urged government agencies to reduce what he
described as their "lavish spending."</P>
      <P>Chang singled out Academia Sinica, Taiwan's highest academic
institution, saying that if this so-called "clear stream" of local
society continues spending lavishly, the PFP will attempt to slash
its budget for next year during legislative screening.</P>
      <P>Chang, who returned from the United States on Sunday after
attending the Republican Party convention, said that he saw "benign
competition among US political parties," which he said has resulted
in the progress of "various systems." However, he added that he still
saw "old thinking" in Taiwan's new government.</P>
      <P>He claimed that "excessive spending by government agencies and
schools" is carried out in order to use up their budget allocation
for fear that if they do not, their budgets will be cut the following
year. Chang urged the government to examine its method of budget
allocation in order to put an end to such spending.</P>
      <P>The former medical doctor also said it is worth promoting the
environmental protection industry at a time when the nation hopes to
increase its national competitiveness. He also claimed that most of
this industry is controlled by gangster-related groups.</P>
      <P>Chang said the people will see if the new government has the
courage to wipe out "the gangsters in this industry."</P>
      <P>He also revealed that the PFP will suggest at an upcoming
interparty round table meeting that the new government review the
broker system for foreign laborers, because it has "caused many
problems in society."</P>
      <P>He said that under the current broker system, foreign laborers
and their employers have to repeatedly pay agent fees. In addition,
he further claimed that government regulations stipulate that foreign
laborers must return to their home countries every two years, which
he said means employers are always short of qualified laborers and
that some foreign laborers abscond when their contracts are due to
expire.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REASSESSMENT OF NEW NUKE PLANT TO BE COMPLETED SOON: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 7 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei on Monday told anti-nuclear
legislators, experts, and scholars that a reassessment committee's
report on the continued construction of Taiwan's fourth nuclear power
plant will be completed "in the near future."</P>
      <P>Tang received an 11-person delegation that included Chen
Mo-shing, director of the Energy Systems Research Center at the
University of Texas at Arlington, legislators Liao Hsueh-kuang and Ke
Chien-ming, anti-nuclear groups, and others to exchange opinions on
the cost-effectiveness of various power generation methods,
alternatives for Taiwan, pollution issues, and comparative studies
with other countries.</P>
      <P>Tang said that there would have been no room for discussion if
the government had simply followed the laws set by the Legislative
Yuan. However, he added that the new government decided to reassess
the construction project because it is considered "a major issue"
that should be discussed fairly and openly.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that anyone -- whether for or against nuclear
power -- is welcome to speak out freely during the re-evaluation
process, and that detailed minutes of the discussions will be made
public so that the entire process is transparent.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant was halfway through its
construction when controversy over whether the plant should continue
to be built prompted the Ministry of Economics Affairs to organize an
ad hoc committee of scholars and experts to re-evaluate the project.</P>
      <P>Chen, a member of the committee, espouses the use of alternative
fuels such as liquefied natural gas to generate electricity for
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that the fourth nuclear plant project was approved by the
Legislative Yuan in 1993, Tang had said earlier that the government
has to re-evaluate the project in light of the issues of
environmental protection, security problems, and the island's strong
anti-nuclear movement.</P>
      <P>Construction work that has not been started has been put on hold
pending the reassessment committee's report, which is expected to be
delivered in September.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Chang Chun-hsiung urged the anti-nuclear groups to
make use of more persuasion and less emotion when making their
arguments.</P>

coming to Hong Kong for illicit prostitution, according to
official statistics compiled by the immigration office.</P>
      <P>The statistics showed that the number of female travelers who

900 in 1997, to 1,700 in 1998, 1,900 in 1999, and 1,200 in the first

    <HEADLINE>KMT WELCOMES ROUNDTABLE MEETING CALLED BY PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 7 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng
said on Monday that the KMT is happy that President Chen Shui-bian
has decided to hold a multiparty roundtable meeting to discuss major
national issues with the heads of the opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Lin said the KMT, the former ruling party which shifted central
government power to the Democratic Progressive Party on May 20, would
be willing to take part in such a meeting, as long as it is
beneficial to national security and interests.</P>
      <P>Lin's remarks came just hours before a meeting scheduled between
Chen and Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and representatives from
other major opposition parties -- mainly the People First Party (PFP)
and the New Party -- aimed at paving the way for a much-anticipated
formal roundtable meeting between the different political camps.</P>
      <P>Wang claimed that the gathering slated for Monday evening would
be just a "union," and that no specific topics had been settled for
discussion.</P>
      <P>At the same time, PFP Vice Chairman Chang Chao-hsiung said in a
news conference that the people of Taiwan have placed high
expectations on the roundtable meeting because the pubic is
disappointed with the performance of Chen's administration.</P>
      <P>Chang said he hopes the cross-party roundtable meeting will
proceed smoothly and achieve consensus on important issues of
national concern to display its determination to achieve government
reforms.</P>
      <P>Although PFP Chairman James Soong lost the March 18 presidential
race, Chang said Soong is clearly aware that Taiwan "cannot afford to
lose" and that the PFP head is willing to make a contribution to the
nation through his participation in the meeting.</P>
      <P>As to a scheduled Tuesday meeting between Soong and DPP Chairman
Frank Hsieh, the PFP vice chief described it as a positive thing,
since the transfer of government power, which is a common practice in
a democratic country, does not mean "live or die."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, other sources close to the PFP revealed that Soong and
Hsieh will exchange opinions on major national issues during their
meeting and that Soong may air his policy regarding cross-Taiwan
Strait relations as part of his efforts to demand that the ruling DPP
face the existing problems.</P>
      <P>In the face of the upcoming Beidaihe meeting in mainland China in
which the Beijing leadership is expected to outline mainland China's
future policy toward Taiwan, a PFP department chief said it may be a
crisis or a turning point for Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>If the government still refuses to clarify its stance on mainland
China, the PFP policy planner asserted that it will undermine
Taiwan's interests and added that the PFP, as an effective opposition
party, will express its viewpoints and grave concern over this
critical facet of Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>Out of consideration for the overall national interest, a PFP
spokesman said the party is willing to shrug off political
differences and participate in the roundtable meeting.</P>
      <P>In a related development, KMT Chairman Lien Chan, who had just
returned from a trip to San Francisco, was reluctant to comment on
the establishment on Saturday of a cross-strait task force led by
Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh.</P>
      <P>Lien told reporters that he had no idea about the special ad hoc
group, and described it as an "outlaw" organization.</P>
      <P>Responding to a question as to whether he was planning to visit
mainland China in the near future, Lien said he will consider doing
so at the "proper time" if it can help boost the well-being and
security of the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by ranking party officials, Lien paid a four-day
visit to San Francisco to meet KMT supporters. It was his first trip
to the United States since being defeated by Chen in the March 18
presidential election.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Tourism Bureau is
helping central Taiwan's hard-hit Nantou County to rebuild its
tourism industry after last year's Sept. 21 earthquake made domestic
travelers shy away from the area.</P>
      <P>According to the Nantou County Government, the Tourism Bureau has
begun an advertising campaign to encourage the public to travel to
Nantou and providing transportation and lodging information about the
area. It is also urging travel agencies and government agencies to
organize group tours to the disaster area and provide low-interest
financing to the local tourism industry.</P>
      <P>The county government said that Minister of Transportation and
Communications Yeh Chu-lan is scheduled to accompany the first in a
series of groups of ministry employees to visit Nantou on Aug. 17 to
host the opening ceremony of a county agricultural and specialty
product fair.</P>
      <P>A total of 125,000 ministry employees and workers of state
enterprises under the jurisdiction of the ministry are scheduled to
visit Nantou in five groups to "provide tangible help" to the area's
tourism industry, the county government added.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau, which is a subordinate agency of the Ministry
of Transportation and Communications, also accepted the Nantou County
Government's suggestion to ask the Weather Bureau to refrain from
being overly vague in its reporting, pointing out that phrases such
as "mountainous areas will experience thunderstorms, please beware of
mudslides" can risk ruining the entire area's tourism prospects with
one broad stroke.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S VISA CARD SPENDING HITS NEW HIGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 7 (CNA)
(By Alice Liang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More and more Taiwan consumers are whipping
out their Visa cards when making purchases, as Visa's total turnover
in Taiwan hit a new high in the first half of this year, according to
statistics reported on Monday by Visa International Service
Association.</P>
      <P>Taiwan shoppers charged NT$243.3 billion (US$7.85 billion) on
their Visa cards during the first half of this year, an annual
increase of 17.48 percent, Visa officials said. They forecasted that
total Visa card spending will reach more than NT$500 billion this
year, a new record high for Taiwan and an indication of Visa's
dominance in the island's credit card market.</P>
      <P>Visa International Service Association said that Taiwan's credit
card market has plenty of room to grow, because Taiwan consumers are
used to paying cash for their purchases, with only 10 percent of
consumers using credit cards. In comparison, that figure has reached
23 percent in the United States, 18 percent in Singapore, and 16
percent in Hong Kong, the firm said.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A potential purchaser of the Taipei-based
Independence Evening Post got cold feet at the last minute and asked
on Monday for a postponement on the inking of a buyout contract.</P>
      <P>Wang Shih-chin, a Taipei City councilman from the Democratic
Progressive Party, said on Monday that he needed more time to
reassess the financial health of the paper, and asked that the
singing of a deal, slated originally for Aug. 10, be put on hold for
another 10 to 15 days.</P>
      <P>Wang said his friends had persuaded him to back away from the
deal after he confirmed last week that he had offered to buy the
paper out of respect for the paper's "objectivity" when the island
was ruled by the Kuomintang under martial law.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, given the financial hardships faced by the
press amid the fierce competition posed by the electronic mass media
and the huge capital needed to revitalize the paper, not to mention
the impact of a possible exodus and layoff of workers, Wang said he
needed more time to learn the ramifications of taking over a
high-quality paper.</P>
      <P>Wang, who tried unsuccessfully to set up "The Voice of Taipei"
radio station, is said to be bending over backwards to acquire a
paper to boost his bid for a seat in the Legislative Yuan next year.</P>

      <P>The KMT lost its 55-year grip on power in Taiwan to the

(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The trade union of state-owned Chunghwa
Telecom is planning to stage a street protest on Aug. 16 against the
over-pricing of more-than 289 million shares that the government is
planning to sell in late August.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) approved
on Aug. 4 a plan to auction off 3 percent of the government's stake
in Chunghwa Telecom within two weeks.</P>
      <P>The offered price for each of the shares up for grabs was set at
NT$104 (US$3.35) on Aug. 4 by a share price appraisal committee
comprised of government officials.</P>
      <P>The price provoked anger among Chunghwa Telecom employees, who
said the price is much higher than the NT$60 passed by the
legislature earlier in the year and makes it difficult for them to
afford.</P>
      <P>The Chunghwa Telecom trade union reached a consensus on Monday
that it will take to the streets to seek a satisfactory response from
the MOTC, or demand the resignation of Minister of Transportation and
Communications Yeh Chu-lan.</P>
      <P>Tseng Chih-ming, a high-ranking union official, said the union
had filed two appeals demanding that the MOTC diversify company
employees' subscriptions and continue to protect the rights of those
employees who are concurrently civil servants and laborers, after the
privatization has been completed.</P>
      <P>The auction in late August is part of the first phase of a
privatization plan in which a total of 33 percent of the government's
shares in Chunghwa Telecom will be sold off.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the auction will augment government coffers
by at least NT$30 billion.</P>
      <P>During the first phase of privatization, the government will also
release 13 percent of shares for public subscription in Taiwan, 5
percent for company employees' subscription, and 12 percent for
listing on the New York Stock Exchange. The first phase of
privatization is expected to be completed by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The government plans to release another 33 percent of its shares
in February next year, with a goal of complete privatization by the
end of June.</P>
      <P>The two phases of privatization are expected to raise at least
NT$660 billion for the government.</P>
      <P>At present, Chunghwa Telecom is totally owned by the MOTC and has
total capital of NT$96.48 billion.</P>

(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The eastern Taiwan county of Taitung
held its annual joint civil and military air defense exercises on
Monday to simulate evacuation procedures during enemy air raids or
missile attacks.</P>
      <P>Wanan No. 23 is a series of drills being held throughout Taiwan.
It began in central Taiwan on Aug. 1 and was held in southern Taiwan
on Aug. 4. It is scheduled to be held in the outlying island of
Kinmen on Aug. 16 as well as in northern Taiwan and the islands of
Penghu and Matsu.</P>
      <P>Wanan No. 23 follows the rescue model imposed after last year's
Sept. 21 earthquake and focuses on the operations of each county and
city's coordination centers for civil defense mobilization in order
to improve the public's ability to react. Local garrison forces are
also called in to support and coordinate with civil defenses.</P>
      <P>Monday's drills in Taitung covered only evacuation procedures but
sources said that related units in Taitung County sent
representatives to the southern city of Kaohsiung to observe and
learn from the Aug. 4 drills there in preparation for a return to a
full spectrum of disaster relief exercises next year.</P>
      <P>Kinmen's scheduled drills will mark the first time that the Wanan
series has been held on the island, which is only kilometers away
from the southeastern coast of mainland China.</P>
      <P>According to the Kinmen Police Headquarters, the civil defense
portion of the 20-minute drill will only consist of emergency klaxon
broadcasts, personnel evacuation, and traffic control because of the
sensitivity involved in being in such close proximity to mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Police went on to say that Kinmen has already established a good
foundation from past drills, which have included not only personnel
evacuation, but also firefighting, rescue of the wounded, disaster
shelters, emergency utility repairs, and civil defense mobilization.</P>
      <P>Kinmen police added that a rehearsal will be held on Thursday and
Friday before the real exercise is held.</P>

      <P>Tsai Tung-jung, a leader of the ruling

Monday urged the Japanese Diet to enact a Japanese version of the
United States' Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>He made the appeal while attending a symposium organized by the
supra-party "Japan-ROC Parliamentarians Council" for a visiting
12-member parliamentarian delegation of which he was head.</P>
      <P>Tsai also expressed the hope that Japanese political parties will
follow the American model in supporting a proposal that Taiwan's
future be decided by the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>The symposium was presided over by former Japan Defense Agency
Director-General Sadanori Yamanaka, with more than 50
parliamentarians and aides participating.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China's Representative to Japan, Lo Fu-chuan,
also attended the hour-long symposium.</P>
      <P>The Japanese side told the visitors that it would be almost
impossible for Japan to enact a Japanese version of the Taiwan
Relations Act, because the political situation in Japan is different
from that of the United States.</P>
      <P>However, they added that they expect both sides of the Taiwan
Strait will be able to resolve their difference through peaceful
means.</P>
      <P>The DPP delegation arrived in Tokyo on Sunday. It will leave for
Seoul on Aug. 9 to continue its "parliamentarian diplomacy" mission.</P>

with leading legislators over a banquet on Monday night in an attempt
to seek support for his minority government in the legislature.</P>
      <P>The formal banquet, hosted by Chen at the Taipei Guest Hall,
which is usually reserved for state banquets for foreign dignities,
brought together the leaders of Taiwan's four main political parties
and one faction at the Legislative Yuan, as well as Premier Tang Fei
and other government leaders.</P>
      <P>Although the banquet was said to be a social gathering rather
than a political event, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng said
Chen exchanged views with the legislators on national issues, and
especially ways to soothe the often jarring relations between the
legislature and Chen's office.</P>
      <P>Lai Shih-pao, a legislator of the New Party said afterward that
Chen emphasized that he will abide by the Constitution and take
charge of policy toward Beijing, diplomacy and defense, which will

      <P>A former head of the military-run Chungshan
Institute of Science and Technology (CIST) said on Tuesday the
Ministry of National Defense (MND) should "localize" military
procurement and enact a law to protect competent officers.</P>
      <P>Former CIST Director Shen Fang-cheng made the appeals during a
public hearing on the implementation of the military supply policy
under the two new "national defense laws" -- the National Defense
Law and the MND Organization Law.</P>
      <P>Shen pointed out that military build-up plans are usually
designed for meeting the combat needs five to 10 years from now,
while combat preparedness is aimed at meeting today's combat
requirements.</P>
      <P>In the past, Shen said, the General Staff Headquarters
took full control of both military build-up and combat preparedness
work. Against this background, he said, headquarters of the three
military branches were only able to dish out their demand for
tactical weapons and lacked the capability to draw up forward-looking
military build-up plans.</P>
      <P>In the future, Shen said he hopes that the new military supply
bureau, scheduled to be inaugurated next July in accordance with the
two new "national defense laws" will be authorized to handle all
military build-up plans and work out the country's need for
strategic weapons.</P>
      <P>Shen said the military should "localize" its demand for weapons,
equipment and other relevant supplies to help boost domestic
economic development, facilitate defense operations and promote
self-sufficiency in defense industry.</P>
      <P>"If we use NT$100 billion (US$3.23 billion) in defense budget to
purchase locally made military equipment, it will bring about
value-added effects to relevant domestic industries," Shen said,
adding that he simply couldn't understand why the military would
purchase military trucks from South Korea since local automakers
were able to produce similar vehicles.</P>
      <P>Noting that cost should not be a decisive factor in making
strategic investment, Shen said mainland China doesn't care how many
Mirage jet fighters and Lafayette-class frigates Taiwan has made.
"What mainland China really cares is which new weapons and new
defense technology the CIST can develop," he noted.</P>
      <P>"The CIST is a strategic unit where we have invested a very large
amount of hard currency. And the institute has become one of our
bargaining chips in negotiating with the mainland," Shen explained.</P>
      <P>Touching on the upgrading of Taiwan's defense industry, Shen
said the MND should first change its mentality and thinking. In the
past, Shen said he once pushed for domestic development of
submarines. "The MND then came up with a demand requiring the
CIST to produce a Kilo-class submarine. Even the United States
cannot manufacture this kind of Russian-developed underwater
warship," he recalled.</P>
      <P>Shen said the MND should be more realistic in working out
weaponry procurement plans. "We should take into account our
country's own subjective and objective conditions while drafting a
procurement list," he urged.</P>
      <P>Turning to the many scandals or kickback allegations involving
major military procurement projects, Shen said the MND should
legislate a comprehensive law or a set of regulations to protect
capable, competent and law-abiding procurement officers. "Otherwise,
competent, hard-working officers would all hesitate to take up
procurement work," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US SCIENTISTS FIND BETTER WAY TO STORE NUCLEAR WASTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Aug.  7  (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>American scientists working at the Los
Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico said they have found a
better way to store nuclear waste.</P>
      <P>High-level radioactive waste is currently stored inside
containers designed to last 100 years. After this time, they will
begin to deteriorate, eventually exposing their dangerous contents to
the environment. The problem is that the waste will continue to emit
deadly radiation for tens of thousands of years.</P>
      <P>The team of researchers said they have discovered that ceramic
materials with chemical structures similar to fluorite crystals can
withstand exposure to nuclear waste for a long time because the
material's atoms shift to accommodate defects caused by radiation.</P>
      <P>The research team, led by Kurt Sickafus of the US Department of
Energy's laboratory, is developing the material by experimenting with
different combinations of pyrochlore and fluorite compounds.</P>
      <P>They found that the material becomes more resistant to the
effects of radiation when large metallic ions, like zirconium, are
added to the compounds' atomic structures.</P>
      <P>The team is still trying to develop the right combination of
compounds to make the strongest ceramic crystal for long-term storage
of nuclear waste.</P>
      <P>Each nuclear power plant produces about 20 tons of radioactive
waste every year.</P>
      <P>The scientists' study appears in the current issue of Science
magazine.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HEALTH CARE IN RURAL CHINA SAID WORSE THAN IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  8 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Health care in rural China is considered
worse than in sub-Saharan Africa as the impoverished rural population
of more than 500 million only receives the most basic preventative
health care, according to a report in The Australian Financial Review
on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that disruptions to mainland China's education
system during the Cultural Revolution has left the country with less
than 30,000 medically trained professionals, most of whom are based
in the more developed cities on the eastern seaboard.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted official Chinese figures as showing that China's
infant mortality rate rose from 34.7 deaths per 1,000 in 1981 to 37
per 1,000 in 1992. The United Nations Children's Fund reckons the
present figure is closer to 52 deaths per 1000 births.</P>
      <P>The international aid agency Medecines Sans Frontieres claims
that health in rural China is worse than in sub-Saharan Africa, the
daily reported.</P>
      <P>Previously, China's health care system relied on Mao Zedong's
brigade of "barefoot doctors", who only received the most rudimentary
medical training. Nevertheless, they were successful in lifting the
health standards of China's rural poor, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>From the early 1950s, China's infant mortality rate steadily
declined while tuberculosis and other infectious diseases were also
largely kept under control.</P>
      <P>But the collapse of the rural communes from the early 1980s,
brought about by the economic reforms of Deng Xiaoping, turned many
of the achievements of the previous 30 years to dust, the daily
reported.</P>
      <P>Beijing is only now paying serious attention to the reform of the
country's crumbling health care system, but most of the efforts are
focused almost exclusively on city dwellers and do little for the 90
percent of peasants who have lost access to free medical treatment,
the daily reported.</P>
      <P>Under the government's new plan, Chinese workers will be required
to pay the equivalent of 2 percent of their annual income into an
individual medical fund. Employers have to contribute the equivalent
of 6 percent of the employees' annual wage, with half being deposited
in the individual fund and the other half going into a national
health insurance program, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>But the big problem with such a scheme is collecting such
contributions from unprofitable state enterprises, analysts told the
daily. The other problem is the ever-increasing cost of
pharmaceuticals in mainland China, which could deprive most poor
people of the ability to buy medicine or see doctors, the daily
reported.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US INTELLIGENCE CONCERNED ABOUT ABILITY TO SATELLITE MONITOR PRC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug. 7 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Reconnaissance satellite monitoring and
analysis of Communist China is a growing concern for US intelligence
operations, according to a report in the latest issue of Aviation
Week &amp; Space Technology Monday.</P>
      <P>The weekly magazine reported that national security managers
directly involved with US recon satellite tasking and image analysis
said that the Chinese are already demonstrating the ability to use
countermeasures capable of thwarting overhead surveillance.</P>
      <P>"Mainland China is an example of a real challenge for the US
intelligence community," intelligence managers were quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>"In some ways it is difficult today, but it is also a looming
intelligence challenge for tomorrow. The question is, have we devoted
sufficient resources to one of the world's largest pieces of
geography?" asked one manager.</P>
      <P>"The Chinese are very good at denying us information. This is
what in the community we call a `hard target,'" he added.</P>
      <P>One major current problem is staffing. The analyst workforce is
one-third smaller than in 1990, but the work they have to do has
roughly doubled, according to the intelligence managers.</P>
      <P>They said this has come from shrinking intelligence community
resources while the size and diversity of the customer base for
imagery (the military services, State Department, White House, etc.)
has been growing every day.</P>
      <P>The daily pointed out that these are problems that could have
contributed to the US overlooking preparations for Indian nuclear
tests in 1998 and the accidental bombing of the Communist Chinese
embassy in 1999.</P>
      <P>As a result, according to one official, the intelligence
community has made a major investment in research on how to boost its
understanding of nuclear test activity.</P>
      <P>The database problems that led to the PRC embassy bombing are
also being addressed. "There are a lot of issues being worked on now
to address the quality of our databases. We have 21st century weapon
systems and expectations, but our infrastructure is still far from
Joint Vision 2010 (the Defense Department vision for information
superiority)," he said.</P>
      <P>Under normal circumstances, the largest share of US satellite
tasking and analyst time is focused on the monitoring of key regions.
As part of this, about 35-40 percent of the overhead assets and
analysts are focused on regional military monitoring -- looking at
the disposition of forces and equipment in areas such as Yugoslavia,
Russia, Communist China, North Korea and Iraq.</P>
      <P>About 15 percent of current US satellite recon capability is
devoted to tracking nuclear, chemical, and biological proliferation
targets. Another 10 percent of the work is devoted to "advance
warning" issues, including checking the status of weapons that could
directly threaten US interests.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCRUB TYPHUS CAN SUPPRESS VIRUS IN AIDS PATIENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bangkok, Aug. 8 (CNA)
(By Kuo Fang-chih )</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a joint study involving researchers from
the United States, the United Kingdom, and Thailand, it has been
confirmed that scrub typhus, an insect-transmitted tropical disease
which only occurs in Asia, can suppress HIV to undetectable levels,
reported the Bangkok Post on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The level of virus in the blood of four out of 10 AIDS patients
in Chiang Rai and Mae Hong Son provinces fell dramatically," the
daily reported.</P>
      <P>"This drop is the exact opposite of what occurs with other
infections in AIDS patients. No other infectious disease has shown
the effects of reducing the HIV viral load," said Dr. George Watt,
the leader of the research team.</P>
      <P>The study involved 15 patients, 10 of whom were infected with
scrub typhus, four with malaria, and one with leptospirosis. No
improvement was found in the health of five other patients in the
study infected with malaria and leptospirosis.</P>
      <P>However, Somsong Rakphao, director general of the Communicable
Diseases Control Department of the Ministry of Public Health,
cautioned that the information could mislead the public into
believing there is a cure for AIDS.</P>
      <P>Dr. Patcharee Kantipong of Chiang Rai Prachanukoah Hospital said
that the patients in the study received treatment for scrub typhus,
but did not receive any anti-AIDS drugs.</P>
      <P>She warned scrub typhus could lead to critical health conditions
or even death among AIDS patients in a similar manner as other
patients, if they do not receive proper treatment on time.</P>
      <P>According to official statistics in Thailand, 2,597 patients were
treated for scrub typhus last year, of whom three died of the

    <HEADLINE>PRC LIKELY TO INCREASE PRESSURE ON AUSTRALIA FOR BACKING US NMD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  8  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is expected to intensify
its pressure on Australia to drop its support for the controversial
US National Missile Defense (NMD) system through its vice foreign
minister's visit to Canberra.</P>
      <P>The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Yang Jiechi was scheduled
to hold talks with Australia's Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and
other senior officials on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The daily reported Yang, accompanied by the Chinese ambassador to
Australia, is expected to lodge a very strong protest with Downer for
Australia's support of the US NMD system.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted foreign policy experts as predicting that the
Beijing leadership will likely threaten that Australia's bid to export
A$20 (US$12.5) billion worth of liquefied natural gas for power
generation to the mainland could be at risk.</P>
      <P>They also predicted that Australia's support for research into
ballistic missile systems means that Canberra's carefully nurtured
diplomatic and trade ties with mainland China could be under threat
at a time of increasing regional instability, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>Prime Minister John Howard and Downer are sympathetic to the US
proposal to deploy a missile shield and are likely to support
Washington if President Bill Clinton or his successor decides to
deploy it, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted senior Chinese diplomats as saying that Yang
would be making Beijing's strongest protest yet after the official
Chinese media last month condemned Australia's stand and the Chinese
ambassador to Australia urged the Howard government to consider
Australian interests rather than US security fears.</P>
      <P>The Australian opposition Labor Party has publicly criticized the
Howard government for supporting the US NMD system, warning that it
could only lead to a greater missile build-up in mainland China and
in India or Pakistan.</P>
      <P>"If China boosts its arsenal, the prospects for future nuclear
arms reductions will be dealt a severe blow," said opposition foreign
affairs spokesman Laurie Brereton.</P>
      <P>"NMD has the potential to trigger a new nuclear arms race and
gravely undermine global disarmament and non-proliferation
agreements," he added.</P>
      <P>The daily reported Australia is one of the few US allies being
targeted by mainland China because Canberra has publicly supported
the US NMD proposals.</P>
      <P>Beijing is aware that Australia has actively cooperated with the
US on research into a Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system, the daily
reported.</P>
      <P>But other Australian experts earlier said the main reason behind
Beijing's strong objection to the US NMD system is that it would
likely expand that system to a TMD system.</P>
      <P>TMD could limit or hamper mainland China's ability to attack
Taiwan, they said, adding that both an NMD system and a TMD system
would be for defensive purposes only and could pose no threat to
mainland China, Russia, or any other country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE YUAN VICE PRESIDENT ADVOCATES CONFEDERATION SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  8  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Yao Eng-chi, vice president of the
Legislative Yuan, on Tuesday advocated a confederation system as the
best way to ensure stable relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Yao made the remarks when he attended a seminar on "current
cross-strait relations and the future direction of China." Domestic
and mainland scholars also attended the seminar sponsored by the
World League for Freedom and Democracy (WLFD).</P>
      <P>Yao, who is also president of the WLFD, pointed out that a
confederation system could handle many issues that are difficult to
solve at present. A confederation is a structure formed by two or
more political entities which retain their political sovereignty
while cooperating on solutions to mutual problems.</P>
      <P>He noted that Beijing's insistence on the "one China" principle
would be satisfied by such a confederation between the two sides, and
peaceful unification would be the natural result.</P>
      <P>He said that moreover, Taiwan could ensure its own sovereignty in
such a system, because political entities in a confederation retain
their own sovereignty and the right to organize their own
governments. He added that Taiwan people would not have to fear that
their nation would be devoured by the mainland.</P>
      <P>Yao noted that President Chen Shui-bian has extended conciliatory
gestures to the mainland since his election victory, and although
Chen's soft approach has eased cross-strait tensions, Jao said that
the nature of cross-strait relations remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>Yao said that Chen's "soft approach to overcome the mighty one"
strategy has not actually solved the real problem between the two
sides of the Taiwan strait.</P>
      <P>Yao summed up President Chen's strategy toward the mainland as
"no action," which he said is only passive, and not aggressive or
constructive.</P>
      <P>He said that faced with mainland China's aggressive promotion of
its "one country, two systems" formula, Taiwan should present a
position that is in its own interests. He added that any other course
of action would be detrimental to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yao said that Taiwan people could not accept the mainland China's
cherished "one China, two systems" formula right away, as the model
practiced in Hong Kong and Macau could not work for the welfare of
Taiwan people. Instead, he said that the formula would feed the
public's misgivings that Taiwan would soon be simply absorbed by the
mainland.</P>
      <P>He also said that it is inappropriate to promote the "two states"
theory, not only because world opinion does not support the idea, for
fear that it would result in a war across the Taiwan Strait,
destabilizing all of East Asia.</P>
      <P>The mainland has repeatedly warned that it would use force
against the island if Taiwan introduced a "two states" theory into
the ROC Constitution, he noted.</P>
      <P>Yao concluded by saying that as both "two states" and "one
county, two systems" are not suitable as the basis for cross-strait
relations, a confederation system would be the best way for both
sides to maintain stable relations and ensure peace for the benefit
of all Chinese people.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP)
decided on Tuesday to dispatch a legislative mission to visit
mainland China later this month.</P>
      <P>According to PFP Legislative Whip Chiu Chuang-liang, the PFP
legislative mission, to be headed by former Legislative Yuan
President Liu Sung-pan, will depart for mainland China on the third
day after the annual Beidaihe conference of Beijing's leaders has
concluded.</P>
      <P>But Chiu pointed out that the party would cancel the trip should
mainland Chinese leaders work out any policy harmful to Taiwan's
interests during their upcoming Beidaihe meeting, he added.</P>
      <P>Chiu said the PFP will maintain a low-key and cautious profile
about the planned mainland trip to avoid public misunderstandings,
since President Chen Shui-bian has recently blasted some Taiwan
lawmakers for their "mainland fever."</P>
      <P>In addition to sponsoring seminars for mainland-based Taiwan
businessmen to provide them with services, the PFP lawmaker said the
delegation will also seek to discuss practical issues with mainland
Chinese representatives regarding mainland Chinese brides and workers
in Taiwan as well as the mainland Chinese agricultural imports to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chiu also confirmed outside speculation that former Justice
Minister Liao Cheng-hao will join the delegation to visit the
mainland. The PFP has arranged academic meetings in mainland China
for Liao, he noted.</P>
      <P>But he stressed that a reported trip to the mainland by former
Judicial Yuan President Lin Yang-kang is not linked to the PFP
delegation's trip, which has been postponed several times as a result
of uncertainties between Taiwan and mainland China since Chen of the
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party was elected as the
Taiwan's new president on March 18.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REORGANIZATION  RESULTS  IN NEW INTERNATIONAL INDUSTRIAL ASSOCIATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  8  (CNA)
(By Alice Liang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Euro-Asia Trade Organization (EATO)
announced on Wednesday that it has reorganized its structure and
changed its name to the Chinese International Economic Cooperation
Association (CIECA).</P>
      <P>In the future, affairs now handled by the Chinese National
Association of Industry and Commerce (CNAIC), will be handed over to
this newly-formed organization. Besides the member-firms of the EATO,
companies joining the new organization include Evergreen Group, I-Mei
Group, Nien Hsing Textile Co., and Giant Manufacturing Co.</P>
      <P>The reorganization was implemented by some 30 industry
individuals, including Jeffrey L.S. Koo, chairman and chief executive
officer of Chinatrust Commercial Bank. President Chen Shui-bian is
expected to attend the CIECA's inaugural ceremony, which will be held
at Chinatrust's headquarters.</P>
      <P>Koo said that domestic economic groups such as the EATO and CNAIC
have played important roles in lots of international meetings.
However, the lack of integration among such groups has resulted in a
lack of efficiency, which the new organization is designed to
alleviate. Koo added that the organization will ask for government
subsidies of about NT$40 million (US$1.29 million) per year.</P>
      <P>A proposal to establish the CIECA was issued in April, and the
Ministry of the Interior approved the organization in May. Its goals
for the second half of this year are to reinforce and develop
Taiwan's industrial relations with mainland China, as well as nations
in the Middle East and Africa.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW ROC NATIONAL DEFENSE REPORT PUBLISHED (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  8  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
published a new version of the "National Defense Report" on Tuesday
in line with the government's transparent defense policy.</P>
      <P>The ministry said in the "2000 National Defense Report" that
with the commissioning of a new generation of arsenal, the Republic
of China military's overall combat capabilities have been
upgraded and now can embark on some sort of counterattack.</P>
      <P>The report, commonly known as the ROC's national defense white
paper, mentioned for the first time the military's plan to push for
the establishment of a mutual trust mechanism with mainland China's
People's Liberation Army (PLA), but it didn't touch on President
Chen Shui-bian's "offshore defense" concept.</P>
      <P>The report divulged that relations across the Taiwan Strait
became rather strained last summer after then-ROC President Lee
Teng-hui defined cross-strait ties as a special state-to-state
relationship.</P>
      <P>In retaliation for Lee's remarks, the report said, the PLA
conducted Taiwan-targeting combined services landing drills in its
Guangzhou and Nanjing military regions.</P>
      <P>The white paper said mainland China's reaction indicated that it
has felt a sense of urgency to resolve the so-called Taiwan issue
after it smoothly reclaimed sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>Noting that mainland China's threat to Taiwan's national
security has become ever more serious, the report said the PLA is
now actively developing unlimited war, electronic warfare
and asymmetrical combat strategies and relevant arsenal. Such
developments will enable mainland China to diversify its methods to
invade Taiwan, the report said.</P>
      <P>According to the report, mainland China's air force could win
air supremacy over the Taiwan Strait after 2005. It further said the
PLA may set up special military units to invade Taiwan. If mainland
China finally decides to take Taiwan by force, the report said, it
will first launch a maritime blockade and conduct air bombardment and
missile attack.</P>
      <P>The report said mainland China's current missile deployment
along its southeastern coast is completely targeted at Taiwan,
and the number of its missiles deployed in the region will exceed
600 by 2005.</P>
      <P>The report further said the PLA currently deploys 70,000 troops
in the Fujian area, which is directly opposite Taiwan. Moreover, the
report said, the PLA can move an additional 250,000 troops to Fujian
from its other military regions in a very short period of time.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the PLA can mobilize up to 400,000
troops for a landing battle with Taiwan and its air force can
airlift two parachute regiments to Taiwan. The PLA can also launch
multi-dimensional and multiple rounds of missile attacks on
Taiwan, the report said.</P>
      <P>In the face of mainland China's mounting military threat, the
report said, the ROC has also upgraded its overall defense
capability with the completion of various arsenal replacement and
modernization plans.</P>
      <P>The report said the ROC military now has "active" strategic
combat capability and can launch counterattacks. Against this
backdrop, the report said, the military has adjusted its
basic combat strategy from "defense and deterrence" to "deterrence
and defense." The change in the strategic concept indicated the
military's determination to establish an elite force to deter
mainland China from trying to invade Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen said in a preface to
the white paper that the ROC has no intention of engaging in an arms
race with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Instead, Wu said, the ROC looks forward to conducting military
exchanges with the mainland and forge a mutual trust mechanism to
ensure lasting peace in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The report also said the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should
increase civilian and governmental exchanges and jointly foster a
climate favorable for dealing with the issue of a "future one China"
based on goodwill and mutual trust.</P>
      <P>The MND began to issue a national defense report every other
year in 1990. The 2000 report is the fifth of its kind. It was
originally scheduled to be off the press in March. But the marketing
was postponed until Tuesday due to the transition of power from the
long-ruling Kuomintang to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>After the inauguration of the DPP-led government on May 20, the
MND made some changes to the content of the report to more clearly
reflect President Chen Shui-bian's national defense policy.

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HAS 'VERY OPEN' INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENT: EUROPEAN REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 8 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A July report by the European Round Table of
Industrialists (ERT) categorized Taiwan's investment environment as
"very open," particularly in the area of foreign investment.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Development and Investment Center (IDIC) of the
Republic of China Ministry of Economic Affairs on Tuesday cited the
ERT report as an indication that Taiwan's efforts to promote
liberalization, internationalization, and an obstacle-free investing
environment in recent years have paid off.</P>
      <P>The IDIC added that the recognition that Taiwan receives from the
ERT report will have a positive effect when foreign investors assess
their Taiwan investment strategies in the future.</P>
      <P>The report, titled "Improved Investment Conditions: third survey
on improvements in conditions for investment in the developing
world," covers the period from 1997-1999, and is based on the results
of a survey of some 33 developing countries.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted in cooperation with the United Nations
and the International Chamber of Commerce. It investigated each
country's conditions for foreign investment, overall investment
environment, government legal system, local enterprises, labor force,
social culture, and living conditions.</P>
      <P>The ERT then rated each country's investment environment on its
degree of openness and speed of liberalization. Taiwan was rated as
"moderately open" in 1992, "quite open" in 1996, and "very open" in
1999.</P>
      <P>The report also demonstrated that over the last three years,
despite the financial crisis in Asia, the developing countries
surveyed have continued to open their economies rapidly to private
investment, and to deregulate and modernize related rules and
institutions to bring them in line with global requirements.</P>
      <P>Particularly substantial progress was found in five main areas:</P>
      <P>- Fewer restrictions on ownership, and improved access to new
sectors for local- and foreign-invested private firms;</P>
      <P>- Improved protection of intellectual property rights, both
through modernization of rules and more strict implementation of
them;</P>
      <P>- Increased effectiveness and efficiency of tax allocation and
collection;</P>
      <P>- Continued deregulation of import/export regimes and reduction
of tariffs; and</P>
      <P>- Modernization and better integration of local financial
markets, aligning relevant rules to global requirements.</P>
      <P>The ERT report, the third in a series, was prepared by an ERT
working group led by Helmut Maucher, honorary chairman of Nestle S.A.
and former ERT chairman.</P>
      <P>The ERT comprises a group of 48 European industrial leaders,
including the heads of large multinational companies such as British
Telecom, Nokia, Bayer, Nestle, Ericsson, and Philips.</P>
      <P>Free copies of the report are available through the ERT website
(www.ert.be) or e-mail (contact@ert.be).</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS, EXPERTS CRITICIZE GOVERNMENT'S LOAN PACKAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  8  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Public confidence will be eroded even
further should the low-interest home loan package put forth by the
government fail to stimulate the sluggish real estate market,
opposition lawmakers warned on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee Ching-an, caucus spokeswoman for the People First Party in
the Legislative Yuan, said public confidence will melt down again if
the measures turn out to be ineffective because the major reason for
the sluggishness is a lack of public faith provoked by the
government's unclear policies on Taiwan's future and its economic
situation.</P>
      <P>PFP legislative whip Chen Chao-jung also voiced his suspicion of
the package, saying that he feels the four-point measures designed by
the government are only aimed at bailing out vested interest groups.</P>
      <P>The remarks came in response to an announcement on Monday by
government spokeswoman Chung Chin that the Executive Yuan will
earmark NT$320 billion in low-interest loans for low-income and
first-time home buyers as part of the government's efforts to
revitalize the property market.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, some local experts also contended that the measures
are only a short-term approach to lure potential buyers into the real
estate market. They added that the package represents no root
solutions to the long-term problem of housing oversupply and capital
movement.</P>
      <P>C.O. Chang, a professor at National Chengchi University, said the
Taiwan property market is facing a structural crisis that should be
corrected by market mechanisms -- allowing house prices to fall and
setting up a sound system to provide loans.</P>
      <P>Judging from the situation of Taiwan's macroeconomy, Chang
suggested the government mull whether it is necessary to pour so much
money into the real estate sector because it is no longer the
"locomotive" of Taiwan's industrial sector.</P>
      <P>Calling on the public to refrain from cashing in on the
low-interest loans, he said potential home buyers should carefully
assess their needs.</P>
      <P>Chinese Culture University Professor C.H. Wu said that the
government's announcement of the preferential loan measures at this
time has "no true meaning." The government's efforts to attract more
home buyers will only further underpin house prices, which are
beginning to slide because of a housing glut and a decline in land
prices, he noted.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, there are probably as many as one million
unoccupied properties in Taiwan, although the island's house
ownership rate has already reached around 85 percent.</P>
      <P>However, many large banking institutions, such as Bank of Taiwan,
welcomed the government's loan package, claiming that it will create
a "win-win-win" situation for the public, the banking sector and the
real estate market.</P>
      <P>The bank expressed the hope that the measures will help increase
the loan business for banking institutions, reduce the loan burden on
home buyers and stimulate the real estate industry.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the Central Bank of China,
loans released by local banks to the construction sector hit a 23
month-low of NT$491.6 billion as of the end of this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CITES 98 MODEL FATHER-SON, FATHER-DAUGHTER PAIRS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  8  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian cited 98 model
father-son, father-daughter pairs from the military, police and
firefighting communities on Tuesday, in recognition of their
contributions to the country and society.</P>
      <P>The citation at the Presidential Office coincided with the
celebration of Father's Day which falls on Aug. 8.</P>
      <P>Chen first wished all fathers around the island a happy Father's
Day and said he was very happy to celebrate the special day with
selected personnel from the military, police and firefighting forces.</P>
      <P>Chen said the citation was arranged to express the government's
recognition and gratitude for all military, police and firefighting
personnel's contributions to the defense of national security, the
maintaining of law and order, and the conducting of emergency rescue
and disaster relief operations.</P>
      <P>"Despite differences in the nature of their work, the three
sectors' contributions to national security, social welfare and
providing a secure, comfortable living environment is the same," Chen
noted.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the large number of father-son and
father-daughter pairs in the three sectors is admirable because it
signifies success in family education. "Only a good father can
inspire his children to choose the same profession," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The accumulated seniority of all of those cited reached 3,000
years. "This is a marvelous record. You are no ordinary people. You
are all great. You have made extraordinary choices and have created
extraordinary lives," the president lauded.</P>
      <P>He also encouraged all of the model military, police and
firefighting workers to regard all fellow countrymen as their
offspring and develop rapport with them in order to ensure social
harmony and domestic stability.</P>
      <P>Chen also revealed that his daughter and son jointly presented
him with a shaver as a Father's Day gift. "I will highly treasure it
because the shaver will remind me that I must `shave my beard before
shaving others' beards,' by which I mean I must reflect upon my own
actions before blaming others," he said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   8   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei is a key force
contributing to current domestic political stability, Vice Premier
Chang Chun-hsiung said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks after ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) Secretary-General Wu Nai-jen said on Monday that Premier Tang
has failed people's expectations in the last two months due to a lack
of resolve and diplomacy.</P>
      <P>Chang said Tang, a Kuomintang stalwart and a
four-star-general-turned politician, is an "irreplaceable pillar" of
domestic political stability.</P>
      <P>Chang said all members of the DPP-led government, including
President Chen Shui-bian and Premier Tang, are willing to accept
criticism and make self-reflection in a modest manner.</P>
      <P>Chang, himself a DPP heavyweight, reminded critics of the
performance of Tang's Cabinet that the Cabinet is composed of members
from different political parties who need time to forge a consensus
on major public issues.</P>
      <P>"Moreover, while some Cabinet members are experienced
politicians, several others are scholars with lofty ideals and
little political experience," Chang noted.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Chang said, the public should give the
Cabinet a bit more time before measuring its performance.</P>
      <P>Since the inauguration of President Chen's administration on May
20, Chang said, some 200 people have joined the new government team.
"But the middle-ranking civil servants have not yet fully adapted
themselves to the new situation and failed to completely shed their
old bureaucratic thinking. This trend has also affected the
operation of the new government," he added.</P>
      <P>With the recess of the Legislative Yuan, Chang said, Tang's
Cabinet now can devote its full energy to administrative work.
"So the Cabinet will from now on enter a new stage. I hope local
public will remain confident in the new government's capability.
I believe the Cabinet will be able to project a new image and score
remarkable achievements in the near future."</P>

      <P>Taiwan's revenues from stock transaction
taxes dropped to NT$6.6 billion (US$213 million) in July, its lowest
level since March 1999, sources from the Ministry of Finance (MOF)
reported on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Stock transaction taxes in July fell off NT$3.8 billion (US$123
million), 36.5 percent lower than those collected in July 1999, MOF
officials said, adding that July saw the largest single-month drop in
such revenues since April of last year.</P>
      <P>The MOF said that the nation's tax revenues collected in July
reached NT$166.1 billion (US$5.36 billion), up an annual NT$7.8
billion (US$252 million), an increase of 4.9 percent over the
year-earlier levels.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA DEPLOYING OVER 400 MISSILES OPPOSITE TAIWAN: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  8  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing has deployed more than 400 guided
missiles along the coastal provinces of Jiangsi and Fujian opposite
Taiwan, according to the 2000 National Defense Report released by the
Ministry of National Defense (MND) on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The range of the missiles covers the whole of Taiwan, according
to the report.</P>
      <P>The report further said that the number of missiles will increase
by over 600 by the year 2005.</P>
      <P>It pointed out that Beijing's armed forces deployment maintains a
"positive defense" strategy combining army, navy, air force and
missile units in the seven military regions of mainland China.</P>
      <P>Beijing has been redoubling its efforts to modernize its armed
forces, the report said, adding that the People's Liberation Army
(PLA) has launched across-the-board reforms in training, war strategy
and administration.</P>
      <P>Affected by the Persian Gulf War, Beijing reformed its Central
Military Commission (CMC), the country's highest military guiding
body, in 1998. A General Logistics Department was established under
the direct control of the CMC to carry out the procurement, research
and administration of weapons and related equipment, the report said.</P>
      <P>With regard to missile development, the report went on, Beijing
has been concentrating its efforts on improving the mobility,
precision and capability of its guided missiles. Beijing has
successfully developed its Dongfeng 31 ballistic missile and is also
developing new missiles with solid fuel to replace its old missiles
that use liquid fuel.</P>
      <P>With respect to the air force, under the technical assistance of
Israel and cooperation with Russia, the PLA Air Force has
successfully manufactured J-10 and J-11 jet fighters that will enter
military service by 2005. The combat capabilities of these jet
fighters are similar to those of US-made F-15s and F-16s.</P>
      <P>Beijing has also purchased AA-12 air-to-air missiles to build up
the combat capability of its warplanes, and has self-developed a
low-level, all-weather bomber -- the J-7 -- as well as buying
Russian-made Su-30MKK fighter-bombers.</P>
      <P>The mainland has also successfully developed a series of
anti-aircraft missiles, including the Red Flag-9, the SA-10, the Red
Flag-7 and the SA-15, according to the report.</P>
      <P>With regard to naval developments, Beijing is developing the
model-093 and model-094 nuclear-powered assault and guided missile
submarines. The O94 can be equipped with 12 to 16 intercontinental
long-range missiles that would reach all of the United States.</P>
      <P>Beijing has also bought modern-class destroyers and K-class
diesel powered submarines from Russia, the report said.</P>

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
on Tuesday received Enrique Garrido Arrosemena, president of the
Legislative Assembly of Panama, and exchanged views with him on
bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Chen extended a warm welcome to Garrido and his entourage and
promised that his government will continue and honor all the
commitments and cooperation projects that the ROC has entered into
with the Central American country.</P>
      <P>He said that in the past two months, high-ranking officials of
the two countries have exchanged visits, and noted that Panamanian
Second Vice President Dominador Kaiser Bazan came to Taiwan to attend
the presidential inauguration on May 20, while President Mireya Elisa
Moscoso Rodriquez visited the ROC in early July, becoming the first
foreign head of state to visit the ROC since the new government was
inaugurated.</P>
      <P>The visit of Garrido's delegation of legislators further
indicates that bilateral relations are stable and cordial, Chen went
on.</P>
      <P>Chen described Panama as a true democratic country because its
people elected a woman president last year, while the parliament also
elected a president descended from aborigines.</P>
      <P>After finding out that Garrido was to curtail his visit in order
to rush back to Panama to take care of his 89-year-old tribal chief,
Chen expressed hope that Garrido will convey his personal regards to
the tribal elder.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the ROC, with its population of 23 million, is
ranked as the world's 13th-largest trading nation with the
third-highest foreign exchange reserves and is a leader in the field
of high-technology, but is still discriminated against and excluded
from world organizations. He expressed gratitude for Panama's support
for the ROC's bid for membership in international organizations.</P>
      <P>He further said that the ROC experienced its first transition of
power in five decades, indicating that the ROC respects democracy,
freedom and human rights, which are common believes shared by both
countries. "We should treasure these common believes and step up our
cooperation," Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Garrido for his part said that both the ROC and Panama share a
similar historical background. He said Panama believes that the ROC
has every right to seats in international organizations and will
continue to offer its assistance to help the ROC achieve this goal.</P>
      <P>Chen also noted that he visited Panama in 1984 and 1996 in his
capacity as city council member and mayor, respectively and added
that he hopes to someday visit Panama in his capacity as ROC
president.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WEATHER BUREAU WARNS OF POSSIBLE STRONG QUAKE IN HUALIEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) on Tuesday
warned that the eastern city of Hualien might be hit by an earthquake
measuring 6 or more on the Richter scale in the near future and urged
residents there to be extra careful.</P>
      <P>CWB Seismology Center Director Kuo Kai-wen said the quake-prone
city has regularly suffered a major temblor of a magnitude of at
least 6 every three to five years over the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>From July this year, the likelihood of another major temblor has
increased as a large accumulation of tectonic momentum has already
built up underground, which could manifest as a powerful quake.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is located on a juncture between the
Philippine Sea and the Euroasian tectonic plates, where underground
activity is common and tectonic momentum regularly builds up, Kuo
said Hualien's chances of a major earthquake in the near future is
scientifically reasonable, particularly in view of the fact that the
city has not had a powerful temblor since 1995.</P>
      <P>Kuo stressed, however, that he was not making an earthquake
prediction, because earthquakes are so far not predictable. He said
he was just making a scientific analysis based on geostratical
viewpoints.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will call on
opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan in early September, after he
returns from a state visit abroad, Deputy Secretary-General to the
President Eugene Chien said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>It will mark the first time a Republic of China president will
have paid a formal courtesy call on an opposition party chairman.</P>
      <P>Chien called on KMT Secretary-General Lin Fong-cheng earlier in
the day to work out details regarding a roundtable meeting to be held
between Chen and the heads of Taiwan's three major political parties.</P>
      <P>He also conveyed the president's wish to pay a visit to Lien, who
was vice president under the previous KMT administration, to "seek
Lien's counsel" on affairs of state and to discuss Chen's roundtable
idea in person.</P>
      <P>Lien is currently in the United States on a 14-day North American
visit, while Chen will embark on a state visit to the ROC's six
allies in the Caribbean, Central America, and West Africa on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chien said that many sectors of society are in favor of holding

development and social stability.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the Presidential Office is especially
looking forward to establishing a communications mechanism with the
three parties.</P>
      <P>He added that Chen has no preset stance or bottom line regarding
the issues to be discussed at the meeting, and that anything
beneficial to the national welfare and the people's livelihoods, such
as the constitutional system, interparty coordination, cross-strait
relations, financial issues, and earthquake reconstruction, can be
discussed.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), the KMT, and the

    <HEADLINE>MILITARY TURNS OVER ARMS SALES DOCUMENTS TO INVESTIGATORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  8  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) on
Tuesday handed over more than 200 cases of documents to investigators
charged with probing the death of a navy captain and alleged
irregularities in navy arms purchases.</P>
      <P>The documents were turned over to the Criminal Investigation
Bureau (CIB) and the Investigation Bureau (IB), which were ordered by
a special panel to look into the death of Capt. Yin Ching-feng in
1993, and the allegations of corruption in the navy.</P>
      <P>Vice Chief of the General Staff Gen. Wang Han-ning told a press
conference afterward that the documents -- including 796 files, 433
of which are classified -- run to 277,862 pages.</P>
      <P>Calling Yin's death and the allegations of corruption fueled by
his death "the shame of the military," Wang said the handover of the
documents vindicated the MND's determination to get to the bottom of
the case and quell speculation that the MND intended to block the
panel's probe of the case.</P>
      <P>He also cautioned the panel to abide by gag rules imposed by law
during the criminal investigation and to refrain from leaking any
classified information about naval arms purchases.</P>
      <P>Chen Pi-lien, a Supreme Court prosecutor and a spokeswoman for
the investigation panel, expressed "sincere thanks" to the military,
saying that the panel believed the military had turned over all
related documents in their possession.</P>
      <P>The MND delivered the documents four days after a prosecutor with
the panel accused the military on Aug. 3 of blocking the work of the
panel and ordered them to produce the related files within a week or
risk being searched by investigators.</P>
      <P>Facing the tremendous volume of documents, State Public
Prosecutor-General Lu Ren-fa, who was named by President Chen
Shui-bian as head of the panel, said Yin's death will be investigated
by the CIB, while the irregularities in naval arms purchases will be
probed by the IB.</P>
      <P>In order to address the military's concerns that some classified
testimony made by witnesses in the case during the military
investigation were leaked to and published by the press earlier this
month, Chen Pi-lien said the panel will look into the alleged leakage
of information and prosecute those responsible to the full extent of
the law.</P>
      <P>In 1993, Yin was the executive secretary of the weaponry
procurement program under Navy General Headquarters when his body was
found floating in Suao Harbor in eastern Taiwan on Dec. 9 after he
was allegedly collecting evidence about corruption in the navy's arms
purchases.</P>
      <P>An investigation carried out by the MND turned up nothing and no
one was ever arrested in connection with his death.</P>
      <P>In a related development on Tuesday, reduced jail terms were
meted out to two brokers who had already been convicted of bribing
two navy officers.</P>
      <P>One of the brokers, Cheng Cheng-kuang, had his sentence
overturned, while the other, Liu Shu, was given a lighter sentence of
seven months in a third retrial by the Taiwan High Court.</P>
      <P>Both men had been sentenced to one year and two months in the
previous trials for bribing their way to winning a contract to
provide Italian-made survey ships to the navy in 1993.</P>
      <P>The High Court ruled that the sentences should be reduced in
light of the fact that Cheng confessed before the case even came to
light, while Liu later copped a guilty plea.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT HEARS REPORTS ON FISCAL 2001 BUDGET PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  8 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
on Tuesday heard reports from Premier Tang Fei and other officials on
the compilation of the central government's budget for fiscal 2001.</P>
      <P>He asked the administrative branches to step up communications
with various party caucuses in the legislature to gain their support
for the budget plan during deliberations in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The budget plan lists fiscal 2001 revenues at NT$1,455.8 billion
and expenditures at NT$1,605.5 billion, revealing a shortage of
NT$149.7 billion.</P>
      <P>As the government is also obliged to raise NT$155.7 billion for
repayment of government debts, the total budget shortage will rise to
NT$305.4 billion, which will be covered by issuance of government
bonds worth NT$260 billion and the previous fiscal year's surplus of
NT$45.4 billion.</P>
      <P>Because of the tight financial situation, Chen said that the
compilation of the new budget for government units had encountered
more difficulties than usual.</P>
      <P>For instance, he said, the expenditure for 2001 increased by only
NT$92.3 billion over the present fiscal year, and of that figure,
NT$62.4 billion and NT$21 billion are to be used to cover losses in
the health insurance program and for pay raises for public servants,
respectively.</P>
      <P>As a result, only NT$2.8 billion is allocated for the new
government's "3-3-3" welfare policy, which was promised by Chen
during his presidential campaign.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he stressed that appropriate budget arrangements
have been made to address the needs of national security, eradication
of black gold, strengthening of cultural, educational, scientific and
technological development, speeding up post-earthquake
reconstruction, promotion of economic development and "improvement of
the welfare of all the people."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT HAS 100 PERCENT  SUPPORT FOR PREMIER:  OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  8  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ranking presidential official said on
Tuesday that President Chen Shui-bian has 100 percent confidence in
and support for Premier Tang Fei.</P>
      <P>The official, who asked not to be named, was joining Vice Premier
Chang Chun-hsing in defending Tang, who came under fire from Wu
Nai-jen, secretary-general of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), for what he claimed was Tang's inability to meet the
expectations of the general public.</P>
      <P>Wu on Tuesday again publicly made it clear that he is very much
concerned about the administrative performance of the new Cabinet
under Tang's leadership.</P>
      <P>He told the media that the Executive Yuan has failed to deliver
what the new government promised and has failed over the past two
months to meet the expectations that Taiwan voters had when they went
to the polls on March 18.</P>
      <P>Other DPP top brass a day earlier had also criticized Tang,
saying he "does not have the guts" to be a leading administrator.</P>
      <P>Wu urged Tang to "flex the muscle" of a military leader (Tang was
defense minister before being appointed premier) and go ahead with
administrative reforms "in a big way."</P>
      <P>Wu's strongly worded criticism of Tang and the new Cabinet marked
a staggering and unprecedented political situation in the Republic of
China whereby the ruling party lambasted the administration.</P>
      <P>The presidential official said that Wu's criticism was
inappropriate, as the Cabinet's performance is improving and will
come up with "a beautiful score list" in the next three months.</P>
      <P>He added that Wu's remarks were just his personal views, of which
the Presidential Office had no prior knowledge.</P>
      <P>However, Vice Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, a DPP heavyweight and
Chen's secretary-general before becoming Tang's deputy on Aug. 1,
rejected Wu's castigation of the premier and said Tang is an
irreplaceable pillar that supports Taiwan's political arena.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Legislative Yuan caucus whip Hsu Tien-tsai said he
believes that Chen is completely positive about Tang's ability and
style of working, and claimed that Tang enjoys 100 percent support
from DPP legislators.</P>
      <P>Protesting against Wu's criticism of Tang, opposition Kuomintang
Secretary-General Lin Fong-cheng ridiculed Wu's remarks as "absurd,"
saying that the ruling DPP pressed hard to persuade the former
defense minister to take the helm of the government just a couple of
months ago, but has now already begun to dump him.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER HOSPITALIZED FOR HEALTH CHECKUP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei, whose office hours have
not lacked twists and turns ever since he took the helm of the
government more than two months ago, was hospitalized again on
Wednesday for a health checkup.</P>
      <P>Tang checked into Veterans General Hospital (VGH) after having
suffered dizzy spells over recent days, particularly after the long,
stomach-churning interpellation sessions at the Legislative Yuan,
according to sources from the Government Information Office (GIO).</P>
      <P>On the suggestion of family members, Tang went to the hospital on
Tuesday, four days earlier than originally scheduled, for a health
checkup.</P>
      <P>This resulted in Tang's absence from a "black gold" sweeping
action meeting, which represented the first serious national
anti-crime and anti-corruption meeting with President Chen Shui-bian
delivering a keynote speech.</P>
      <P>At noon, VGH President Chang Mao-sung told the media that after
preliminary checkups, the premier's breathing, blood pressure, and
heart beat were all found to be normal.</P>
      <P>He added, however, that more thorough examinations will have to
be carried out in order to discover the reasons behind Tang's recent
dizzy spells, speculating that they may be due to lack of sufficient
rest, particularly during the period of his rehabilitation after
undergoing chest surgery in April.</P>
      <P>Tang, who was defense minister in the previous KMT government
before being appointed premier by President Chen, has been
hospitalized on and off since a benign thymoma was removed from his
chest on April 16.</P>
      <P>He was admitted into VGH again on May 2 after catching a cold.
After agreeing to Tang's release from the medical center, VGH doctors
suggested that the premier work no more than six hours a day as he
had still not fully recovered from the operation.</P>
      <P>Although Tang's admittance to hospital this time came on the
heels of a series of attacks on him by ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Secretary-General Wu Nai-jen for his "inability to meet
the expectations of the general public," Vice Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung denied that the pressure of politics was the reason for
the premier's state, saying that Tang was admitted to hospital simply
because he "has been too tired recently."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI-WASHINGTON-BEIJING ROUNDTABLE TO OPEN ON AUG. 14</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Aug.  8  (CNA)
(By Jennifer Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A "Track II" roundtable meeting on
relations across the Taiwan Strait and the US China policy is
scheduled to open in New York on Aug. 14, with the participation of
delegates from Taiwan, mainland China and the United States.</P>
      <P>The roundtable, to be sponsored by the National Committee on
American Foreign Policy (NCAFP), a noted US think tank, will bring
together about 20 scholars and former foreign policy officials from
the three areas to discuss the latest cross-strait situation and the
US policy toward cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>Among the Taiwan delegates to the upcoming closed-door meeting
will be Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, an opposition Kuomintang
heavyweight, and Wu Jui-kuo, a close aide to opposition People First
Party Chairman James Soong.</P>
      <P>The NCAFP, which enjoys enormous clout in the formation of US
foreign policy, began to hold a biannual unofficial meeting on
the delicate Taipei-Washington-Beijing relations after cross-strait
hit a snag over the "one China" principle, as it thought that
private, closed-door discussions, also known as "Track II"
consultations, would be most effective in mending differences and
fostering goodwill.</P>
      <P>The first NCAFP-organized three-way roundtable was held in June
1997. The upcoming meeting will be the first of its kind since the
Republic of China completed its first democratic transition of power
from the long-ruling KMT to the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) in May.</P>
      <P>NCAFP sources said no incumbent central government officials
from the three areas will take part in the Aug. 14-15 roundtable
whose agenda will focus on an analysis of the impact on
cross-strait relations of the DPP's grip on power, the DPP-led ROC
government's policy toward mainland China and Beijing's views and
stances on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The participants will also discuss how the United States should
cope with the new cross-Taiwan Strait situation, NCAFP sources said,
adding that minutes of the meeting will be presented to the three
governments for reference.</P>
      <P>Several senior NCAFP members, including Winston Lord, a former US
Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific affairs, have
twice traveled to both sides of the Taiwan Strait to collect
first-hand information about cross-strait relations since the DPP
won Taiwan's March 18 presidential election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSSIE POLICE PROBING CASE OF ROBBING &amp; BEATING OF TAIWANESE STUDENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  9 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian police in New South Wales are
investigating the alleged robbery and beating involving three junior
Taiwanese students in Sydney after the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office (TECO) stepped in to demand that justice be done.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA on Wednesday, Maggie Tien, director
general of the Sydney-based TECO, said one of the students said he
was hit twice on his left cheek and the other one said he was robbed
of his mobile phone during a stroll near the University of New South
Wales on Aug. 3.</P>
      <P>In addition, several young Australians also allegedly used
abusive language, shouting "go home" to the three students from
Taichung. Tien declined to identify the students, who are studying
English in Sydney on a short-term basis.</P>
      <P>After the incident, the cousin of the three students, who has
been studying in Sydney for some time, reported the case to police in
South Maroubra. He said that police officers at the station did not
take the matter seriously.</P>
      <P>Two days after the incident, the cousin and the students again
came across the young Australians who they say robbed and beat them
when they were walking a dog in a park near their home-stay house.</P>
      <P>The cousin again reported the case to the same police station,
but it was ignored again. Instead, the cousin and the students
received a threat from the Australians who allegedly robbed and beat
them.</P>
      <P>Tien and her colleagues became aware of the case on Tuesday and
immediately stepped in to report the case to a senior police officer,
who instructed the South Maroubra police to investigate the matter.</P>
      <P>Tien told the police inspector assigned to the investigation that
the incident could damage the tourism and education industries in
Australia. In addition, it could also damage the country's
international image if authorities did not handle the case carefully
and bring the offenders to justice.</P>
      <P>She said the three students have moved to another place in order
to avoid any further harassment. They are returning to Taiwan soon,
she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADIAN RESEARCHERS TAKE E. COLI VACCINE TO ANIMAL TESTING STAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Aug.  8  (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada's National Research Council is
cooperating with Foragen Technology Ventures Inc. in testing a
vaccine against the E. coli 0157 bacterium that causes "hamburger
disease."</P>
      <P>This particular strain of E. coli causes serious illness in
humans, especially in young children and the elderly. Infections with
E. coli 0157:H7 have recently been associated with the water
contamination in Walkerton, Ontario which killed six people, as well
as with recalls of hamburger meat by certain supermarket chains in
North America.</P>
      <P>Cattle are the primary source of E. coli infection for humans.
Eliminating E. coli 0157 from cattle could go a long way towards the
prevention of disease outbreaks in humans.</P>
      <P>The NRC vaccine is expected to trigger an immune response in
cattle against E. coli 0157 through the production of protective
antibodies that prevent the growth of the bacterium in the animal's
gut. If proven effective, this simple, inexpensive vaccine could
provide an effective solution to the elimination of the bacterium at
the source.</P>
      <P>NRC's partnership with Foragen will provide funding for the next
stage of the evaluation, namely the testing of the vaccine in cattle
this month at the Veterinary Infectious Disease Organization in
Saskatoon. If the cattle evaluation is successful, action will be
taken to commercialize the vaccine.</P>
      <P>The vaccine has been developed by the Bacterial Pathogenesis
group led by Dr. Malcolm Perry. The team began research into E. coli
0157 during the early 1980s following disease outbreaks in Canada.</P>
      <P>"The understanding of how bacteria cause disease is a fundamental
step in combating the disease," said Perry.</P>
      <P>His group first isolated and chemically identified a unique
component of the E. coli 0157 -- an antigenic marker. The antigen is
used as the basis of a diagnostic tool for the detection of the E.
coli 0157. This antigen could form the basis of a specific vaccine.</P>
      <P>In subsequent work, the group discovered that there were other,
non-pathogenic bacteria that carried markers identical or chemically
similar to the E. coli 0157 antigenic marker. Oral immunization of
mice with some of these non-pathogenic bacteria produced antibodies
that successfully prevented colonization by E. coli 0157 in the
animals.</P>
      <P>Foragen Technology Ventures Inc. is a venture capital company for
early seed-stage project financing to create companies in advanced
agricultural technologies. Royal Bank Ventures Inc. has partnered
with Foragen to create the fund to help bridge the early stage
development gap in company creation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COUNTY CHIEFS RECALLED TO BEIJING FOR FURTHER TRAINING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  8  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Almost half of the Chinese Communist
Party's county secretaries have been called back to Beijing for
further indoctrination and training, illustrating that Beijing sees
its authority slipping and is attempting to bolster it, according to
an analysis published Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Stratfor, Inc., a Texas-based private global intelligence
services company, wrote in its global intelligence update titled
"Beijing's Anxiety" that for the first time in more than 50 years,
over 2,000 Chinese Communist Party chiefs at the county level have
been summoned to Beijing to "advance their ideology at the
professional and managerial level" at the Central Party School.</P>
      <P>These chiefs are Beijing's front line troops in its great
contradictory effort to open the economy while maintaining tight
political control, and the mainland Chinese government is signaling
that they may not be up to the job, said the analysis.</P>
      <P>The training program highlights Beijing's concern with the
interaction between politics and economics at the local level,
according to the analysis.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong Mail was quoted as reporting Monday that Communist
Chinese authorities are hiring additional lecturers and building
additional classrooms and dormitories at the Central Party School
campus. It will apparently take at least three years for the 2,000
county party heads to complete the six-month training courses, longer
than the four months allotted for ministerial officials.</P>
      <P>The entire process is unorthodox, the analysis noted, considering
that local Communist officials have their own schools, usually at the
provincial or municipal level.</P>
      <P>"This high-level attention underscores the importance Beijing
attaches to this training," which appears to be an attempt to
buttress the party at what is simultaneously its weakest and most
significant interface between the party and the masses, it noted.</P>
      <P>The analysis continued that these local officials have to resolve
the tension between economic reform and social stability and
operationalize central policy on a daily basis. This is especially
true if Communist China becomes a member of the World Trade
Organization. If accepted, Beijing will likely have to liberalize its
agricultural sector, which will involve thousands of low-level
decisions involving millions of farmers.</P>
      <P>"But distance makes it difficult to double-check their judgment
and erodes the central government's authority. Central officials
often lack sufficient power and are prone to corruption," stated the
analysis.</P>
      <P>"Beijing clearly sees its authority slipping at the most
significant level and appears to be taking emergency steps to bolster
its authority. This training program is an attempt to prepare the
local authorities to make the decisions that will set the course for
the economy," concluded the analysis.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SENDS MORE MOFA STAFF TO BE TRAINED IN AUSTRALIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug. 9 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) of
the Republic of China has sent more of its staff to receive training
in Australia following the successful training of an initial batch
over the past year.</P>
      <P>The first batch of three MOFA staff members -- Chen Tsun-ling,
Chen Huei-chin, and Hsu Hai-lei -- successfully finished their
training, including English language study at the Australian National
University and different programs specially designed by the ANU in
Canberra.</P>
      <P>They received 10 weeks of language training at Anutech, a special
language training center of the AN. Afterwards, they were assigned to
different programs, including the Australian Aid Commission, for a
period of 10 months.</P>
      <P>Also included were the Australian Youth Ambassadors for
Development Program, the Australian Agency for International
Development, volunteer work, government and community service,
documentation and filing, liaison work, education and business
networking, and various seminars and forums on wide-ranging topics.</P>
      <P>MOFA staff training in Australia is the brainchild of Dr. Liu
Polun, retiring representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in Canberra. Liu will leave Canberra on Thursday for a one
night stopover in Sydney before heading to Taipei on Friday where he
will retire after ending a diplomatic career of nearly 40 years.</P>
      <P>Liu proposed to the MOFA that its staff be sent to Australia to
receive training in order to receive different experiences and
perspectives for their future career.</P>
      <P>He said the MOFA used to send its younger staff for various
training programs, including language training in English, Spanish,
and other languages, to the United States, the United Kingdom,
Malaysia, South Africa and European countries.</P>
      <P>"I believe Australia will provide a different type of training
and perspective to our foreign office staff and help them develop
different ideas when they serve in different overseas postings in the
future," Liu said in an interview with the CNA.</P>
      <P>The first group of trainees told the CNA that they were lucky to
have received their training programs in Australia because they
obtained "very valuable and practical experiences."</P>
      <P>"Just like going to a mountain filled with treasures, I did not
go home empty handed from my one-year training in Australia," said
Chen Chun-ling.</P>
      <P>"It was the first time that I took part in practical meetings,
including one that was chaired by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in
1999, on discussion about Australia's temporary acceptance of about
4,000 Kosovar refugees.</P>
      <P>"Such an important discussion meeting on emergency issues opened
my eyes and vision on how representatives from developed countries
dealt with important problems," he added.</P>
      <P>Hsu Hai-lei said aside from taking part in major conferences
between Australia and other countries on different topics, she also
listened personally to a series of discussions on Australia's foreign
aid program and humanitarian assistance.</P>
      <P>"I will cherish all of what I received from the various training
programs in Australia. There were very practical and useful for my
future career," she said.</P>
      <P>Due to this initial success, the MOFA in July sent another batch
of five staff members for another year of training in Australia.</P>
      <P>At a welcome party last week, Liu Polun encouraged them to take
every opportunity to learn and benefit from all the programs and
studies they are receiving.</P>
      <P>"The dispatch of the first group of MOFA staff members is a good
start and the dispatch of the second group speaks well for the fact
that the Australian training programs cater to the practical needs of
our foreign office personnel," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT TOUTS BUSINESS DIPLOMACY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Superseding the venerable Euro-Asia Trade
Organization (EATO), the Chinese International Economic Cooperation
Association (CIECA) was established on Wednesday to promote Taiwan's
trade and cooperation with the international community.</P>
      <P>Addressing the inaugural ceremony, President Chen Shui-bian spoke
of high expectations regarding CIECA's collaboration with government
agencies to jointly promote business and trade diplomacy for the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Chen said he has high hopes that CIECA will cooperate closely
with government agencies, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
the International Cooperation and Development Fund and the Board of
Foreign Trade, to help the country achieve its diplomatic goals.</P>
      <P>He urged leaders and executives from Taiwan's private business
and industrial sectors to join CIECA as permanent members in order to
help bolster exchanges and cooperation between Taiwan and countries
in the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>Chen also asked government agencies and academic circles to
provide essential training to executives and personnel from the
private business and industrial sectors to allow them to become a
strong part of Taiwan's diplomatic front.</P>
      <P>EATO Chairman Jeffrey Koo, who is also chairman of the Chinese
National Association of Industry &amp; Commerce (CNAIC), became the first
chairman of CIECA.</P>
      <P>Addressing the inauguration of the new international trade group,
Koo vowed that CIECA will cope with government policies and
collaborate with all possible sources to promote Taiwan's economic
exchanges and cooperation with the world.</P>
      <P>Initially, Koo said, CIECA will continue to carry out the tasks
of EATO, a 25-year-old organization devoted to cementing contacts and
working relationships between Taiwan and European trade promotion
groups, and at the same time bolstering exchanges with trade
organizations in the Middle East and Africa.</P>
      <P>According to Koo, CIECA currently has 120 companies, groups and
individuals as its members, which include all existing members of
EATO and a number of newcomers, including big names like the

    <HEADLINE>WATCHDOG MEMBERS TO QUESTION ARMS SCANDAL VICTIM'S SECRETARY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of the Control Yuan, Taiwan's top
watchdog agency, were scheduled to question the former secretary of a
murdered navy captain on Wednesday in an investigation of a
high-profile scandal that has tarnished the image of the navy.</P>
      <P>Control Yuan members Kang Ning-hsiang and Ma Yi-kung said they
had summoned Wang Wan-ying to the Control Yuan and would ask Wang to
recall events in 1993 before and after the death of Capt. Yin
Ching-feng, then-executive director of the navy's weaponry
procurement program.</P>
      <P>Kang said that since Wang was the captain's secretary, knew Yin's
office activities and most importantly, was told to "clean up" Yin's
room at naval headquarters, Wang should know some matters regarding
her boss' death.</P>
      <P>Most puzzling, Kang said, was why Wang was asked by Yin's
colleague Kuo Li-heng to clean up Yin's room even before Yin's
whereabouts was known.</P>
      <P>Ma said the Control Yuan wanted to fathom what Wang had observed
while she was cleaning Yin's room and what was the motive behind the
decision to clean his office.</P>
      <P>Yin's body was found in Suao Harbor in eastern Taiwan on Dec. 9,
1993 after he had been collecting evidence about alleged
irregularities concerning the Navy's procurement of four German-made
minesweepers and six French-made frigates.</P>
      <P>The investigation into his death had bogged down over the past
six years as several arms brokers competing for contracts to provide
the navy with the warships fled the island shortly after Yin's death.</P>
      <P>Recent reports from Paris saying that huge kickbacks were paid to
Taiwan officials for the deal of six frigates fueled speculation that
Yin's death was just the tip of an iceberg, and that where was a ploy
to cover up massive corruption involving senior military officers and
government leaders.</P>
      <P>The investigation of Yin's death got a shot in the arm after
President Chen Shui-bian on July 30 ordered the establishment of an
ad hoc panel, with State Public Prosecutor-General Lu Ren-fa as its
head, to look into the case.</P>
      <P>After prosecution, police, investigation and military circles
pitched in to renew the probe, the Control Yuan on Wednesday joined
in the hunt for Yin's murderer or murderers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yin's widow Lee Mei-kuei visited the Control Yuan that
morning, where she produced two photos of Yin's body taken after it
been retrieved from the sea.</P>
      <P>Lee, who said she has not had a chance to talk with Wang over the
past six years, said she wants to show the secretary the photos to
let her see how cruel the murder was and how sad it was for Yin to
die in such a way.</P>

      <P>New Party legislative caucus convener Lai

data from the DOH.</P>
      <P>He added that the total annual deficit of DOH-run hospitals

structure and excessive personnel costs, the government must
subsidize these hospitals to the tune of NT$6 billion each year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT VOWS NO COMPROMISE ON `BLACK GOLD' CRACKDOWN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Wednesday
reaffirmed the government's "no compromise" determination to wipe out
"black gold" and establish clean politics in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen made the pledge in a speech delivered at the opening of an
inter-ministerial meeting on the new government's anti-black gold
crackdown, which refers to eradicating any connection between
organized crime and the government.</P>
      <P>Chen said his administration has consistently given top priority
to clamping down on organized crime, official corruption, and
gangster involvement in politics.</P>
      <P>"We will never compromise on this mission, no matter how
difficult it is to accomplish the goal," Chen pledged, adding that
all relevant government agencies should drop their parochial
mentality and work hand-in-hand in anti-black gold operations.</P>
      <P>Noting that the public have high expectations of the new
government's reform programs, Chen said all law enforcement officers
should adopt an active, aggressive working attitude to live up to
public expectations of putting an end to black gold politics and
establishing "rule by the clean and upright."</P>
      <P>Chen outlined three guiding principles for the government's
anti-black gold crusade:</P>
      <P>-- Taking concrete action to signify the government's
determination to engage in an all-out war on black gold, regardless
of the stature or rank of officials allegedly involved in bribery
scandals or kickback schemes;</P>
      <P>-- Shedding the old "bureaucratic thinking and mentality" and
upholding a team spirit in carrying out anti-black gold operations;
and</P>
      <P>-- Dealing with all anti-black gold cases in a just, impartial
manner, abiding by all legal procedures and avoiding infringing upon
the basic human rights of suspects in probing those cases.</P>
      <P>Chen encouraged all government officials to adopt a "do more and
talk less" attitude and to use concrete measures to win the hearts
and minds of the public. "All members of the new government team
should redouble their efforts and achieve solid results to prove the
government's anti-black gold determination. Otherwise, the public
will lose patience and confidence in the government," he cautioned.</P>
      <P>To show its no-nonsense, no-compromise attitude toward
"black-gold" politics, Chen said, the new government set up a
national anti-black gold action center under the Public Prosecutors'
Office of the Taiwan High Court on July 1 and formed a special task
force on Aug. 1 to probe the high-profile 1993 murder of navy captain
Yin Ching-feng.</P>
      <P>Chen especially cited the Yin case to stress the importance of
cooperation among various government units and even military agencies
in investigating the highly complicated and controversial criminal
case allegedly involving the country's warship procurement projects
in the 1990s. "We will probe the case to the maximum degree, no
matter how many incumbent or former military servicemen and
government officials are suspected of being involved," he added.</P>
      <P>The inter-ministerial anti-black gold meeting was organized by
the Ministry of Justice to discuss major problems and possible
difficulties in carrying out relevant missions.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the occasion, Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan said the
meeting was designed to strengthen communication and coordination of
relevant government agencies in anti-black gold operations in order
to enhance operational efficiency.</P>
      <P>The meeting brought together more than 200 officials from the
newly established anti-black gold action center, and prosecution,
police, investigation, military police agencies, as well as the
Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications, the Public Construction Commission and other related
government departments.</P>
      <P>The justice minister said the anti-black gold action center has
so far received 163 applications for investigating corruption,
kickback and other criminal charges. Seventy-two of those cases have
been assigned to suitable law-enforcement offices for investigation
and the remaining 91 cases are being handled by the action center.</P>
      <P>He said there will "no ceiling, no bottom line and no deadline"
for probing anti-black gold cases. Noting that the action center will
focus its operations on cracking down on organized crime, official
corruption and vote-buying, Chen said the action center has singled
out 17 major categories of public projects for close monitoring,
including infrastructure construction bidding, huge procurement
programs and business license applications.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JOINT COMMITTEE TO BE FORMED TO CRACK DOWN ON MILITARY CORRUPTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 9 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government decided on Wednesday to form
a joint committee of military and judicial prosecutors to effectively
crack down on corruption in military procurement operations.</P>
      <P>The decision was made at a national rally convened by President
Chen Shui-bian to demonstrate the government's determination to stamp
out "black gold" in politics -- special links between government
agencies, vested interest groups and organized crime syndicates.</P>
      <P>In line with a proposal made by Taipei District Prosecutor Chen
Rue-jen at the rally, it was decided to recruit investigative units
of the Coast Guard Administration, military police and prosecutors to
join forces with the "black gold crackdown center" under the Taiwan
High Court.</P>
      <P>Chen currently also serves as head of a special ad hoc group
composed of Taipei district prosecutors and investigative officers of
the Criminal Investigation Bureau that is probing the death of naval
captain Yin Ching-feng, former chief of the navy's military
procurement office who is widely believed to have been assassinated
in 1993 to stop him from blowing the whistle on corruption in the
navy's purchase of six French-made Lafayette battle ships.</P>
      <P>The joint committee will hold meetings periodically to exchange
opinions and pool government sources to fight against black gold, and
especially corruption in the military's weapons procurement, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, military corruption is a fierce "black hole"
which sucks up the country's economic strength, as military budget
totals more than NT$400 billion per year. If military procurement
personnel are illegally linked to gang organizations, it will slash
the country's combat capabilities terribly, he noted.</P>
      <P>As military prosecutors, in compliance with Republic of China
law, are granted greater access to information in secret military
establishments than ordinary judicial prosecutors, Chen said they
will be a great help in investigating cases related to corruption in
military procurement.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Cultural
Affairs (CCA) launched a trend-setting program on Wednesday to scout
for qualified hopefuls to join its staff roster.</P>
      <P>The council said all those who are qualified for 10th- to 12th-

work are welcome to apply before Aug. 31 to head the CCA's first and
third departments and the National Taiwan Museum, which is under the
CCA's jurisdiction.</P>

candidates will be required to present their civil service
accreditation certificates, detailed resumes, career plans and papers
detailing their vision of the nation's cultural development.</P>
      <P>In the second stage, the CCA will organize a special panel of
judges to interview those who make the first cut to examine their
professional expertise, career goals and work ethics. The jurors will

competent and dedicated cultural professionals to work for our
country and people and help boost our cultural renaissance and

    <HEADLINE>US CONGRESSMAN PROTESTS BAN ON MEETING WITH PRESIDENT CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  9  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A US congressman has demanded the
Department of State ease its restrictions on ROC President Chen
Shui-bian's activities during his upcoming transit stay in Los
Angeles, Capitol sources said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>President Chen is scheduled to arrive in Los Angeles on Aug. 13
for a brief stopover on his way to Central America for his first
state visit since taking the helm of the Republic of China on May
20.</P>
      <P>An aide to Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) told CNA that
several pro-Taiwan US congressional members have expressed interest
in meeting with Chen in private during his Los Angeles stopover.
However, the ROC representative office in Washington, D.C. has
politely turned down all requests for arranging meetings with Chen.</P>
      <P>As Rep. Rohrabacher was fully aware that the true reason behind
the ROC representative office's refusal was pressure from the Clinton
administration, his aide said, the congressman already wrote to
Assistant Secretary of State Stanley Roth urging the State Department
to lift its improper ban on informal meetings between President Chen
and US lawmakers.</P>
      <P>According to his aide, Rohrabacher said in his letter dated on
Tuesday that he was disappointed by the Clinton administration's
continued sacrifice of its ties with Taipei simply for coddling
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Rohrabacher was quoted as saying in his letter that the Clinton
administration's stringent restrictions on Chen's transit activities
provide yet another evidence to its kowtowing to Beijing.</P>
      <P>The US lawmaker further said if the United States wants to
maintain its leadership in the democratic world, it should let
President Chen and his entourage enjoy their basic rights to freedoms
of speech and assembly during their transit stay in Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>The State Department announced on Monday that it will grant a
transit visa to Chen with the understanding that no public
activities will be on his agenda during his stopover in the United
States.</P>
      <P>The arrangement is designed "for the safety and convenience of
the traveler," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said,
adding that there are no meetings expected with any Clinton
administration officials during Chen's stopover.</P>
      <P>Despite Beijing's consistent objection, the United States has
usually allowed transit visas for senior ROC leaders on the condition
that they refrain from any public activities while on US soil.</P>
      <P>Due to his hectic schedule, President Chen will stay in Los
Angeles for only about 15 hours. His first overseas trip as the
ROC's head of state will take him to the Caribbean nation of the
Dominican Republic, and Nicaragua and Costa Rica in Central America,
as well as the Gambia, Burkina Faso and Chad in West Africa.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA INCREASES MISSILE-RELATED ASSISTANCE TO PAKISTAN: CIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug. 9 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Intelligence Agency said in
its latest National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) that Communist China
appears to have honored its pledge not to expand aid beyond Iran's
two nuclear projects, but it accused Beijing of increasing
missile-related technical assistance to Pakistan in the second half
of last year.</P>
      <P>First disclosed by congressional aides in late July and then
reported in The Washington Times on Wednesday, the non classified
version of the NIE report, which reviewed nonproliferation
developments during the last half of 1999, was made public by the
CIA.</P>
      <P>The CIA pointed out that mainland Chinese companies also provided
missile-related items, raw materials, and/or assistance to several
countries of concern to the United States, including Iran, North
Korea, and Libya.</P>
      <P>"The Chinese have taken a very narrow interpretation of their
nonproliferation commitment," noted the CIA report. Beijing has
promised not to export whole missile systems and denied selling them
to Pakistan, but it has refused to sign the Missile Technology
Control Regime or abide by its ban on sales of missile components.</P>
      <P>The CIA added that the United States has failed to stop the
increasing flow of Russian aid to Iran's missile and non conventional
weapons program, saying Washington's appeal to Moscow for an end to
the transfer of missile technology to Tehran has fallen on deaf ears.
The result is that Iran has significantly advanced its program to
develop such intermediate-range and long-range missiles as the
Shihab-3 and Shihab-4.</P>
      <P>"The Russian government's commitment, willingness, and ability to
curb proliferation-related transfers remains uncertain," stressed the
CIA report.</P>
      <P>The CIA said Iran's non conventional weapons program is also
being assisted by Communist China, North Korea, and Western Europe.
This includes the construction of chemical weapons plants and missile
production facilities. In addition, Syria has obtained
missile-related equipment from Russia and North Korea and is building
a solid-fuel missile motor plant in its drive to develop
intermediate-range missiles.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia has deported 22 boat people to
mainland China less than one month after they landed illegally in
Cairns, Queensland, said Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock in a
written statement.</P>
      <P>The statement, faxed to the CNA on Thursday morning, said the 22
male Chinese nationals were flown from Port Hedland in Western
Australia where they had been held in detention since July 15.</P>
      <P>Ruddock said that "the removal of the illegal arrivals showed the
value of cooperation between countries that are determined to end
people smuggling rackets and also the futility of trying to enter
Australia illegally."</P>
      <P>"The return of the 22 illegals is a further example of the
ongoing cooperation that exists between the Australian and Chinese
governments," he added.</P>
      <P>Between July 1999 and the first half of 2000, more than 4,000
illegal immigrants landed in Australia, with most of them coming from
Afghanistan, the Middle East, Turkey, and other Asian countries,

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The country's new police chief pledged on
Thursday that he will push for the establishment of a
service-oriented management system to reduce crime rate and more
effectively maintain law and order.</P>
      <P>Wang Chin-wang, new director-general of the National Police
Administration (NPA) under the Ministry of the Interior (MOI), made
the remarks after assuming office.</P>
      <P>Wang, who, at 53, is the Republic of China's
youngest-ever national police chief, said the public have high
expectations of enjoying a safe, crime-free living environment.</P>
      <P>"All police staff should treat all members of the general public
as their clients and help them resolve problems," Wang said, adding
that police should not reject handling of burglaries on the excuse
that they are minor criminal cases.</P>
      <P>Wang said the NPA will crank out forward-looking work plans to
step up criminal investigations, protect women and children's
safety, prevent juvenile crime, improve traffic conditions and lower
traffic accidents.</P>
      <P>In this democratic era, Wang said police must reach out to
ordinary people and develop close ties with grassroots communities
to understand their demand.</P>
      <P>Wang also promised to promote structural and systematic reforms
to enable all police officers to continuously acquire new knowledge
and expertise so as to enhance individual and group competitiveness
and operational efficiency.</P>
      <P>Wang succeeded Ting Yuan-chin who resigned over the Pachang
Creek tragedy which claimed four lives due to a government
rescue fiasco.</P>
      <P>Wang took his oath of office in a joint swearing-in ceremony
presided over by Interior Minister Chang Po-ya.</P>
      <P>Also sworn in by Chang at the same ceremony were new National
Fire Administration (NFA) Director-General Chao Kang and new National
Police University President Chu Cheng-min.</P>
      <P>Chao took over the top NFA post from Chen Hung-yi who, like
Ting, quit over the Pachang Creek incident which also resulted in the
resignation of Vice Premier Yu Shyi-kun last month.</P>
      <P>Both Ting and Chen have retired from public services after their
departure from their posts to assume the political
responsibility for the Pachang Creek tragedy.</P>
      <P>On July 22, people in Taiwan watched in horror and anxiety as
live TV beamed the image of four hapless workers huddled together in
the raging Pachang Creek in the southern county of Chiayi waiting for
rescue helicopters until they finally lost their footing and were
swallowed by the surging current.</P>
      <P>For more than two hours, the three men and a woman waited for a
helicopter rescue which was only a five-minute flight away, as the
Air Force's Seagull Rescue Team is stationed nearby. However, the
various authorities -- firefighters, police and military -- were
unable to agree as to who was responsible for rescue, and the petty
bureaucratic wrangling of low-level pen-pushers led directly to the
death of all four people.</P>
      <P>Their deaths triggered a public uproar and shaved about 20
percentage points off Chen's popularity ratings.</P>

      <P>Tang underwent a medical examination at Veterans General Hospital
on Wednesday after complaining of dizzy spells. He continued to take

various administrative plans.</P>
      <P>Some observers have speculated that Tang's latest illness might

ability to head the Executive Yuan by Democratic Progressive Party

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior official of the Ministry of
Finance said here on Thursday that it still has technical problems
concerning local banking institutions that wish to set up offices in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's banking regulations say that if local banks want to set
up offices in a "third country" -- meaning mainland China -- the
application should be made by an overseas branch. Many banks in
Taiwan do not fulfill Beijing's requirements as to total assets, Vice
Minister of Finance Sean C. Chen.</P>
      <P>According to Beijing's rules, a Taiwanese bank is regarded as a
foreign institution, so its total assets should surpass US$20 billion
and it should be able to show a profitable record for several years
if it wishes to set up an office in mainland China. At present, a
total of 14 local banks meet those qualifications, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that in addition to these technical problems,
authorities in Beijing may ask the bank's home country to present a
certification before allowing its mainland branches the freedom to
trade in renminbi. It remains unclear whether Beijing would accept a
certification bearing the official name of the Republic of China, he
added.</P>
      <P>Chen made these remarks at a breakfast meeting with members of
the opposition People First Party's caucus in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Financial officials who were present at the meeting included

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10  (CNA)
(By Alice Liang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The output of Taiwan's computer products
surged in the first half of this year, according to a report issued
on Thursday by the Institute for Information Industry (III).</P>
      <P>Production of personal computers (PC's) was up a whopping 60.45
percent annually during the first six months of 2000, that of
notebook computers rose by 50.46 percent during the same period, and
that of motherboards grew by 30.44 percent, the III said. However,
the III noted that output of most computer peripherals failed to keep
pace, with an exception being digital camera production, which rose
by 50.1 percent during the same period.</P>
      <P>Despite the huge increase in production of PCs, revenues from
their sales grew by just 10.79 percent compared to the year-earlier
period, to reach US$3.6 billion, according to the report. Meanwhile,
revenues from sales of notebook computers and motherboards were up
40.92 percent and 20.66 percent, respectively. In comparison, sales
of digital cameras grew by some 227 percent to reach about US$400
million.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CALLS FOR ARMED FORCES POLICE HELP IN ANTI-BLACK GOLD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Thursday
urged the armed forces police to assist law enforcement officers
in sweeping away "black gold" and establishing clean politics in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen made the call during an inspection tour of the Armed Forces
Police Command (AFPC) in Taipei, also the last stop of his first
nationwide "journey of national defense" as the Republic of China
military's supreme leader.</P>
      <P>Chen was accompanied by Vice President Annette Lu, Defense
Minister Wu Shih-wen, Chief of the General Staff Tang Yao-ming and
other senior military officers on his AFPC inspection visit.</P>
      <P>The president received a grand welcome from the AFPC's newly
formed honor guards band. AFPC Commander-in-Chief Yang Yu-tsun then
briefed Chen on AFPC's operations and future work plans.</P>
      <P>In his speech to AFPC staff, Chen said as the AFPC is
responsible for safeguarding capital, it plays a pivotal role in
defending the security of the country's political and military
centers.</P>
      <P>Noting that mainalnd China has stepped up development of
high-technology-oriented partial war strategy and "acupuncture
warfare" strategy, Chen said Taiwan's political and military
centers will certainly become the prime targets of mainland Chinese
attack.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Chen said, establishing a modern, professional elite
military police force is one of the priorities of Taiwan's military
build-up plans.</P>
      <P>Chen further said that under the military's ongoing 10-year
troops reduction plan, the AFPC's functions have been adjusted
and streamlined.</P>
      <P>In addition to defending the government and military command
centers and major public facilities, Chen said, the AFPC should also
share the responsibilities of safeguarding military barracks security
and maintaining law and order in local society.</P>
      <P>Chen further said the APPC should focus on helping
crackdown on smuggling of humans, contraband goods, narcotics and
firearms, as well as on eradicating organized crime and gangster
involvement in politics, also known as "black old" which is seen as
a malignant tumor to Taiwan's political and economic development.</P>
      <P>To accomplish these anti-"black gold" missions, Chen said, all
AFPC staff members should beef up their professional criminal
investigation capability and expertise.</P>
      <P>In response, AFPC Commander-in-Chief Yang Yu-tsun said the AFPC
has set up four special task forces, stationed in northern,
central, southern and eastern parts of the island respectively, to
assist law enforcement officers in anti-black gold operations.</P>
      <P>President Chen began his nationwide "journey of national defense"
on June 16 when he reviewed a military cadets exercise at the
Chinese Military Academy in Fengshan, southern Taiwan as part of the
celebrations of the school's 76th founding anniversary.</P>
      <P>Over the past two months, Chen has visited all major military
units around the country and presided over new warplanes and warships
commissioning ceremonies.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to start his 13-day, six-leg diplomatic
tour on Aug. 13, which will take him to the ROC's allies in the
Caribbean, Central America and West Africa. This will be his first
overseas visit since taking office on May 20. After ending the trip
on Aug. 26, Chen will preside over the opening of an annual combined
services military drill, code-named Han Kuang No. 16.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DRAFT BUDGET MEETS ONLY 80% OF DEFENSE NEEDS: DEFENSE MINISTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The defense budget for fiscal year 2000
meets only 80 percent of the needs of the island's defense forces,
and should not be cut anymore, said a defense official on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Huang Yi-li, an planning official under the Ministry of National
Defense (MND), told a hearing called by Legislator Chin Hui-chu that
although the NT$271.9 billion (US$8.77 billion) in defense
expenditures in the government's draft budget for 2000 is NT$1.6
billion more than that of 1999, it falls far short of the NT$324.2
billion (US$10.45 billion) required by the MND.</P>
      <P>As a result, the MND will be forced to prioritize programs aimed
at improving operational readiness, such as preparations for
cyberspace warfare, operational support and the replacement of aging
weaponry equipment.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, non-operational expenditures, such as
administrative expenses and expenditures for vehicles' fuel, will be
cut because of the shortfall in the budget, said Huang.</P>
      <P>Stopping short of asserting that this year's tight defense budget
will jeopardize Taiwan's national security, the officer cautioned
that any further Legislative Yuan cuts in the already-stretched
budget would spell trouble for the MND.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's notebook computer suppliers will
enjoy a 60 percent share of the worldwide market this year, according
to a report released on Thursday by the Institute for Information
Industry (III).</P>
      <P>III senior analyst Chen Wen-tang said that major Japanese firms
such as Sony, Toshiba, and NEC have all increased their orders of
Taiwan-made notebook computers, which will allow Taiwan's notebook
suppliers to dominate the worldwide market.</P>
      <P>Chen added Taiwan's notebook computers have been No. 1 in the
world in terms of total shipments for two years running, beating out
their competitors worldwide, including Korean firms such as LG and
Samsung.</P>
      <P>Chen forecasted that unless the government stands in the way,
production of notebook computers will gradually shift to mainland
China starting from the third and fourth quarters of this year, as
manufacturers look forward to taking advantage of lower production
costs on the mainland. Most of Taiwan's personal computer firms have
moved their production facilities to the mainland China already.</P>
      <P>The report also noted that Taiwan's OEM and ODM computer
manufacturing during the first six months of the year increased by an

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS NOT MAINLAND'S BIGGEST ISSUE: MAC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Berlin,  Aug.  9  (CNA)
(By James Kuo and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main issue being debated at an annual
meeting of Beijing leaders is not mainland China's relations with
Taiwan but rather its domestic economic and political dilemmas, said
Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Lin Chong-pin here on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking on mainland China's domestic issues and cross-strait
relations at an annual meeting of overseas Chinese in Europe, Lin
said that the mainland's top brass and party leaders are currently
more worried about economic development and domestic unrest than they
are about Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the Beidaihe meeting is about whether authorities
in mainland China should break through a political bottleneck in
order for economic development to continue or let conservatives
retain their power and interests, which risks worsening social
instability.</P>
      <P>As evidence of increasing instability on the mainland, he cited a
little-known riot that took place in northeastern China in February
that involved over 100,000 people, including servicemen from a
nuclear submarine base in the vicinity. He said that it received
virtually no publicity because of a ban on media coverage in the
area.</P>
      <P>He added that riots by farmers are commonplace, but that they are
scattered across mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lin said that most people in Taiwan observing cross-strait
relations only look at the exchanges and fail to realize that the
mainland's domestic situation has a big effect on how Beijing deals
with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan's mainland policy should emphasize patience,
and that the best way to handle Beijing's continued push for its "one
China" principle before restarting bilateral negotiations is to
return to the "spirit of 1992," which circumvents problems that
cannot be solved at the moment to focus only on those that can be
worked out.</P>
      <P>Lin also warned that mainland China is not about to back down on
its military buildup, regardless of whether the United States decides
to establish a National Missile Defense system.</P>
      <P>Wednesday's meeting is traditionally held each year before the
annual meeting of Chinese Associations in Europe, slated to begin on
Friday. It is the biggest annual event for overseas Chinese in
Europe.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR CALLS FOR APPROVAL OF HIS DEPUTY'S MAINLAND VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou on Thursday
urged the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) to approve Deputy Mayor Pai
Hsiu-hsiung planned visit to mainland China in line with the
government's pledge to promote exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Ma said since Pei is not an elected local government chief,
the Cabinet-level MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward the
mainland, should not reject Pei's mainland travel plan.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Ma said, the main purpose of Pei's mainland visit is
to attend an academic seminar on the population aging
problems.</P>
      <P>Noting that Pei is a well-known expert on the problems of
elderly people, Ma said Pei has been invited to attend the
seminar in his capacity as an expert on population graying
problems, not as a deputy mayor of Taipei.</P>
      <P>The MAC last month forced Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh to cancel
his plan to visit the southeastern mainland port city of Xiamen. Ma
said Pei's case is different from Hsieh's.</P>
      <P>"For one thing, Hsieh is an elected local government chief, while
Pei is not," Ma said, adding he hopes the MAC will approve Pei's
application to show the new Republic of China government's sincerity
to promote cross-strait exchanges and rapprochement.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma said he has been invited to attend a "Track II"
roundtable meeting on cross-Taiwan Strait issues and US
China policy to be held in New York from Aug. 14-15. Ma, himself a
former MAC vice chairman, will deliver a paper at the seminar.</P>
      <P>The non-governmental roundtable is sponsored by the National
Committee on American Foreign Policy, a noted US think tank which
enjoys enormous influence on the formation of US foreign policy. The
meeting will bring together about 20 scholars and experts from
Taiwan, mainland China and the United States.</P>
      <P>Ma said he believes that the three-way roundtable will help
promote cross-strait mutual understanding.</P>
      <P>Except for Ma, Taiwan delegates will include Soochow University
professor Kuo Cheng-liang and Lin Cheng-yi, head of the Institute of
European and American Studies of Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>Following his New York visit, Ma will visit several of Taipei's
sister cities in Central America to help cement the Republic of
China's diplomatic relations with its Central American allies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT ACCUSES BEIJING OF HYPOCRISY ON `ONE CHINA'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 10 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
on Thursday accused Beijing of hypocrisy in terms of its definition
of "one China," and reiterated Taiwan's rejection of Beijing's demand
that it embrace "one China" on Beijing's terms.</P>
      <P>Stopping short of naming names, Chen told visiting US Senator
Jack Reed that while some Beijing leaders have told Taiwan visitors
that "one China" does not necessarily refer to Beijing, they stick to
the claim on the international stage that "there is only one China of
which Beijing is the sole legitimate regime and Taiwan is a part."</P>
      <P>Beijing's differing versions of "one China" only betray its plot
to annex Taiwan and made the island a province of mainland China
through what it calls "peaceful reunification" and "one country, two
systems," said Chen.</P>
      <P>As a head of state elected by the people, Chen said he would be
over-stepping his authority if he were to accept Beijing's "one
China" without the people's mandate, as the majority of the people of
Taiwan do not consider the island to be "another Hong Kong or Macau."</P>
      <P>Just as the US administration is subject to the control of
Congress, the government of the Republic of China has to consult
public opinion when setting forth its policy toward the mainland, and
should give the people the final say on the issue of "one China."</P>
      <P>However, the president reiterated an offer he made on July 31
that Taipei is ready to resume contacts with Beijing "in the spirit
of 1992" if Beijing backs down on its insistence that Taiwan
reconfirm its commitment to the "one China" policy.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Beijing held intensive dialogue in 1992, which was
capped with the first meeting between the top cross-strait
representatives in Singapore the following year.</P>
      <P>Chen echoed US President Bill Clinton's call for the solution of
the Taipei-Beijing dispute through peaceful dialogue and respect for

government -- the Executive, Legislative, Judicial, Control, and
Examination Yuans -- at the Taipei Guest House.</P>

in good spirits during the course of the banquet.</P>
      <P>Tang was hospitalized the day before for a health checkup and
took the day off on Thursday to rest amidst nationwide concern over
his health, which prompted speculation on whether he intends to step
down. Government spokeswoman Chung Chin had quashed the speculation
on Tang's behalf earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the president briefed the five yuan heads on his
upcoming 13-day state visit to Latin America and Africa, and asked
them to take good care of domestic affairs while he travels abroad.</P>

spoke of feeling "at ease" about going abroad because he will be able
to maintain control over the domestic situation 24 hours a day.</P>
      <P>Wang added that the president told them of his "initial
understanding" of the content of an annual meeting of the Beijing
leadership, which he added should not manifest too many major
problems.</P>

the personnel issues regarding the 16th People's Congress; and the

    <HEADLINE>PETROCHEMICAL REPS ASK FOR EASING OF M'LAND INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  11  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Leaders from Taiwan's petrochemical
industry appealed to the government on Friday for a relaxation of
restrictions on mainland China-bound investment in order to allow the
up-stream petrochemical industry to invest on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chen Wu-hsiung, chairman of the Petrochemical Industry
Association of Taiwan and Lee Chih-tsun, president of Formosa
Plastics, Taiwan's plastics giant, along with eight other leaders of
the petrochemical industry, called on Economic Affairs Minister Lin
Hsin-yi to make clear their appeal.</P>
      <P>The industrial leaders asked the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) to give a green light to the up-stream petrochemical industry
to make investments on the mainland, accelerate the development of
the seventh and eighth naphtha cracking plants, review the
feasibility of rehabilitating the second naphtha cracking plant, and
expedite the privatization of state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp.
(CPC).</P>
      <P>Chen said the idea of liberalizing Taiwan's up-stream
petrochemical industry to allow for Taiwan companies to relocate to
mainland China to take advantage of cheap labor and land costs is a
consideration based on a globalization strategy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is doomed to loose out to South Korean companies in the
international field if ROC government authorities continue to adhere
to the "No haste, be patient" policy of keeping a tight rein on
Taiwanese investment in mainland China, warned Chen.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that Taiwan companies are still banned from
investing in major infrastructure construction projects in mainland
China, it was learned that the petrochemical industry has already
acted faster than the government in moving to tap mainland
possibilities.</P>
      <P>Unconfirmed sources said the Formosa Plastics Group has chosen
mainland China's southern port city of Ningbo as the location for its
second naphtha cracking plant in an attempt to revive a long-moribund
plan to develop a petrochemical complex in mainland China.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia is keen on exporting its
liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Taiwan and wants to boost its sales of
coal, iron ore, and crude oil, while also welcoming investment from
the island in its energy resources industry.</P>
      <P>The Australian message was voiced on Thursday at the 7th
Australia-Taiwan Joint Annual Energy and Mineral Trade, Investment
and Cooperation Consultations now under way in Perth, Western
Australia.</P>
      <P>Twenty two representatives of the Australian government and of
the LNG, coal, and iron ore industries are holding an annual meeting
with ROC delegates from the Energy Commission (EC) of the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, the Chinese Petroleum Corporation, the Taiwan Power
Company, and executives from the private sector.</P>
      <P>Australian LNG producers and exporters expressed their strong
desire to crack the LNG market in Taiwan, which has signed 20-year
contracts each with Indonesia and Malaysia to import more than 4
million tons of LNG from the two countries per year.</P>
      <P>Australian coal, iron ore, crude oil, and other resource industry
officials also want to boost their exports to Taiwan, citing their
reliability, adequate supplies, and competitive prices at extensive
briefings given to potential Taiwanese buyers on the first day of the
Perth meeting on Thursday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA, EC Executive Secretary Chen
Chao-yih said the ROC delegates also briefed Australian exporters on
Taiwan's energy requirements and resources in order to give them a
clearer picture of the island's economic development.</P>
      <P>Chen said he told the Australian delegates that Taiwan's energy
needs are forecast to nearly double by 2020.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's LNG imports are expected to increase
substantially over the next 20 years because of the island's gradual
shift towards the use of clean fuel to generate electricity.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan is now one of the few countries in Asia capable of
using LNG to generate its electricity, and Australian producers and
exporters have begun to realize the market potential.</P>

      <P>The United States would abandon the ANZUS

Australia refused to host early warning facilities for a US National
Missile Defense system, said Australian Foreign Minister Alexander

    <HEADLINE>SMUGGLED LIVE HORSES NABBED IN KINMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Aug.  11  (CNA)
(By K.Y. Ni and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kinmen coastal patrol forces on Friday
nabbed two live adult horses smuggled from mainland China and also
the illegal owner of the animals.</P>
      <P>Acting on a tip, members of the Kinmen Coastal Patrol (KCP) squad
moved into a small tract of coastal forest in Anchi, northern Kinmen,
during the small hours of Friday morning. There they discovered two
live horses grazing. Before long, a man, later identified as Hsu
Yuan-tsai, 51, appeared and tried to lead the horses away. The
coastal guards arrested Hsu and his illicit belongings.</P>
      <P>At the KCP headquarters, Hsu admitted to smuggling the animals
from across the Taiwan Strait to make ends meets as his business has
been suffering over the past year.</P>
      <P>While Hsu will be handed over to the Kinmen District Prosecutors'
Office for further questioning, the two horses will be sent to the
Kinmen County Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and
Quarantine where they are likely to be put down for quarantine
reasons, KCP sources said.</P>
      <P>The smuggled horses will likely be dealt with squarely and
quickly as Kinmen, located just 2.4 km off the mainland Chinese
coast, is believed to be the entry point into Taiwan of the deadly
O-strain virus that led to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease
(FMD) among Taiwan's cloven-hoofed animals last year, marking the
most destructive livestock epidemic in Taiwan in 70 years.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to KCP Head Shih Ta-cheng, mainland Chinese
citizens have become increasing daring and active in recent months,
sailing to Kinmen to conduct "small scale" trade with the Kinmen
locals.</P>
      <P>This "small scale" trade activity is so easy and widespread that
some Kinmen-based travel agencies have even incorporated it into
their tourist itineraries for visitors from Taiwan. If a tourist is
interested in taking a look at the illegal trade, the travel agency
simply makes a phone call, and within half an hour, mainland fishing
boats arrive at a predetermined spot where the tourists are not only
entertained by watching the transactions, but can also make purchases
of their own.</P>
      <P>Over the past months, Kinmen coastal patrol forces have
confiscated countless amounts of mainland-originating fish catch and
agricultural products, including meat, wheat, rice, peanuts, and
vegetables.</P>
      <P>Shih said the squad's crack down on smuggling will not relent
because the illicit activities have become increasingly prevalent.</P>
      <P>He urged Kinmen civilians to refrain from continuing the illegal
activities which only bring them a small amount of income at the
expense of national security and the overall economic interests of
Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND POLICY UNDER OVERALL REVIEW: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  11  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) is
conducting an overall review of Taiwan's policy toward mainland
China, with regulations governing bilateral exchanges as the main
screening focus, a senior official said on Friday.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen made the statement while meeting with
a group of watchdog Control Yuan members who made an inspection tour
of the MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward the mainland.</P>
      <P>Tsai said mainland policy formulation is one of the greatest
challenges faced by the new Republic of China government since its
inauguration on May 20.</P>
      <P>The international trade law expert-turned-policy planner said
the MAC is trying to maintain policy continuity, but also hopes to
make necessary policy adjustments to live up to public expectations.</P>
      <P>Tsai said Premier Tang Fei called a meeting of senior financial
and economic officials earlier this month to discuss current
regulations governing trade and economic exchanges across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Noting that both sides of the Taiwan Strait may be admitted to
the World Trade Organization (WTO) at the end of this year, Tsai
said the ROC must review and adjust its existing trade regime,
particularly measures related to cross-strait trade links to meet
WTO requirements.</P>
      <P>Tsai said no definite conclusions were reached at the meeting.
Nevertheless, Tsai said, the MAC will continue consultations
with other relevant government agencies and crank out suitable
amendment proposals in the near future.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MAC Vice Chairman Teng Chen-chung said the MAC is
mulling whether to allow local banks to set up representative
or liaison offices in mainland China.</P>
      <P>"We are considering the issue in an open, favorable manner,"
Teng said, adding that representative offices can collect information
and forge contacts, but are banned from operating money transfer or
capital movement deals.</P>
      <P>Teng said the ROC hopes mainland China can resume
cross-strait dialogue to discuss issues related to further
liberalization of bilateral trade, economic and financial exchanges
for mutual benefits.</P>
      <P>"We also look forward to seeing mainland China make a goodwill
response if the ROC allows its banks to set up representative
offices on the mainland in the near future," Teng said.</P>
      <P>On new Central Bank of China Deputy Governor Chen Shih-meng's
proposal that the government levy a "national security tax" on
Taiwanese investors in mainland China, Teng said the MAC
currently has no such a plan. "The MAC doesn't see a need to
collect the so-called 'national security tax' at the moment," he
added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>James Soong, chairman of the People First
Party (PFP), said on Thursday that the PFP will focus on the issues
of cross-strait peace and political reforms at the proposed
roundtable meeting of the heads of the three major political parties
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Soong, who arrived here on Thursday to attend the annual meeting
of overseas Chinese residing in Europe, made the remarks while
attending a luncheon given in his honor by overseas Chinese who
support the PFP.</P>
      <P>Soong, who stated the PFP puts the interests of the people above
the party, said he is willing to help the minority ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, adding that the PFP will take part in the
roundtable meeting on national affairs to seek stability and
prosperity for the people.</P>
      <P>Soong garnered 36.8 percent of the vote in Taiwan's March 18
presidential election, second behind Chen Shui-bian's 39.3 percent
of the DPP and ahead of KMT candidate Lien Chan's 23.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Soong said that if he joins hands with KMT Chairman Lien Chan at
the roundtable, this would mean that over 60 percent of Taiwan's
voters were in favor of pursuing cross-strait peace.</P>
      <P>He said that the cross-strait policy of the new government should
not be rash because this could lead to social instability and
possible military confrontation between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>He said that the PFP will seek to join hands with the KMT on this
issue in order to reflect the mainstream of society's thinking.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said that the PFP will unite with the DPP, which
will mean that 80 percent of Taiwan's voters aspire for political
reforms.</P>
      <P>Soong pointed to the kickback scandal in the government's
purchase of French-made Lafayette vessels, adding that even the
French government is investigating the matter and the new government
should again ask the French government to provide it with information
to probe the case.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Rejoicing over a victory in a five-year
lawsuit against a local cement manufacturer, members of two
aboriginal activist groups on Friday called for aboriginal people
around Taiwan to defend their ancestral lands.</P>
      <P>At a public hearing convened by aboriginal legislator Pa Yen-Ta
Lu, members of the Taroko Anti-Asia Cement Self-Saving Group and the
Taiwan Aboriginal Ethnic Policy Association claimed triumphantly that
"victory belongs to the determined."</P>
      <P>According to Tien Chun-chou, president of the Taroko Anti-Asia
Cement Self-Saving Group, Amis tribespeople in the eastern city of
Hualien filed a lawsuit against Asia Cement more than five years ago,
seeking redress for the cement makers' long-term usurpation of tribal
land and illegal exploitation of soil zoned by the government
specifically for aboriginal use.</P>
      <P>The aboriginal activist group also brought a lawsuit against the
Aboriginal Affairs Commission of Taiwan Province (AACTP), accusing
the provincial authorities of possibly receiving kickbacks from the
cement maker which resulted in the commission pressuring the
aborigines to give up their homes and farmland in Hualien's Hsiulin
Township.</P>
      <P>Over the past five years, according to Tien, Asia Cement and the
AACTP appealed against the aboriginal group on the grounds that Asia
Cement was legally allowed to explore the eastern lands to make
cement in accordance with government regulations.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, more than five years after the lawsuits were filed,
the Hualien District Court overturned an appeal by the AACTP, thereby
handing victory to the Taroko group.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the results, Yisak-Afu, chair of the Taiwan Aboriginal
Ethnic Policy Association, said the case will serve as an example and
a precedent, providing inspiration to other local aboriginal tribes
on how to fight to secure their own interests.</P>

      <P>She said that she plans to use this book as the basis for a

      <P>Lu also noted that the world will ring in the 21st century in
just five months, and that before its arrival, "we should altogether
end the guilt and mistakes of the 20th century."</P>
      <P>She also said that before the last international human rights day

      <P>The government has decided to use
desalination plants to provide a water supply for southern Taiwan,
Economics Minister Lin Hsin-yi said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The desalination plan was adopted as an alternative to the

President Chen Shui-bian following months of bitter protests by
Meinung residents and environmental activists who were outraged at
the plan to inundate one of the island's most pristine valleys.</P>
      <P>The initial stage of the plan will see four desalination plants
established on the outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu, while
feasibility studies will be conducted on the possibility of setting
up further plants to provide water to the Hsinchu Science-based
Industrial Park in northern Taiwan and other industrial zones.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the Meinung reservoir project will not be

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice
Chairman Teng Chen-chung said on Friday that an application by Taipei
Deputy Mayor Pai Hsiu-hsiung to visit mainland China will be
considered favorably if it complies with government rules.</P>
      <P>At a routine press conference at the MAC, Teng said that
according to existing regulations governing bilateral exchanges with
mainland China, Pai, as a political official, must submit an
application to the Ministry of the Interior, where officials from the
National Security Bureau, the Ministry of Justice and the MAC will
jointly screen the application and decide on whether to grant him
permission to visit the mainland.</P>
      <P>Teng stressed that Pai's proposed visit will be handled in a
manner equal to that accorded to Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh, who
planned to visit southern mainland Chinese city of Xiamen in early
July to bolster city-to-city exchanges. Hsieh's proposal was rejected
because he made his application too close to his stated date of
travel.</P>
      <P>Teng added that it is hoped that besides being in line with
government regulations, Pai's visit would also fully take into
account the nation's dignity and the principle of equality in such an
engagement.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou has already approved Pai's proposal to
visit Beijing and Shanghai between Sept. 4-13 to boost inter-city
exchanges, particularly in the fields of metropolitan development,
social welfare and cultural conservation.</P>

      <P>An opposition legislator said on Friday
that the president and former president should "return" to the public
diplomatic gifts received while in office.</P>
      <P>Shen Chih-hwei of the opposition People First Party made the

      <P>She said that when Taiwan's president or government officials
make visits to diplomatic allies abroad, they bring large amounts of

      <P>Shen pointed out that while these valuable presents are paid for
with taxpayers' money, gifts given in return are divvied up between

    <HEADLINE>NO NEW AID PROGRAMS TO BE SEALED DURING PRESIDENT'S UPCOMING TRIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will not sign any
new aid programs with any of the Republic of China's diplomatic
allies during his upcoming overseas trip, Foreign Minister Tien
Hung-mao said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Tien, who will accompany Chen on his Aug. 13-25 "journey of
friendship," said the main purpose of the trip is to cement relations
with the ROC's allies and display to the world Taiwan's democratic
achievements and smooth transition of power between different
political parties.</P>
      <P>"President Chen is not expected to discuss any new economic aid
programs with our allies during his first overseas trip as our head
of state," Tien stressed.</P>
      <P>The hectic 13-day journey will take Chen to the Caribbean nation
of the Dominican Republic, and Nicaragua and Costa Rica in Central
America, as well as three West African countries -- the Gambia,
Burkina Faso and Chad.</P>
      <P>Tien said the president will take advantage of his visits to
assure the six countries of his administration's determination to
continue carrying out existing cooperative programs based on the
existing foundations.</P>
      <P>"If our allies present any new ideas or make any new aid
requests, we'll take them back to Taipei for further evaluation and
consultations with relevant government agencies," Tien said, adding:
"At any rate, we will not make any aid promises, nor seal any aid
projects during the journey."</P>
      <P>Asked about his views of a press report claiming that the
Nicaraguan foreign minister has publicly said he will ask the ROC to
offer his country US$100 million in aid during Chen's visit, Tien
said he was not sure whether he believed the report. "If the report
were true, I would say that such remarks were inappropriate," he
noted.</P>
      <P>Tien said he would take advantage of the upcoming visit to
explore the truth and hold further discussion with relevant
Nicaraguan officials to clarify the ROC's stance on the issue.</P>
      <P>Responding to opposition legislators' criticism of the timing of
Chen's globe-trotting journey, Tien said the six-leg visit is of
great significance as it will allow the president to demonstrate to
the ROC allies his administration's sincerity in further
strengthening bilateral friendship and cooperation.</P>
      <P>Many opposition lawmakers have cast doubts on Chen's wisdom in
undertaking a long overseas journey at a time when the public is
losing confidence in his administration's ability to cope with the
host of problems facing the country due to the recent Pachang Creek
rescue bungle in which four people lost their lives.</P>
      <P>Tien said the president's state visits had been arranged before
the July 22 tragedy.</P>
      <P>"If we cancel the trip in the wake of the Pachang incident, our
international credibility will go bankrupt and our national image
will also be at stake," Tien warned.</P>
      <P>The minister further said Chen is highly concerned about domestic
problems exposed by the Pachang incident, but he added that the
Executive Yuan alone can address all those problems well.</P>
      <P>Touching on mainland China's move to invite the ROC's African
diplomatic allies to attend a Sino-African forum to be held in
Beijing in October, Tien said the diplomatic tussle between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait has a long history.</P>
      <P>"We have full information about Beijing's plan since it unveiled
the meeting schedule early this year. We have reached an
understanding with all of our African allies concerning the issue. If
any of our allies finally decide to attend the Beijing forum on the
grounds of promoting regional development, they will certainly inform
us in advance. And I believe that our allies will only dispatch
low-echelon civil servants to attend the meeting," Tien said.</P>
      <P>He further said the ROC will not pay an unreasonably exorbitant
price to court an "unfaithful" friend or ally.</P>
      <P>Due to Beijing's diplomatic embargo against Taiwan, the ROC
manages to maintain diplomatic ties with only 29 countries, most of
which are located in Latin America and Africa.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RAISING DEBT CEILING CAN RESOLVE FINANCIAL ISSUE: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 11 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei broke his silence for the
first time on Friday to stress that a moderate raising of the ceiling
on public debt is a practical way to resolve the financial problems
facing the government.</P>
      <P>Tang made the remarks when responding to requests by Hualien
County Magistrate Wang Ching-feng and Taichung City Mayor Chang
Wen-ying for financial aid from the central government for local
governments.</P>
      <P>Tang pointed out that while the financial difficulties of local
governments in Taiwan seem to stem from the central government's
allocation of tax revenues, they are actually a problem of "the
nation's financial allocation."</P>
      <P>The financial allocation issue stems from the imbalance of
expenditures and revenue. The government has not only spent a great
deal on social welfare payments, but has also paid a lot for
implementing educational and communications establishments. As a
result, tax revenues cannot balance outgoing revenue, according to
Tang.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that public debt and the privatization of
state-owned enterprises are the government's main financial
resources. However, Taiwan is facing an economic transition in which
traditional industries must upgrade their structure and productivity,
while high-tech industries have to break through a bottleneck.</P>
      <P>He added that tax increases will not be considered for the time
being, and that therefore, a moderate rise in the ceiling of the
public debt would be a better way to resolve the difficulty.</P>
      <P>He also expressed hope that the ruling and opposition parties
will reach a consensus on the modification of the debt ceiling after
holding careful and detailed discussions.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Vice Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said that if
the current public debt ceiling can be raised from the existing 15
percent of the annual budget to 25 percent, it would help the
government resolve the financial issue.</P>
      <P>However, the opposition Kuomintang said it would adopt a
conservative attitude toward Chang's proposal until next week, when
the KMT caucus at the Legislative Yuan meets.</P>
      <P>Vice Finance Minister Wang Teh-shan said that government revenues
are expected to increase by NT$160 billion per year if the debt
ceiling is readjusted to 25 percent.</P>
      <P>Peng Shao-chin, chief of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's caucus at the Legislative Yuan, said that the DPP supports
such a readjustment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN URGED TO CRACK DOWN ON CREDIT CARD CRIME</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  11  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of bankers on Friday urged the
Republic of China government to take effective measures to crack down
on credit card crime to prevent the island from becoming an
"Asia-Pacific financial crime center."</P>
      <P>The bankers made the call at a public hearing on credit card
crime, sponsored by opposition People First Party Legislator Chou
Hsi-wei.</P>
      <P>Senior executives from various local banks complained at the
hearing that credit card crime is rampant in Taiwan, partly because
punishments meted out in local courts according to ROC law are "too
lenient."</P>
      <P>They said even though their banks have taken many precautionary
and preventive measures, credit card crime is still increasing
rapidly in Taiwan. They pointed out that credit card-related criminal
activities will cost them, and a result the banking public, more than
NT$2 billion (US$64.52 million) this year.</P>
      <P>"This amount will greatly exceed the figure recorded in Japan,
thus giving Taiwan the dubious distinction of being the most
notorious credit card crime country in Asia," a bank executive
claimed.</P>
      <P>He said the most worrisome development is that organized crime is
moving into credit card crime in Taiwan. "The involvement of gang
syndicates has made it even more difficult to curb credit card
crime," he warned.</P>
      <P>Another bank executive said the most serious credit card crime is
when a criminal steals encoded credit card information and uses
the data to make a copy card. "There is no easy way to discern
problems with those copycards," he noted.</P>
      <P>In some cases, he said, gangsters pretend themselves to be
bank employees to swindle out victims' personal data for credit card
forgery purposes.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chou displayed an advertisement in a local
newspaper saying that forged credit cards are available at NT$30,000
apiece. "The advertisement indicates how devilish local credit card
forgery rings are," he lamented.</P>
      <P>Chou said the maximum prison term for credit card forgery is
five years in Taiwan, horter than Hong Kong's seven years,
Malaysia's 20 years, and America's 10 years.</P>
      <P>Noting that lenient punishments can't effectively deter credit
card crime in this high-tech world, Chou said he is drafting an
amendment bill to the current law to impose harsher penalities on
credit card convicts. "I hope the bill can be passed in the next
parliamentary sesion," he added.</P>

      <P>In an attempt to foster children's love of
nature, a local educational foundation on Friday urged Taiwan's
youngsters to support the release of the famous killer whale Keiko.</P>
      <P>The King Car Education Foundation suggested that local young
people surf related websites to get more information about Keiko's
release, and to become Keiko's friends.</P>
      <P>The killer whale Keiko, captured in waters off Iceland at 2 years
old, was trained to perform at sea parks in Canada and Mexico. In
1992, the film "Free Willy," produced by Warner Bros. Studios, made
the animal internationally famous. Now Keiko has completed his third
film.</P>
      <P>The Ocean Futures Society and some other environmental protection
organizations plan to release Keiko when a documentary film about the
whale has been completed.</P>
      <P>Morgan Sun, director general of the King Car Education
Foundation, said the time for Keiko's release to the open sea depends
on when he can be received by his fellow whales.</P>
      <P>Sun revealed that Keiko has recently been swimming in the ocean
while guided by trainers aboard ships, and has had "talks" with other
whales. The researchers have made detailed recordings of their
noises.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Press for Children will publish eight special
articles about Keiko's recent news and people interested in the whale
are welcome to visit the website -- www.mdnkids.com.</P>

      <P>The 26th annual Tseng Hsu-pai Journalism
Awards were handed out on Friday to Taiwan writers, reporters, and
photojournalists in recognition of their professional excellence and
their contributions to public service.</P>
      <P>Termed "Taiwan's Pulitzer" by respected local journalism pioneer
Ouyang Chun, this year's coveted Tseng Hsu-pai Journalism Academic
Award went to Fang Peng-cheng, an official of the Straits Exchange
Foundation, a quasi-official organization that handles communications
with mainland China. Fang's award-winning entry was his new book
called "Kueiku Tzu: The Art of Persuasion and Negotiation."</P>
      <P>Fang, a former correspondent for the Central News Agency,
systematically applied an ancient Chinese philosopher's teachings and
writings to persuasion and negotiation under the broader perspective
of mass communication theory. The panel of judges credited the work
with advancing the "sinolization" of local mass communication
studies.</P>
      <P>The Tseng Hsu-pai Journalism Awards were established in 1975 to
promote professionalism and public service in the domestic journalism
community. This year's awards ceremony was held in the conference
room of the CNA headquarters in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Hsu Chia-shih, a noted journalism scholar and a member of the
judging panel, told the recipients of the awards to be proud of their
accomplishments not only for the excellence of the works themselves,
but also for the impact their works have made in society -- an
important criteria in the judging process, he added.</P>
      <P>As if to drive home his point, three news teams received their
respective awards for providing comprehensive and nonstop coverage of
last year's devastating Sept. 21 temblor. It was the strongest
earthquake to hit Taiwan in almost 100 years, and about 2,400 people
were killed.</P>
      <P>A team of United Daily News (UDN) columnists won the Public
Service Newspaper Commentary Award for their in-depth analysis of the
various issues that surfaced in the wake of the earthquake, such as
flaws in some public construction that led to the collapse of
buildings, and the government's responses.</P>
      <P>Another UDN team of photographers took the Public Service
Newspaper Photography Award for capturing the disaster relief efforts
on camera and sharing them with the anxious Taiwan public.</P>
      <P>The third team, of the Min Sheng Daily, received the Public
Service Newspaper Reports Award for focusing on useful rescue and
medical information during the same disaster.</P>
      <P>An investigative study into the problems of radioactive building

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) has
earmarked NT$1 billion (US$32.26 million) in its budget plan for
fiscal 2001 for the upgrading of the locally built Ching-kuo
indigenous defense fighters (IDFs), a senior official said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Deputy Defense Minister Sun Tao-yu made the statement at a
hearing on the future of the IDFs, sponsored by a group of
legislators from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the
opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Sun said there is still ample room for the upgrading of the IDF
performance by improving avionics firing system and weaponry systems
installed in the warplane.</P>
      <P>Despite its limited budget, Sun said, the MND still has set
aside NT$1 billion in its fiscal 2001 budget plan for commissioning
state-run Aerospace Industry Development Corp. (AIDC) to further
upgrade the IDF performance.</P>
      <P>AIDC, the ROC's only aircraft manufacturer, is expected to
finalize an IDF upgrading plan by the end of this year, Sun said.</P>
      <P>AIDC was originally the aircraft manufacturing arm of the
military-run Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology (CIST),
but it was restructured into a corporation under the jurisdiction of
the Ministry of Economic Affairs a few years ago as part of the
government's plan to boost the island's aviation industry
development.</P>
      <P>The ROC Air Force originally planned to purchase 250 IDFs from
AIDC, but cut its order to 130 after it managed to buy 150 US-made
F-16 jet fighters and 60 French-made Mirage 2000-5 jet fighters.
These three types of jet fighters now form the backbone of the ROC's
second-generation air fleet.</P>
      <P>In the face of mainland China's mounting military threat,
President Chen Shui-bian said last month that the Air Force should
begin preparation for acquiring a new generation of warplanes to beef
up its air defense capability.</P>
      <P>Sun reported at the hearing that the MND has formed a special
task force to make a preliminary study of the possibility of
developing a third generation of warplanes at home or shopping for
suitable one abroad.</P>
      <P>Most lawmakers present at the hearing said they hope the MND can
commission CIST, AIDC and its satellite plants to develop a new
generation of aircraft for the Air Force in line with the
government's self-sufficiency defense policy.</P>
      <P>In response, Sun said the MND task force will make an overall
evaluation of technological requirements and cost efficiency and
other related factors before making a decision.</P>

according to the results of a recent survey released on Friday.</P>
      <P>The poll taken by the Interior Ministry found that as many as

while 64.3 percent of the public voiced a desire for greater
government security inspection of public facilities.</P>

starting Monday, but that it will appeal the CAA decision. "Not one
point fails to meet aviation safety requirements," Chou said of his
firm.</P>
      <P>Chou added that his company's financial problems have already
been "put back in order," and that he is not sure why the CAA still
believes U-Land is still in the midst of financial troubles.</P>
      <P>The CAA first noticed U-Land's financial problems at the end of
1998, Chang said, adding that the suspension of the company's flights
will not have too much of an effect on the public because U-Land only
offered a limited number of flights on three routes --
Taipei-Kaohsiung, Taipei-Kinmen, and Kaohsiung-Kinmen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN UNVEILS 5 QUAKE-ZONE RECONSTRUCTION PROJECTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Nantou,   Taiwan,   Aug.   11   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian
on Friday announced five new programs for speeding up reconstruction
of the central Taiwan areas hit by the 921 earthquake.</P>
      <P>Chen, who will leave Taiwan on Sunday for his first overseas trip
since taking office on May 20, made the announcement during an
inspection tour of the central county of Nantou which took the brunt
of the 7.6-magnitude earthquake that rattled Taiwan on Sept. 21 last
year.</P>
      <P>Chen first inspected a bridge reconstruction project in Nantou
County. The bridge, which linked the mountain township of Mingchien
to the outside world, was seriously damaged in the 921 earthquake.</P>
      <P>Chen said one of his major concerns before his departure for his
Aug. 13-25 overseas trip was the earthquake zone reconstruction
work. "Therefore, I took time out of my hectic schedule to visit
the area to see for myself the progress in the reconstruction
project."</P>
      <P>Chen urged the Nantou County Government, the Cabinet-level
Post-Earthquake Reconstruction Commission and other relevant
government agencies to coordinate and cooperate closely to
facilitate reconstruction work.</P>
      <P>"We need team spirit and concerted efforts to carry out the
daunting reconstruction task. If relevant government agencies cannot
shed parochial mindset and bureaucratic thinking, reconstruction
work cannot proceed smoothly and completion of all relevant projects
will be nowhere in sight," Chen noted.</P>
      <P>The president then announced five new measures designed to
speed up quake-zone reconstruction. First of all, the government
will offer additional low-interest loans to help earthquake victims
rebuild their houses; those whose homes were partially destroyed in
the quake will be given another one-year grace period for interest
payments for their original housing loans; and the government will
also raise a NT$2 billion fund for quake-zone business loans
guarantee.</P>
      <P>Second, the government will offer loans and subsidies for
developing new residential communities and new townships, promoting
rural development and urban renewal.</P>
      <P>Third, the government will raise a NT$10 billion fund in the
next three years for mudslide prevention projects in the earthquake
zone.</P>
      <P>Four, the government will push for the completion of repair work
for five major roads linking tourist attractions in Nantou County to
the outside world before April 2001.</P>
      <P>Five, the government will build a roving medical service network
within the next six months for all Nantou County villages that still
do not have any hospital or clinic.</P>
      <P>Chen told a group of legislators from both ruling and
opposition parties accompanying him on the inspection tour that the
government is drafting a special three-year budget plan for quake
zone reconstruction projects. "I hope all lawmakers of different
political colors could support the budget plan to facilitate
completion of major reconstruction programs in the next three
years," he added.</P>

      <P>Lee, Tan, and Chang are the only exchange students at the

maintain official diplomatic relations with the United States, and
their enrollment is seen as a breakthrough in ROC-US military ties.
Enrollment records from the three academies reveal that no cadets

      <P>Plasma televisions are expected to become mainstream consumer
electronics products over the coming five years, and Lee predicted
that business volume is expected to reach NT$3.5 billion for the

    <DATELINE>Berlin,  Aug.  11  (CNA)
(By James Kuo &amp; Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
Former Chairman Shih Ming-teh on Friday fiercely criticized President
Chen Shui-bian's administration and described the Chen administration
as a "clean and dirty" one which merely co-governs.</P>
      <P>Shih suggested that President Chen return to the basis of the
national constitution as soon as possible so as to resolve
difficulties resulting from the current constitutional controversy.</P>
      <P>President Chen, who has advocated the concept of "government for
all people" to substitute for party politics, has caused a lot of
difficulties which the new government has to resolve, Shih went on.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that DPP does not hold a majority of seats in the
Legislative Yuan, and needs the cooperation of opposition parties
when introducing any new policy or bill into the Legislative Yuan.
Without such cooperation, he said, any bill will be killed or
modified before the Legislative Yuan begins deliberating on it.</P>
      <P>Consequently, President Chen's concept of "clean" ruling would
demote his administration and transform it into one that is jointly
controlled by "the clean and the dirty," Shih said.</P>
      <P>Shih made these remarks in Berlin when addressing the 26th
meeting of Overseas Chinese Associations in Europe.</P>
      <P>High-ranking government officials and civic leaders, including
Legislative Yuan Vice President Yao Eng-chi and Opposition People
First Party Chairman James Soong, attended the meeting.</P>
      <P>Later on the same day, Chang Fu-mei, minister of the
Cabinet-level Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, said that the OCAC
will provide services to all overseas Chinese who hold Republic of
China passports, no matter their age or when they emigrated.</P>
      <P>President Chen also sent a televised congratulatory message to
the meeting, which was attended by more than 900 overseas Chinese

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
said on Saturday that no signs of a plane crash have been found off
Taiwan's northeastern coast.</P>
      <P>The ministry was responding to a report that a military aircraft
crashed into the sea off Tungao in the northeastern Taiwan county of
Ilan Saturday morning.</P>
      <P>The MND said it had contacted the Air Force combat command
center, the combat control radar station and the newly formed
national emergency rescue command center for information about the
crash report.</P>
      <P>"Our inquiries have proved that the report was speculation and
couldn't be substantiated by any concrete signs," an MND spokesman
said, adding that all the three agencies had not found any
signs showing an offshore plane crash.</P>
      <P>The Ilan County Government's fire department said it received a
report from a local citizen at 9:50 a.m. saying that he had seen a
military plane crash into waters off Tungao.</P>
      <P>The Ilan fire department immediately contacted the Navy's
Chungcheng base nearby. However, the naval base authority told the
fire department that there was not any military or commercial
airliner flying past the Ilan area during the period around the
reported time.</P>
      <P>Acting on the Ilan fire department notice, the airborne police
squadron and the naval patrol unit also sent a helicopter and patrol
ships, respectively, to search for signs of the reported mishap.
Neither unit found any signs and they also confirmed that no
aircraft flew over the Ilan skies during the period.</P>
      <P>Even before the MND contacted the national emergency rescue
command center, the center had received a notice from the Ilan fire
department. The center then approached the military information
service unit and civil aviation authority to check the flight
situation in the Ilan area. Both units said all military and
civilian planes were flying normally and that no plane crash had
been detected off the Ilan coast.</P>

      <P>A former chairman of the Republic of
China's ruling Democratic Progressive Party was released from the
hospital on Friday after recovering from a dizzy spell that doctors
said was caused by high blood pressure stemming from travel fatigue.</P>
      <P>Shih Ming-teh, now a legislator, was in Berlin to give a speech
to the 900-some guests in attendance at the 26th annual conference of
the Overseas Chinese Associations in Europe.</P>
      <P>Shih, who fiercely criticized ROC President Chen Shui-bian's
administration during his speech, had to end it abruptly when he
apparently became overly agitated and could not continue.</P>
      <P>He was later diagnosed at a nearby hospital as having blood
pressure as high as 190/118. However, Shih said that he called his
doctor in Taiwan who said he didn't think it was a stroke but merely
the symptoms of fatigue due to long travels.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Shih said that Chen's "government of all people"
-- as a substitute for party politics -- has caused numerous
difficulties for the new administration.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the ruling party does not hold a majority of
seats in the Legislative Yuan where Shih is a lawmaker, and needs the
cooperation of opposition parties when introducing any new policies
or bills. Without such cooperation, he said, any bill would be killed

      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Frank Hsieh on Saturday urged mainland China to produce a
president through popular elections so as to bridge the gap between
Taiwan and the mainland's political systems and public opinions.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who concurrently serves as Kaohsiung mayor, made his
remarks in response to press reports that the annual meeting of
mainland China's leaders at Beidaihe yielded a consensus that the
future development of cross-strait relations will depend on the
Taiwan public.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, whose party sent Chen Shui-bian to the Presidential Office
in the March 18 election, said that any political party or figure in
a democratic system must first persuade the people before making any
major changes.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that if Beijing wants to change how the Taiwan
public feels about mainland China, then improvements in the political
system and bilateral exchanges will be necessary.</P>
      <P>As an example of possible changes to the political system, Hsieh
said that if mainland China can produce a popularly elected
president, then it will go a long way toward improving bilateral
interactions.</P>
      <P>As to whether the DPP's attitude is shifting from a
pro-independence to a "one China" stance, Hsieh noted that no
political party's platform can successfully go against public
opinion, so a party is continuously developing according to the
wishes of the people.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian welcomes Singapore
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew's plan to visit the Republic of China,
a Presidential Office source said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The source was responding to a newspaper report that the
prominent former Singapore prime minister is scheduled to visit
Taiwan in late September at the invitation of President Chen.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, one of Chen's aides said as Lee has
expressed an interest in visiting Taiwan, President Chen is indeed
planning to invite the respected architect of independent Singapore
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the aide said details of the tour, including the
schedule, have yet to be cranked out.</P>
      <P>Chen has made no secret of his admiration for Lee's achievements
in making Singapore one of the world's most competitive economic
powerhouses. During his 1994-1998 stint as Taipei mayor, Chen made
four visits to the Southeast Asian city state. On each of his
Singapore visits during that period, he met with Lee for
wide-ranging talks.</P>
      <P>Lee has maintained close relations with the top leaders on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait. He was reportedly to be instrumental in
pushing for a historic meeting between top envoys from Taipei and
Beijing in Singapore in April 1993.</P>
      <P>But Lee has gradually suspended his mediatory role in recent
years due to his different views with former ROC President
Lee Teng-hui on cross-strait relations and basic political
concepts. He last visited Taipei in 1994.</P>
      <P>During his visit to Beijing in June this year, Lee reportedly
exchanged views with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
Premier Zhu Rongji on the development of cross-strait relations
after the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) came
to power in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>After his Beijing visit, Lee has on several occasions urged
Taiwan and mainland China to resume talks this year, saying it would
be dangerous to drag out the current stalemate.</P>
      <P>Taipei's United Daily News said in a front-page report on
Saturday that Lee is likely to visit Taipei late next month to
assist with future cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>President Chen's aide said it's too early to talk about whether
Lee would resume his intermediary role in cross-strait engagement.
Moreover, the aide said, Lee's Taiwan visit is still on the
drawing board as no details have so far been worked out.</P>
      <P>Relations across the Taiwan Strait soured after former President
Lee described cross-strait ties as a "special state-to-state
relationship" in an interview with a German radio station in July
last year.</P>
      <P>Lee's remarks were deemed by Beijing to be a departure from the
"one China" principle, and Beijing launched military exercises along
the southeastern mainland coast to intimidate the island. The PRC
considers Taiwan to be part of its territory and has vowed to use
force against the island if Taipei was to declare independence.</P>

support behind the company's privatization project, which is soon to
move into the actual stock release phase.</P>
      <P>Chen said that his resignation should not affect the company's
ongoing plans and that he will continue to supervise the
privatization project until the Minister of Transportation and
Communication approves his resignation.</P>
      <P>He also urged the employees to cancel their trade union's plans
to stage a street protest on Wednesday against what they say is the
overpricing of more than 289 million shares.</P>
      <P>Chen, 66, said that he has been taking medicine to keep his high
blood pressure at bay over the past year and that his three children
are all abroad. After Chunghwa Telecom Vice President Lin Feng-cheng
fell to his death from Lin's office at the company's headquarters in
an apparent suicide, Chen said he has come to believe that indeed
nothing is constant in life.</P>
      <P>Chen, whose first job was at Chunghwa Telecom, added that the
company is right on the edge of privatization, so he asked for
support from all quarters to ensure the future development of the
enterprise.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that privatization is an international trend
but that much remains to be done and that the rights of the employees
must be given consideration. Talent abounds in the industry, so he
said that after he leaves, "tomorrow will be even better than today."</P>
      <P>The MOTC on Aug. 4 approved a plan to auction off 3 percent of
the government's stake in Chunghwa Telecom within two weeks. The
offered price for each of the shares up for grabs was set at NT$104
(US$3.35) on Aug. 4 by a share price appraisal committee comprised of
government officials.</P>
      <P>The price provoked anger among Chunghwa Telecom employees, who
said the price is much higher than the NT$60 passed by the
legislature earlier in the year and makes it difficult for them to
afford.</P>
      <P>The auction in late August is part of the first phase of a
privatization plan in which a total of 33 percent of the government's
shares in Chunghwa Telecom will be sold off. It is expected that the
auction will augment government coffers by at least NT$30 billion.</P>
      <P>During the first phase of privatization, the government will also
release 13 percent of the shares for public subscription in Taiwan, 5
percent for company employees' subscription, and 12 percent for
listing on the New York Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>The first phase of privatization is expected to be completed by
the end of this year. The government plans to release another 33
percent of its shares in February next year, with a goal of complete
privatization by the end of June.</P>
      <P>The two phases of privatization are expected to raise at least
NT$660 billion for the government. At present, Chunghwa Telecom is
owned entirely by the MOTC and has capital assets totaling NT$96.48
billion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN REMAINS UNDECIDED ABOUT NUC POST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office on Saturday denied
a newspaper report that President Chen Shui-bian has decided to
serve as chairman of the National Unification Council (NUC).</P>
      <P>Deputy Secretary-General to the President Eugene Chien made the
denial in response to a China Times report that President Chen
agreed to head the NUC after consultations with former President Lee
Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>The Chinese-language Taipei daily said Chen, a stalwart of the
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), originally
planned to invite a Kuomintang heavyweight to head the NUC, an
advisory board founded by the previous KMT-led government to provide
the president with counseling services concerning the development of
relations across the Taiwan Strait and the promotion of eventual
cross-strait unification under freedom and democracy.</P>
      <P>According to the paper, the KMT heavyweight had discussed Chen's
offer with former President Lee, also a former KMT chairman, and
incumbent KMT Chairman Lien Chan. Both Lee and Lien reportedly gave
a thumbs-down to Chen's proposal because they thought that the
Chen-proposed arrangement would downgrade the NUC's status.</P>
      <P>During the KMT era, Lee himself served as the NUC chairman. The
China Times said Lee was afraid that if Chen refuses to serve as NUC
chairman and instead names a KMT politician to head the council, the
already shaky cross-strait ties may become even worse.</P>
      <P>According to the paper, Chen has been reluctant to
take over the top NUC post as he frets that such a move may draw a
backlash from pro-independence DPP members. But the paper said Chen
is likely to assume the NUC chairmanship after a recent meeting with
Lee on the issue.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, Deputy Secretary-General to the
President Eugene Chien said the report was speculation, adding that
no decision has been made since the NUC has not discussed the issue.</P>
      <P>Chien said it remains uncertain how the NUC will operate in the
future. He further said the NUC will not convene until after the
newly formed cross-party task force on cross-strait relations begins
operations later this month.</P>
      <P>President Chen has appointed Academia Sinica President Lee
Yuan-tseh, a Nobel Prize-winning chemist, to head the
cross-party task force designed to forge a national consensus on
future cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>The task force, composed of 25 members from across the
political and social spectrum, is expected to provide advice and
research findings to President Chen on cross-strait ties-related
affairs.</P>
      <P>Lee, who unveiled a list of 25 panel members last weekend, said
he is convinced that the panel will be able to achieve concrete work
results in one year or two to help improve cross-strait relations
and maintain lasting peace in the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials of the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) announced on Saturday they are encouraging private
industries to build desalination plants to supply water to the Tainan
Science-based Industrial Park in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The desalination plan was adopted as an alternative to the
controversial Meinung reservoir plan that was shelved last week by
President Chen Shui-bian. The new plan, which will be established
along the southwestern Taiwan coast, will cost NT$3 billion (US$96.77
million) and will supply 30,000 tons of water per day when completed.</P>
      <P>Officials forecast that by 2006, the Tainan region's total water
demand will hit 224,200 tons per day, including 73,800 tons required
by the Tainan park, 57,700 tons by the Tainan Industrial Zone, 4,000
tons by the Dongshi industrial zone, and the water needs of southern
Taiwan residents.</P>
      <P>Officials added that the success of the Penghu area's
desalination plants provide an example of the effectiveness of such
a plan.</P>
      <P>The MOEA calculated that if the government's desalination plan is
put into practice along the western coast of Taiwan, it will provide
138,000 tons of water per day to Tainan Park, Changpin Industrial
District, the Yunlin area, and the biotechnology park in Chunan.</P>

Friday that left-wing overseas Chinese groups are using the
controversy created by her earlier remarks as an opportunity to sow
discord among overseas Chinese communities in the United States.</P>
      <P>Chang, who flew into San Francisco on Friday night from Berlin

of the OCAC to the effect that service provided by the OCAC to
overseas Chinese should be in accordance with a priority system based

      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian,
accompanied by a large entourage and members of the media, is
scheduled to leave here on Sunday for Los Angeles to conduct his
first state visits to the ROC's diplomatic allies in the Caribbean,
Central America, and Africa since assuming office on May 20.</P>
      <P>Officials accompanying President Chen on the trip will include
Secretary-General of the National Security Council Adm. (Retired)
Chuang Ming-yao, Foreign Minister Tien Hong-mao, Economics Minister
Lin Hsin-yi, Chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and

      <P>Touching on the purpose of Chen's upcoming overseas trip, the

      <P>Despite the fact that Chen's overnight stop in Los Angeles is

    <HEADLINE>ROC ENVOY MEETS TOP US NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   Aug.   11   (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's new
representative to the United States, Chen Chien-jen, has met with
White House National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, reliable sources
said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Sources said Berger held a secret meeting with Chen in a hotel
shortly after Chen, a career diplomat and former ROC foreign
minister, assumed office as the ROC's de facto ambassador to the
United States on July 7.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's diplomatic embargo against Taiwan,
meetings between senior US officials and the ROC representative
stationed in Washington, D.C. have consistently been kept secret.
The United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to
Beijing in 1979, but still maintains close substantive ties with the
ROC.</P>
      <P>The content and other details of the recent Chen-Berger meeting
remained unknown, the sources said. Neither the ROC representative
office in Washington, D.C. nor the Clinton administration would
confirm whether Chen and Berger did meet recently.</P>
      <P>Douglas Paal, president of the Washington-based think
tank Asia-Pacific Policy Center who once served in the White House
National Security Council during the Bush administration, said he
had heard of the meeting between Chen and Berger.</P>
      <P>Paal said he thought that the meeting was mainly a "get to know
each other" social function. To his knowledge, Paal said, the ROC's
previous representatives would meet the top White House national
security adviser at least one time during their tenures.</P>
      <P>With the retirement of former ROC National Security Council
(NSC) Secretary-General Ding Mou-shih and the departure of James
Steinberg from the post of the White House deputy national security
adviser, Paal said he thought that the recent Chen-Berger meeting
means that Chen will from now on take full charge of communications
between the new ROC government and the Clinton administration.</P>
      <P>Ding, a career diplomat, had traveled to the United States at
least once a year during his NSC stint to meet with Steinberg for
exchanges of views on relations across the Taiwan Strait and
Taipei-Washington-Beijing relations since the 1996 Taiwan Strait
crisis. The Ding-Steinberg meeting marked the highest-level ROC-US
dialogue mechanism aimed at averting escalation of cross-strait
tension.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  11  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who is
currently on a visit to Atlanta, Georgia, said on Friday that he
thinks relations across the Taiwan Strait will gradually improve.</P>
      <P>Ma made the optimistic forecast in interviews with the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution and Cable News Network (CNN).</P>
      <P>The charismatic politician from the Republic of China told the
Atlanta journal that he personally supports the unification of the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait under specific conditions, but
opposes the Beijing-proposed "one country, two systems" unification
formula.</P>
      <P>Ma stressed that the most important cross-strait issue at the
moment is "maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and
further improving bilateral ties."</P>
      <P>If both sides can regard their ties from the viewpoints of
market economy and partnership, Ma said, cross-strait relations will
move in a positive, constructive direction.</P>
      <P>And if the two sides can deepen their interaction, Ma said
he believes that cross-strait military confrontation can be
avoided.</P>
      <P>Asked about his views on mainland China's military intimidation
and bellicose rhetoric against Taiwan, Ma said he thinks mainland
China was shocked by pro-independence Democratic Progressive
Party candidate Chen Shui-bian's victory in the ROC's March
18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Ma further said he thinks that mainland China should have
been equally surprised by Chen's repeated goodwill remarks and olive
branches toward Beijing since his election.</P>
      <P>Ma, a former vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council,
which charts Taiwan's policy toward the mainland, said he doesn't
think the long-stalled cross-strait ties could make headway until
after the US presidential election in November. He further said it
takes wisdom of Taipei and Beijing leaders to resolve the basic
cross-strait dispute over sovereignty issue.</P>
      <P>In his interview with CNN, Ma said as the ROC has been an
independent sovereign state since its establishment in 1911, it
does not need to declare independence once again.</P>
      <P>Asked about the Kuomingtang's reform plan after its
defeat in the March 18 presidential election, Ma, a KMT
stalwart, said he believes whether the KMT can return to
power will hinge on the degree and speed of its intraparty
restructuring.</P>
      <P>Ma also said he has no plan to run for the ROC presidency in
2004. "My immediate career plan is seeking re-election because it
takes eight years, not just four years, to delivery on all of my
mayoral campaign promises," he added.</P>
      <P>Following his Atlanta visit, Ma will travel to New York to
attend a roundtable meeting on Taipei-Beijing ties and US policy
toward both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Ma will also visit several ROC diplomatic allies in Central
America, including Panama and Honduras, before returning to Taipei.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO MORE SMUGGLED LIVE HORSES SEIZED IN KINMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Aug.  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two more live horses smuggled from
mainland China were seized in the Republic of China-held frontline
island of Kinmen on Saturday, police authorities said.</P>
      <P>The seizure of the two ponies followed the confiscation of two
adult horses by Kinmen coastal patrol force on Friday.</P>
      <P>Initial investigations show that the two ponies were smuggled to
Kinmen, located some 2.4 kilometers off the mainland Chinese coast,
in late July.</P>
      <P>As mainland China is a foot-and-mouse disease (FMD)-stricken
area, the two ponies were put down by Kinmen quarantine officials
shortly after they were seized by police.</P>
      <P>Kinmen police took action to seize the two ponies and one adult
horse at a chicken ranch in Hsipao late Friday evening after the
Kinmen Coastal Patrol nabbed two adult horses in a coastal forest in
northern Kinmen early Friday.</P>
      <P>The chicken farm owner, Chou Chih-hsiang, has been detained for
questioning. Chou told prosecutors that he bought the two ponies
from a mainland fisherman in the Kinmen coastal area late last
month at a price of NT$6,000 apiece. Chou said he planned to
re-sell the ponies for high profits.</P>
      <P>As Chou said the adult horse was bought from a local resident,
Kinmen quarantine officials are still studying whether to kill it
for anti-FMD purposes. "If the adult horse was also smuggled from
the mainland, it would certainly be put down, too," said a
quarantine official.</P>
      <P>Kinmen police said at least 10 other horses were believed to have
been smuggled into the ROC's offshore defense outpost from the
mainland. "We have intensified investigations in order to seize them
as early as possible to prevent a possible FMD outbreak," said a
police officer.</P>
      <P>Live animal smuggling in the Kinmen area was suspended after a
batch of smuggled cattle and goats from mainland China triggered an
outbreak of FMD in Kinmen and certain Taiwan areas among in
June last year. During that period, some 200 cattle raised in Kinmen
were all slaughtered to prevent a further spread of the deadly
disease which mainly infected cloven-hoofed animals, including pigs,
cattle, horses and goats.</P>
      <P>However, live animal smuggling resumed recently as the ROC is
planning to open its three main outlying islands --Kinmen, Matsu and
Penghu -- for direct trade, postal and shipping links with mainland
China southeastern port cities, such as Xiamen and Fuzhou,
commonly known as the "mini three links," to help boost the three
offshore islands' economic development.</P>
      <P>Kinmen police and coastal patrol authorities said they will
launch a crackdown on cross-strait smuggling of contraband goods,
including live animals, to protect the country's agricultural and
livestock industries.
 The ROC government has said it will not open the so-called "mini
three links" until after comprehensive preparatory work, including
quarantine and many other safety measures, has been completed.</P>

the four people who died in a flash flood last month, and the 113
people who died onboard the Air France Concorde that crashed in Paris
last month.</P>
      <P>With the World Religions Museum to be established in Taiwan next
February, Lu urged everyone to respect each religion, accept every

      <P>Fielding questions after the ceremony, Lu expressed her support

Latin American and West African allies which begins Sunday. She added
that with Taiwan's current plight in its foreign diplomatic
relations, every effort should be made to introduce Taiwan to the
whole world.</P>
      <P>Lu may visit South Africa in October in a private capacity to

received a reply from the South African government so far. South
Africa was an ROC diplomatic ally until it switched its recognition

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nicaragua Foreign Minister Eduardo
Montealegre has denied news reports concerning his demand for Taiwan
to honor its aid commitments made earlier to Nicaragua, Vice Foreign
Minister Wu Tzu-dan said on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Foreign wires reported last week that on the eve of Republic of
China President Chen Shui-bian's visit to Nicaragua, Montealegre
asked Chen to fulfill a US$100 million aid package to Nicaragua made
by Chen's predecessor, former President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to arrive in Managua on Aug. 17, on the second
leg of his 13-day two-continent tour which will also bring him to the
Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Gambia, Burkina Faso and Chad.</P>
      <P>Wu said that Montealegre denied the reports in a letter to ROC
Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao on Aug. 11, saying that they were
totally untrue and ran counter to the spirit of the cooperative ties
between Taiwan and his country.</P>
      <P>Montealegre said that Nicaragua has given full support to Taiwan
in the international arena, based on mutual respect and cooperation.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan has always come to Nicaragua's relief
whenever needed, and that both the Nicaraguan government and people
have been appreciative of what Taiwan has done for their country. He
also said that his country will enthusiastically welcome Chen upon
his arrival in Managua.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile Nicaragua President Arnoldo Aleman has also told the
ROC envoy in Managua that Taiwan should ignore the groundless
reports.</P>
      <P>He assured the ROC official that President Chen's upcoming visit
will further cement bilateral ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Foreign Affairs Ministry has repeatedly stressed that

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN LAUNCHES DIPLOMATIC DEFENSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 13 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Alarmed by Beijing's increasing efforts to
win over Taipei's allies in Africa, President Chen Shui-bian will
consolidate Taiwan's diplomatic foothold in Africa during his visits
to three of the island's eight allies on that continent, said his
office.</P>
      <P>At a pre-departure briefing on Chen's itinerary, Deputy
Secretary-General of Presidential Office Eugene Chien called the
president's trip an exercise in "diplomatic defense" aimed at
demonstrating Taiwan's democratic achievements, winning international
recognition for the island, and cementing ties with its allies.</P>
      <P>Considering that Beijing leader Jiang Zemin has visited nine
African states during the last five years on three separate trips,
Chien said Taipei sees trouble with its African allies this year,
because of Beijing's all-out efforts to woo Taiwan's allies away.</P>
      <P>With mainland authorities gearing up for a forum with African
states in Beijing this October in the hope of enhancing their
presence on the African continent, Chien said Taipei has determined
that it is essential to preempt by Chen's visit any plots by Beijing
to lure away its allies.</P>
      <P>Chung Chin, director general of the Government Information
Office, branded President Chen's trip a bid to enhance Taiwan's
international profile by reaching out on the international stage, and
called for her fellow countrymen to rally behind President Chen's
trip.</P>
      <P>Chen is slated to depart on a 13-day, six-state tour on Sunday
evening. It will take him to the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Costa
Rica, Gambia, Burkina Faso and Chad.</P>
      <P>It is Chen's first overseas trip since his swearing-in on May 20,
and he will be the first ROC president ever to set foot in Africa,
where the island has eight allies.</P>
      <P>Chen will make a stop in Los Angeles on Sunday night, on his way
to the Dominican Republic. Although several pro-Taiwan US congressmen
have tried to set up meetings with Chen during his stopover there,
Vice Minister Wu Tzu-dan said at Sunday's press briefing that no
meeting with any US public officials were on Chen's agenda, because
his stopover will be too brief.</P>
      <P>He denied that Washington has made it a ground rule that
President Chen should not meet any US officials or lawmakers during
his stopover on US territory, saying that Chen could not fit in any
appointments during his 15-hour stay and will do nothing inconsistent
with a normal transit stay.</P>

      <P>As much as it is tiny in size, Taiwan is

Tzu Chi Foundation, a Buddhist charity organization, said Vice

      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT) will launch a member

three-month campaign on Sept. 1, in an effort to encourage members to
follow suit, the KMT said.</P>
      <P>The KMT will send its heavyweights to invite senior party

      <P>Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense (MND)
on Sunday denied a local news report that its fighters flew over the

      <P>"(The news report) is absurd and the scenario is absolutely not

      <P>The Taiwan fighters were detected by mainland military radar and
expelled by mainland aircraft, the report said.</P>
      <P>Kung said that his ministry has consistently asked Air Force and

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Zhong Gong organization in China
Sunday urged US authorities in Guam to take necessary measures to
protect Zhong Gong founder Zhang Hongbao against possible
assassination.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued Sunday through the Hong Kong-based
Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy, the organization
said that Zhang has been in a detention center in Guam since he
applied for political asylum early this year, and that he is
vulnerable even in the detention center, because communist Chinese
assassins may disguise themselves as illegal immigrants and get into
that center to kill or hurt him.</P>
      <P>Zhang established Zhong Gong in 1987, and publicized his "Chi Lin
theory" in 1990. Chi Lin is a propitious animal in ancient Chinese
mythology.</P>
      <P>The information center said the theory, which is inconsistent
with Marxism, prompted Chinese authorities to crack down on Zhong
Gong, which has an estimated membership of 38 million in China.</P>
      <P>Another reason for the crackdown, the information center said, is
that a task force formed in 1993 by Chinese authorities found that
Zhong Gong was more dangerous than Falun Gong, because the former was
expanding not only like a spiritual and religious sect, but also like
a modern enterprise.</P>
      <P>In 1996, the Chinese government began to crack down on Zhong Gong
and search for Zhang in order to arrest him. Many training
centers and affiliated enterprises of Zhong Gong have been closed
down by the government since then.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT'S 6-STATE JOURNEY NOT TO AFFECT CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's current
six-country "journey of friendship" is not expected to have any
adverse impact on relations across the Taiwan Strait, a senior
opposition Kuomintang official said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, director of the KMT's Mainland Affairs Research
Department, said President Chen's ongoing overseas visit will
inevitably provoke mainland China's ire and criticism.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chang said he thinks mainland leaders should also
understand that Chen's state visits to the Republic of China's allies
will not have substantive adverse impact on cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Beijing will take any provocative action during
President Chen's first post-inauguration overseas trip, Chang said
Beijing has again endorsed its double-edged strategy against Taiwan
during its recent Beidaihe policy review meeting.</P>
      <P>Under its double-edged strategy, Chang said, Beijing will on
the one hand continue publicizing its "peaceful unification"
overture to win international support for its cherished "one China"
principle, while on the other Beijing will not cease its combat
preparedness in order to intimidate Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"It's worthy of our attention when and how mainland China will
launch military intimidation against us after the Beidaihe meeting,"
Chang explained.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's perennial diplomatic embargo against
Taiwan, Chang said, the number of the ROC's diplomatic allies has
been limited (29 at the present).</P>
      <P>"And against this background, the ROC's head of state is
obligated to expand the country's diplomatic frontiers while
simultaneously endeavoring to improve cross-strait relations," Chang
said, adding that he believes the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
will continue their diplomatic tug-of-war, particularly in the Latin
America and Africa where most of the ROC's diplomatic allies are
located.</P>
      <P>In fact, Chang said, the most difficult part in the current
cross-strait relation lies in accommodating Beijing's "one China"
principle and the ROC's quest for a decent international status.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's "one China" principle claims sovereignty
over Taiwan and deems the ROC as a local government under the
People's Republic of China. Such a stance is unacceptable to
the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>President Chen left Taipei on Sunday for a hectic 13-day,
six-country visit aimed at highlighting the ROC's first-ever
democratic transition of power in May and cementing relations with
diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>The visit will take Chen to the Caribbean nation of the Dominican
Republic, and Nicaragua and Costa Rica in Central America, as well as
the Gambia, Burkina Faso and Chad in West Africa.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT MAKES OVERNIGHT STOPOVER IN LOS ANGELES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles,  Aug.  13  (CNA)
(By Y.Y. Chen and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian and his entourage arrived in Los Angeles Sunday for an
overnight stopover en route to the Dominican Republic, where Chen
will begin a 12-day six-state visit to the Caribbean, Central
America, and Africa.</P>
      <P>The new ROC president received an overwhelming welcome from some
500 Taiwanese-Chinese residents in California when he arrived at the
five-star Long Beach Westin, despite a 25-minute delay due to engine
failure of the limousine which was arranged by the US State
Department to take him to the hotel.</P>
      <P>Richard Bush, chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT),
the de facto US ambassador to Taipei, met Chen at the airport and
accompanied him to the hotel in a different limousine.</P>
      <P>Chen's trip, representing his first overseas visit since taking
office on May 20, will take him and his 200-member entourage to the
Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Gambia, Burkina Faso, and
Chad.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Los Angeles, Chen is not expected to do
anything that is inconsistent with a normal transit stopover, such as
meeting with US officials or lawmakers, according to Vice Foreign
Minister Wu Tzu-dan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the president has been kept fully abreast of national
affairs since beginning his overseas trip. Premier Tang reported to
Chen on the latest operations of the Executive Yuan through a fax,
while Chief of the General Staff Tang Yao-ming sped a message to him
concerning a report that ROC Air Force jet fighters flew over the
"middle line" of the Taiwan Strait and were intercepted by mainland
Chinese fighters sometime in July. Tang told the president the report
proved to be false.</P>
      <P>During his 12-hour flight from Taipei to Los Angeles, Chen took
time to meet with three leading Taiwanese entrepreneurs to exchange
views on the country's economic and business developments.</P>
      <P>Chen held separate talks with Jeffrey Koo, chairman of the
Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce; Wang
You-tseng, chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce of the ROC;
and Lin Kun-chung, chairman of the Chinese National Federation of
Industries.</P>
      <P>Talks focused mainly on the private business and industrial
sectors' wish for government intervention to help protect the
country's traditional industries and to help prop up prices on the
stock market, according to Council of Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) Chairman Chen Poh-chih, who accompanied the
president during the talks.</P>
      <P>The CEPD head said the government will at the end of August for
the first time make public plans on how to revive the traditional
industries.</P>
      <P>Also present at the talks were Economic Affairs Minister Lin
Hsin-yi, Foreign Affairs Minister Tien Hung-mao, and Chuang Ming-yao,
secretary-general of the National Security Council.</P>
      <P>In the capital of the Dominican Republic, Chen will attend the
inauguration of President-elect Hipolito Mejia and meet with other
attending heads of state who are diplomatic allies of the ROC.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese government authorities
uncovered 319,000 "economic crimes" -- the Chinese euphemism for
corruption -- over the first six months of 2000, according to
official Chinese figures, reported the Australian Financial Review on
Monday.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that although more than 17 provincial and vice
ministerial-level officials were investigated and punished for
corruption in 1999, Beijing appears extremely reluctant to pursue
corruption all the way to the top.</P>
      <P>The central government in Beijing has slapped a ban on news
coverage of this week's trial of officials involved in a US$10
billion smuggling scandal that indirectly implicates the wife of Jia
Qinglin, a member of China's ruling Politburo and head of the party
in Beijing, reported the daily.</P>
      <P>The smuggling ring is the biggest uncovered in mainland China and
has already resulted in the arrest of more than 200 officials in
Xiamen city in southeastern Fujian province, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>While the government has been doing its best to keep the
politically sensitive Xiamen scandal under wraps, it has been more
than keen to publicize the show trials of other senior officials,
including the sentencing to death of the former governor of Guangxi
province, Cheng Jejie, the highest level official to receive such a
sentence for corruption since the communists took power in 1949.</P>
      <P>Despite this crackdown, the daily reported that many Chinese remain
skeptical about the authorities' seriousness in eliminating
corruption as Beijing seems to be reluctant to punish top party and
government officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC AIR FORCE TO FORM MIRAGE WING IN APRIL 2001</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Air Force is
scheduled to form a wing of Mirage 2000-5 jet fighters in April 2001
and two F-16 jet fighter wings by February 2002, Air Force
Commander-in-Chief Chen Chao-min announced on Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the announcement at a rally marking Air Force Day
which falls on Aug. 14.</P>
      <P>Chen said the commissioning of the new Mirage and F-16 wings
will mark the completion of the installation of the ROC's
second-generation warplanes and a substantial upgrading of the ROC's
air defense capability.</P>
      <P>At the ceremony, Chen cited outstanding Air Force officers who
have contributed to the recent commissioning of the third and last
wing of locally built Ching-kuo indigenous defense fighters (IDFs)
and to the replacement of the ROC's aging air fleet with
second-generation arsenal.
 The ROC Air Force has acquired 130 IDFs, 60 French-made Mirage
2000-5s and 150 US-built F-16s. All these three types of warplanes
form the backbone of the ROC's new generation of air defense
arsenal.</P>
      <P>Noting that military build-up and combat preparedness require
continuity, Chen said all Air Force staff should devote full energy
to accomplishing new aircraft replacement as scheduled and
simultaneously intensify various training programs to upgrade
overall combat capability and deter mainland China's invading
attempts.</P>
      <P>Chen also outlined three Air Force modernization goals --
establishing a professional air combat force, averting
any flight mishaps and beefing up overall combat capability.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen categorically denied a mainland Chinese press
report that the ROC's IDF and F-16 jet fighters flew over the center
line of the Taiwan Strait last month to collect information about
a recent mainland military exercise off the southeastern mainland
coast.</P>
      <P>"The report was false outright," Chen stressed, adding
that the ROC's warplanes are unlikely to fly over the middle line of
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's Liberation Army Daily reported over the weekend
that the ROC's IDF and F-16 fighters took off from its Sungshan and
Chiayi air bases, respectively, and flew over the center line of the
Taiwan Strait in July for monitoring the People's Liberation
Army's amphibious training exercise.</P>
      <P>"The report was sheer speculation and absurd," Chen said,
adding that Sungshan Airport in downtown Taipei has not been a
military base for any jet fighters.</P>
      <P>"By allowing its official mouthpiece to disseminate such a
fabricated report, Beijing apparently wants to mislead mainland
people and the international community into believing that Taiwan
was provocative," Chen noted.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the Air Force leadership has consistently
reminded all Air Force officers and men to avoid triggering
cross-strait tension while performing their official duties.</P>
      <P>Chen assured the press confidently that Air Force pilots were
not likely to fly over the Taiwan Strait center line by mistake
because Air Force flight control personnel have routinely kept close
watch on their operations.</P>
      <P>Chen further said if the ROC's warplanes undergo long-range
training missions, including BVR missile test-firing, they tend to
undertake such training exercises off Taiwan's eastern coast, namely
in the skies over the Pacific Ocean.</P>
      <P>Asked how the Air Force will react if a mainland Chinese
warplane flies over the Taiwan Strait middle line, Chen reiterated
that the ROC Air Force will under no circumstances take any
provocative action.</P>

(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's gross national product (GNP) will
break the US$300 billion mark to reach US$320.8 billion this year,
according to a forecast released on Monday by the Directorate General
of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The nation's per capita GNP will hit more than US$14,500 this
year, the DGBAS added.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS also adjusted downward its economic growth forecast for
2000 by 0.16 percentage points, saying that the economy will only
grow by 6.57 percent.</P>
      <P>The downward adjustment was made due to sluggish stock trading
volume in the local equities market since the second quarter of this
year, as well as declining private sector expenditures, DGBAS sources
said.</P>
      <P>However, due to increasing domestic industrial demand and the
overall good health of the world economy, Taiwan was still able to
register 6.65 percent economic growth in the first half of this year,
the DGBAS said. It added that the growth rate for the whole of this
year will reach 6.57 percent if exports continue expanding in the
second half.</P>
      <P>However, the DGBAS' newest forecast is very close to similar
estimates made by private economic research institutes. Among them,
the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research forecasts a 6.6
percent GDP growth for this year, the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research foresees economic growth of 6.5 percent in 2000, and
Academia Sinica's Institute of Economics predicts that growth will
hit only 6.44 percent this year.</P>
      <P>Looking forward to next year, the DGBAS said that the nation's
GNP in 2001 will grow to over NT$10 trillion (US$324 billion), which
will translate into a per capita GNP of US$15,427.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS also forecast that next year's economic growth rate
will hit 6.48 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOMINICAN REPUBLIC PRESIDENT-ELECT REAFFIRMS TIES WITH ROC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Santo  Domingo,  Aug. 13 (CNA)
(By Oscar Chung and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Dominican Republic President-elect
Hipolito Mejia said on Sunday he likes the Republic of China very
much and will make his country the ROC's staunchest ally in Latin
America after assuming office.</P>
      <P>Mejia, who has made 22 visits to Taiwan over the past years,
made the remarks during a meeting with a group of Taiwan reporters
who are here to cover ROC President Chen Shui-bian's upcoming visit
to the Dominican Republic to attend Mejia's inauguration. Chen and
his entourage are scheduled to arrive in Santo Domingo via Los
Angeles on Monday.</P>
      <P>Mejia said he has enjoyed cordial friendship with many Taiwan
friends, including the late President Chiang Ching-kuo, former
President Lee Teng-hui and former Premier Sun Yun-suan. The
president-elect said he has been impressed by Taiwan's economic
prosperity and urban development.</P>
      <P>Mejia said he will need the ROC's assistance in carrying out
many projects to boost his country's development. "I will take
advantage of President Chen's visit to discuss possible
bilateral cooperative projects," he added.</P>
      <P>Mejia further said his government will continue construction of
the Dominican Republic's first high-tech industrial park,
which was patterned after the ROC's Hsinchu Science-based Industrial
Park, also Taiwan's high-tech industry stronghold.</P>
      <P>Mejia promised to improve visa services to ROC passport
holders after assuming office. Noting that the Dominican Republic
welcomes ROC investors, Mejia said his government will take concrete
measures to encourage Taiwan entrepreneurs to invest in his Caribbean
nation to help spur its economic development and create more job
openings.</P>
      <P>Mejia said he plans to visit Taiwan next year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, outgoing Dominican Republic President Leonel
Fernandez presided over the opening of his country's first
high-tech industrial park on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Fernandez pushed for construction of the new industrial park
after he visited Taiwan's Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park and
was impressed by its role in Taiwan's high-tech development.</P>
      <P>Construction on the Dominican high-tech park began last October
and the first-phase construction has roughly been completed.
During the inaugural ceremony, Fernandez encouraged companies in the
park to learn from their counterparts in Taiwan's Hsinchu park to
help upgrade the Dominican industry.</P>
      <P>ROC Ambassador to the Dominican Republic Sun Ta-cheng was among
the 100-plus guests present at the grand opening ceremony. Sun said
he has met with senior administrators of the Dominican park on many
occasions and has offered them the Hsinchu park's developmental
experience.</P>
      <P>Sun said he has also exchanged views with Taiwan business people
here on the prospects for investing in the Dominican industrial
park. "Many of them told me that they believe investment in the
new park will be profitable as the Dominican Republic has decided to
offer incentives to attract its 1 million expatriates in New York to
return for investment and work," he said, adding that Taiwan firms
are also welcome to invest in the high-tech park.</P>
      <P>According to Sun, a consortium of Taiwan banks have offered a
syndicated US$10 million loan for the Fernandez administration to
build the high-tech park.</P>
      <P>Taiwan companies have launched some 100 investment projects in
the Dominican Republic, with a combined capital investment of US$100
million over past years.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce in the Dominican Republic was
established in 1989. It now has 100 members. Taiwanese-owned firms
provide more than 10,000 jobs for Dominican people.</P>
      <P>Many Taiwan businessmen have arrived in Santo Domingo from the
United Sates and other Central and South American countries in
preparation for welcoming President Chen's arrival on Monday for his
first state visit since taking office on May 20.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KINMEN POLICE FORM SPECIAL TASK FORCE TO PROBE HORSE SMUGGLING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kinmen County Police Bureau formed a
special task force on Monday to investigate the smuggling of live
horses from mainland China to the Republic of China-held frontline
island of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>The formation of the special investigative panel was prompted by
Kinmen law enforcement authorities' seizure of a total of six
smuggled mainland horses since last Friday.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen Coastal Patrol first seized two mainland horses in a
northern coastal forest early on Friday, and Kinmen police caught two
ponies and two horses in three different townships on Saturday and
Sunday, respectively.</P>
      <P>As mainland China is an area in which two horse-related
contagious diseases are endemic -- equine anthrax and glanders -- all
the animals were destroyed at the Kinmen animal quarantine center to
prevent a possible spread of the diseases.</P>
      <P>The owners of the smuggled mainland horses were detained for
questioning and were quoted as saying they had purchased the horses
from mainland fishermen for re-sale at a high profit. Smuggling a
mainland pony to Kinmen costs NT$5,000 and the cost for smuggling a
horse is NT$10,000. The smuggled animals can fetch NT$28,000 to
NT$50,000 apiece in Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Police said some Kinmen residents like to keep horses as pets,
while others use them to lead funeral processions.</P>
      <P>Police said they suspect that underworld criminal rings might be
involved in the recent smuggling cases. "We will intensify
investigations to bring to justice to all those involved and to seize
all smuggled live animals to prevent an outbreak of any epidemic,"
said one police officer.</P>
      <P>Police sources said at least 10 other horses were believed to
have been smuggled into Kinmen since late last month.</P>
      <P>Live animal smuggling in the Kinmen area was suspended after a
batch of smuggled cattle and goats from mainland China triggered an
outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Kinmen and certain areas
of Taiwan proper in June last year. During that period, some 200
cattle raised in Kinmen were slaughtered to prevent a further spread
of the disease which infects cloven-hoofed animals such as pigs,
cattle and goats.</P>
      <P>However, live animal smuggling resumed recently as the ROC is
planning to open its three main outlying islands -- Kinmen, Matsu and
Penghu -- for direct trade, postal and shipping links with mainland
China's southeastern port cities such as Xiamen and Fuzhou, in a move
commonly known as the "mini three links," to help boost the three
offshore islands' economic development.</P>
      <P>Kinmen police and coastal patrol authorities said they will
launch a crackdown on cross-strait smuggling of contraband goods,
including live animals, to protect the country's agricultural and
livestock industries.</P>
      <P>The ROC government has said it will not open the so-called "mini
three links" until after comprehensive preparatory work, including
quarantine and many other safety measures, has been completed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPOWER PROBES CAUSE OF PENGHU BLACKOUT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) said on Monday
that a power blackout a day earlier in the offshore island county of
Penghu was caused by neither an electrical storm nor by mainland
Chinese sabotage.</P>
      <P>Taipower, a state-owned enterprise, said it sent engineers and
technicians to Penghu to assist in probing the possible cause of the
major blackout that suspended electricity supplies to more than
35,000 households and businesses in the county, located off the
southwestern Taiwan coast near Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The blackout hit the county at 6:43 p.m. on Sunday and it was not
until 8:25 p.m. that power was partially restored. In some areas, the
electricity supply did not return to normal until 11:45 p.m.</P>
      <P>Taipower offered a public apology on Monday to all the
35,000-plus affected Penghu households and businesses.</P>
      <P>Speculation about the cause of the rarely experienced major
blackout had been rife in the county where fishing and tourism form
the backbone of the economy.</P>
      <P>Taipower said initial investigations show that the blackout had
nothing to do with an afternoon thunderstorm, nor was it caused by
any sabotage by mainland China.</P>
      <P>A senior executive said the blackout might have been caused by
problems with a 12-kilometer-long underground electricity
distribution cable between the county's Makung and Chien power
plants.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he said, further investigations will be needed
before the true cause can be determined. "We believe a final
investigative report will be ready soon, as our engineers and
technicians already traveled to Penghu to make extensive checks," he
added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US SCHOLAR OPTIMISTIC ABOUT CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Aug.  13  (CNA)
(By Jennifer Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A noted US expert on relations across
the Taiwan Strait said on Sunday he is cautiously optimistic about
the prospects for resuming cross-strait dialogue in the near future.</P>
      <P>Professor Donald S. Zagoria, the chief organizer of a "Track II"
roundtable meeting on cross-strait relations to be sponsored by the
National Committee on American Foreign Policy (NCAFP) from Aug.
14-15, also made a bold forecast that cross-strait dialogue
could resume next year at the earliest.</P>
      <P>Zagoria, also an NCAFP trustee, made the remarks during a dinner
in honor of some 20 delegates from Taiwan, mainland China and the
United States to the two-day roundtable.</P>
      <P>This is the eighth time that the NCAFP, a prominent US think tank
which has enormous influence on US foreign policy, has sponsored a
"Track II" unofficial meeting on cross-strait ties since the 1996
Taiwan Strait crisis.</P>
      <P>Based on the findings of his April and June visits to
Taiwan and mainland China, Zagoria said he thinks both sides of
the Taiwan Strait have shown certain flexibility in dealing with
their bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Zagoria said he supports new ROC President Chen Shui-bian's
remarks that if North and South Korea could sit down to talk, the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait should also be able to make it.</P>
      <P>Zagoria further said the US government will not pressure either
side of the Taiwan Strait to go to the "negotiating table." He
predicted that the top negotiators from both sides, Taiwan's Strait
Exchange Foundation Chairman Koo Chen-fu and mainland China's Wang
Daohan, president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait, are likely to meet next year.</P>
      <P>Republic of China delegates to the roundtable include Taipei
Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, also a stalwart of the opposition Kuomintang;
Hsiao Bih-kim, an aide to President Chen; Wu Jui-kuo, an adviser to
the opposition People First Party; Kuo Cheng-liang, a professor with
Soochow University and a member of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party; and Lin Cheng-yi, head of the Institute of American and
European Studies of Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>Hsiao said this is the first time she has been invited to attend
the NCAFP-sponsored roundtable on cross-strait ties. Hsiao said the
new DPP-led ROC government is very interested in Beijing's and
Washington's views and thinking about cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>"I hope the roundtable will help me gain a better understanding
in this regard," Hsiao said. But she stressed that she is attending
the meeting in her private capacity, not as a government
representative.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's delegates include Xu Shiquan, director of the
Institute of Taiwan Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, and Yang Jiehmien, head of the Institute of American
Studies of the Shanghai International Relations Research Center.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT COMMENTS ON ROC-US-CHINA RELATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles,  Aug.  13  (CNA)
(By Y.Y. Chen, Chu Lu-shen, and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian said on Monday that relations between the ROC and the
United States are so close that there is "no distance" between them.</P>
      <P>Chen, who is in Los Angeles on a 16-hour stopover at the start of
his 13-day, six-state visit to the Caribbean, Central America, and
West Africa, likened the closeness of Taipei-Washington ties to the
proximity of his charter plane to the US president's "Air Force One,"
parked less than 100 meters away.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting Richard Bush, chairman of the
American Institute in Taiwan, which represents American interests in
Taiwan in the absence of official relations.</P>
      <P>Chen urged the United States to play a more active role as a
"stabilizer" and a "balancer" in ROC-mainland China relations, even
if it is not willing to serve as a mediator.</P>
      <P>He added that the unobstructed communications channel between the
governments of the ROC and the United States plays "an important
role" in the peace and stability of the Asia Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Bush welcomed Chen in a dinner address and said that Chen's
election opened "a window of opportunity" for resumed dialogue
between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Bush told Chen afterward that US support for Taiwan remains
unchanged, that US adherence to the Taiwan Relations Act remains
unchanged, and that no matter who becomes the next US President, US
policies toward Taiwan will retain their continuity and stability.</P>
      <P>Chen told Bush that the Taiwan public cannot accept mainland
China's "one country, two systems" policy. He added that he is
willing to promote beneficial exchanges between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait under the foundation of the "1992 spirit" -- through
dialogue, exchanges, and setting aside controversial issues.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say that Taiwan has already expressed its
greatest sincerity by holding out several olive branches to mainland
China. He added that Taiwan will continue to be even more patient,
and that as long as both sides can sit down and temporarily set aside
their differences, they can surely come to a consensus.</P>
      <P>Bush told Chen that the United States is very pleased with Chen's
patience, admires his policies toward mainland China, and that it
will encourage Beijing to seize the opportunity to resume
cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>Bush then asked Chen about Taiwan's domestic situation, to which
Chen replied that after the new government stabilizes Taiwan's
foreign diplomatic environment, it will focus on domestic reform. He
added that he is confident about Taiwan's domestic, cross-strait, and
economic issues.</P>
      <P>Chen also met US Representative Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), who
paid a visit to Chen in defiance of a publicly announced US State
Department objection to any congressional meeting with Chen during
his transit stop.</P>
      <P>Rohrabacher said that he was determined not to be concerned about
the US State Department's policy and insisted on welcoming Chen as
the representative from California.</P>
      <P>He recently accused the Clinton administration of sacrificing
Taiwan in order to appease mainland China.</P>
      <P>He also claimed that many congressmen from both the Republican
and Democratic parties had wanted to meet Chen, but that they had all
been dissuaded by the State Department.</P>
      <P>Chen's trip, his first overseas visit since taking office on May
20, will take him and his 200-member entourage to the Dominican
Republic, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Gambia, Burkina Faso and Chad.</P>
      <P>Chen will attend the inauguration of Dominican Republic
President-elect Hipolito Mejia and meet with other attending heads of
state who are diplomatic allies of the ROC.</P>

relief and reconstruction after the 921 earthquake have hit NT$31.8
billion (US$1.03 billion), according to a report released on Monday
by the Cabinet-level Post-Earthquake Reconstruction Commission.</P>
      <P>Although the earthquake which devastated parts of central Taiwan
last Sept.21 occurred almost a year ago, the stricken areas still
need large amounts of money to continue with reconstruction and the
commission wants to launch a second round of fund-raising.</P>
      <P>However, the report points out that the public do not know
exactly how their donations have been used, although there has been
speculation that quantities have gone into the pockets of corrupt
local officials.</P>
      <P>Worried that the rumors will affect the second round of
fund-raising, the Ministry of the Interior has added up the donations
from the all city and county governments and private groups.</P>
      <P>According to the report, 108 government organizations and 222

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp.
(CPC) is planning to invite major international oil corporations to
invest in CPC as part of its privatization process, officials with
the Commission of National Corporations (CNC) said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The CPC, along with two other state-run firms -- Taiwan Power Co.
(Taipower) and Chunghwa Telecom -- is facing privatization, and
Chunghwa Telecom will begin its first stage of privatization in late
August by auctioning off 3 percent of the government's stake in the
company.</P>
      <P>By the end of the year, the figure will have been increased to 33
percent, with a further 33 percent of shares divested in February
next year, and the goal of complete privatization by the end of next
year or early the following year.</P>
      <P>The CNC, meanwhile, has mapped out three phases of privatization
for the CPC and Taipower. In the first phase, the government will
auction off some of its shares in the two companies and release part
of its stakes for company employees' subscriptions. The second phase
will see the government listing its shares abroad, while in the third
phase, the government will offer more shares for public subscription.</P>
      <P>The CPC will invite the international oil corporations or
oil-producing countries to be strategic investors in the second phase
of its privatization process, the CNC said.</P>
      <P>The government originally planned to release 15 percent of its
stake in the CPC in 1998 and 18 percent in 1999. However, the
legislature passed a resolution that only after the passage of the
Petroleum Control Law would the CPC be permitted to release shares,
forcing the privatization plan to be postponed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GAP BETWEEN RICH AND POOR REMAINED UNCHANGED IN 1999: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The gap between rich and poor in Taiwan
remained unchanged in 1999, according to the results of a survey
released on Monday by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting,
and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The DGBAS results, Taiwan's average monthly family income in 1999
was NT$91,000 (US$2,936), an annual increase of 1.75 percent, with
the highest income families bringing in 5.5 times the amount brought
in by the poorest families, little changed from the 5.51 times
recorded in 1998.</P>
      <P>The annual disposable income of the highest-income bracket
families reached NT$1.74 million compared to NT$317,000 for the
lowest families, DGBAS added.</P>
      <P>It said that 39 percent of Taiwan's families had computers, with
half of them having Internet connections, 54.3 percent had
automobiles, 79 percent had air conditioners, 43 percent had
microwave ovens and 23 percent had dehumidifiers, which the report
said shows the modernization of Taiwan society.</P>
      <P>In related news, the DGBAS also predicted that Taiwan's exports
will grow by 24.2 percent and imports by 30.8 percent this year,
resulting in a shrinking trade surplus of US$6.3 billion.</P>
      <P>It forecast that due to promising prospects for the semiconductor
and optical-electronic sectors, Taiwan will see a 17.6 percent
increase in its private investment this year.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS said that the trend will continue until next year when
the two sectors are expected to make NT$250 billion and NT$100
billion more, respectively, in new investment.</P>
      <P>The agency also foresees a recovery of the construction industry,
benefiting from the building of Taiwan's high-speed railway, large
shopping shopping malls and entertainment centers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC WORLD NO. 2 FOR NEARSIGHTED CHILDREN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Aug.  14 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu and Alice Liang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The percentage of nearsighted children
has reached 19 percent, the second-highest level in the world after
Singapore's 34 percent, according to the latest statistics of the
Singapore National Eye Center (SNEC) released on Monday.</P>
      <P>The SNEC is undertaking a five-year research project on more than
1,000 school age children and preliminary results reveal that
genetics is the main cause of nearsightedness, although other factors
such as reading, watching TV at an improper distance, and playing
video games also has an effect.</P>
      <P>The SNEC is setting up a series of tests in order to slow down
the rate of increase of nearsighted people and the entire research
project is scheduled to be completed by next year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US PLEASED WITH PRESIDENT CHEN'S LOW-KEY TRANSIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Aug. 14 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US administration is "very pleased"
that President Chen Shui-bian kept a low profile during his one-night
transit stopover in Los Angeles, said the US State Department
spokesman on Monday.</P>
      <P>"We noted to Taiwan our expectation that President Chen's
activities while in the United States would be in line with a
transit, would be consistent with that, would be private in nature,"
said Philip Reeker.</P>
      <P>"We are very pleased that this is exactly what occurred," he told
a regular briefing at the State Department.</P>
      <P>Despite the administration's efforts to persuade members of
Congress against meeting with President Chen, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher
(R-CA) showed up at a dinner on Sunday held in President Chen's
honor.</P>
      <P>Reeker played down the significance of this episode, however,
saying the congressman went uninvited to the hotel where the
president stayed overnight en route to the Caribbean.</P>
      <P>"Mr. Chen clearly stated that his limited time in Los Angeles
precluded the possibility of meeting with members of Congress,"
Reeker said.</P>
      <P>"I believe he greeted Mr. Rohrabacher briefly and returned to the
private dinner that he was having," he added.</P>
      <P>The US administration agreed to Taipei's request for a transit by
President Chen, considering the safety, comfort, and convenience of
the traveler.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing that a transit is different from a visit, the

    <HEADLINE>CLINTON ADMINISTRATION CRITICIZED FOR KOWTOWING TO BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  14 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While the Clinton administration said
it was "very pleased" that ROC President Chen Shui-bian acted in a
manner consistent with the nature of his transit stopover in the US,
a renowned American foreign policy expert on Monday criticized the
administration for humiliating itself by unnecessarily appeasing
Communist China.</P>
      <P>Instead of brusquely dismissing Beijing's protest, "the Clinton
administration went out of its way to be accommodating," assuring the
regime in Beijing that President Chen would make only a brief transit
stop and would not hold meetings nor conduct public activities while
on US soil, Ted Galen Carpenter, vice president for defense and
foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, wrote in a commentary.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the Clinton administration's conduct has been
"disgraceful but not surprising." It is reminiscent of the policy
adopted more than five years ago when then-President Lee Teng-hui
requested a visa to attend a reunion at his alma mater, Cornell
University.</P>
      <P>He said the proper response to Beijing's attempts to block the
visits of Lee and Chen would have been a firm rebuff, because the
Beijing regime habitually responds to US protests about its egregious
human rights record by denouncing "interference in China's internal
affairs."</P>
      <P>Yet Communist Chinese leaders don't hesitate to try to dictate
America's visa policy or decide whether a traveler in transit can set
foot on American soil, said Carpenter.</P>
      <P>"The administration's excessively deferential behavior toward
China not only betrays important American values, it is potentially
dangerous. Chinese leaders are impressed with quiet displays of
strength and pride, and they have justifiable contempt for fawning
behavior. Unfortunately, the Clinton administration has all too often
engaged in the latter," he wrote.</P>
      <P>In addition to its campaign of diplomatic appeasement regarding
the Lee and Chen visits, Carpenter noted, the administration
acquitted itself poorly in responding to attacks on the US embassy in
Beijing following NATO's inadvertent bombing of the PRC embassy in
Belgrade.</P>
      <P>"It was certainly appropriate for Washington to apologize -- once
-- for the bombing and to offer generous compensation to the victims
and their families. It was troubling, though, to see US officials
apologizing to China again, again and again," he said.</P>
      <P>Even worse, he said, the Clinton administration responded to the
violent, week-long attacks on the US embassy and the US ambassador's
residence -- clearly conducted with the connivance of the Beijing
regime -- with nothing more than anemic diplomatic protests.</P>
      <P>"The proper response would have been to recall the ambassador
and, more important, announce that appointment of his successor would
be delayed until Beijing apologized and made explicit assurances that
it would provide appropriate protection for embassy property in the
future. Other contacts between the two governments should have been
curtailed as well, to show Washington's displeasure," said Carpenter.</P>
      <P>He emphasized that "such actions would have made it clear to
Beijing that the United States was not about to be bullied and
intimidated. Unfortunately, the administration's actions conveyed
precisely the opposite message."</P>
      <P>Few people would dispute that it is important for the United
States to maintain a cordial relationship with the PRC. "But there is
a big difference between that goal and having US officials abase
themselves when China's Communist rulers make outrageous demands or
engage in outrageous conduct. The Clinton administration seems
incapable of grasping that distinction," concluded the foreign policy
expert.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC BANS IMPORT OF ARGENTINE, PARAGUAYAN BEEF OVER FMD EPIDEMIC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA) announced on Tuesday that beef imports from Argentina and
Paraguay will be temporarily banned due to an outbreak of the
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in the two South American countries.</P>
      <P>COA officials said the import ban is not expected to affect the
Republic of China's beef market because Taiwan mainly relies on the
United States and Australia as its major sources for beef imports.</P>
      <P>The ROC representative office in Buenos Aires informed the COA
on Monday that an FMD epidemic has broken out among cattle
population in northern Argentina bordering Paraguay and Brazil.</P>
      <P>Acting on the notice, the COA immediately decided to ban
entry of refrigerated and frozen beef that was delivered from
Argentina and Paraguay after Aug. 11.</P>
      <P>The COA also decided to tighten inspection of Argentine and
Paraguayan beef that were already imported into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ROC opened its market to Argentine beef for the first time
last year in preparation for its accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO). In 1999, Taiwan imported about 395 tons of
Argentine beef which accounted for only a small slice of the
island's overall beef import market.</P>
      <P>But beef imports from Argentina have increased rapidly this
year. In the first seven months, the amount already reached
1,551 tons.</P>
      <P>COA officials said Argentina, which recognizes Beijing but
maintains substantive ties with the ROC, mainly supplies medium- and
lower-price beef for the Taiwan market.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also began to allow beef imports from Paraguay in 1999,
but actual import quantity remains limited. The Paraguayan first
lady just visited Taipei last month to help promote sales of
Paraguayan beef to local consumers. Paraguay is the ROC's only
diplomatic ally in South America.</P>
      <P>Taiwan imports premium-grade beef mainly from the United States
and Canada, medium-grade beef from Australia and New Zealand, and
lower-price beef from Argentina and other Latin American countries.</P>
      <P>COA officials said as Taiwan has many beef import sources, the
import ban on Argentine and Paraguayan beef will have little
impact on the local market.</P>
      <P>In view of frequent reports of FMD outbreaks in other countries,
COA officials said the council will intensify quarantine and
inspection measures at airports and sea ports and call for support
and cooperation of importers to prevent the spread of the
animal killer disease into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The FMD mainly affects cloven-hoofed animals, including pigs,
cattle and goats. An FMD outbreak hit Taiwan's hog ranches in
1997 and some of its cattle and goats farms were also struck by
the epidemic last year, resulting in large financial losses to local
livestock farmers.</P>

supporters in recent years of the ROC's bid to join such
international organizations as the United Nations and the World
Health Organization.</P>
      <P>Gambia, located in west Africa with a land area of 4,000 square
miles and a population of 1.3 million, had a per capita income of
only US$300 in 1998. The agricultural, fishery, and tourism
industries are the backbone of the nation's economic development.</P>
      <P>ROC Ambassador to Gambia Lee Chen-hsiung said that since the two
nations resumed diplomatic ties in 1995, relations between the two
nations have been close, with frequent visits of officials between
the two nations.</P>
      <P>Mustapha Wadda, the speaker of Gambia's National Assembly,
visited the ROC at the invitation of his ROC counterpart Wang
Jin-pyng, speaker of the Legislative Yuan, in June 1999. Foreign
Minister Momodou Sedat Jobe also visited Taiwan to attend the
inauguration of ROC President Chen Shui-bian this May.</P>
      <P>Although some said that Gambia resumed diplomatic relations with
Taiwan with the aim of receiving economic assistance to help improve
the living standard of its people, Lee said he takes pride in sharing
the ROC's economic development experience with its allies.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that it will be significant if Taiwan can help Gambia
develop quickly economically through technological cooperation and
substantial assistance in agricultural technology, medical care, and
road construction.</P>
      <P>In recent years, the volume of trade between the two nations,
although not large, has recorded steady growth. P.K. Chiang, former
chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, led a
delegation to visit Gambia last year and worked out a proposal on
bilateral cooperation after the visit in which he suggested that
Gambian youth come to Taiwan for training.</P>
      <P>Lee said the ROC is now pushing for the plan, with an
enthusiastic response from Gambia, which he said will be beneficial
to the promotion of bilateral trade cooperation.</P>
      <P>The ROC has also sent an agricultural mission to Gambia to help
it improve its rice growing technology and establish vegetable
gardens.</P>
      <P>ROC President Chen Shui-bian will also travel to Nicaragua (Aug.
17-18), Costa Rica (Aug. 18-19), Gambia (Aug. 20-21), Burkina Faso
(Aug. 21-23), and Chad (Aug. 23-25).</P>
      <P>It is expected that Gambia's President Yahya Jammeh will accord
full military honors to President Chen and will bestow a medal of
highest honor on Chen during his visit in recognition of the
friendship and contribution extended by the ROC to Gambian economic
development.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOMINICAN PRESIDENT-ELECT REAFFIRMS SUPPORT FOR ROC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Santo  Domingo,  Dominican  Republic,  Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By Oscar Chuang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Dominican
President-elect Hipolito Mejia said on Monday that he will continue
to support the Republic of China in its efforts to join international
organizations during his upcoming four-year stint, and revealed his
plan to visit Taiwan in March next year.</P>
      <P>Mejia made the remarks at a news conference in which he detailed
policies on several key issues which his administration will adopt
after he assumes the presidency on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Describing himself as a "most loyal friend" to the ROC, the
incoming Dominican president noted that he has visited Taiwan 22
times, adding that he understands that the two countries are good
partners in economic cooperation because of their similar climates
and geographic features.</P>
      <P>Although Mejia said he maintains very good relations with the
former ruling Kuomintang, he voiced his desire to continue to be a
loyal friend to the ROC. He also praised the performance of current
Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian, a member of the Democratic
Progressive Party, during his term as Taipei mayor several years ago.</P>
      <P>On the conflict between Taipei and Beijing, Mejia said he will
not touch on this problem, but vowed to continue backing Taipei in
its bids to enter international organizations.</P>
      <P>Mejia also brushed aside reports by international media that the
relations existing between the ROC and the Dominican Republic are
based on "money diplomacy." Rather than money, diplomatic relations
between the two countries are maintained by mutual respect, he
stressed, adding that ROC agricultural and fishery missions stationed
here have contributed a great deal to the promotion of bilateral
links.</P>
      <P>The Dominican president-elect also claimed that he will set up an
organization similar to the ROC Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission
to handle affairs related to the millions of Dominican people
residing abroad.</P>
      <P>Mejia said he is keen to pay a visit to Taiwan in March 2001, and
promised to meet with Taiwanese reporters at that time.</P>
      <P>President Chen, traveling at the head of a delegation composed of
more than 200 ROC officials and business leaders, arrived here on
Monday afternoon to attend Mejia's inauguration on Wednesday.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 15 (CNA)
(By Yolanda K.C. Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Local banks' ratio of loans to deposits was
a mere 84.04 percent at the end of June of this year, according to a
Ministry of Finance (MOF) report on Taiwan's banking industry
released on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>An MOF official said that loans by local banks were much too
conservative and should have been higher, and may be an indication of
pessimism over the nation's economy.</P>
      <P>The official said that the ratio of loans to deposits normally
stands in the range of 100 percent to 111 percent. When the economy
slackens, however, the ratio may sink below 100 percent, as bankers
shy away from lending money for fears of amassing irredeemable debt.</P>
      <P>On the contrary, when the market is in high spirits, the ratio
often exceeds 100 percent, as banks do not wish to leave their
capital idle, the official explained.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO SOLVING NAVAL CAPTAIN MURDER CASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Santo  Domingo,  Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian on Monday reaffirmed his administration's commitment to
solving a high-profile naval captain murder case that occurred in
1993.</P>
      <P>President Chen reiterated his commitment during a dinner party
given in his honor by all overseas Chinese associations in the
Dominican Republic as he started his first state visit to the
Caribbean nation.</P>
      <P>Chen told some 1,000 overseas Chinese representatives, including
members of the federation of Taiwanese chambers of commerce in North
America, present at the dinner that even though he is currently on
an overseas trip, he is still concerned about progress in
investigations of the naval captain Yin Ching-feng murder case and
other related weaponry procurement scandals back in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said "no ceiling, no limit and no deadline" are his
administration's cardinal principle for probing the Yin murder case.
"I don't believe that pursuing the case to the maximum would rock
our country's foundation as some people fret. And even if that be
the case, the probe would still not be stopped until after the truth
comes out to prove our determination to wipe out corruption and
'black gold' politics."</P>
      <P>Chen's firm declaration drew enthusiastic response from all
overseas Chinese representatives.</P>
      <P>President Chen arrived in Santo Domingo on Monday evening after
an overnight stopover in Los Angeles. Chen was accorded a
red-carpet welcome and full military honors upon his arrival
at the airport. He was greeted by Dominican Foreign Minister Eduardo
Latorre Rodriguez, ROC Ambassador to the Dominican Republic Sun
Ta-cheng and hundreds of ROC expatriates in the Caribbean nation.</P>
      <P>Chen will attend the inauguration of President-elect Hipolito
Mejia on Wednesday. The Dominican Republic is the first leg of his
hectic 13-day, six-state "journey of friendship" aimed at cementing
the ROC's relations with its diplomatic allies in the face of
mainland China's intensified offensive to isolate Taiwan in the
international community.</P>
      <P>During his stay, Chen will hold bilateral talks with both
outgoing Dominican President Leonel Fernandez and incoming President
Mejia on various existing cooperative projects and other matters of
mutual concern.</P>
      <P>Chen was given a grand welcome, complete with dragon and
lion dances, upon his arrival at the hotel. Chinese
community leaders said President Chen's visit to the Dominican
Republic is of great significance. They pledged full support for the
ROC's new government.</P>
      <P>Ambassador Sun then briefed President Chen on the current
ROC-Dominican ties. Sun said the two countries have traditionally
enjoyed close friendship. But Sun said the incoming Dominican ruling
party is basically a left-wing party and has many pro-Beijing
members.</P>
      <P>In addition, Sun said, mainland China has set up a trade office
in Santo Domingo and plans to build a power plant in the Dominican
Republic. Beijing also offers preferential tariff rates for
Dominican products. "All these moves are aimed at tempting the
Caribbean republic to switch its diplomatic allegiance," Sun said,
adding that the ROC Embassy here has stepped efforts to strengthen
ties with the Dominican parliament to win its support for the ROC's
national cause.</P>
      <P>After listening to Sun's briefing, Chen said he remains
confident in future ROC-Dominican relations. Noting that incoming
Dominican President Mejia has made 22 visits to Taiwan over past
years, Chen said Mejia is friendly toward the ROC.</P>
      <P>Chen is the first ROC president to visit the Dominican Republic
since the two countries forged diplomatic ties 60 years ago. Chen
encouraged all ROC embassy staff to hold confidence in
ROC-Dominican relations.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a dinner with overseas Chinese representatives, Chen
said this is his second trip to the Dominican Republic. "I first
visited this beautiful country in 1984 when I was a Taipei City
Council councilor. I met with the then-Dominican president and has
fond memory about that visit. This is why I have chosen the Dominican
Republic as the first destination of my first overseas visit as
the ROC's head of state," he explained.</P>
      <P>Chen also encouraged Taiwan entrepreneurs to invest more in the
Dominican Republic to help boost its economic development and
consolidate ROC-Dominican diplomatic ties. Chen's first
post-inauguration journey will also take him to Nicaragua and Costa
Rica in Central America as well as the Gambia, Burkina Faso and Chad
in West Africa.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRACK II ROUNDTABLE MEETING OPENS IN US</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By Jennifer Huang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A roundtable meeting of scholars from
both sides of the Taiwan Strait and the United States opened in New
York on Monday.</P>
      <P>The focus of the meeting was the track II cross-strait
communications channel, an alternative to the current semi-official
contacts between Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), and
Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).
The gathering was sponsored by the US-based National Committee on
American Foreign Policy.</P>
      <P>As this was the first roundtable meeting since the March
presidential election in Taiwan, many issues were hotly debated. The
election was a watershed event in Taiwan politics, with the
Kuomintang losing its five-decade grip on political power in Taiwan,
and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had a record of
supporting Taiwan independence, taking the helm of the central
government.</P>
      <P>Issues discussed at the New York meeting included the
cross-strait policy of Taiwan's new administration, the current
situation of party politics in Taiwan, and mainland China's policy
toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who represented the KMT at the
meeting, suggested that both sides of the Taiwan Strait go back to
the cosensus reached in 1992 -- the "one China, separate
interpretations" basis for relations -- so as to help establish a
systematic dialogue channel to solve pressing issues between the two
sides.</P>
      <P>Ma, who has served as vice chairman of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs
Council, noted that the 1992 agreement helped pave the way for the
first meeting between the heads of the SEF and ARATS in Singapore in
1993.</P>
      <P>Ma said that he was not optimistic about the resumption of a
cross-strait dialogue in the short term, saying that if both sides
want to have a breakthrough, they must first show sincerity.</P>
      <P>Ma said that President's Chen had showed a great deal of good
will in his inaugural speech, in which he pledged that if Beijing
does not use force against Taiwan, Taiwan will not declare
independence and will not change the official name of the Republic of
China.</P>
      <P>The mainland also needs to know that if it does not give up its
strategy of intimidating the island and squeezing Taiwan
diplomatically, it is unlikely that the ROC will go back to the
negotiations table, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Two mainland China and four Taiwan scholars delivered papers on
the cross-strait situation during the meeting. Hsiao Bi-khim, adviser
to President Chen Shui-bian, represented Taiwan's ruling DPP, while
Wu Juei-kuo represented the island's People First Party, another
opposition party.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXECUTIVES SENTENCED TO LIFE IMPRISONMENT FOR DUMPING TOXIC WASTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Executives and drivers of two factories
were sentenced to harsh jail terms on Tuesday by the Kaohsiung
Prosecutors' Office on charges of dumping toxic waste solvents in
Kaoping Creek in southern Taiwan last month.</P>
      <P>According to Public Prosecutor General M. L. Shih, Yang
Wen-hsiung, president of the Eternal Chemical Company, the producer
of the toxic waste, as well as Hung Shang-ching and Hung Yu-sheng,
manager and deputy manager of the Shengli Chemical Company, which
handled the toxic waste, and truck driver Lo Shou-kuan, were given
life-long prison terms for their respective roles in the dumping.</P>
      <P>The two companies -- Eternal and Shengli -- were also hit with
fines of NT$260 million and NT$160 million, respectively.</P>
      <P>Additionally, Chang Cheng-chun, Shengli's contractor in the case,
was also sentenced to life imprisonment, while another 19 people
involved in the crime were handed jail terms ranging from three years
to 12 years, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Shih said all the defendants were given harsh sentences because
they had engaged in "greedy and selfish" activities which posed a
serious threat to public security, water conservation and
environmental protection.</P>
      <P>Since no one has been reported to have been harmed or killed,
they were convicted on charges of attempted murder, Shih noted.</P>
      <P>The incident took place on July 12, when trucks carrying toxic
waste containing the carcinogenic chemical dimethyl benzene were
caught red-handed dumping the substance into Kaoping Creek, a major
source of tap water for Kaohsiung, Taiwan's second-largest city and
home to 3 million people.</P>
      <P>The event, the latest in a series of similar activities, shocked
the nation, and tap water services in Kaohsiung were cut off for the
following three days.</P>
      <P>Although Eternal and Shengli were already ordered to shut down
operations and have had their licenses revoked, Shih said that
prosecutors will continue investigating the case to determine where
other toxic wastes have been dumped, and whether government officials
are guilty for negligence of duty.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that more than 400 tons of toxic substances were
produced by Eternal from June to the time of the firm's shut-down.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An annual joint civil and military air
defense exercise was held in northern Taiwan on Tuesday to simulate
emergency rescues, riot mob dispersal, and evacuation procedures in
the event of enemy air raids or missile attacks.</P>
      <P>A total of 10,094 police officers, military police, voluntary
policemen, and civilian defense personnel were involved in clearing
the streets of all traffic and directing pedestrians into bomb
shelters during the 20-minute exercise in the cities of Taipei,
Keelung, and Hsinchu, and the counties of Ilan, Taipei, Taoyuan, and
Hsinchu.</P>
      <P>Wanan No. 23 is a series of drills being held throughout Taiwan.
It began in the central regions on Aug. 1, was held in southern
Taiwan on Aug. 4., and was again held in eastern Taiwan in Aug. 7. It
is scheduled to be held in the outlying islands of Kinmen, Penghu,
and Matsu on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The exercise follows the rescue model imposed after last year's
Sept. 21 earthquake, and focuses on the operations of each county and
city's coordination centers for civil defense mobilization in order
to improve the public's ability to react. Local garrison forces are
also called in to support and coordinate with civil defense forces.</P>
      <P>The exercise included a simulation of several emergency
situations at an abandoned chemical fertilizer plant in Hsinchu City.</P>
      <P>First, under the premise of a hypothetical drop in
pro-unification sentiment followed by mainland China attempting to
take Taiwan by force with missile and fighter attacks, a "mob" of 500
men gathered in front of a mock-up of Hsinchu City Hall to simulate
an insurrection to force the government to enter into peace talks
with mainland China.</P>
      <P>As the simulated drill at the abandoned industrial site went on,
riot police and water cannons moved in to disperse the increasingly
aggressive crowd after the deputy mayor failed to talk them out of
leaving -- as planned.</P>
      <P>The exercises also allowed related forces to practice rescue
efforts in the event of a bombing run on a Hsinchu chemical plant,
including fires, ruptured gas lines, and collapsed buildings with
people trapped inside. Coordinated teams from law enforcement,
medical, fire fighting, and health sectors joined in the simulated
rescue.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) on
Tuesday denied a report that mainland Chinese military aircraft flew
close to the center line of the Taiwan Strait on the eve of President
Chen Shui-bian's overseas trip.</P>
      <P>Unidentified military sources said four mainland Chinese jet
fighters conducted offshore patrol missions on Aug. 12, two of which
flew close to the middle line of the Taiwan Strait at around 9:53
a.m. on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China Air Force then went on heightened alert and
kept a close watch on the mainland fighters' flight paths and
movements, the sources said, adding that the alert was not lifted
until between 10:40 a.m. and 10:50 a.m.</P>
      <P>The mainland aircraft were reportedly J-8 fighters, the mainland
version of Russian-made MiG 21s, which the sources said might have
taken off from a mainland air base in northern Fujian Province,
located opposite Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The report caused concern as Chen left Taipei on Sunday for his
first post-inauguration overseas visit which will take him to six of
the ROC's diplomatic allies -- the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua,
Costa Rica, the Gambia, Burkina Faso and Chad.</P>
      <P>However, both the Air Force Operations Command and the Air Force
General Headquarters denied the report, saying that because of rainy
weather on Aug. 12, no PLA fighters took off for offshore patrol
missions.</P>
      <P>A senior officer with the Air Force Operations Command said he
was on duty at the command that day. "I fully remember the situation
on the day. Because of bad weather, no mainland Chinese warplanes
flew close to the center line of the Taiwan Strait which separates
Taiwan from the mainland," he said firmly.</P>
      <P>According to the officer, it is all too common for mainland
warplanes to conduct patrol missions off the Fujian coast, commonly
known as "offshore patrols" in the mainland military jargon. "But
there were absolutely no mainland fighters flying along the middle
line of the Taiwan Strait last Saturday," he stressed.</P>
      <P>The officer further said it is understandable that local people
are concerned about Taiwan Strait security during the president's
absence.</P>
      <P>In fact, the officer said, the air force has gone on heightened
alert and maintains constant close monitoring of mainland China's
military movement.</P>
      <P>MND spokesman Gen. Kung Fan-ding also said mainland China's
People's Liberation Army (PLA) has not conducted any abnormal
movement in the past few days and has only embarked on routine
training exercises.</P>
      <P>Kung said the ROC military has consistently kept a close watch on
PLA activities. "We have not detected any changes in the PLA's
deployment so far," he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MND officials said Chen's overseas visit will not
affect the schedule of various military training programs.</P>
      <P>For instance, the officials went on, the Wan-An No. 23 civil air
defense drill, part of the annual combined services military training
exercise code-named Han Kuang No. 16, was held on Tuesday afternoon
as scheduled.</P>
      <P>The officials said all Han Kuang No. 16-related preparations and
training drills will proceed as scheduled despite Chen's absence.</P>
      <P>The Han Kuang No. 16 exercise will last for six months in order
to upgrade the three military branches' capability to engage in
three-dimensional or amphibious warfare.</P>
      <P>After his return from the Aug. 13-25 overseas journey, Chen will
preside over a computerized simulation confrontation between two
military units, one of which will act as an enemy force. The
president will also review all troops taking part in the annual Han
Kuang exercise.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN TO TACKLE NUC ISSUE AFTER RETURN FROM OVERSEAS VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has not ruled out
the possibility of serving as chairman of the National Unification
Council (NUC), a senior Presidential Office official said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Tze-nan, acting secretary-general to the President, said
President Chen does not want to see the NUC become a rubber stamp
if he assumes the NUC chairmanship.</P>
      <P>Chen said the president truly has considered inviting a
political heavyweight or other social celebrity to head the NUC.
"But no final decision has been made. The president will tackle the
issue after his return from his current overseas visit," he noted.</P>
      <P>The NUC was established in 1991 to serve as a presidential
advisory board offering advice concerning promotion of relations
across the Taiwan Strait and unification of the two sides in
accordance with the National Unification Guidelines which calls
for phased development of cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>During the Kuomintang era, the NUC was headed by the president
himself. President Chen, a stalwart of the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has reportedly been reluctant to
assume the NUC chairmanship for fears of drawing backlash from DPP
members.</P>
      <P>The late DPP Chairman Huang Hsin-chieh rejected former
President Lee Teng-hui's invitation to serve as the NUC vice
chairman because of the DPP's pro-independence stand.</P>
      <P>However, Chen Tze-nan said President Chen will not rule out the
possibility of serving as NUC chairman because he attaches great
importance to the development of cross-strait relations. In his
May 20 inaugural speech, President Chen also promised not to
abolish the NUC and the unification guidelines.</P>
      <P>Chen Tze-nan said President Chen will certainly honor his
promise.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he said, the Nub's role, function and
membership should be adjusted in line with changes in the
Taiwan Strait situation and local political and social climate.</P>
      <P>"And the adjustment direction and related details are not
issues that President Chen alone can decide," Chen said, adding that
the Presidential Office hopes to arrange for a summit meeting
between President Chen and KMT Chairman Lien Chan in the first
week of September to enable them to exchange views on the issue.</P>
      <P>Despite losing its grip on power, the KMT still controls a
majority in the Legislative Yuan, Taiwan's parliament.</P>
      <P>Following the proposed Chen-Lien meeting, the Presidential
Office will push for the convention of a roundtable meeting between
President Chen and the top leaders of three major parties -- the
ruling DPP, the KMT and the People First Party.</P>
      <P>"The roundtable meeting can also provide a forum for the
discussion of the NUC issue" said Chen Tze-nan.</P>
      <P>Chen Tze-nan visited the legislature on Tuesday to send
appointment certificates to legislators of different parties who have
been appointed to sit on a special cross-strait task force headed by
Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh.</P>
      <P>The 25-member task force, composed of legislators, social
celebrities, scholars and experts, will also serve as an advisory
panel offering counseling services to President Chen to help
forge a national consensus on cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Chen said he believes that both the NUC and the cross-party
cross-strait panel can co-exist and work smoothly to help forge
cross-strait rapprochement and achieve a breakthrough to the
long-stalled cross-strait relations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese poet Bei Ling, who is
chief editor of the quarterly literary magazine Tendency and has
permanent US resident status, has been formally arrested in Beijing,
a human rights group said here Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and
Democracy said police picked him up in Beijing and confiscated 2,000
copies of the latest issue of the magazine on Aug. 11. The police
has informed his family of his arrest, but did not give the reason
for the arrest. The information center said he might be indicted on
charges of attempting "to overthrow state power."</P>
      <P>The quarterly magazine, which was started in 1993, carries poems
and "underground articles," which are often seen by Chinese communist
authorities as unfit for publication. The Chinese authorities have
however adopted a tolerant attitude toward the magazine until now.
Bei's arrest is an indication that the Chinese government is
tightening its control over literary works, the information center
said.</P>
      <P>Bei, 40, went to the United States in 1988 and has become a

    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Aug. 15 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A human rights group alleged Tuesday
that China has released a political prisoner early in order to help
secure the status of permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) with the
United States.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and
Democracy said Liu Wensheng, founder of the outlawed "Social
Democratic Party of China," was released from prison on Aug. 9, about
20 months before the end of his 10-year prison term.</P>
      <P>The information center said that the US Congress will soon vote
on a bill that would grant China PNTR status if enacted, and that
the Congressional vote and his early release are related. His name
was on a list of Chinese political prisoners given recently to the
Congress by American labor groups, who have been lobbying against the
legislation, it pointed out.</P>
      <P>Liu, 32, was a student leader during the 1989 Tiananmen
pro-democracy movement. He was arrested in April, 1992 and was
sentenced to 10-years in prison on charges of committing
"anti-revolutionary crimes," because he established the Social
Democratic Party. It was one of the three major political parties
established by dissidents after the 1989 Tiananmen massacre in
Beijing.</P>
      <P>The Chinese government has promptly outlawed the political
parties and sentenced more than 100 of their leaders to long prison
terms, the information center added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan researchers working on a therapy for
ovarian cancer have come up with a vaccine which they believe can
also be used to help cut the number of stray dogs and cats on the
island in a cheap and humane way.</P>
      <P>Production know-how for the vaccine, described as a vaccination
against gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) using toxin
receptor-binding domain-conjugated GnRH repeats, was transferred to a
local business group on Tuesday for commercial production, according
to sources from Academia Sinica, Taiwan's top research institute.</P>
      <P>Addressing a ceremony marking the signing of an agreement between
Academia Sinica's Institute of Molecular Biology (ASIMB) and the
Chyang Sheng Group, ASIMB Director Shen Che-kun said the cooperation
marks another example of intellectual property transfer from academic
circles to the private industrial sector so that research and
development of cutting-edge technologies can be commercially carried
out on products that will benefit people and animals.</P>
      <P>The researchers reported in the July 15 edition of Cancer
Research, the organ of the American Association for Cancer Research,
that the ovaries of female rabbits injected with the vaccine
degenerated with just a single dose, rendering the animals
permanently infertile.</P>
      <P>Researcher Jaulang Hwang also noted that the vaccination can also
be used to treat diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, as well as
other forms of cancer.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Jen-fa, chairman of the Chyang Sheng Group, the
vaccination method is expected to help achieve effective control of
Taiwan's population of stray dogs, as well as offering a pain- and
stress-free method of neutering domestic pets.</P>
      <P>Chen added that in Taiwan, the current cost of castrating a male
cat is about NT$700 (US$22.6), while it costs NT$2,000 to spay a
female cat. The vaccine, to be manufactured by a newly founded Chyang
Sheng offshoot, will cost only about half that, and does not require
surgery.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan in the
first seven months of this year reached US$13.26 billion, according
to statistics released on Tuesday by the Directorate General of

importing US$22.68 billion-worth of goods from Japan, creating a
deficit that was US$3.51 billion up from the same period of last
year.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS attributed the increase to the boom in the local
information technology and machinery industries that caused increased
demand for imports of components and spare parts.</P>
      <P>In terms of value, Taiwan's imports from Japan increased by 39.1
percent in value in the first seven months of the year as compared

      <P>Taipei police on Tuesday announced that
they had rescued a kidnapped major stockholder of the Askey Computer
Co. and arrested all his abductors.</P>
      <P>Police said that Wu Yian-lung, 36, and Chai Yung-sen, 35, were
allegedly the masterminds behind the July 24 kidnapping of Chou
Pu-pin.</P>
      <P>They allegedly hired Kuo Kuo-feng, 27, and Kuan Chien-ming, 23 --
two mainland Chinese who were in Taiwan illegally -- to guard Chou,
while Hu Yi-kuang, a taxi driver, committed the actual kidnapping.</P>
      <P>Chai and Hu were arrested days earlier, while Kuo and Kuan were
arrested in an empty house in Taipei County on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu was caught by waiting police as he was returning to the house
to pick up his car, also on Tuesday. He denied taking part in the
kidnapping, saying that it was entirely a financial dispute between
Chou and Chai and adding that all he did was find the two mainlanders
to guard Chou.</P>
      <P>Police revealed that until March 16, Chai had worked for the
Investigation Bureau, where he was in charge of the security of
Hsinchu's Science-based Industrial Park, home to some of Taiwan's
largest electronics and computer companies -- including Askey.</P>
      <P>Chai's alleged involvement sparked concern in the park that if an
investigator in charge of park safety and security can break the law,
it will be difficult for companies to trust law enforcers in the
future</P>
      <P>Police added that the kidnapping was apparently a well-planned
crime because Chai and Wu never showed up on the day of the
kidnapping and Chai fled to mainland China afterward, while Wu
continued to give orders to Hu, Kuo, and Kuan via mobile phone.</P>
      <P>Police said that they had locked onto Hu from very early in the
investigation and listened in on his mobile phone calls. Through the
telephone conversations between Hu and Wu, police were able to locate
the hostage and move in to make the rescue and arrests.</P>

      <P>After many twists and turns, opposition
People First Party (PFP) legislators have finally decided to leave
for a long-planned visit to mainland China next week, party sources
said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, the PFP parliamentary delegation will
be headed by veteran Legislator Liu Sung-fan, also a former
Legislative Yuan speaker.</P>
      <P>The sources said the delegation will focus on meeting with
Taiwanese business people in Shenzhen, Xiamen and Shanghai. "As the
main purpose of the visit is to serve our people doing business on
the mainland, the group has no plan to visit Beijing, mainland
China's political center," said Legislator Chiu Chuang-liang.</P>

      <P>Chiu said former Justice Minister Liao Cheng-hao may join the
delegation on its visit to Shanghai, the last leg of the group's
mainland trip.</P>
      <P>Chiu further said the delegation looks forward to helping Taiwan
business people resolve their problems during its upcoming mainland
visit.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, the mission members do not expect to meet with
high-ranking mainland officials," Chiu said, adding that the group
will not request for meeting with senior mainland leaders.</P>
      <P>Except for Taiwanese business executives, Chiu said, the group
may only contact local-level mainland administrators and officials of
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), a
Beijing-based quasi-official intermediary body authorized to handle
exchanges with Taiwan in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Chiu said the delegation hopes to exchange views with mainland
administrators and ARATS officials on practical issues regarding
cross-strait exchanges, including illegal mainland immigrants to
Taiwan, cross-strait intermarriage and farm trade.</P>
      <P>The PFP, which was formed after the Republic of China's March 18
presidential election, first planned to organize a legislative group
to visit the mainland in June, but later postponed the travel plan
as PFP Chairman James Soong was reluctant to endorse it.</P>
      <P>Soong, a charismatic former Taiwan governor who lost his
presidential bid with a very narrow margin, and PFP Vice Chairman
Chang Chao-hsiung have said they are unlikely to visit the
mainland in the near future.</P>
      <P>The PFP has become even more cautious in arranging a mainland
trip after President Chen Shui-bian, a stalwart of the
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, recently criticized
opposition lawmakers for a rush to visit the mainland following
Taiwan's transition of power from the Kuomintang to the DPP in May.</P>
      <P>Chiu said the PFP legislative group will keep a low profile
concerning its mainland visit to avoid causing misunderstanding or
criticism of its mainland travel purposes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHUNGHWA TELECOM WORKERS TAKE IT TO THE STREETS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 9,000 labor union members of Chunghwa
Telecom Co. and their supporters on Wednesday took to the streets to
appeal for their rights in the face of the imminent privatization of
the largest telecommunications corporation in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The union decided to push ahead with the planned demonstration
after negotiations with officials from the Ministry of Transportation
and Communications (MOTC) broke down Monday evening.</P>
      <P>The union members demanded that workers' salaries not be cut and
that their mandatory retirement age should remain unchanged at 65
after Chunghwa's privatization, but their requests were rejected by
MOTC officials during the negotiations.</P>
      <P>The group of demonstrators, which also included family members of
the Chunghwa employees and labor union members of 13 other industrial
associations and state-run enterprises including Taiwan Railway
Administration, assembled at around 9:40 a.m. at Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall where they proceeded to the Executive Yuan to make
clear their appeal.</P>
      <P>Shouting slogans and waving banners, the demonstrators also
condemned Transportation and Communications Minister Yeh Chu-lan for
her recent comments that some Chunghwa labor union members were being
"insatiably greedy."</P>
      <P>They demanded that Yeh step down from her ministerial position
and asked that Vice Transportation and Communications Minister Mao
Chih-kuo not take up his latest appointment as Chunghwa Telecom
chairman, replacing Chen Yao, who resigned last week to protest
against the government's tampering with Chunghwa Telecom's stock
price before the company was listed on the stock market.</P>
      <P>The selling off of Chunghwa Telecom's shares in late August was
part of the first phase of a privatization plan in which a total of
33 percent of the government's holding shares in Chunghwa Telecom
will be sold off.</P>
      <P>A few days before Chen's resignation, Chunghwa Telecom Vice
President Lee Ching-chiang, 61, was found dead in the company
building's lobby. Lee's relatives and colleagues were quoted as
saying he suffered from depression and insomnia.</P>
      <P>Lee's death came after Chunghwa Telecom announced a NT$104
(US$3.35) base price for the upcoming share sell-off, taking a
further step towards eventual privatization. Chunghwa Telecom
authorities said Lee's death was unrelated to the stock sale.</P>
      <P>Trying to soothe the protesters, Mao, slated to be the next
Chunghwa Telecom chairman, managed to deliver a speech to them at
noon when the demonstration lines approached the Control Yuan
headquarters.</P>
      <P>As a vice minister who is set to head the soon-to-be privatized
Chunghwa Telecom, Mao said his first encounter with Chunghwa Telecom
colleagues "on such an occasion was awkwardly strange."</P>
      <P>Mao was castigated by the protesters when he said issues
pertaining to the welfare of Chunghwa Telecom workers are "internal
affairs" of the company.</P>
      <P>Mao was unsuccessful in soothing the demonstrators, who said his
rank was too low and demanded talks with "higher-level officials."
Mao later accompanied his new colleagues to the Executive Yuan, where
they met with legislators to hold talks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HIGH SPEED RAIL TO OFFER 15,000 JOB OPENINGS TO ABORIGINALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  16  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC)
promised on Wednesday to offer some 15,000 job openings to the
island's aboriginal people during construction of the high speed
railway and after its completion.</P>
      <P>THSRC Chairwoman Nita Ing and Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
Chairwoman Chen Chu jointly signed an agreement on Wednesday
highlighting the THSRC's intention of providing job opportunities to
aboriginal citizens so as to help improve their livelihood.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, CLA will first offer them career training to
provide them with the skills required by the THSRC.</P>
      <P>During the signing ceremony, Ing said the aboriginal people are
not only welcome to work for THSRC on the civil construction projects
during the five-year development period, but they will also be asked
to stay on as maintenance staff once the railway begins operation.</P>
      <P>Initially, the 11 civil construction works along the proposed
345-km high speed rail system will create 1,600 job openings for
aboriginal workers, Ing said, adding that eventually a total of
15,000 jobs are expected to be created for this sector of Taiwan's
society.</P>
      <P>The multibillion-dollar high speed railway that will connect
Taiwan's two largest cities -- Taipei in the north and Kaohsiung in
the south -- will pass through 13 cities and counties and 77 urban
and rural townships.</P>
      <P>The trains using the high speed railway will have an average
speed of 300 km per hour and will be able to shuttle passengers
between Taipei and Kaohsiung in about 87 minutes.</P>
      <P>The high speed railway, the first of its kind in Taiwan, is
expected to become operational by October 2005.</P>
      <P>It is also Taiwan's first infrastructure project to be built
under the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model, under which private
firms will build and operate the system for a set period of time
before turning over the management to the government.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING STEPS UP ANTI-INDEPENDENCE 'UNITED FRONT' TRICK AGAINST DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  16  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China has stepped up its
anti-Taiwan independence "united front" tactics against the Republic
of China's new ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),
Presidential Office sources said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Quoting mainland China's internal documents, the sources said
Beijing will strengthen its relations with Taiwan's pro-unification
New Party and People First Party (PFP) and actively court the
island's largest opposition party the Kuomintang, which ruled Taiwan
for more than five decades until May 20 and now still controls a
majority in the Legislative Yuan or parliament.</P>
      <P>As part of its "united front" trick, the sources said, mainland
authorities sponsored a series of anti-independence, pro-unification
seminars in southeastern mainland cities located opposite Taiwan,
including Shenzhen, Shantou and Xiamen, before Taiwan's March 18
presidential election with an apparent attempt to sway Taiwan voters
away from DPP candidate Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>At that time, mainland authorities invited Taiwan politicians
supporting Beijing's cherished "one China" principle to attend those
seminars whose theme focused on blasting the DPP's pro-independence
party charter and Chen's policy proposals concerning relations
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Despite Beijing's intimidation, Chen still managed to win the
presidential election. Against this backdrop, Beijing has
intensified its anti-independence "united front" trick. As part of
the drive, Beijing will join forces with the European Chinese
Peaceful Unification Promotion Association (ECPUPA) to sponsor a
seminar in Berlin from Aug. 26-27 to boost its cause.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office sources said ECPUPA President Zhang Manxin
traveled to Beijing earlier this week to discuss with mainland
officials in charge of Taiwan affairs the lists of mainland
Chinese and Taiwan attendees to the seminar.</P>
      <P>The sources said 56 mainland delegates, including Zhang
Jincheng, vice president of Beijing's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) -- and Wan Guoquan, vice chairman of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, will attend
the meeting.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 108 delegates from major pro-unification
organizations in Taiwan will also take part in the two-day seminar.
Among the Taiwan delegates will be Liang Su-jung, a former
Legislative Yuan speaker and head of the Cross-Taiwan Strait Peaceful
Unification Promotion Association.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office sources said Shi Hwei-you, vice chairman and
secretary-general of Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), has
also been invited to attend the meeting.</P>
      <P>Both SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies
authorized by their respective governments to handle
cross-strait exchanges in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Sources said the National Security Council under the
Presidential Office called a meeting earlier this month to
explore the feasibility of Shi's attendance to the Berlin meeting.
But no final decision has been made so far.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Alexander Downer has
urged mainland China to follow the steps taken by the United States
and Russia and reduce its nuclear weapons arsenal.</P>
      <P>In an interview with The Australian on the eve of a human rights
dialogue with mainland China, Downer said both the US presidential
candidates -- Al Gore and George W. Bush -- have committed themselves
to reducing the US nuclear arsenal and Russia has similar strong
views.</P>
      <P>"We would like to see a similar commitment made by China. I make
no apology for that. We would like to see China, instead of building
its nuclear weapons capability, reducing its nuclear weapons
capability," Downer said.</P>
      <P>"We would like to see all the nuclear weapons states and the
nuclear threshold states undertaking that task," he added.</P>
      <P>Without naming mainland China, Downer said that he is also
concerned about the transfer of missile technology around the world
-- a long-standing Western complaint against Beijing, the daily
reported.</P>
      <P>He repeated earlier comments that the proposed US nuclear missile
defense system is defensive in nature and that there is no reason for
any country to build up its nuclear arsenal to counter the system.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  16  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A former Republic of China envoy to
Canberra said that Australia has become a hostage to its one-China
policy to the detriment of its commercial interests with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In an interview with The Australian on Friday, Dr. Liu Polun,
former representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in
Canberra, said Australia had lost a golden opportunity to supply
Taiwan with 8 million tons of liquefied natural gas (LNG) because it
was suspicious that Taipei might use its commercial leverage to
influence Australia's foreign policy.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan wanted to sign an agreement with Australia because
it wanted to diversify its import sources. Liu told the daily that
the LNG proposal to Australia was purely a commercial proposition.</P>
      <P>"Australia has the advantage of having proven LNG reserves,
especially in the North West Shelf where there is a possibility of
expanding production to 7.5 million tons a year," said Liu.</P>
      <P>"The figure could be doubled if the Gordon fields are included.
We think that Australia's production capacity can be lifted to around
16 million tons a year," he added.</P>
      <P>Liu said he was disappointed that the Australian government mixed
business with politics, adding that if only Canberra had been more
forthcoming to his overtures, it could have struck an even more
lucrative deal. Instead, he said Canberra avoided contact with him
and Taipei and repeatedly denied trying to stall the deal.</P>
      <P>He contrasted Canberra's caution to the enthusiasm of its
competitors. Washington, Paris, and Moscow have courted Taipei for a
possible billion-dollar LNG deal, the daily reported.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STUDY FINDS HEALTH, WEALTH NOT ENOUGH FOR HAPPY RETIREMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, Aug. 15 (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Being healthy and wealthy may not be enough
for a retiree to lead a happy life, according to the authors of a new
study published in the Canadian Journal of Behavioral Science.</P>
      <P>"Missing workplace friends and being bored can also affect life
after work," said researcher David Evans of the University of Western
Ontario.</P>
      <P>Evans, a professor of clinical psychology, and Terry Lynn Gall, a
humanities faculty member at Saint Paul University in Ottawa, studied
109 men six or seven years after they retired and found changed
social situations were more typically on their minds than money or
health.</P>
      <P>They found that interaction with co-workers, feeling wanted, and
a sense of belonging have more of an impact on quality of life
because these factors represent more sudden interruptions to daily
routines compared with health and financial concerns which tend to
set in over time, Evans said.</P>
      <P>Material well-being, personal growth, and relationships with a
partner and family and friends are all considered when measuring
quality of life.</P>
      <P>While other researchers have assessed disruptions in lifestyle
immediately after retirement, the study by Evans and Gall differed in
that it involved assessing how people fare years after leaving work.</P>
      <P>The latest research also provides a more realistic image of post-
retirement life, said Evans, referring to the first six to 12 months
after retirement as the "honeymoon phase."</P>
      <P>"Once that phase is over, you sort of face the reality of
retirement," he noted.</P>
      <P>The authors hope their findings will encourage companies and
unions to work with employees nearing the end of their careers to
help prepare them for the psychological distresses that may lie
ahead. As well, they recommend post-retirement programs to monitor
changes in lifestyle and to help retirees evaluate their values and
goals.</P>
      <P>The latest study was a follow-up to earlier research involving
224 London, Ont. men who were assessed two to four months, then a
year, after retiring.</P>
      <P>Of those 224 retirees, 109, ranging in age from 61 to 75, some of
whom had been managers and others laborers, were interviewed and/or
completed questionnaires.</P>
      <P>The authors found that while most workers viewed retirement as a
positive step, only about a third looked forward to it and adjusted
well. The retirees complained of financial difficulties, missing
friends from work, being bored, and having trouble adjusting to
change.</P>
      <P>In fact, 16 percent of those interviewed saw nothing good about
retirement.</P>
      <P>The study suggests that while health plays a role in a good
quality of life, just as important -- if not more -- are the mental
pressures of coping after leaving the work force.</P>
      <P>"Symptoms of psychological distress (such as being unhappy,
depressed, or lonely) may be experienced as more bothersome on a
daily basis for the older adult than physical symptoms," wrote the
authors.</P>
      <P>Evans will retire next year to focus on writing. He hopes,
however, that a follow-up study by Gall or others might involve
recruiting retirees who take on community or paid work and comparing
their quality of life to those who don't take on new work.</P>
      <P>"I think a lot of people do well if they are employed in some
way, be it through gainful employment or being a volunteer," said
Evans.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Dominican
Republic President-elect Hipolito Mejia on Tuesday said that the
friendly relations between his country and the Republic of China will
remain unchanged after he assumes the presidency.</P>
      <P>Mejia, who will be sworn as the head of state of the Caribbean
country on Wednesday, made the assurance to ROC President Chen
Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>President Chen, who arrived in Santo Domingo on Monday, paid a
call to Mejia at his residence and exchanged views with him on ways
to enhance bilateral relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Chen during the 30-minute talks thanked Mejia for his country's
continued support for the ROC's bid to take part in the international
community. He said that he loves the Dominican Republic very much and
it has become his "second hometown."</P>
      <P>Chen last visited the Dominican Republic 16 years ago when he as
a Taiwan City councilman.</P>
      <P>Mejia expressed the hope that Taiwan will encourage its
businesses to make more investment in his country so as to help
create job opportunities and give a boost to its economic
development.</P>
      <P>Before meeting Mejia, Chen also called on outgoing Dominican
Republic President Leonel Fernandez. Chen extended his appreciation
to Fernandez for his contribution to promoting bilateral ties during
his tenure.</P>
      <P>While addressing the opening of the directors' meeting of the
Taiwan Chamber of Commerce in North America earlier in the day, Chen
spoke highly of the contributions that overseas Chinese have made to
the founding and democratization of the ROC.</P>
      <P>The conference was held in Santo Domingo specifically to
coincide with the President's Chen visit to the Dominican Republic.</P>
      <P>Chen urged overseas Chinese to put aside their ideological
differences and party affiliations, close ranks and stand behind the
ROC government. He was referring to disunity in the overseas Chinese
community, especially between "old" and "new" Chinese immigrants.</P>
      <P>President Chen, traveling at the head of a delegation composed of
more than 200 ROC officials, business leaders and journalists,
was in Santo Domingo for Mejia's inauguration on Wednesday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JUSTICE MINISTER APOLOGIZES FOR INVESTIGATOR'S INVOLVEMENT IN KIDNAP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan on Wednesday
offered his apologies to the country for the alleged involvement of a
former Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) agent in the
kidnapping of a local businessman.</P>
      <P>Calling it "the shame of the Ministry of Justice," Chen expressed
deep regret at Chai Yung-sen's alleged involvement in the kidnapping
of Chou Pu-ping, a shareholder of Askey Computer Corp., Taiwan's
biggest modem maker.</P>
      <P>Chai, 35, a graduate from Central Police University, had served
as an MJIB agent until March this year, when he quit his post at the
Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park in northern Taiwan and claimed
that he was going to the United States to study for a doctorate.</P>
      <P>He was fingered by his five accomplices as one of the masterminds
of Chou's kidnapping in late July.</P>
      <P>On July 27, the kidnappers wrote to Chou's wife demanding a
ransom of US$4 million dollars to be remitted into an account in a
Hong Kong bank. Chou's family reported the kidnapping to the police
the next day.</P>
      <P>Chai was arrested on Aug. 4 by police and cooperated with the
police to crack down on the five others, who included fugitive
fraudster Wu Yen-lung, a taxi driver, two illegal immigrants from
mainland China and Wu's girlfriend.</P>
      <P>All six captors had been rounded up as of Tuesday when Chou was
discovered hidden in a rented apartment in the Taipei suburb of
Hsichih.</P>
      <P>According to the testimonies gathered by investigators, Chou
received a call from Chai, whom he had known well for years, in late
July, saying that they were going to meet "babes" in a pub.</P>
      <P>Chou was then abducted to the Hsichih apartment, where he was
locked up for 23 days and guarded by the two mainland illegals.</P>
      <P>At the apartment, police found a coffin-like wooden box, which
the abductors said might have been used to transport Chou to the
mainland if necessary.</P>
      <P>Chai, whose testimony led to the five other arrests, might be
spared the death sentence in accordance with the code that encourages
criminals to cooperate with law enforcement agencies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP HAS NO PLANS TO VISIT EL SALVADOR IN AUTUMN: VP OFFICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu will take part in
a world women's summit slated for October in South Africa, but has no
plans at present to visit El Salvador at that time, the Vice
Presidential Office said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The comments by the Vice Presidential Office came after local
media reported that President Chen Shui-bian had told Salvadoran Vice
President Carlos Quintanilla Schmidt during a meeting in the
Dominican Republic capital of Santo Domingo that Lu is likely to pay
a visit to his country in September or October.</P>
      <P>The reporters had claimed that Quintanilla had originally
invited Chen to take part in a "Central American summit" scheduled
for later this year in El Salvador, to which Chen answered that Lu
may visit the country in September.</P>
      <P>Chen, traveling at the head of a Republic of China delegation of
more than 200 people, arrived in the capital of the Dominican
Republic on Monday to attend the inauguration of Dominican
President-elect Hipolito Mejia on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Foreign Affairs Vice Minister David Tawei Lee also
said he was unaware of any planned trip by Lu to El Salvador in the
coming months. Lee, who had just concluded a two-week tour of several
countries with no formal diplomatic ties with the ROC, added that the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) had not received any related
information either.</P>
      <P>Echoing Lee's remarks, Y.L. Kuo, vice chief of MOFA's Central and
South American Affairs Department, said the Foreign Ministry had not
been informed by the Vice Presidential Office of such a trip or its
supposed purpose.</P>
      <P>If the vice president plans to visit El Salvador in September,
her office should notify MOFA as soon as possible to allow MOFA to
make full arrangements for the trip, Kuo added.</P>
      <P>Despite the vehement denials, however, it is understood that Lu,
on behalf of Chen, might visit certain ROC diplomatic allies next
month, as Sept. 15 is the national day of Costa Rica, Guatemala,
Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Dominican Republic, Chen is scheduled to visit
Costa Rica and Nicaragua on his current Central American tour, but
not El Salvador, due to time constraints.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO EXCUSE FOR DIPLOMATIC FLOP: ROC PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Santo  Domingo,  Aug.  15  (CNA)
(By Oscar Chung and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian said here on Tuesday that there is still ample room and
opportunity for ROC diplomats to work for the country's diplomatic
cause, despite Beijing's diplomatic embargo on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen, who arrived in the Dominican Republic on Monday for a state
visit, made the remarks during a lunch meeting with the staff of the
ROC Embassy in Santo Domingo.</P>
      <P>Chen first recognized the devotion and contributions of all
embassy staff in promoting relations with the Caribbean nation over
the years. The ROC's first opposition leader-turned-president further
said he fully understands the hurdles in carrying out diplomatic work
in the face of mainland China's constant diplomatic offensive against
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he said he believes Beijing's perennial attempts to
block Taiwan's presence on the world stage and sabotage its relations
with other countries should not be used as an excuse for the
country's diplomatic plight.</P>
      <P>Noting that diplomacy is the most important symbol of an
independent sovereign state, Chen said the ROC must step up its
diplomatic work to signify its sovereign status.</P>
      <P>He acknowledged that it is no easy task to break the
Beijing-imposed diplomatic isolation. "But I believe where there is a
will, there is a way. So long as we have the resolve, we will be able
to find a way to overcome the obstacle. Nothing is impossible. We
still have ample room to achieve a breakthrough in our diplomatic
plight. So long as we want success, we can find a way to realize our
goal," the outspoken president noted.</P>
      <P>Stressing that mainland China is not expected to cease its
diplomatic suppression of Taiwan in the foreseeable future, Chen said
the ROC's diplomatic corps should not use this as an excuse for
lackluster performance in the diplomatic domain.</P>
      <P>"We should have vision and the ambition to boost our national
interests, safeguard our national status and dignity, and upgrade our
international profile," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The Dominican Republic is the first leg of Chen's first
post-inauguration overseas visit. The president said he wants to take
advantage of his current six-state "journey of friendship" to further
cement the ROC's existing diplomatic ties and display to the world
the ROC's economic and democratic achievements.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is proud to be the first ROC president to visit the
Dominican Republic since the two countries forged diplomatic ties 60
years ago. Noting that new Dominican President Hipolito Mejia had
made 22 visits to Taiwan, Chen said he is convinced that bilateral
ties will become even stronger in the future.</P>
      <P>During his stints as Taipei mayor, a legislator and a Taipei City
councilor, Chen said he has made many overseas trips. "Whenever I see
our national flag during my overseas trips, I have been excited, as
have been our expatriates and business people abroad," he said,
adding that the ROC national flag is the common language of all ROC
citizens, regardless of their party affiliation, ethnic origin or
ideology.</P>
      <P>Responding to Chen's call for ROC diplomats not to use Beijing's
diplomatic embargo as an excuse for the country's diplomatic plight,
Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao, a member of Chen's entourage, said
the president's remarks were mainly aimed at boosting morale among
the ROC diplomatic staff.</P>
      <P>Tien echoed Chen's view that there is still ample room for the
ROC to improve its relations with other countries, saying that the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now working hard to boost ties with
the 15-member European Union, the United States and Japan.</P>
      <P>Chen's ongoing 13-day globe-trotting visit will also take him to
the Central American states of Nicaragua and Costa Rica as well as
the Gambia, Burkina Faso and Chad in West Africa.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN MEETS HAITIAN, PANAMANIAN LEADERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Santo  Domingo,  Aug.  15  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC President Chen Shui-bian met
with Haitian President Rene Preval and vice presidents of Panama, El
Salvador and Guatemala on Tuesday for wide-ranging talks.</P>
      <P>Chen arrived in the Dominican Republic on Monday to attend the
inauguration of President-elect Hipolito Mejia on Wednesday. This is
Chen's his first state visit since taking office on May 20.</P>
      <P>Chen took advantage of his current visit to the Caribbean nation
to meet with his counterparts or senior officials from the Republic
of China's diplomatic allies, who are also here to attend Mejia's
inauguration.</P>
      <P>During his meeting with Preval, Chen invited the Haitian
president to visit Taiwan in October to attend the ROC's Double Ten
National Day celebration.</P>
      <P>Chen also reaffirmed the ROC's commitment to economic aid to
Haiti, saying his administration will faithfully carry out all
existing cooperative programs between the two countries.</P>
      <P>For his part, Preval said he is interested in visiting Taiwan in
October. He further said although Beijing has used its clout in the
United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to pressure Haiti, his
government will not switch its diplomatic allegiance and will
continue maintaining full diplomatic ties with the ROC. Mainland
China, a UNSC permanent member, has threatened to boycott the
dispatch of UN peacekeeping forces to Haiti to force the Caribbean
nation to cut diplomatic ties with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Chen held talks with Panamanian Second Vice
President Dominador Kaiser Bazan on matters of mutual concern. Bazan
first conveyed to Chen a personal letter from Panamanian President
Mireya Moscoso expressing her gratitude for the hospitality shown by
the ROC government and people during her July visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Bazan invited Chen to visit his country on the behalf of the
Panamanian government. In reply, Chen said Moscoso was the first
foreign head of state to visit the ROC after his inauguration. "I
appreciate her visit and will make a reciprocal visit at an
appropriate time," Chen said, adding that he will invite Evergreen
Group Chairman Chang Jung-fa to accompany him on his Panama visit.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based Evergreen Group operates the world's largest
container shipping fleet and has many interests in Panama.</P>
      <P>Bazan said as Panama just reclaimed control of the Panama Canal
from the United States, it needs support and assistance from the ROC
and other countries in managing and developing the canal.</P>
      <P>Chen assured Bazan that the ROC government will fully honor its
promise to assist Panama in the management and development of the
canal and its nearby zone.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, Chen also met with Salvadoran Vice President Carlos
Quintanilla Schmidt for exchanges of views on bilateral ties. Chen
told Quintanilla that ROC Vice President Annette Lu may visit El
Salvador in September or October.</P>
      <P>For his part, Quintanilla invited Chen to attend a summit
meeting between the ROC and its Central American allies to be held
in El Salvador next year. Chen said he will consider the invitation.</P>
      <P>The Dominican Republic is the first leg of Chen's current
six-state "journey of friendship" aimed at cementing the ROC's
diplomatic relations with its allies after the ROC completed its
first democratic transition of power between different political
parties in May.</P>
      <P>The Aug. 13-25 hectic visit will also take Chen to Nicaragua and
Costa Rica in Central America and three West African countries --
the Gambia, Burkina Faso and Chad.</P>

      <P>The government reached an agreement on
Wednesday with union members of Chunghwa Telecom Co., ending a Taipei
street protest of some 9,000 union members.</P>
      <P>The Chunghwa union members and their supporters took to the
streets earlier in the day to appeal for their rights in the face of
the imminent privatization of the country's largest
telecommunications corporation.</P>
      <P>The union demanded that workers' salaries not be cut and that
their mandatory retirement age should remain unchanged at 65 after
Chunghwa's privatization.</P>
      <P>Wea Chi-lin, secretary-general of the Executive Yuan, received
union representatives and reached an agreement with them promising to
resolve the problem.</P>
      <P>According to the agreement, while the government is very

enterprises is the set policy of the government. The agreement adds
that problems related to workers' rights in the process of
privatization can be negotiated by incoming Chunghwa Chairman Mao
Chih-kuo and union representatives.</P>
      <P>The agreement also indicates that if the process of the
privatization touches on other ministries besides the Ministry of

vehicles and personnel during the 20-minute drill.</P>
      <P>The island's garrison forces conducted field air defense

It began in central regions on Aug. 1, was held in southern Taiwan on
Aug. 4., and in eastern Taiwan on Aug. 7. Tuesday saw northern

      <P>The exercise follows the rescue model imposed after last year's
Sept. 21 earthquake and focuses on the operations of each county's

      <P>This was the first time Kinmen had been included in the drill,

cooperation and alertness displayed by its residents.</P>
      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Chen Shui-tsai pointed out that
Wednesday's exercise was especially aimed at those aged under 40, who
have never experienced the actual air raids or bombardments endured

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO DEVELOP KNOWLEDGE-BASED ECONOMY: ROC PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  16  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Tang Fei on
Wednesday unveiled a proposal to transform Taiwan into a
knowledge-based economy that is on par with the world's most advanced
nations within ten years.</P>
      <P>Tang said at a regular meeting of local industrial and commercial
leaders that a decade-long observation of the development,
experiences, and accomplishments of the United States shows that
Taiwan must look upon a knowledge-based economy as an international
trend and adjust its development accordingly.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan already has a basic foundation for
developing such an economy because of the government's long-term
nurturing of Taiwan's talent, its focus on technical development, and
its promotion of information technology and industrial automation.</P>
      <P>Tang went on to say that the Cabinet's plan for a new draft law
on the development of a knowledge-based economy will take three
months to complete, and that the final version will take another
month to reorganize. He therefore estimated that the government and
the private sector will be able to begin implementing the proposal in
January.</P>
      <P>The law will help supply basic network facilities, nurture
domestic talent and bring foreign know-how to Taiwan, establish a
mechanism for innovation and new ventures, and promote the use of
information technology and the World Wide Web, Tang said.</P>
      <P>Tang said that he would not deny the challenge involved in the
government's promotion of a knowledge-based economy, adding that the
most important aspect will be for civil servants to change their
mindset. For example, many government research and development units
lack sufficient interaction with the manufacturing industry, creating
gaps in government research endeavors and actual private sector
needs, he said.</P>
      <P>Morris Chang, chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.,
said at the same meeting that the development of a knowledge-based
economy will depend on three main factors -- technical know-how, a
corporate spirit for adventure and risk, and innovation.</P>
      <P>Chang said that Taiwan's hardware technology is fairly good, but
that the domestic software industry still needs improvement. He noted
that the development of forward-looking technology is particularly
important.</P>
      <P>Answering questions regarding a shortage of talented
manufacturing industry professionals, Tang said that in the face of
insufficient manpower, Taiwan must look beyond its shores for
workers, possibly including mainland Chinese. He added that the
government has already noticed the issue and will resolve it step by
step.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP REMAINS UNDECIDED ON WHETHER CHEN SHOULD HEAD NUC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 16 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman
Frank Hsien said on Wednesday that the ruling party has not decided
whether or not President Chen Shui-bian should head the National
Unification Council (NUC).</P>
      <P>Speaking to the media after a DPP meeting, he said that the party
has not yet made the final decision on this matter but that it is
still under discussion, and added that Chen himself has not yet made
up his mind.</P>
      <P>Since the establishment of the NUC in 1990, former President Lee
Teng-hui had served as its chairman until his term ended on May 20
this year.</P>
      <P>But the spirit of the NUC calls for Taiwan's unification with
China, running counter to the pro-Taiwan independence platform of the
DPP. Chen is a DPP member, which makes the issue of whether or not he
will assume its chairmanship an object of public concern.</P>
      <P>Hung Yu-chin, a heavyweight of the Kuomintang (KMT), said on
Wednesday that Chen has no reason to evade his responsibility of
assuming the NUC chairmanship, because it is a customary practice for
the president to take over that post.</P>
      <P>At the same time, KMT Secretary-General Lin Fong-cheng said that
if Chen agrees to head the NUC and invites KMT leaders to join it,
the KMT will be happy to comply with his request.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VEEP HOPES PRES. CHEN CAN BE INVITED TO WHITE HOUSE AS GUEST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 16 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said on Wednesday
that she hopes that one day President Chen Shui-bian will be invited
to the White House as a guest to further enhance substantial
relations between the Republic of China and United States.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remark in a meeting with visiting US Congressman Rob
Riley (R-AL).</P>
      <P>Lu noted that the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, and Yasir
Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, have been
invited to the White House as guests. Considering the long and close
relations between Taipei and Washington, the leader of the Republic
of China should have been treated better during his recent stopover
in Los Angeles, she said.</P>
      <P>Lu also said that 20 years ago, when she was imprisoned for her
involvement in Taiwan's democracy movement, she could not imagine
that Taiwan would reach its current state of democratization. Even in
March's presidential election, she still was not sure whether the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) would be able to win the election,
Lu added.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan voters chose the DPP, and the island took another
step toward pure democracy without any bloodshed, she said, adding
that this was accomplished by the effort of all of Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>Riley told Lu that the shining example of Taiwan's successful
democratic movement is the reason why most US congressmen support
Taiwan, and these US lawmakers will continue backing the ROC to
ensure peace in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that local people have high expectations for President
Chen's current overseas trip to Taiwan's diplomatic allies, which
they hope will allow him to carry Taiwan's voice to the world.
However, Lu lamented that Chen had received unsatisfactory treatment
during his stopover in the United States.</P>
      <P>On the same day, Riley also had a meeting with Lin Chong-ping,
vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).</P>
      <P>Lin told Riley that he thinks relations between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait will move in a positive direction, considering the
two sides' mutual economic independence and the increasing demand for
democracy within mainland China.</P>
      <P>Riley said that no country in history ever benefited from
conflict, adding that the cross-strait economic interdependence can
enable a "win-win" situation for the two.</P>
      <P>Referring to the question of balanced military power, the US
congressman added that it is necessary that the United States supply
Taiwan with sufficient defensive arms to maintain peace and security
in the region.</P>
      <P>Riley said he hopes that Taiwan will use its democratic and
economic power to push for the positive development of cross-strait
ties.</P>

      <P>Prosecutors and other law enforcement
authorities on Wednesday searched the office and the house of
Legislator Liao Fu-pen (Kuomintang-Yunlin County). They took away
some 10,000 shares from Liao's house.</P>
      <P>Lin Chieh-teh of the Public Prosecutor's Office of Taiwan's High
Court told the media that the search was conducted because Chi Mei
Corporation complained to the Tainan District Prosecutor's Office
that some people were suspected to have fabricated Chi Mei shares.</P>
      <P>Two prosecutors from Tainan first entered Liao's office in the
Legislative Yuan's Chunghsing Building on Wednesday afternoon. Police
guarding the Legislative Yuan argued with them over their right to
search Liao's office.</P>
      <P>Liao's aide said that the prosecutors stayed at the office
for about one hour, but took nothing away.</P>
      <P>On Thursday night, the prosecutors and law enforcement

(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A videotaped
greeting from Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian to the
president, officials, and people of the Dominican Republic has been
broadcast on about a dozen local television channels since Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen, who arrived in Santo Domingo on that day, is on the first
stop of his 13-day, six-state trip to the Caribbean, Central America,
and West Africa.</P>
      <P>In the video, Chen reaffirmed the ROC's ties with the Caribbean
country and congratulated Dominican Republic President-elect Hipolito
Mejia, who was later sworn in on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that although the ROC and the Dominican Republic are
far apart geographically, common ideals between the two governments
and the two peoples regarding democracy, freedom, human rights, and
the establishment of pluralistic societies have allowed the two
countries to maintain a close alliance and cooperative relations
since bilateral ties were established.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the ROC will continue to actively promote all
manner of cooperative projects between the two nations, adding that
he is certain that his visit will further improve the cooperative
relationship between the two nations -- particularly in the areas of
politics, economics and trade, technology, and international affairs.</P>
      <P>He added that he hopes his visit will also cement the mutual
understanding and friendship between the two peoples.</P>
      <P>Chen, who last visited the Dominican Republic 16 years ago when
he was a Taipei City councilman, went on to say that his visit is
significant in that it is the first time that he is attending an
ally's presidential inauguration ceremony in the capacity as
the head of state of the ROC.</P>
      <P>He added that the March 18 ROC presidential election rewrote
history by implementing the first-ever democratic transfer of
political power in Taiwan from one party to another, making the ROC a
truly democratic country.</P>
      <P>With domestic policies, foreign relations, and cross-strait
policies steadily moving forward, Chen said that the ROC will
continue to speed up the pace of Beijing-Taipei exchanges under the
principle of mutual respect and for the benefit and prosperity of
both sides.</P>
      <P>In international affairs, Chen said that the ROC will continue to
actively participate in international organizations and activities as
well as develop cooperative relations with all democratic,
freedom-loving nations in the world.</P>
      <P>Chen, traveling at the head of a delegation of more than 200 ROC
officials, business leaders and journalists, will stay in the
Caribbean republic until Aug. 17, after which he will travel to

his contributions to the promotion of bilateral ties during his
four-year term, while Fernandez thanked the ROC government for its
help in his country's development of hi-tech industries and the
setting up of science-based parks.</P>
      <P>Chen also presented Fernandez with the gift of a computer

Fernandez on Wednesday as the Dominican Republic's new head of state

      <P>Mejia, an agricultural engineer, told Chen that he was deeply
impressed by Taiwan's expertise in agriculture and water engineering,
and voiced his desire for greater Taiwan investment in the country's
electricity and sugar sectors.</P>
      <P>Stressing that he has great admiration for the ROC, the incoming
Dominican president recalled that he first visited Taiwan in 1976,
and has visited the nation 22 times in his capacities as minister,
mayor and businessman.</P>
      <P>Mejia also recalled that he had visited late President Chiang
Ching-kuo and former Premier Sun Yun-shuan, and had traveled to the
cities of Taichung and Kaohsiung, in addition to Taipei.</P>
      <P>Mejia told Chen he has "a crush" on Taiwan and that he is
determined to continue bolstering two-way relations based on the

      <P>In the face of Beijing's strong offensive designed to lure away

      <P>Claiming that he felt as comfortable in the Dominican Republic as

      <P>The lady is a representative from a Gambian women's group which
in recent years has been up-and-coming, gaining its reputation
through the planting of vegetables that have contributed to improving
Gambian families' economic situation.</P>
      <P>When Chen and his 200-member entourage fly into Banjul from Costa
Rica on Sunday, the first ROC head of state to ever visit the African
country will be welcomed with a long line of tables covered with
fresh vegetables and fruits cultivated at farms in the suburbs of
Banjul under the technical guidance of members of an ROC agricultural
mission.</P>
      <P>The ROC agro-tech mission has helped develop four model vegetable
farms near Banjul, with members of 300 local households taking part
as planters.</P>
      <P>The four model farms, on a combined tract of 40 hectares, have
marketed produce which immediately earned a reputation for the
planters in the second harvest. Orders have even come from England
and Ireland for the vegetables, said Chen Yi-sung, chief of the ROC
agro-tech mission.</P>
      <P>The harvests have not only improved the households' incomes, but
have also turned the farms into a sort of tourist attraction in
recent months, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Apart from the planting technique, the ROC mission also applied
Taiwan's precious experience in organizing farmers' cooperatives to
the Gambian planters, allowing them to organize their own
cooperatives to serve farmers in various fields, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>From the cooperative, Chen said, the planters acquire
high-quality seeds imported from Taiwan, fertilizers, and other
needed equipment and materials.</P>
      <P>With one-fourth of the profits derived from every sale of the
vegetables being channeled into the cooperative bank, the farmers
will have enough funds to acquire new farm machinery, to maintain the
land, and to secure a good public irrigation system.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said, the cooperative offers low-interest soft
loans to the planters and also scholarships to help promote education
for the children of farmers.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the achievements of the ROC agro-tech mission, ROC
Ambassador to Gambia Lee Chen-hsiung, who was largely instrumental in
arranging the ROC mission to lead the Gambian model vegetable farm
development, said the vegetable plantation project has proven to be a
quick success in efforts to promote friendship and to help improve
the locals' livelihoods.</P>
      <P>Lee said he is proud that the ROC agro-tech mission has harvested
so much with relatively little effort. He attributed the achievements
to an inspiration he got from the fact that some four decades ago,
the United States granted Taiwan US$15 billion in aid to help the
island develop its own agriculture, proving to be an important force
behind Taiwan's economic take-off in later years.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu will actively
consider paying formal visits to El Salvador and other Republic of
China diplomatic allies in Central America next month, sources from
the Vice Presidential Office said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Visiting diplomatic allies and promoting diplomacy are
responsibilities that the vice president has to share with the
president, officials from Lu's office said, adding that the vice
president will "actively and carefully" consider making the visits in
September.</P>
      <P>Lu's office on Wednesday had said that the vice president had no
plans to visit El Salvador in September in response to a local media
report which said that President Chen Shui-bian told Salvadoran Vice
President Carlos Quintanilla Schmidt during a meeting in the
Dominican Republic capital of Santo Domingo on Wednesday that Lu is
likely to pay a visit to his country in September or October.</P>
      <P>The sources said Thursday that Lu is likely to represent
President Chen and visit Central America next month as Sept. 15 is
the national day of Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and
El Salvador. They added that no concrete itineraries for the visits
have been worked out yet.</P>
      <P>Lu, who is currently in charge of Taiwan's top office while
President Chen is overseas on a six-state, 13-day visit, flew to the

The Australian on Thursday.</P>

      <P>He said a series of studies of Olympic athletes show that bronze

    <HEADLINE>M'LAND CHINESE EXHIBITORS WALK OUT OF CHICAGO SHOW OVER ROC FLAGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Aug.  16  (CNA)
(By David Wang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese exhibitors at the
Chicago Hardware Show walked out of the fair on Tuesday in protest of
the flying at the show's venue of several national flags of the
Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Chinese exhibitors had occupied 303 booths, making them the
largest participating group at the show. They said they were told by
their government to close the booths on Monday -- two days before the
show was scheduled to end -- to protest against the show organizers'
refusal to remove the ROC flags.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the exhibition's organizers said that trade shows
are pure business and should not be linked to politics. Exhibiting
firms from many countries are all guests of the fair, and all of them
should be accorded respect, he stressed.</P>
      <P>The mainland Chinese exhibitors were apparently dismayed by the
order to shut down their displays, in a protest which was believed to
be officially orchestrated.</P>
      <P>In a printed statement, the mainland Chinese delegation blasted
the fair authorities for allowing ROC flags to be displayed in the
exhibition hall.</P>
      <P>"This erroneous decision by the show organizers runs counter to
the United States government's 'one China' policy and offers Taiwan
authorities a stage to create two Chinas," it said.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) in
Chicago said they are appreciative of the show organizers' firm
stance of being fair and providing justice to all the exhibitors,
regardless of nationality.</P>
      <P>TECO officials stressed that the hardware show is purely a
private sector business activity, and mainland China's protest makes
no sense at all.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan exhibitors, who represent 61 companies from the
island, viewed the flag issue as ridiculous.</P>
      <P>The Chicago Hardware Show is the largest fair in the Western
Hemisphere for professional and DIY hardware, home improvement
products, and lawn, garden and building supplies.</P>
      <P>The fair kicked off on Sunday at Chicago's McCormick Place

    <HEADLINE>CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK DECLINES: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  17  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Consumer confidence in Taiwan's economic
outlook has declined because of a combination of factors, according
to the results of a quarterly government survey released on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The third quarter survey of the local public's confidence in the
general domestic economic situation was conducted by the
Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>Survey results show that consumer confidence in the domestic
capital market, economic outlook and job opportunities for the next
six months has all declined from the second-quarter levels.</P>
      <P>As much as 47 percent of those surveyed said they don't think
that the coming six months are a good time for stock investment.</P>
      <P>The quarterly consumer confidence survey covered six categories
-- the domestic inflation rate, household economic status, domestic
economic prospect, job opportunities, stock investment and durable
goods purchases for the next half year.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS used a zero-to-200-point scale to measure consumer
confidence in the above-mentioned six major economic indicators.
Survey results show that the score for each indicator fell below 100
points, which meant that consumers have become more conservative,
more reserved about future economic prospect.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, consumers were least confident of the
stock market prospect for the next six months, with a score of a
mere 69.1 points. Compared with the second quarter survey, consumer
confidence in stock investment registered the largest decline.</P>
      <P>And consumer confidence in domestic price stability was the only
category that showed a slight improvement in the third quarter
survey.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials attributed the falling consumer confidence to a
host of factors, including recent flooding in central and southern
Taiwan, the Pachang Creek tragedy and bearish stock trading in
recent weeks. "Because of these factors, consumer confidence in the
domestic capital market, economic outlook and employment
opportunities has all dropped," said a DGBAS official.</P>
      <P>As the Legislative Yuan's recent passage of a bill cutting the
legal bi-weekly working time to 84 hours from next year is expected
to have a significant impact on the domestic economic development,
the DGBAS especially surveyed public opinion about the issue in its
third quarter consumer confidence poll.</P>
      <P>Poll results show that the majority of the respondents said they
think that the new legal workweek scheme needs a further review or
supplementary measures should be adopted to complement the new
scheme.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 52.12 percent of employers interviewed
said the 84-hour-biweekly-workweek system should be subject to
further review or supplementary measures should be adopted if the
system will be put into force as scheduled; 23.4 percent said
implementation of the new system should be postponed for one year;
and only 9.57 percent said the new system should be enforced next
year as scheduled.</P>
      <P>In contrast, 28.25 percent of salaried people said they think
the new workweek scheme should be implemented next year; and 34.63
percent said they think a further study is needed before the new
scheme is put into practice.</P>

      <P>Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian met with Honduran President Carlos Flores here on
Wednesday, local time.</P>
      <P>Chen and his Honduran counterpart are in Santo Domingo, the
Dominican Republic, to attend Wednesday's inaugural ceremony of
President-elect Hipolito Mejia.</P>
      <P>Chen told Flores that relations between the ROC and Honduras will
continue to be very cordial and stable. Taiwan's recent transition of
power will not affect established ties between the two countries, the
ROC chief of state added.</P>
      <P>Chen took the opportunity to express gratitude to Flores on
behalf of Taiwan's government and people for Honduras' staunch
support of the ROC in its bids for membership in international
organizations, including the United Nations and the World Health
Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>Flores said that he was eager to meet with Chen in Santo Domingo
because he was unable to attend the ROC president's inauguration on
May 20 in Taipei, as he had to deliver a keynote speech at the
university commencement ceremony of his eldest son.</P>
      <P>Flores went on to say that the friendship between Honduras and
the ROC is everlasting and inseparable, and urged Chen to visit his
country. Honduras holds the same democratic concepts and shares
common goals with the ROC, and will continue supporting the ROC's
bids for membership in international organizations, Flores added.</P>
      <P>Chen replied that he understood Flores' reason for missing his
inauguration, saying that the affection of a parent toward a child is
paramount. He noted that he had attended the commencement ceremony of
his daughter in June.</P>
      <P>Chen reaffirmed that relations between the two countries will not
be affected by the recent ROC transition of power, adding that all
economic and technical cooperation projects will continue as before.</P>
      <P>President Chen also extended his invitation to President Flores
to visit Taipei.</P>
      <P>Secretary-General of the National Security Council Adm. (Retired)
Chuang Ming-yao, Foreign Minister Tien Hong-mao, and Deputy Secretary
General to the President Eugene Chien were also present at the

    <HEADLINE>MAC POSITIVE ON SETTING UP BANK LIAISON OFFICES IN MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  17  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Senior mainland affairs and finance
officials said on Thursday that they are working on a proposal of
allowing local banks to set up representative offices in mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Both John C.C. Teng, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), and Vice Finance Minister Sean C. Chen said
relevant government agencies are working on regulations to govern
bank applications for gaining footholds on the mainland.</P>
      <P>They made the remarks at a public hearing on the pros and cons
of allowing local banks to open liaison offices or representative
offices on the other side of the Taiwan Strait. The hearing was
sponsored by Legislator Hsieh Chi-ta of the New Party, a
tiny pro-unification opposition party.</P>
      <P>Teng said the MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland
China, is promoting the proposal in a positive direction. "We are
crafting a comprehensive package of regulations in cooperation with
the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of China to pave the
way for an orderly opening of local banks to operate liaison offices
on the mainland," he added.</P>
      <P>Teng pointed out that the local public remain divided over the
feasibility of permitting local banks to open liaison offices on the
mainland. While the proponents said the liberalization measure would
help facilitate mainland-based Taiwan companies' financial
management and market expansion drive, opponents said the move would
accelerate outbound capital movement and hinder local businesses'
acquisition of bank loans.</P>
      <P>Noting that the establishment of a bank liaison office must first
pass stringent screening of the mainland government, Teng said local
banks must consider whether they will face political pressure from
mainland authorities, such as asking them to spell out their
political stance.</P>
      <P>Teng said the government basically favors an open-door policy and
will carry out the policy in a gradual manner. Nevertheless, he
said, local banks should have "risk management" concepts and develop
a sound in-house supervisory system to prevent irregularities and
unnecessary financial losses.</P>
      <P>Teng also urged local bankers and members of the general public
not to have unrealistic expectations of the liberalization proposal.
Local banks should evaluate their own financial status and the
mainland financial and political environment before making
inroads into that market.</P>
      <P>Vice Finance Minister Chen echoed Teng's views, saying local
banks should carefully survey mainland China's financial climate
and banking regulations before deciding whether to tap that
market.</P>
      <P>Chen particularly reminded local bankers that they should take
into account the possible changes in the mainland market situation
following its entry to the World Trade Organization. "It is important
to understand whether mainland China offers an advanced environment
for banking operations," he noted.</P>
      <P>Chen said mainland China only allows 32 foreign-owned banks to
operate the mainland currency (renminbi)-denominated banking
services. Against this backdrop, he said, local banks should
consider whether they can survive if they open footholds on the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Chen further said opening representative offices is different
from opening bank branches because a representative office can only
collect information and is banned from operating banking services.</P>
      <P>So long as relations across the Taiwan Strait, Chen said the
government will not oppose local banks' plan to seek a foothold on
the mainland. "In fact, the finance ministry is working with other
relevant government agencies in drafting rules for local banks to
apply for opening liaison offices on the mainland," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOCIAL UNREST GROWING IN CHINA: MAC REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  17  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Social unrest is growing in mainland
China, the Mainland Affairs Council said in a report released
Wednesday at a regular meeting of the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The report pointed out that the number of public protests and
demonstrations in China reached 110,000 in 1999, a jump of 70 per
cent over the 60,000 registered in 1998. The situation is getting
worse this year, especially in the past one and a half months.</P>
      <P>Economic reforms in the past 20 years in China have made some
people rich, but have also created some factors that are
destabilizing the country, such as the problems of unemployment,
corruption, and the great disparity of wealth between rich and poor
areas of the country.</P>
      <P>The report also said that there is unrest in different strata of
society. For example, practitioners of Falun Gong are still defying
authorities despite widespread government crackdown on the spiritual
sect. The police arrest an average of 40 to 50 practitioners
everyday in recent months, and have detained 35,000 since April,
1999.</P>
      <P>The report warned that social unrest in China is not in the
interest of Taiwan, because the unrest may affect the situation in
the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>At a time when the development of
websites is facing a "bubble," Internet media should be based on
traditional media if it is to have a bright future, a Taiwan media
expert said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee Wan-lai, editor-in-chief of the Taipei-based Central News
Agency (CNA), made the remark at the Wisers Info Tech Forum 2000 in
Hong Kong. The conference is aimed at sharing experience and opinions
among the media industry in Chinese societies.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the rapid development of the Internet and the
mushrooming of diverse websites in the mid-1990s in Taiwan were based
on breakthroughs in high technology, the stimulation of the economy
and a free and open society.</P>
      <P>He indicated that conventional media with spin-off portals is the
future trend, but added that he did not think that Internet media
will replace conventional methods of news dissemination.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the opinion that media groups should have the
backup of other relevant business groups in order to ensure long-term
development.</P>
      <P>Lee mentioned that while many local network operators are finding
ways to obtain benefits, they have found it difficult because of
limited advertising resources, high personnel costs and high
technology costs.</P>
      <P>He said that providing only content on the web is not lucrative
and he suggested that some media portal sites transfer to e-business
industry and network operators to use high technology to promote
economy and trade.</P>

(By Alice Liang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The International Cultural and Education
Foundation of Dharma Drum Mountain on Thursday announced the
establishment of the Dharma Drum Mountain Foundation for the
Humanities and Social Sciences Prize.</P>
      <P>The foundation was established to promote public appreciation for
the humanities, said foundation founder Master Sheng-yen. He added
that the foundation was formed in commemoration of his teacher, the
late Elder Master Tung-chu. He said that he wants the new prize to be
thought of as "Taiwan's Nobel Prize," and added that he hopes the
prestige of the award will rise to an international level.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Master Sheng-yen emphasized that the prize will not
only be awarded to Buddhists, but also to all Taiwanese and even to
people beyond Taiwan's shores.</P>
      <P>Thursday's press conference, held at the National Central
Library, coincided with a donation ceremony. Shih Ping-huang, founder
and chairman of Sunplus Technology Co., and his wife, Wu Yi-yeh,
donated NT$200 million (US$6.45 million) to the new foundation. They
said that science and technology professionals like themselves earn a
lot of money from their knowledge, and should give something back to
society.</P>
      <P>Shih added that they made the donation to thank their parents for
raising them well. He likened their donation to "throwing out a
minnow to catch a whale," as their gift was small in comparison to
its potential benefit to society.</P>
      <P>Wu said she believed life is a continuous education, adding that
while she has learned to be dutiful, handle pain, and serve others,
she still has to learn to abandon fame and wealth.</P>
      <P>The foundation is actively seeking additional contributors to
assist it in funding the humanities and related research. It has set
a fund-raising goal of NT$5 billion (US$160 million).</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI, BEIJING SHOULD RESUME DIALOGUE SOON: US OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York, Aug. 16 (CNA)
(By Jennifer Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior US Department of State official
has urged the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to resume dialogue as
soon as possible to prevent unexpected twists from further hampering
cross-strait rapprochement.</P>
      <P>Darryl Johnson, deputy assistant secretary of state for East
Asian and Pacific affairs, made the call at a just-concluded "Track
II" roundtable meeting on cross-strait relations and the US policy
toward Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman Richard
Bush, also the top US liaison officer with the Republic of China in
the absence of official ties, made a similar appeal on the same
occasion.</P>
      <P>Both Johnson and Bush said they are afraid that if cross-strait
dialogue cannot resume promptly, changes in domestic political
conditions on both sides of the Taiwan Strait could add up to twists
and obstacles to resumption of bilateral talks.</P>
      <P>Johnson, who had headed the AIT Taipei office before assuming
his current post, and Bush said they believe that the timing for
resuming cross-strait dialogue is crucial. They pointed out that
Taiwan is scheduled to hold parliamentary and local government
chiefs elections late next year and mainland Chinese President Jiang
Zemin will step down the post in 2002. Noting that all these factors
could change the political climates on both sides, they said
cross-strait dialogue should resume as early as possible.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA on Wednesday, Prof. Donald
Zagoria, also the chief organizer of the Aug. 14-15 roundtable, said
although Taiwan and mainland China are not expected to come to terms
on their dispute over the "one China" principle, they are likely to
resume their long-stalled dialogue next year.</P>
      <P>Zagoria, who has made many visits to Taiwan and mainland China
for talks with their senior leaders in the past few years, said both
Taipei and Beijing basically hope to resume dialogue, but they are
hindered by their different definition of "one China."</P>
      <P>Zagoria said he believes the two sides will be able to narrow
their gap concerning the "one China" cognition. But he didn't
elaborate on the reasons of his confidence.</P>
      <P>The US China hand pointed out that cross-strait relations are
the most dangerous factor that could trigger military confrontation
between the United States and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Zagoria said, both sides of the Taiwan
Strait and the United States should face the issue with prudence,
patience, pragmatism and dialogue.</P>
      <P>Zagoria further said the current annual policy review meeting of
Beijing leaders at the summer resort of Beidaihe should be a key
point for observing Beijing's new policy guidelines toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Zagoria said he thinks that mainland China will continue its
military intimidation to curb growth of pro-independence force in
Taiwan while simultaneously inviting influential pro-unification
Taiwan politicians to visit the mainland for talks.</P>
      <P>Zagoria said he personally believes that the World Trade
Organization (WTO) would provide a forum for cross-strait dialogue
after both sides are admitted to the organization late this year or
early next year.</P>
      <P>This was the eighth cross-strait roundtable sponsored by the
National Committee on American Foreign Policy, a noted US think tank
which has enormous influence on US foreign policy.</P>
      <P>More than 20 scholars and experts from Taiwan, mainland China
and the United States took part in the two-day meeting. The
participants spent much time discussing ways to resolve the "one
China" dispute. Most of them said there is no easy way to settle the
issue in the near future. But they agreed that the continued
cross-strait trade and cultural exchanges are good omens for
improvement of bilateral ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN COMPATIBLE WITH SILICON VALLEY: SINGAPORE STATESMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Aug.  17  (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and Israel are the only two
countries in the world compatible with California's Silicon Valley in
the era of the "new economy," Singapore elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew
commented on Wednesday in Kuala Lumpur.</P>
      <P>Lee voiced his opinion that today, "only Taiwan and Israel have
adequate scales to maintain links with the US' Silicon Valley,"
because both Taiwan and Israel have a great deal of young
professional talent. He added that "close relationships between each
other can help produce many creative ideas."</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks while answering questions at a seminar
sponsored by Malaysia's Institute of Strategic and International
Studies.</P>
      <P>Recalling a symposium held by Cisco Systems Co. in which he
participated two years ago at Stanford University, Lee said "the
country which has the scale to maintain links with Silicon Valley"
was the answer to a major question hanging over the attendees --
which country could create a Silicon Valley of its own?</P>
      <P>According to the Singapore senior statesman, the city state does
not lack the funds for career development, but the people of
Singapore are content with what they have. Therefore, "we must change
the people's concepts and culture, and change their old-fashioned
mindsets," he noted.</P>
      <P>Noting that the use of the Internet will be ubiquitous in the
coming 20 or 30 years, he stressed that to succeed in the era of the
"new economy," people should make all-out efforts to face challenges
and be brave enough to take risks, including the possibility of
losing their affluent lifestyles and wealth.</P>
      <P>Lee returned to Singapore on Thursday after concluding a four-day
visit to Malaysia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JUSTICE MINISTER APOLOGIZES FOR PROSECUTOR'S STATEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan on Thursday
apologized to legislator Liao Hwu-peng for a public prosecutor's
statement the day before which claimed that a raid on Liao's office
and dormitory had turned up fabricated stock certificates.</P>
      <P>The controversial incident marked the first time that the
nation's judicial personnel have entered the legislature to conduct a
search.</P>
      <P>Chen said at a press conference and later in a news release that
he is sorry for any damage caused by the prosecutor's statement,
which the prosecutor later retracted.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that a prosecutor should notify the Legislative
Yuan before conducting a search within its perimeters, but
Wednesday's search -- which took place before Legislative Yuan
President Wang Jin-pyng was notified -- "apparently showed a
difference in understanding" between the person they notified and the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>However, he added that the prosecutors did not search Liao's
research room in the legislature in the end, so that there should not
be any problems with regard to prosecutors searching the legislative
compound.</P>
      <P>Chen added that he did not take any "political considerations"
into account and was concerned only with whether or not the procedure
was legal.</P>
      <P>However, regarding the search of Liao's Taipei residence, Wang
said on Thursday that the legislator's dormitory should have been
considered part of the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Wang added that Chen's apology is not the issue, because the
fundamental issue is really about respect. He went on to say that the
country is an integrated whole, whose different branches must respect
each other so that the autonomy of the legislature can be ensured.</P>
      <P>Legislative caucuses of the ruling and opposition parties held an
emergency joint meeting on Thursday, and the general conclusion was
that most legislators recognize the resolve displayed by the
prosecutors to fight corruption and crime, but that the new
government should show more respect toward the legislature.</P>
      <P>The controversy came about when Tainan prosecutors reported that
their search of Liao's apartment in the Ta-an complex, a "dormitory"
building occupied exclusively by legislators, turned up 10,000 fake
stock certificates in Chi Mei Electronics, an unlisted Tainan-based
company.</P>
      <P>Lin Chieh-teh of the Public Prosecutor's Office of Taiwan's High
Court told the media on Wednesday that the search was conducted
because Chi Mei Corp. had told the Tainan District Prosecutor's
Office that "some people" were suspected of having fabricated Chi Mei
share certificates.</P>
      <P>Upon learning of the search, Liao rushed back to Taipei from his
constituency in Yunlin County on Wednesday night. He told the media
that the shares the prosecutors had taken away from his house are
those of Chungtai Canned Manufacturing Co., of which he is board
chairman. He stressed that he owns no Chi Mei shares.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The world's center of economic
growth will shift from the Atlantic to the Pacific by 2040, Singapore
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew forecast on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>But Lee claimed that latent suspicions exiting between the
Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans will degenerate into conflict if there
is no assurance of big-power balance in the region.</P>
      <P>He said he thinks that the major threat will come from conflict
between mainland China and the United States over Taiwan. "The
largest imponderable is the danger of conflict between China and the
US over Taiwan's drift or move toward independence."</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks while giving a keynote speech at a seminar
sponsored by the Kuala Lumpur-based Institute of Strategic and
International Studies.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that mainland China will be the locomotive of the
region's economic growth after it enters the World Trade
Organization, Lee said that Northeast Asia will reap more benefits
than Southeast Asia from the situation by enjoying a three-fold or
five-fold increase in current business and investment volumes.</P>
      <P>According to the Singapore elder statesman, Taiwan, Hong Kong,
Japan, and Korea will also benefit from increasing investments in
Southeast Asia, as the economies of the northern regions are
complementary to those of the south.</P>
      <P>The challenge at present is how to maintain a security balance,
dissolve the possibilities of war and risk within the region, he
noted, adding that an all-out focus on economic developments and
market competition by regional countries will upgrade their living
standards.</P>
      <P>The 1997 financial crisis, he said, has slashed Southeast Asia's
growth rate in the region the from the previous level of 9.7 percent
to the current 7.6 percent. During the same period, the average gross
domestic product of the Northeast Asian economies jumped from 25.1
percent 27.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Citing additional figures as evidence, he detailed that the
combined value of Southeast Asian stock markets has declined by 23
percent, down from the pre-crisis level of US$753 billion in 1996 to
US$578 billion in 1999. At the same time, the combined value of
bourses in the north has grown by 64 percent, increasing from US$981
billion to US$1.6 trillion.</P>
      <P>Southeast Asian countries can ride out the crisis setback by
making the necessary changes and completing their structural reforms
to make them less vulnerable in the event of another market crisis,
he emphasized.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO OFFER US$ 4.6 MILLION IN LOAN TO DOMINICAN REPUBLIC</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China will offer US$4.6
million in loan to the Dominican Republic to help the Caribbean
nation modernize its congress and budget office, a senior official
in charge of foreign aid affairs said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Loh Ping-cheung, secretary-general of the ROC's International
Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF), made the statement after
Dominican Senate Speaker Ramon Alburquez said on Wednesday that
visiting ROC President Chen Shui-bian has promised to offer US$4.8
million as guarantee for his country to borrow money from the
International Monetary Fund.</P>
      <P>Loh said the Dominican parliamentary leader's remarks were not
fully correct.</P>
      <P>Loh said Eugene Chien, secretary-general to the President,
already held a press conference in Santo Domingo to clarify
Alburquez's statement. Chien accompanied President Chen on his
current six-state "journey of friendship" aimed at cementing the
ROC's diplomatic ties with its allies.</P>
      <P>Loh said the fact is that the ROC will join forces with the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in offering a loan of US$28
million to the Dominican Republic to finance its congressional and
budget office modernization plan.</P>
      <P>Of the amount, Loh said, the ROC will offer a loan of US$4.6
million and the remainder will be provided by the IDB.</P>
      <P>Loh said the US$4.6 million loan program has been proposed last
year and that the ROC government plans to earmark money for the
project in its budget plans for the next three to four years.</P>
      <P>According to Loh, the loan program will be implemented after the
two countries formally sign an agreement on the project.</P>
      <P>Loh said the government has kept open and transparent the whole
process of negotiating with the IDB and the Dominican Republic
government concerning the loan program.</P>
      <P>Loh stressed that the lending offer is an old project, not a new
aid program cranked out during President Chen's current overseas
trip. Chen said prior to his departure for his first
post-inauguration overseas visit that he will not make any new aid
commitment during his trip.</P>
      <P>Loh said the loan project is mainly designed to help the
Dominican Republic strengthen its democratic mechanism through
modernizing and beefing up its congress and budget office.</P>
      <P>President Chen arrived in the Dominican Republic on Monday to
attend the Caribbean ally's presidential election on Wednesday. He
ended his state visit on Thursday and left for Nicaragua to continue
his first overseas trip since taking office on May 20. Following
his Nicaragua visit, he will travel to Costa Rica and three West
African countries -- the Gambia, Burkina Faso and Chad.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US NEWSPAPER BLASTS CLINTON ADMINISTRATION FOR TAIWAN SNUB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A US newspaper on Thursday blasted the
Clinton administration for keeping Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian's US stopover under wraps in deference to Beijing, calling
it "Chinese interference in American internal affairs."</P>
      <P>Chen, who is currently on his 13-day, six-state "journey of
friendship" to the Caribbean, Central America, and West Africa, had
arrived in Los Angeles on Sunday for a 15-hour transit stop before
traveling on to the Dominican Republic.</P>
      <P>The Washington Post criticized the US government for doing
"everything it could" to keep the American public from knowing that
the head of state from "one of Asia's most vibrant democracies" was
in the country, for fear of upsetting mainland China.</P>
      <P>The paper went on to say that the administration even went as far
as pressuring Chen to back out of a "private, unofficial reception"
to be held in Los Angeles by a former congressional aide, to which
five members of the US Congress were invited.</P>
      <P>The reception was canceled, and only one of the invited guests --
US Representative Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) -- defied the
administration to meet Chen in person at his hotel.</P>
      <P>The paper pointed out that "a quick meet-and-greet" between Chen
and a few congressmen should not have been taken as something that
would renege on the United States' long-standing "one China" policy.</P>
      <P>It questioned Beijing's right -- or that of any foreign
government, for that matter -- to tell foreign visitors where they
may go or US congressmen whom they may see, calling it a blatant
example of "Chinese interference in American internal affairs."</P>
      <P>Chen, traveling at the head of a delegation of more than 200 ROC
officials, business leaders and journalists, is scheduled to leave
for Nicaragua on Thursday, after which he will travel to Costa Rica
(Aug. 18-19), Gambia (Aug. 20-21), Burkina Faso (Aug. 21-23), and
Chad (Aug. 23-25).</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAL TO BUY 25 PERCENT STAKE IN MAINLAND CHINESE AIRLINE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's China Airlines (CAL) plans to buy
a 25 percent stake of mainland China's China Air Cargo Transport Co.
(CACT), the Hong Kong-based China News Agency said in a dispatch from
Shanghai on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The news agency quoted Lo Chu-ping, board secretary-general of
mainland China's China Eastern Air Ltd., as reporting that CAL has
settled on mainland China's air cargo market in view of the fact that
both sides of the Taiwan Strait are expected to soon join the World
Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>China Eastern Air Ltd. holds a 70 percent stake in CACT, the only
all-air cargo transport company in mainland China.</P>
      <P>It is CAL's cargo transport strength, capital and management
experience that makes China Eastern Air Ltd. willing to seek
cooperation with CAL, said Lo.</P>
      <P>The news agency report quoted sources with mainland Chinese
transportation authorities as saying that because both CAL and China
Eastern Air Ltd. are mostly state-owned, the bilateral cooperation
will have a certain political meaning and will be regarded by the
mainland as a touchstone for the "three direct links" between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  southern  Taiwan,  Aug.  17  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local financial
expert calculated on Thursday that Alzheimer's disease will
eventually cost Taiwan as much as NT$17.6 billion (US$567 million)
annually.</P>
      <P>Chou Li-fang, associate professor in finance at National Chengchi
University, said in a seminar in the southern city of Kaohsiung that
the number of Taiwan people over the age of 65 already accounted for
7.1 percent of the population in 1993, which is considered an elderly
society according to the criteria set by the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's gray population this year has been recorded at 8.6
percent, and it is expected that the aged will account for 23.9
percent of the population in 2051.</P>
      <P>Chou indicated that the problem of the aging population should
receive more concern from the government, citing as an example the
fact that at present, around 340,000 old people in Taiwan need
long-term care because of senility, mostly as a result of
Alzheimer's.</P>
      <P>He added that each Alzheimer's patient costs the country between
NT$310,000 and NT$710,000 each year.</P>
      <P>Chou pointed out that caring for Alzheimer's patients is a heavy
burden for the families of the victims and society in general, and
suggested that the government establish a long-term care system to
solve the problem.</P>

    <DATELINE>Santo  Domingo,  Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By Y.Y. Chen and  Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A sum of US$46 million promised by
Taipei to Santo Domingo is a part of a syndicated loan designed to
help with the "parliamentary modernization" of the Dominican
Republic, Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian said on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that the money is not new economic assistance, but
rather part of a syndicated loan of more than US$20 million jointly
promoted by the ROC in cooperation with the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) to help modernize the country's parliament.</P>
      <P>According to the president, officials with the ROC Ministry of
Foreign Affairs had reported to him on several cooperation projects
between the ROC and some of its diplomatic allies in Central America
and Africa before his departure on his overseas trip.</P>
      <P>Some of the cooperative ventures were previously clinched by
Taiwan's former Kuomintang government, including the package to help
the Dominican Republic with its plan of "parliamentary
modernization," Chen said during a breakfast meeting with reporters
from Taipei.</P>
      <P>The president's remarks came after a statement made by Dominican
Senate Speaker Ramon Alburquez on Wednesday during the inauguration
of President Hipolito Mejia that Chen had promised to provide US$46
million to the Dominican Republic to help the country pay back
deposits to the International Monetary Fund.</P>
      <P>The declaration stirred up a strong reaction in Taiwan, with many
suspecting that Chen's administration is engaged in the very "money
politics," which the president had earlier vowed he would never stoop
to.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT YET TO DECIDE ON WHETHER TO SERVE AS NUC HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Santo  Domingo,  Dominican  Republic,   Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By Y.Y. Chen and Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of
China President Chen Shui-bian said on Thursday that he has not
decided on whether or not to concurrently serve as chairman of the
National Unification Council (NUC).</P>
      <P>Chen, who was in the capital city of the Dominican Republic for
Wednesday's inauguration of President Hipolito Mejia, made the
remarks at a breakfast press conference for Taiwan reporters covering
his 13-day, six-state trip which will also take him to Nicaragua,
Costa Rica, Gambia, Burkina Faso and Chad.</P>
      <P>"It's too early to say now whether I will be the NUC chairman,
and it is not impossible that the position could be filled by
somebody else who is fully qualified," he said.</P>
      <P>Concern has recently mounted on both sides of the Taiwan Strait
over whether or not Chen will take over the NUC chairmanship, as it
would be considered a gauge of whether Chen, a member of the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is likely to deviate from the
DPP's pro-independence stance and support Taiwan's unification with
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Former ROC President Lee Teng-hui founded the NUC and also served
as its chairman.</P>
      <P>Chen did say that the NUC will have to be reshuffled, as the
tenure of all its members expires soon, but he stressed that the
personnel change will not be tantamount to the abolishment of the
organization. He also said that any revisions to the Guidelines for
National Unification would have to be made in line with the changing
times.</P>
      <P>Chen said that any solution to the cross-strait dispute must be
first approved by the Taiwan public and that he will listen to the
voice of the Taiwan people before making any decision as to whether
unification is the only and best solution to the cross-strait
problem.</P>
      <P>The president emphasized, however, that normalizing cross-strait
relations is his government's obligation and "moral mission."</P>
      <P>Answering questions as to whether or not he will invite Vice
President Annette Lu to serve again as his running mate in Taiwan's
next presidential election if he is to seek reelection, Chen said
that since he has only been in office for three months, his focus has
always been on how to do a good job as president and he has never
even thought of the question of reelection, far less a running mate.</P>
      <P>In an interview in Taipei earlier in the day, Lu was reported to
have said that she would never run with Chen again, even if invited.</P>
      <P>Chen said that in future he will assign Lu to visit foreign
countries on his behalf, as she is interested in, and capable of
handling, foreign affairs.</P>
      <P>Lu, Taiwan's first female vice president, will reportedly visit
El Salvador, one of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central America, in
October. Her office has denied that any such plans exist.</P>
      <P>The president said his is satisfied with his visit to the
Dominican Republic and described it as "meaningful and useful."</P>
      <P>He thanked President Mejia for his "considerate arrangements"
which enabled Chen to meet with many heads of state and ranking
officials of foreign countries, thus improving mutual understanding
between the ROC and those countries.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he has accepted invitations from the presidents of
several diplomatic allies, including Honduras, to visit their
countries.</P>
      <P>He also defended what was described by the media as his "low-key"
transit stop in Los Angeles, saying it was out of respect for the
host country and the "tacit understanding" between Taiwan and the
United States.</P>
      <P>Chen and his entourage of 200 was scheduled to arrive in
Nicaragua, the second leg of his two-continent trip, later in the day
for a two-day visit.</P>

    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles,  Aug. 16 (CNA)
(By Chu Lu-sheng and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Delegates of the Republic of China's
major political parties observing the US Democratic Convention on
Thursday agreed that both Republican and Democratic platforms
regarding US support of Taiwan are similar.</P>
      <P>Shaw Yu-min, deputy secretary-general of the opposition
Kuomintang, said that although the Democratic platform does not give
the impression of being as clear and resolute as the Republican
platform, that is not really the key factor.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that what is important is that the ROC is now a
democratic nation whose values are in line with the United States'
so-called "mainstream" values.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, he continued, the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), a US
law that outlines US conduct toward Taiwan -- including the continued
provision of defensive weapons to Taiwan -- has been in effect for
several decades, and both the Republican and the Democratic parties
should adhere to the law.</P>
      <P>People First Party legislator Chou Hsi-wei agreed with Shaw that
the Democratic Party's new platform is basically the same as that of
the Republican Party, only worded differently.</P>
      <P>A comparison of the two party platforms reveal that both parties
support the "one China" policy, but the Republican Party supports the
Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, while the Democratic Party espouses
following through on the responsibilities set forth in the TRA.</P>
      <P>The Republicans describe mainland China "strategic competitors"
while the Democrats call them "strategic partners."</P>
      <P>The Republican platform states that the party will keep its
promise to the Taiwan people because they are long-term friends of
the United States, and because Taiwan's democracy is a "real"
democracy.</P>
      <P>The Republican platform also states that any issue regarding
Taiwan's future must be resolved in a peaceful manner with the
agreement of the Taiwan public. If mainland China goes against these
principles and attacks Taiwan, the platform states that the United
States will respond according to the TRA and assist in defending
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Democratic platform also urged Taiwan and mainland China to
resolve their differences through peaceful methods and refrain from
resolving issues by force. It went on to say that the Democratic
Party supports resolving cross-strait issues according to the wishes
of the Taiwan public.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSSIE PM URGED TO STOP BEIJING EMBASSY'S FALUN GONG HARASSMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A major Australian daily has urged Prime
Minister John Howard to stop harassment by Chinese diplomats of
followers of the Falun Gong religious sect in Canberra, Sydney, and
other Australian cities.</P>
      <P>The Sydney Morning Herald made the comments in a editorial on
Thursday. "When China oppresses its people, there is not much
Australia or any other outsiders can do, except speak up for the
oppressed. If China's fear of difference extends to its diplomats'
behavior in Australia, it is a more serious matter," the daily said.</P>
      <P>"As long as the beliefs and practices of Falun Gong harm no one,
they should not only be tolerated, they should also be protected from
anyone who might seek to curb or interfere with them," the paper
said.</P>
      <P>"The Prime Minister, Mr. Howard, who has been willing to speak
out in relation to human rights abuses in Malaysia, should be
consistent in this case, too," it added.</P>
      <P>The Herald published the editorial after the Chinese Embassy in
Canberra on Wednesday denied that its diplomats had tried to extend
the ongoing mainland crackdown on Falun Gong sect members to
Australia, claiming that an earlier Herald story to that effect was a
complete fabrication.</P>
      <P>The original story had quoted the Australian Security and
Intelligence Organization and the Australian Federal Police as saying
that they were monitoring harassment by Chinese diplomats of Falun
Gong members. The harassment included tapping the phones of Falun
Gong members, slashing their car tires, and damaging their property,
the daily reported.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chinese diplomats have also reportedly demanded that
the municipal governments of Blacktown and Hurstville, both near
Sydney, deny the sect members the right to use local facilities and
engage in community activities.</P>
      <P>"There is no mistaking the Chinese government's hostility to the
Falun Gong sect, in China and abroad," the paper said in the
editorial, headlined "In Fear of Falun Gong."</P>
      <P>Australia and China on Wednesday held a one-day closed-door
dialogue in Canberra on the issue of human rights in China.</P>
      <P>"It is not clear what discussion of the suspected harassment of
Falun Gong members in this country took place. But if the least
harassment has occurred, it is a matter of great seriousness. Falun
Gong members in Australia . . . should have the freedom to express
their beliefs within the law like anyone else," the editorial said.</P>

`World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders'?" asked
Helms.</P>
      <P>"Mr. Ambassador, the United States must not condone such

the Australian delegates to the bilateral human rights dialogue with

about alleged harassment of Falun Gong sect members in Canberra and
Sydney by the mainland Chinese embassy.</P>
      <P>"We obviously would not want to see harassment of any Australian

      <P>The Republic of China will continue to be
a major growing market for Australian beef in the coming years,
according to the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Research
Economics (ABARE).</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA on Friday morning, ABARE analyst
Tris Gleeson said that "Taiwan is our fifth biggest beef market and
we believe our exports will continue rising in the next few years as
a result of growing consumption of meat in that country."</P>
      <P>Australia is the world's largest beef exporter, exporting 22
percent of the world's total. In 1999, Australia's total beef exports
jumped to 868,000 kg from 856,000 kg in 1998. Japan is Australia's
biggest market, followed by the United States, South Korea, and
Canada, she said.</P>
      <P>In 1999, Australia exported 34,700 kg of beef and veal to Taiwan,
up from 33,700 kg in 1998, she said.</P>
      <P>Gleeson said the prospects of exporting more beef to Taiwan in
the near future are bright. "Our beef industry is competitive because
we produce grains, and our exporters benefit from geographical
proximity to Taiwan," she said.</P>
      <P>Gleeson predicted Australian beef exports would rise after Taiwan
enters the World Trade Organization, either at the end of this year

(By Y. Y. Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nicaraguan President Arnoldo
Aleman Lacayo assured visiting ROC President Chen Shui-bian on
Thursday that Nicaragua will continue supporting the Republic of
China's bid to join the United Nations and other world bodies.</P>
      <P>Aleman reaffirmed his country's commitment during a meeting with
President Chen at the Nicaraguan Presidential Office which was
completed recently with funds donated by the ROC.</P>
      <P>Aleman expressed his gratitude for the ROC's financial,
agricultural and technological assistance to Nicaragua since 1972
when the Central American country was rocked by a devastating
earthquake.</P>
      <P>"Nicaragua is a small, poor country. We appreciate and will
never forget the ROC's longtime support and assistance," Aleman said,
adding that his government will continue strengthening cooperation
with the ROC and back its bid to take part in major international
organizations.</P>
      <P>For his part, President Chen said he doesn't think that
Nicaragua is a small, poor country. "Instead, I think it is a great
country as it still boldly moves toward democratization after
enduring long-term martial law, civil war and numerous quake and
hurricane natural disasters," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The Aleman-Chen meeting was held in a conference hall dedicated
to the ROC in appreciation of the ROC's financial support for the
construction of the new Nicaraguan Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Chen thanked Aleman for his speeches in support of the ROC's UN
bid at the annual UN General Assembly plenary session over past
years. He lauded Aleman and former Nicaraguan President Violeta
Chamorro as statesmen with a sense of justice.</P>
      <P>Chen, a human rights lawyer-turned-politician said he admires
Aleman's frequent call for his fellow Nicaraguan countrymen to stand
up and contribute to national development. Like Aleman, Chen said, he
consistently thinks that Taiwan should stand up and walk out into
the world to break the Beijing-imposed diplomatic embargo.</P>
      <P>Chen arrived in Managua from the Dominican Republic on Thursday
for a hectic two-day state visit after attending the inauguration of
Dominican President Hipolito Mejia on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Upon his arrival at the Managua airport, Chen was accorded a
red-carpet welcome and full military honors, complete with a 21-gun
salute. Aleman personally presided over the welcoming ceremony at
the airport. Both Chen and Aleman reaffirmed their commitment to
further reinforcing bilateral ties and cooperation in various fields
based on existing foundations.</P>
      <P>Chen then paid a visit to the Nicaraguan National Assembly where
he was warmly received by a full house of Nicaraguan
parliamentarians, senior government officials and diplomatic corps
members.</P>
      <P>Nicaraguan National Assembly Speaker Ivan Escobar Fornos
conferred the Order of Pedro Joaquin Chamorro on President Chen in
recognition of his efforts to promote relations between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>Chen then delivered a speech to Nicaraguan parliamentarians,
stressing the ROC's desire to play a more active role in the
international community.</P>
      <P>Chen, the ROC's first opposition leader-turned-president, said
the ROC is more than willing to share its developmental experience
with its allies and work together with all countries around the
world for global prosperity and peace.</P>
      <P>Chen also told Nicaraguan lawmakers that he feels at home to
visit the Nicaraguan lawmaking body because he himself once served
as an ROC legislator for five years.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Chen visited the ROC Embassy in Nicaragua
where he was briefed by ROC Ambassador Tsai Teh-san on Nicaragua's
general situation and relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Chen told the embassy staff that his administration will
faithfully implement cooperative programs and lending and economic
aid offers signed by the previous Kuomintang government with
Nicaragua.</P>
      <P>Chen will sign a joint communique with Aleman prior to his
departure on Friday for Costa Rica to continue his current six-state
"journey of friendship aimed at cementing the ROC's diplomatic
relations with its allies.</P>
      <P>This is Chen's first overseas trip since taking office on May 20.
The Aug. 13-25 journey will also take him to the ROC's three West
African allies -- the Gambia, Burkina Faso and Chad.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CENTRAL AMERICA BECOMES NEW BASE OF TAIWAN'S TEXTILE INDUSTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  18  (CNA)
(By C.P. Wang and Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Over the past decade, Taiwan's textile
manufacturers have one by one moved their production lines overseas,
taking advantages of lower labor costs and investment incentives.</P>
      <P>Central America and the Caribbean countries have benefited from
this exodus.</P>
      <P>Comparatively high production costs, difficulties in acquiring
land for factories, and mounting environmental consciousness have
forced Taiwan's textile manufacturers to find solutions outside of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Mainland China and Southeast Asia were once the most favored
regions for Taiwan textile makers seeking to branch out, but many of
them became frustrated by disturbing non-economic factors, and
profits soon began to dwindle, making Central America more
attractive.</P>
      <P>In early June, the US Congress approved the Caribbean Basin
Initiative (CBI) Enhancement Act aimed at luring more investors into
the region to help stimulate the economies. With the implementation
of the CBI Act, effective from Oct. 1, 2000 through Sept. 30, 2008,
textile products from the 24 countries in Central America and the
Caribbean will be subject to beneficial treatment in the US market.</P>
      <P>With its tremendous demand, North America has long been the
target market of textile industries all over the world. In 1994, the
US Congress approved the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
to provide beneficial measures to Mexico. This allowed textile
products from Mexico to have easier access to the quota-regulated US
market.</P>
      <P>NAFTA helped Mexico to attract many foreign textile
manufacturers, among them Nien Hsing Textile Co. from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While foreign investors have concentrated their interest in
Mexico, NAFTA is indirectly to the disadvantage of the Central
American countries. The implementation of the CBI Act, according to
the Taiwan Textile Federation (TTF), will make the 24 countries of
the region more attractive.</P>
      <P>The TTF has suggested that Nicaragua, El Salvador, Costa Rica,
Honduras and Guatemala are most favorable to Taiwan's textile
manufacturers, in view of their abundant natural resources, low labor
costs, stable political situations and free economic systems. It
takes between three and seven days for deliveries from the Central
American countries to reach the US market, and a secure delivery
schedule is another advantage.</P>
      <P>Several Taiwan textile manufacturers have already set up bases in
Central America. Managers of these processing plants have pointed out
that Central America has various advantages.</P>
      <P>Nicaragua, for instance, was chosen by Taiwan textile
manufacturers because of low labor costs (US$115 per month), as well
as good supplies of apparel. Honduras has Puerto Cortes, the largest
seaport in the Caribbean Sea, while El Salvador has a sound
infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The Central American countries are also the most cordial allies
of the Republic of China. While reinforcing diplomatic relations, the
ROC government is also encouraging the industries to further their
cooperation with the Central American countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA URGED TO TAKE BACK ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China should cooperate with the
Republic of China in repatriating illegal mainland Chinese
immigrants into Taiwan, senior officials said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Cheng Tsai-kuei, a section chief with the Bureau of Immigration
under the Ministry of the Interior, and Liu Teh-hsun, a department
chief with the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), made the
appeal at a public hearing sponsored by Kuomintang Legislator Tsao
Erh-chung.</P>
      <P>Tsao, a lawmaker from the ROC-held frontline island of Matsu,
said as the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, the government
should accelerate repatriation of illegal mainland immigrants so
that they can spend the festival with their families in their
hometowns.</P>
      <P>The Mid-Autumn Festival, also known as the Moon Festival, falls
on the 15th day of the eighth moon on the lunar calendar or Sept. 12
this year. It is one of the three most important festivals in
Chinese society.</P>
      <P>Tsao said all the three detention centers set up by the ROC
government to accommodate seized mainland immigrants have reached
capacity.</P>
      <P>Take the Matsu detention center as an example. Tsao said anyone
who has ever visited there would find that it is not a
suitable place to shelter illegal mainland immigrants.</P>
      <P>"I hope our relevant government agencies can develop an
illegal mainland immigrants early warning system and craft out a
systematic repatriation formula," Tsao urged.</P>
      <P>Responding to Tsao's call, Cheng of the Immigration Bureau said
1,900-plus illegal mainland immigrants are still waiting for
repatriation, about 1,800 of whom are staying at the three special
detention centers. Except for the Matsu center, the other two are
located in Taiwan, one in the northern county of Hsinchu and the
other in the northeastern county of Ilan.</P>
      <P>There are still more than 100 illegal mainland immigrants
detained at other places due to the overcrowding in the three
special detention centers, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Cheng pointed out that the only obstacle to repatriating the
illegal mainland immigrants lies in Beijing's uncooperative
attitude. According to him, repatriation tends to come to a halt so
long as relations across the Taiwan Strait become strained.</P>
      <P>For instance, Cheng recalled that repatriation was halted for
several months after former President Lee Teng-hui declared
cross-strait ties as a special state-to-state relationship. Lee's
remarks enraged Beijing and sent cross-strait ties to a new low.</P>
      <P>And after several months of difficult talks, Cheng said Beijing
finally agreed to take back a batch of illegal mainland immigrants
on March 19 this year.</P>
      <P>However, Cheng said, Beijing again broke its promise after Chen
Shui-bian, a stalwart of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive
Party, won the ROC's March 18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>"The mainland Red Cross Society informed us that they couldn't
dispatch a ferry boat to take back the mainland immigrants as
originally scheduled because higher-level mainland officials had not
given a green light," Cheng recalled.</P>
      <P>At present, the Red Cross Society on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait are authorized to handle illegal mainland immigrants
repatriation. "Without mainland China's cooperation, we cannot
unilaterally repatriate any mainland immigrant before the Moon
Festival," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Liu Teh-hsun of the MAC, which
charts Taiwan's policy toward the mainland, said immigrants' security
is the biggest concern of the ROC government in repatriation.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, we cannot unilaterally send back illegal mainland
immigrants," Liu said, adding: "The mainland Red Cross Society must
first inform its Taiwan counterpart of the timing and place for
repatriation, then we can start necessary preparations."</P>
      <P>Noting that the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
has been actively contacting its mainland counterpart, the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS),
concerning the repatriation issue.</P>
      <P>"We hope the SEF-ARATS contact can achieve positive results as
soon as possible, so that we can repatriate mainland immigrants
before the Moon Festival," he said, adding that taking care of the
large number of illegal mainland immigrants has become a heavy
financial burden for the ROC government.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are semi-official intermediary bodies authorized
by their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in
the absence of official ties.</P>

      <P>Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso told
visiting Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou on Thursday that Panama would
welcome Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian "at any time,"
according to Taipei City government officials.</P>
      <P>The officials said on Friday that Moscoso denied US media
reports that Panama would not welcome Chen.</P>
      <P>Moscoso, inaugurated last September, visited the ROC in 1993 as
the leader of the country's opposition. She revisited Taipei this
July, when she met with Chen.</P>
      <P>Ma lauded Moscoso as a model for female politicians, saying that
women in Taiwan today are more active in politics than ever before.
He noted that the current ROC vice president is a woman, that female
members account for a quarter of the new Cabinet, and that women
account for one-third of the members of the Taipei City Council.</P>
      <P>Moscoso pointed out that her government is planning to enlarge
the Panama Canal and expressed the hope that the expansion plan will
help introduce more investment in her country, to which Ma promised
that he will encourage Taiwan businessmen to visit Panama to tap
investment opportunities.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Panama, Ma also called on Foreign Relations
Minister Jose Aleman.</P>
      <P>Ma, who departed from Taipei on Aug. 10 for a two-week tour of
the United States, Panama, Honduras and Guatemala, noted that his
visit to Central America coincided with that of Chen, who is
currently on a two-week, six-state visit to the Caribbean, Central
America and West Africa, saying that while they are "rivals" at home,
they are "partners" in promoting national interests when out of the
country.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that Panama City and Taipei can increase
bilateral exchanges, including exchanges of students and artists.</P>
      <P>Ma later toured schools for the children of overseas Chinese, and
received a warm welcome from the students and faculty.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  18  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian should take the
blame for the strong suspicion provoked in Taiwan by the news that he
has promised to extend US$4.6 million in a syndicated loan to the
Dominican Republic, a ranking Kuomintang official said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Jason Hu, head of the KMT's Cultural Affairs Department and
former minister of foreign affairs, said Chen himself is to blame for
the situation, because the president had vowed prior to his departure
on his current overseas trip that he would promise no economic aid or
loans to any of the countries on his itinerary.</P>
      <P>The president held a news conference in Santo Domingo on Thursday
with reporters from Taiwan to dismiss reports about US$4.6 million he
had promised to offer to the Dominican Republic a day earlier.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the money is only part of a syndicated loan of
US$28 million jointly promoted by the Republic of China's
International Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF) in cooperation
with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to help modernize the
country's parliament, and stressed that the money does not constitute
new economic assistance or a gift.</P>
      <P>Hu, who served as foreign minister in the former KMT
administration, said he could not recall any such cooperative venture
between the ICDF and IDB. If venture really exits, he went on, it
should be a normal and routine Foreign Ministry activity.</P>
      <P>In addition, the former foreign affairs minister also criticized
Chen's recent remarks that ROC diplomatic officials stationed
overseas should not use mainland China's diplomatic blockade against
Taiwan as a pretext for their setbacks in the international
community.</P>
      <P>According to Hu, the officials have the responsibility to report
the real situations in international society, and such remarks by
Chen are just not fair to the many ROC diplomatic personnel working
overseas.</P>

      <P>While expressing satisfaction about existing ROC-Nicaragua ties,
Chen and Aleman stressed that more efforts should be made to further
cement the friendship and cooperation between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Aleman extended appreciation to Chen for Taiwan's agricultural
assistance to his country, and agreed with Chen that bilateral
agricultural cooperation should be further expanded so as to help
improve the living standards of Nicaraguan farmers.</P>
      <P>Chen also praised Aleman for his dedication to promoting
Nicaragua's political, economic and social developments.</P>
      <P>Chen arrived in Managua from the Dominican Republic on Thursday
for a hectic two-day state visit, after attending the inauguration of
Dominican President Hipolito Mejia on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen then paid a visit to the Nicaraguan National Assembly, where
he was warmly received by a full house of Nicaraguan
parliamentarians, senior government officials and members of the
nation's diplomatic corps.</P>
      <P>Nicaraguan National Assembly Speaker Ivan Escobar Fornos
conferred the Order of Pedro Joaquin Chamorro on Chen in recognition
of his efforts to promote relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Chen then delivered a speech to the Nicaraguan parliamentarians,
in which he stressed the ROC's desire to play a more active role in
the international community.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Chen visited the ROC Embassy in Nicaragua,
where he was briefed by ROC Ambassador Tsai Teh-san on Nicaragua's
general situation and relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Chen and his entourage of 200 are scheduled to depart Nicaragua
and fly to Costa Rica on Saturday morning. His two day visit there
will be the third official stop on his two-continent trip.</P>
      <P>This is Chen's first overseas trip since taking office on May 20.
The Aug. 13-25 journey will also take him to the ROC's three West
African allies -- Gambia, Burkina Faso and Chad.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW TTV CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT ENDORSE NEWS AUTONOMY AGREEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 19 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Television Enterprise (TTV) Chairman
Lai Kuo-chou endorsed a news autonomy agreement at his inauguration
ceremony on Saturday following his controversial appointment, which
some critics have called "a politically charged decision."</P>
      <P>The News Autonomy and Fair Reporting Joint Manifesto began as a
signature drive that originated from TTV's news department. It covers
such issues as political endorsements and public interest, editorial
autonomy and fair reporting, working and managerial rights,
commercial discourse and news values, and the principle of
non-avoidance.</P>
      <P>TTV's board of directors appointed Hu Yuan-hui, president of the
Independence Evening News, to be the station's new president. Lai
likened Hu -- who is highly regarded by his peers -- as an
indispensable driver for the car that is TTV, while modestly claiming
that Lai himself is but the car attendant who punches tickets and
brings the tea and towels.</P>
      <P>Lai and Hu's endorsement of the agreement won immediate praise
and recognition from the acting presidential secretary-general, Chen
Che-nan, who witnessed the inauguration.</P>
      <P>Chen urged the new TTV leadership to give consideration not only
to on-the-job professionalism, but also to professional ethics like
the violinists in the movie Titanic who continued to belt out their
soothing melodies even in the face of a life-and-death situation.</P>
      <P>A statement issued by the Association of Taiwan Journalists on
Friday criticized President Chen Shui-bian's administration for
nominating Lai to the partially government-owned broadcast station as
a political favor, adding that the decision will seriously harm the
new government's image and set a poor example for the future.</P>
      <P>However, Lai countered that his media expertise and education won
him the position. Lai holds a doctorate in journalism from National
Chengchi University and is a senior opposition Kuomintang official as
well as the son-in-law of former ROC President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>The statement recalled that Chen's Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) had expressed its wholehearted support for the removal of
political and military interests from the mass media while it was
still an opposition party.</P>
      <P>This move abrogates the DPP's past ideals and violates Chen's
promises, the statement said, adding that the "backroom dealing" was
undoubtedly aimed at maintaining warm relations with the former
president.</P>

US EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE RADAR SYSTEM TRANSFER TO TAIWAN SOON</P>
      <P>Washington, Aug. 18 (CNA) The Clinton administration is expected
shortly to follow through on a promise made last year to transfer an
advanced long-range radar system to Taiwan, according to a report in
The Washington Times on Friday.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that the Pentagon is close to announcing final
approval of the sale, a move which is likely to upset Beijing.</P>
      <P>In the spring of 1999, the Clinton administration agreed in
principle to sell the radar system to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Since then, administration officials have been working on the
specifications of the system, called PAVE PAWS, to be exported. PAVE
is the name for a US Air Force radar program and PAWS stands for
phased array warning system.</P>
      <P>The Washington Times quoted knowledgeable government officials as
saying that the Pentagon recently worked out arrangements with Taiwan
for the transfer.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan had to meet a couple of conditions and they were things
they planned to do anyway," one official told the daily.</P>
      <P>The conditions include upgrading and networking existing radar
stations in order to help Taiwan better monitor aircraft or missile
activities on the Chinese mainland, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The daily did not mention the cost of the transfer or other
details, and the Clinton administration and Taiwan's representative
office in Washington would not comment on matters related to the
sale.</P>
      <P>Taiwan hopes the advanced radar system will extend warning time,
some say by a few minutes, in case of an air or missile attack from
the mainland.</P>
      <P>Some experts, however, say they believe short-range missiles
deployed just across the Taiwan Strait can be used to attack Taiwan
with little or no warning at all.</P>
      <P>According to a recent Ministry of National Defense estimate,
mainland China has deployed as many as 400 M-9 and M-11 short-range
missiles in areas opposite Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US MUST MAKE PLANS TO DEFEND INTERESTS IN ASIA: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug. 18 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States must acknowledge the
possibility of conflict with Communist China and make appropriate
plans to protect and preserve US national security interests and
those of its friends and allies in Asia, stressed an American expert
on East Asian affairs.</P>
      <P>Peter Brookes, the principal adviser for East Asian affairs with
the Republican staff of the House Committee on International
Relations, said in a July 26 lecture released Friday by The Heritage
Foundation that "Beijing must comprehend that the development and
ultimate deployment of these ballistic missile defensive systems are
in part due to China's increased offensive capability and
proliferation practices."</P>
      <P>In fact, he pointed out, Communist Chinese strategic
modernization has been underway for over 15 years and predates the
current missile defense debate in Asia. It is further asserted that
Beijing's strategic force upgrades and expansion will proceed
regardless of a US decision to deploy ballistic missile defenses.</P>
      <P>"The PRC's international arms control and diplomatic crusade
against missile defenses is most likely an effort to deflect
attention from the real issues: the direction, scope, and pace of
China's strategic nuclear weapons and ballistic missile program and
its desire to retain and broaden this asymmetric capability," said
Brookes.</P>
      <P>Contrary to the assertions of Beijing, he noted, "a regional
arms race will be based upon the deployment of Chinese offensive
missiles and the PRC's perceived regional global ambitions -- not the
fielding of American ballistic missile defenses. Chinese claims to
the contrary are a `red herring.'"</P>
      <P>Brookes concluded that changes in Chinese capability, doctrine,
and proliferation practices require an appropriate response from the
US to deter and, if necessary, defend against it. There will
certainly be consequences to the deployment of US missile defenses,
"but the cost of inaction to US national security in the face of the
evolving Chinese missile threat and proliferation to countries of
concern greatly outweighs the cost of action."</P>
      <P>The development and deployment of US missile defense systems will
provide greater freedom of action and a broader range of policy
options and potential responses to the US military. American
strategic forces, including missile defenses, must retain the
capability of deterring wars, precluding crises from evolving into
major conflicts, and of winning wars rapidly and decisively should it
become necessary, said the expert.</P>
      <P>As international security talks with Beijing resume after the
hiatus that followed the accidental bombing of the PRC embassy in
Belgrade last year by NATO forces, Brookes emphasized, it is time for
Washington to bring the arms race precipitated by Beijing to the
front and center of political-military discussions with the PRC in an
effort to stem misconceptions, preclude a dangerous arms race, and
ultimately avoid the deadly risk of a miscalculation and military
conflict.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING URGED TO STOP PERSECUTING FALUN GONG PRACTITIONERS</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A dozen participants at the International
Conference on Peace in Ottawa, Canada signed a petition on Friday
calling on the government of the People's Republic of China to stop
persecuting Falun Gong practitioners.</P>
      <P>The signatories, including research fellow Barry Myers and
physician Neil Arya, mainly from the United States and Canada, said
Falun Gong is a peaceful and non-violent form of personal belief and
practice with tens of millions of practitioners in China and
elsewhere.</P>
      <P>However, the petition pointed out, starting on July 22, 1999, the
Beijing regime has banned the movement and, according to credible
reports prepared by Amnesty International and other organizations,
resorted to arbitrary detention, torture, and inhumane treatment of
Falun Gong practitioners.</P>
      <P>As of Aug. 9 this year, at least 27 practitioners have died while
in police custody in China, the document noted.</P>
      <P>"We, participants of the International Conference on Peace, call
on the Government of the People's Republic of China to stop mass
arbitrary detentions, unfair trials, and other human rights
violations resulting from the crackdown on the Falun Gong," it said.</P>
      <P>They also called on all governments and international
organizations which treasure peace and justice to use every
appropriate public and private forum to urge the regime in Beijing to
release detained practitioners, to allow them to pursue their
beliefs, and to abide by the International Convention on Civil and
Political Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</P>
      <P>As members of the Falun Dafa Association of Canada prepare to
stage a nationwide Falun Dafa Week next week, many Canadian
government and civilian leaders, including Governor General Adrienne
Clarkson and several members of parliament, have expressed their
support for all Falun Gong practitioners.</P>
      <P>Extending her greetings to all those celebrating Falun Dafa Week,
Clarkson praised Falun Dafa followers for striving to perfect their
bodies and minds and learn compassion for others and for helping to
create a more open and tolerant society.</P>
      <P>Vivienne Poy, the first ethnic Chinese woman to become a senator
in Canada, also extended her support to Falun Dafa Week celebrants,
stressing that "it is important that organizations, such as yours,
have the freedom to practice their beliefs in Canadian society."</P>

      <P>As many as 40 Russian sailors jumped ship
in Halifax, and Canadian immigration officials were interviewing them
on Friday as some of them were asking to stay in Canada.</P>
      <P>Thirty-two Russian sailors on Thursday night walked away from the
trawler "Bizon" docked in Halifax, joining eight others who jumped
ship earlier. On Wednesday, about half a dozen men leapt off the
ship, landing in the harbor. Three were picked up by the coast guard,
while the rest were fished out by fellow crew members.</P>
      <P>With 40 having left the ship, only 20 of the crew, including the
captain, remained on board.</P>
      <P>A Canadian inspector with the International Transport Federation

been paid for six months. The crew also said that conditions on board
the 33-year-old ship were awful.</P>
      <P>Some Russians told immigration officials they fear reprisals from
the Russian mafia and that they'll be jailed or beaten if they go
home. A few men have told reporters that the captain has threatened
them, accusing them of not working.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOW DOSES OF BETA-BLOCKERS MAY BE BETTER FOR HEART PATIENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Aug.  18  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Low doses of beta-blockers may be more
effective in preventing further heart failure in patients who have
already suffered a heart attack than high doses of the drugs,
according to a Canadian study published in the prominent British
medical journal The Lancet.</P>
      <P>Doctors treating elderly heart patients should "start low and go
slow" in prescribing beta-blockers, said lead author Dr. Paula
Rochon, a researcher at Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care and the
Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences. Both facilities are part
of the University of Toronto.</P>
      <P>"One of the reasons our study is important is it would suggest
that if you are on a lower dose and you can't tolerate a higher dose,
then it's probably just fine to continue," Rochon said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The research team looked at the health records of more than
13,000 people in Ontario aged 66 and over who had suffered a heart
attack between 1993 and 1995. Of that group, 4,681 were prescribed
beta-blockers after their heart attack.</P>
      <P>Beta-blockers are a class of drug that slows the heart rate. They
are commonly prescribed in the treatment of angina, heart
arrhythmias, high blood pressure, and other heart conditions. The
drugs are highly effective, but not everyone tolerates them well at
standard doses.</P>
      <P>The team found that people on low doses of beta-blockers --
defined as lower than the standard tablet -- appeared to have been
better protected by the drug than those on high doses.</P>
      <P>Low-dose patients were 52 percent less likely to suffer heart
failure in the year after their heart attack than patients who
weren't given beta-blockers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of advisers to the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) have thrown weight behind a proposal
to open news exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, a senior official
said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chao Chieh-fu, director of the cultural and educational affairs
department of the MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward
mainland China, made the report after an MAC advisory board meeting.</P>
      <P>According to Chao, most of the MAC advisers voiced support for a
proposed opening of cross-strait news exchanges. Many of the
advisers also suggested that the Republic of China government
formulate a comprehensive package of regulations to pave the way for
mainland Chinese media to post journalists in Taiwan, he added.</P>

newsmen to live and work in Taiwan will enable them to experience
Taiwan's democratic and liberal lifestyle.</P>
      <P>"Although some advisers worry that resident mainland journalists
may get involved in intelligence gathering, most of them still adopt
a positive attitude toward the proposed opening as they hope that the
measure would help boost interaction between media professionals on
both sides and enable mainland reporters to gain a better
understanding of Taiwan's culture and lifestyle," Chao explained.</P>
      <P>Most of the advisers recommended that in the initial stage, the
government only allow mainland news organizations to send reporters
to Taiwan for news coverage without opening a permanent office.
After a certain period of time, the advisers said, the government
can decide whether to allow mainland media organizations to open
offices and post journalists in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During Saturday's meeting, Chao said, some advisers also cast
doubts over whether mainland news media would faithfully publish
articles written by their reporters stationed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At present, Chao said, cross-strait news exchanges are seriously
unbalanced, with mainland media carrying few Taiwan-related news
reports. Worse yet, Chao said, mainland media often carry false or
misleading reports about Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chao further said mainland reporters currently travel to Taiwan
mainly for attending seminars or for fact-finding tours. "Mainland
journalists have made 5,045 visits to Taiwan over the past years,
but only 280 of visiting mainland newsmen had engaged in news
coverage," he noted.</P>
      <P>According to Chao, mainland journalists presently can apply for
news coverage in Taiwan in accordance with the existing regulations
governing visits by mainland professionals.</P>
      <P>In fact, Chao said, the government has largely eased requirements
for mainland newsmen to apply for news coverage in Taiwan. "Mainland
journalists are no longer required to name a guarantor and they need
only to present applications one month in advance," Chao explained.</P>
      <P>Commenting on reports that mainland China's official mouthpiece,
Xinhua News Agency, plans to send reporters to cover news in Taiwan,
Chao said the MAC will screen relevant applications based on the
working plans presented by mainland newsmen.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's import and export trade with
the United States hit a new monthly record high in June, according to
US Department of Commerce (DOC) figures made public on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's import trade with the US in June amounted to

figure represented a US$390 million increase over May's total and
a jump of US$790 million over the previous June's figure.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's export trade with the US in June totaled US$3.52
billion, up by US$86 million over May's figure and up US$435
million from June 1999.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's annual export growth rate reached 14.1 percent and its
annual import growth rate rocketed up to 50.5 percent in the month of

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING SAID TO DRIVE WEDGE AMONG DPP MEMBERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China will take steps to drive
a wedge among Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
members, a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official predicted on
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Jan Jyh-horng, director of the MAC's research and planning
department, made the forecast after a meeting of the advisory
board to the Cabinet-level MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Jan said Beijing leadership's annual policy review meeting at
the summer resort of Beidaihe is scheduled to end this week. "After
the Beidaihe meeting, we think that Beijing will begin arrangements
for meeting with DPP moderates in order to sow seeds of discord among
DPP members," he noted.</P>
      <P>Beijing has until recently ruled out the possibility of
engagement with the pro-independence DPP. However, Jan said, Beijing
has decided to change its strategy after DPP's Chen Shui-bian won
the Republic of China's March 18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>In the past few month, Jan said, Beijing has invited some
moderate DPP members to attend seminars on the mainland. In the
meantime, Jan said, Beijing has continued harsh criticism of DPP
radicals' pro-independence stance. Jan said Beijing is expected to
continue this double-edged tactic after the Beidaihe meeting.</P>
      <P>In addition, Jan said, Beijing may adopt a similar
strategy in dealing with ROC lawmakers based on their moderate or
radical attitudes toward the DPP-led government's cross-strait
policy.</P>
      <P>In another news development, Finance Minister Shea Jia-dong said
on Saturday that the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has drafted a package
of regulations governing applications by local banks to set up
liaison or representative offices on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Shea said the ministry will invite the Central Bank of China and
the MAC to discuss key points of the regulations in the coming week.
If the two agencies do not oppose the draft bill, Shea said, the
Finance Ministry will refer it to the Cabinet which will then pass
the bill to the MAC for further deliberation.</P>
      <P>Shea said the government basically supports the opening measure.
"We have taken into account issues related to capital outflow and
financial inspection in formulating regulations governing the
establishment of bank representative offices on the mainland," the
minister explained.</P>
      <P>The ROC government unveiled a set of regulations governing
business exchanges between insurance companies on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait early this year.</P>
      <P>In line with the regulations, the MOF has approved applications
by several Taiwan life and property insurance companies to open
liaison offices on the mainland.</P>
      <P>However, none of them have so far received a green light from
mainland authorities to open a representative office on the other
side of the strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEARCHING PARLIAMENT BUILDING A CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE: JUSTICE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 19 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan on Saturday
said that the issue of whether searching the legislative building
requires the speaker's prior approval cannot be settled by a
legislative consensus alone but requires constitutional debate.</P>
      <P>Following the search of opposition Kuomintang lawmaker Liao
Hwu-peng's research room by prosecutors on Wednesday, ruling and
opposition legislative caucuses on Thursday concluded that the
legislative building should remain an autonomous area deserving
respect.</P>
      <P>The controversial incident marked the first time that the
nation's judicial personnel entered the legislative building to
conduct a search.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng also added that any such
search should be subject to his approval.</P>
      <P>Chen, who garnered a public approval rating of 71 percent in a
recent poll for his tough stance in cracking down on corruption,
pointed out that the lawmakers' conclusions cannot stand in for
existing laws and regulations, but can only be used as a consensus
reference for future amendments.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the legislators already possess special privileges
under Articles 73 and 74 of the Republic of China Constitution and
that if they want to add another privilege to protect themselves from
searches, then it is not simply a matter of amending the criminal
laws but is in fact a constitutional issue.</P>
      <P>Article 73 of the ROC Constitution currently exempts legislators
from being liable for any opinions expressed or votes cast in the
Legislative Yuan, while Article 74 protects lawmakers from being
arrested or detained without the permission of the Legislative Yuan,
except in the case of "flagrante delicto," a legal term meaning being
caught red-handed.</P>
      <P>Shen Fu-hsiung, a ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
legislator, said on Saturday that the Legislative Yuan should reform
itself first before talking about parliamentary dignity and that if
his colleagues truly want to improve their collective image, then he
would suggest abandoning the umbrella protection given to them by
Article 74 until the next term of lawmakers are elected.</P>
      <P>However, DPP legislator Lee Ching-hsiung, a former judge, said
that although he believes Liao would probably be the first to take up
Shen's suggestion, renouncing the privilege does not mean the
constitutional law will no longer be in effect.</P>
      <P>Lee also gave his "utmost condemnation" to the legislators who
joined in the Thursday conclusion that searching the legislative
building requires the speaker's approval.</P>
      <P>Lee was supporting DPP legislator Tsai Ming-hsien's statement at
a Saturday press conference that the Wednesday search did not go
against the Constitution or existing laws because Articles 73 and 74
are not in effect when the legislature is not in session, as is the
case now, and neither protects lawmakers from being searched.</P>
      <P>The controversy first came about when Tainan prosecutors searched
Liao's research room in the Legislative Yuan and later his apartment
in the Ta-an complex, a "dormitory" building occupied exclusively by
legislators.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors initially reported that the search turned up
10,000 fake stock certificates in Chi Mei Electronics, an unlisted
Tainan-based company, but later retracted their statement, saying
that no Chi Mei stocks were discovered.</P>
      <P>Lin Chieh-teh of the Public Prosecutor's Office of Taiwan's High
Court told the media on Wednesday that the search was conducted
because Chi Mei Corp. had told the Tainan District Prosecutor's
Office that "some people" were suspected of having fabricated Chi Mei
share certificates.</P>
      <P>Upon learning of the search, Liao rushed back to Taipei from his
constituency in Yunlin County on Wednesday night. He told the media
that the shares taken away by the prosecutors from his apartment were
those of Chungtai Canned Manufacturing Co., of which he is board
chairman. He stressed that he owns no Chi Mei shares.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VEEP AGAIN PUSHES FOR ASIAN ALLIANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette Lu
on Saturday renewed her appeal for Asian leaders to jointly push for
the formation of an Asian alliance patterned after the 15-member
European Union (EU).</P>
      <P>Lu made repeatedly her call during a meeting with James Gerard
Collins, deputy speaker of the European Parliament, the
EU's legislative arm.</P>
      <P>Lu said she looks forward to seeing Asian leaders deal with the
continent's common future development with vision and
broad-mindedness.</P>
      <P>"All Asian leaders should learn from their European counterparts
in promoting Europe's gradual integration after World War II through
setting up the EU," Lu said.</P>
      <P>For his part, Collins said European countries have
encountered many difficulties and obstacles on their way toward
integration.</P>
      <P>"Thanks to generous support from major EU members in the process,
the EU has so far managed to develop a viable mechanism for
cooperation among all its members for the common
well-being," Collins said, adding that it takes time to accomplish
such a task.</P>
      <P>Noting that mutual respect and forward-looking strategy are
pivotal to the EU's success, Collins said formation of an EU-style
Asian alliance may need a much longer period of time because of
wider differences among Asian countries than European states.</P>
      <P>Touching on relations across the Taiwan Strait, Collins said all
EU members hope to see Taiwan and mainland China co-exist peacefully
for mutual benefits.</P>
      <P>In response, Lu said the ROC has no intention to provoke
mainland China. "We are more than willing to promote constructive
interaction with the mainland, and on the international front, we
only want a more reasonable treatment to safeguard our national
dignity," she added.</P>
      <P>Collins, also an Irish senator, further said he hopes the
ROC government can encourage Taiwan companies to invest in Ireland
and use his country as a springboard to tap the vast EU market.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Lu hosted a tea party at the Presidential
Office in honor of women representatives from the central Taiwan
county of Changhua.</P>
      <P>Lu, a political dissident-turned-politician and human rights
activist, said she hopes to see an end to gender discrimination and
human rights oppression before the end of the 20th century.</P>
      <P>In the face of the dawn of the 21st century, Lu said all fellow
countrymen should work together to make Taiwan a society
characterized by peace, justice and fairness.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  19 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Winston Wang, chairman of Hung Jen Group,
on Saturday denied media reports that he is investing in eight-inch
wafer plants in mainland China, adding that Hung Jen Group is only
"assessing" the viability of such a venture.</P>
      <P>Wang -- the son of local tycoon Wang Yung-ching, chairman of
Formosa Plastics Group -- added that the companies under his flag
will not go against the government's "no haste, be patient" mainland
investment policy, which forbids high-tech investments in mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Local media reports on Saturday said that Wang and Jiang Mianheng
-- the son of mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin -- are planning
to form a NT$20 billion (US$ 643.5 million) joint venture to build
eight-inch wafer plants in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long,
Wang held a press conference to clarify his company's position.</P>
      <P>Wang said that Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi had
clearly announced recently that it is still not appropriate to allow
infrastructure and high-tech industries such as eight-inch and
12-inch wafer producers to invest in mainland China for national
security reasons.</P>
      <P>He added that Hung Jen Group has been assessing the issue for
over a year and that it is still assessing the investment
possibilities.</P>
      <P>Wang went on to say that if the government relaxes its
regulations in the future, he will then fund the project with joint
investment from American and Japanese firms, and the capital will
come from overseas, not from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to local news reports in May, technology for Wang and
Jiang's joint venture to build three eight-inch and three 12-inch
wafer plants will be provided by Japan's Oki Electric Industry Co.</P>
      <P>Wang also has extensive investments in petrochemical production

the county's future development should be based on tourism.</P>
      <P>Tang added that he will instruct related government agencies to
provide assistance to Penghu's various proposed programs following

      <P>In his first inspection tour of the islands since taking up his

face a crunch as the Cabinet begins to implement its plans to boost
Taiwan's traditional and high-tech industries, but added that he will
not abandon Penghu.</P>
      <P>Tang went on to say that he believes county work should focus on
"self-help" in order to make the most out of limited financial
resources.</P>
      <P>He said that the new government has been at the helm for only
three months, so many things are still not yet on track, but added

    <DATELINE>San  Jose, Costa Rica, Aug. 18 (CNA)
(By Y. Y. Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Costa Rican President Miguel
Angel Rodriguez on Friday threw support behind the Republic of
China's bids to join the United Nations and its affiliates as well
as the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Rodriguez offered the commitment during talks with visiting ROC
President Chen Shui-bian, who arrived in Costa Rica earlier in the
day after a hectic visit to neighboring Nicaragua.</P>
      <P>The Costa Rican leader was quoted by ROC Foreign Minister
Tien Hung-mao as having told Chen that he thinks the acceptance of
Taiwan into the WTO is a necessity because of the island's role in
the new economy and international commerce.</P>
      <P>Costa Rica has not actively spoken for the ROC's UN bid at
relevant UN meetings in recent years, nor has it joined with other
ROC allies in signing a proposal asking the UN to consider the ROC's
representation in the world body.</P>
      <P>Tien said President Chen took advantage of his meeting with
Rodriguez to call for more active Costa Rican support for the ROC's
bid to join major international organizations, including the UN, the
WTO and the UN-affiliated World Health Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>Tien, who was also present at the two top leaders' meeting, said
Rodriguez assured President Chen of his country's full support for
the ROC in political and diplomatic domains.</P>
      <P>Rodriguez was quoted as having assured Chen that Costa Rica
will not waver its diplomatic ties with the ROC even though
it may not be able to fully satisfy the ROC's desire in
trade and economic affairs. Costa Rica has increased commercial
exchanges with mainland China in recent years.</P>
      <P>According to Tien, Rodriguez has also told Chen that as the two
countries share same ideals of upholding democratic values and human
rights, ROC-Costa Rican relations will become even stronger and
closer in the future.</P>
      <P>Rodriguez also briefed Chen on current bilateral cooperative
projects and progress in those programs. For his part, Chen assured
Rodriguez that his administration will faithfully fulfill its
obligations under all existing cooperative agreements.</P>
      <P>Tien said he believes that Costa Rica will take more active
steps in support of the ROC's UN bid this year following the summit
meeting between the top leaders of the two countries.</P>
      <P>Shortly after his arrival in San Jose, Rodriguez presided over a
grand welcoming ceremony for Chen at the Costa Rican Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>All senior Costa Rican officials, some 70 young students,
100-plus overseas Chinese representatives and 70 Chinese and foreign
journalists were present at the ceremony to greet the visiting ROC
head of state.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the occasion, Rodriguez said Chen's visit has
ushered in a new era in ROC-Costa Rican relations and will boost
their quest for democracy, freedom, peace, prosperity and human
rights.</P>
      <P>Rodriguez lauded Chen as one of Asia's "Third Wave" democratic
leaders. He then decorated Chen with the Order of Juan Morales
Fernandez in recognition of his contribution to promoting bilateral
ties. The Grand Cross-class golden medal is the highest honor offered
by the Costa Rican government to a foreign leader.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chen expressed his gratitude for the hospitality
extended to him by the Costa Rican government and people. He also
thanked Costa Rica for its support for the ROC's cause in the
international community over past years.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, the two presidents signed a joint communique
reaffirming their commitment to forging a mechanism for strategic
cooperation in the future.</P>
      <P>The two leaders pledged to further reinforce bilateral
cooperation in trade, investment and economic development following
the ROC's entry to the WTO in the near future.</P>
      <P>In the communique, Rodriguez also recognized Chen's efforts
to push for resumption of dialogue with mainland China since he
took office on May 20. Rodriquez also expressed gratitude for the
ROC assistance and aid over past years.</P>
      <P>Costa Rica is the third leg of Chen's current six-state "journey
of friendship" aimed at cementing the ROC's diplomatic ties with its
allies. During his stay, he will also attend a meeting of ROC
mission chiefs in Latin America to be held on Saturday. The meeting
will be chaired by Foreign Minister Tien.</P>
      <P>Chen already visited the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua. He
will also visit the ROC's three West African allies -- the Gambia,
Burkina Faso and Chad -- before concluding his first
post-inauguration overseas trip on Aug. 25.</P>

Chen and Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President
Chen Shui-bian said on Saturday that joining the United Nations and
more international organizations is Taiwan's rights and obligation
and that there should be no so-called "diplomatic truce."</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a press conference that he jointly
presided over with Costa Rica President Miguel Angel Rodriguez at the
end of Chen's brief visit to the Central American country.</P>
      <P>"Unless the ROC disappears from the earth, we should continue our
drive to reach out so as to increase our international presence,"
Chen said.</P>
      <P>"We should not be afraid of blockade by mainland China as far as
our foreign relations are concerned, and that the most serious
problem for us would be the disunity among our people," Chen said.</P>
      <P>"It's a shame to those who oppose our 'reach out' drive if they
come to understand Costa Rica's firm support of our bids for
membership in the United States and other international
organizations," the President said.</P>
      <P>President Rodriguez during the press conference, called for
the "immediate" admission of the ROC into the UN and other
international organizations.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that there will be no change in Costa Rica's
policy toward the ROC and that his country is willing to join with
Taiwan's other allies in issuing a joint statement in support of
Taiwan's UN bid."</P>
      <P>Costa Rica has not actively spoken for the ROC's UN bid at
relevant UN meetings in recent years, nor has it joined with other
ROC allies in signing proposals asking the UN to consider the ROC's
representation in the world body.</P>
      <P>The Costa Rica head of state spoke highly of his ROC counterpart,
saying Chen is "a new-generation leader of Asia."</P>
      <P>He said that he believes Chen's two-day visit will help promote
diplomatic, trade and tourist exchanges between the two countries
and he called for more investments in Costa Rica from Taiwan's
business sector.</P>
      <P>Chen during the press conference praised Costa Rica's
achievements in various fields, describing it as "the Switzerland of
America and "reach beach."</P>
      <P>The ROC President especially cited the establishment of a human
rights library and the Pan-American Court in Costa Rica as proof of
Costa Rica's full respect for human rights.</P>
      <P>He also said that Costa Rica has special respect for women's
rights, as has been evidenced by the facts that the two vice
presidents of the Central American country, its parliament speaker
and one fourth of its parliament members are women.
 Chen also took the opportunity to stress the importance of
national stability.</P>
      <P>He said that the exports of Costa Rica and Nicaragua reached
about US$800 million, respectively, 20 years ago. But while Costa Rica
has increased its export volume to an annual US$7 billion, Nicaragua
is running on the other way with a negative export growth, due to its
10-year long civil war.
 Chen said his government will honor all the promises made by the
former Kuomintang administration of financial and technical
assistance to foreign countries as a nation's policy must be
constant and stable, and cannot be overturned because of power
transition.</P>
      <P>He said that it's time now for Taiwan, which in the past had
received assitance from other countries, to shoulder its
responsibility by offering assistance to the less developed countries
in the world.</P>
      <P>Chen added that the ROC's annual foreign aids totaled US$300
million in value, accounting for just about 0.13 percent of its gross
national product (GNP), which is far less than the developed
countries' 0.24 percent, or the criteria of 0.7 percent GNP as required
by the UN.</P>
      <P>Chen, accompanied by Foreign Affairs Minister Tien Hung-mao
arrived in Costa Rica at the head of his 200-member delegation for a
two-day state visit.</P>
      <P>He met Rodriguez for a wide range of talks shortly after his
arrival during which the Costa Rican President threw his support
behind the ROC bids to join the UN and its affiliates such as the
World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Later in the day, the two presidents signed a joint communique

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER GETS HIGHEST APPROVAL RATING: KMT POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's approval rating
is the third highest of high-level officials in the new
administration, next to the approval ratings of Premier Tang Fei and
Justice Minister Chen Ting-nan, according to the results of a poll
conducted by the opposition Kuomintang announced on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The KMT's Policy Coordination Committee conducted the poll on the
performance of the new government in the first quarter by calling
1,096 Taiwan citizens over 20 years of age between Aug. 15 and 16.
The survey had a margin of error of 3 percent.</P>
      <P>The president's approval rating was 55.11 percent, down from
about 80 percent in his first month and 60 percent in the second
month of Chen's administration, the poll showed.</P>
      <P>Among high-level officials of the administration, Premier Tang
Fei received the highest approval rating, at 63.87 percent. He was
followed by Justice Minister Chen Ting-nan at 60.40 percent, and the
president at 55.11 percent.</P>
      <P>The KMT attributed the public's higher approval of Tang than that
of Chen to its sympathy for the plight of the premier, who is a KMT
member but serves in the ruling government of the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Women serving in the Cabinet also received positive ratings, with
three female Cabinet-level officials receiving the fourth, fifth and
sixth highest approval ratings. Mainland Affairs Council Chair Tsai
Ing-wen, Minister of Transportation and Communications Yeh Chu-lan
and Chair of Council of Labor Affairs Chen Chu took those spots.</P>
      <P>Among the three lowest-ranked members of the new Cabinet was Chen
Hsi-huang, chair of the Council of Agriculture (COA), who received
an approval rating of just 18.34 percent. He was followed by Finance
Minister Shea Jia-dong at 21.62 percent, and Economic Affairs
Minister Lin Hsin-yi at 21.99 percent.</P>
      <P>Turning to the new administration's policies, the public is most
satisfied with the new government's policy on cross-strait relations,
which received an approval rating of 49.91 percent.</P>
      <P>But the public is most dissatisfied with policies regarding
social order and ecological and environmental protection, with
disapproval ratings of 52.28 percent and 51.1 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Chen was inaugurated in May, ending five decades of the KMT's
grip on political power in Taiwan.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a sign that Taiwan people are always
willing to help others, statistics recently released by the
government show that the public donated a total of NT$43 billion
(US$1.38 billion) between May 1998 and April 1999.</P>
      <P>The Directorate General of the Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS), in releasing the statistics, also said that half of the
donations went to religious groups.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials said that 5.93 million people donated money
between May 1998 and April 1999, giving an average of NT$8,000 per
donator.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that those who have higher academic
backgrounds tend to donate more money, because they also earn higher
salaries.</P>
      <P>The survey showed that those who have received college educations
or higher donated NT$11,736 (US$379) a year, or twice that of people
who received less than a college education.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that except for a few cases where donation
went to individual people or households, most of the donations went
to non-profit organizations, with religious groups getting the lion's
share at 49.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Social service and charity groups were next, at 37.3 percent.
Academic, cultural, medical and political groups only received a
combined 13.6 percent of the donations.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials said that after the disastrous earthquake that
wreaked havoc in central Taiwan on Sept. 21, 1999, the number of
people who donated money nearly doubled, with donations reaching a
record high of NT$69.3 billion (US$2.23 billion).</P>
      <P>The officials said that the large sum of donations shows that
local people have kept the traditional virtues of generosity and

    <HEADLINE>VP SUGGESTS REVISION OF CONSTITUTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu suggested on
Sunday that the government revise the Constitution to adapt it to
Taiwan's current political reality.</P>
      <P>In a speech to the Bar Association of the Republic of China, Lu
called the Constitution an out-of-date document concocted more than
five decades ago with an eye on applying it to all of mainland China
instead of just Taiwan. She went on to blame it for the current
political chaos in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The anachronism of governing a modern state with an obsolete
constitution has become obvious after President Chen Shui-bian was
swept to power on the ticket of Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),
leaving the legislature still controlled by the opposition
Kuomintang, said the dissident-turned vice president.</P>
      <P>Because Chen's DPP controls no more than one third of the seats
in the legislature, Lu said, the president was forced to tap
Kuomintang member Tang Fei as his premier to lead a Cabinet made up
largely of Chen's followers.</P>
      <P>But Chen's attempt to organize an non-partisan administration has
only complicated the problem by obliterating the party's political
liability for policy, rather than winning support from parties across
the political spectrum.</P>
      <P>In order to sort out the current difficulties, Lu strongly
suggested an overhaul of the Constitution to review the division of
powers among five branches, the cornerstone of the current
Constitution.</P>

      <P>In response to a 25,000-word critique of
Taiwan's government by the Cheng Society, President Chen Shui-bian
has instructed all government officials to redouble their efforts so
as to give good results to the people as soon as possible, according
to a spokesman of the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that President Chen attaches a great deal of
importance to the critique made by the Cheng Society, which is made
up academics. The official added that Chen has instructed him to fax
him the full text of the critique, as he is currently on an overseas

Burkina Faso and Chad.</P>
      <P>President Chen said that members of the new government should use
their adapting period as newcomers to hone their skills.</P>
      <P>Chen urged all his government officials to listen more to the
voice of the land and people, despite the fact that they may have
different opinions. The mission of reform cannot be accomplished only
by the government, but must be undertaken by both the people and the

formulating any policy.</P>
      <P>Tang described the Cheng Society's critique as "very
significant."</P>

solve Taiwan's problem, suggesting that it be replaced by a clear

    <HEADLINE>HUMANITARIAN DIPLOMACY IS PRIORITY OF NEW GOV'T FOREIGN POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Foreign Affairs Minister David Lee
said here on Sunday that "humanitarian diplomacy" will be the utmost
priority of the new administration's foreign policy.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remark while speaking about the new government's
foreign policy at a seminar sponsored by the Po-chung Cultural and
Educational Foundation held at Dr. Sun Yet-sen Memorial Hall in
Taipei on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lee said that President Chen Shui-bian's statement that Beijing's
pressure was not an excuse for failing to engage in foreign affairs
was not meant to criticize Taiwan's diplomats, but rather to
encourage them. Chen made the statement while on an official visit in
the Dominican Republic.</P>
      <P>Under the current cross strait situation, diplomats should not be
pessimistic, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He said that the new government will emphasize humanitarian
diplomacy because of foreign assistance in the wake of the killer
earthquake that jolted central Taiwan on Sept. 21, 1999, claiming
more than 2,400 lives and causing massive property damage. Lee noted
that a Japanese rescue team reached Taiwan within 24 hours after the
temblor, and teams from the United States, Mexico and others
countries arrived later.</P>
      <P>The priority in foreign affairs will be to emphasize human rights
and democracy, he said, adding that Taiwan has developed into a truly
democratic country after the transition of power on May 20, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Another priority will be to use economic power to support
diplomacy, he said, adding that the government will continue to play
a safeguarding role to help local people expand their investments
abroad.</P>
      <P>The new government will also implement a policy of providing
humanitarian assistance to non-government organizations, Lee said,
citing the warm welcome that the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi
Foundation received when a medical assistance team it organized
arrived in Macedonia, which recently established ties with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Asked about the of future cross-strait relations, Lee said that
at this moment, nobody can answer the question. As things stand now,
it is impossible to come up with a diplomatic truce between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait, he said. He also added that Taiwan should
step up its non-official relations with the United States, Japan and
the European Union.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 20 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Taiwan electronics manufacturers
left for mainland China for a nine-day fact-finding tour on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The 80-odd members of the delegation of the Taiwan Electrical and
Electronic Manufacturers Association (TEEMA) will tour Beijing,
Shanghai and Ningbo in Zhejian Province, Central China, to research
the investment environment in the mainland, said Richard Wu, TEEMA
president and leader of the delegation.</P>
      <P>They will also call on Chen Yunlin, director of the Central
Office for Taiwan Affairs under the State Council, as well as other
Beijing officials to explore the possibility of setting up a special
tribunal to settle trade disputes involving Taiwan businessmen.</P>
      <P>Owing to differences in legal systems and regulations between
Taiwan and mainland China, Taiwan businessmen are often treated
unfairly by ordinary courts in disputes with their mainland Chinese
partners, said Wu, who added that this issue needed to be addressed
by a special tribunal.</P>
      <P>In addition to TEEMA members, the delegation comprises officials
from the Mainland Affairs Council, Council for Economic Planning and
Development, and Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>TEEMA also released on Sunday a survey of the four biggest
complaints of Taiwan businessmen operating in mainland China.</P>
      <P>The biggest problem facing most Taiwan businessmen is marketing
and production, including overlaps in investment, cutthroat
competition and overcapacity, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>The second most common problem is the difficulty in obtaining
credit in mainland China and the widespread overdue payments by their
mainland Chinese trade partners, TEEMA said.</P>
      <P>Based on the survey, TEEMA warned Taiwan businessmen interested
in doing business with mainland Chinese firms to prepare themselves
for overdue payments.</P>
      <P>The third problem is the ambiguity in regulations, which leaves
regulators too leery of applying laws, said the survey takers, adding
that would-be Taiwan investors should be careful to establish
themselves in areas where the implementation of rules is more
thorough.</P>
      <P>Social security and order are the last but not the least of
Taiwan businessmen's concerns. Potential investors should shy away
from areas with high unemployment and crime rates, TEEMA advised.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that the Yangtze River Delta is the most
favored area by Taiwan investors because of its relatively good
infrastructure and lack of risk, with Soochow and other six cities
across the delta especially favored.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjing, the mainland's three
most densely-populated special municipalities, were rated as the
second best areas for investment.</P>

      <P>Liu said that Lee hopes to visit Japan by the end of October to
attend the last meeting of Asian Outlook, which he co-founded in
1989, adding that whether the Japanese government will grant a visa
for the visit is still unclear.</P>
      <P>Mainland China opposes a visit to Japan by the former ROC
president in any form or name despite the fact that Lee has already
stepped down as Taiwan's head of state and that many groups in Japan
have actively promoted such a visit.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks on the sidelines of an international
symposium on East Asia held Monday.</P>
      <P>Liu said that the former president wants to gain first-hand
information about Japan by visiting the country, adding that Lee
hopes to attend the Asian Outlook meeting and to pay a visit to his
alma mater Kyoto Imperial University. Liu also noted that many
Japanese universities have invited Lee to visit and deliver a speech.</P>
      <P>Lee also has plans to visit the Czech Republic before the end of
year, said Liu, adding that the former head of state is interested in
visiting Europe, America, and Japan.</P>
      <P>Asian Outlook held its first meeting in 1989, and meetings have
since been held in Taiwan and Japan on alternate years. This year's
meeting will be the 12th and last meeting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GAMBIA VOWS STRONG SUPPORT FOR ROC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Banjul,  Gambia,  Aug.  20  (CNA)
(By Y.Y. Chen and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Gambian President Yahya A.J.J.
Jammeh stressed on Sunday that Gambia's support for the Republic of
China will not waver despite Beijing's intimidation and that his
nation will continue to speak in support of the ROC at the United
Nations General Assembly.</P>
      <P>Jammeh said the ROC was the first republic to be established in
Asia, but unfortunately it has been excluded from the UN since 1971
simply because of pressure from mainland China.</P>
      <P>In his summit meeting with Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian, who arrived in the Gambian capital Sunday afternoon on the
first leg of his three-nation African tour, Jammeh said that if East
Timor can hold a plebiscite on the issue of independence from
Indonesia, so can Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen, the first ROC president and the first Asian head of state
to visit the West African nation, said President Jammeh is the
youngest head of state in Africa and the first president of any
nation in the world to speak at the UN General Assembly in support of
Taiwan. He said he hopes that Gambia will continue to voice its full
support for Taiwan at the UN.</P>
      <P>Although Chen did not respond directly to Jammeh's statement
regarding Taiwan's right to hold a referendum to decide its fate, he
stressed that Gambia, despite its small size, always has a loud voice
in the international community as it stands firmly on the side of
freedom, democracy, human rights, and justice.</P>
      <P>Chen said that in order to help achieve the goals of President
Jammeh's ambitious 2020 Prospects Project to economically escalate
Gambia into the ranks of the middle power nations, the Republic of
China is willing to continue to provide its African ally with
infrastructure development assistance, including the areas of
electricity, public health, highways, and agricultural technology.</P>
      <P>For his part, Jammeh told Chen that he has for long aimed at
building his nation into a window on Taiwan in West Africa, adding
that toward that goal, he has actively pushed for effective
development in the areas of education, public health, and
manufacturing.</P>
      <P>The Chen-Jammeh summit meeting was followed by a state banquet
that was hosted by Jammeh himself. During the banquet, Chen said he
has been overwhelmingly moved by the warm welcome he has received
since stepping down onto Gambian soil. More than 10,000 Gambian
citizens turned out to welcome Chen and his 200-member entourage,
with the welcoming line extending for miles from the airport.</P>
      <P>Jammeh told Chen that he plans to visit Taiwan in November of
this year, representing his third official trip to the island.</P>
      <P>Chen is expected on Monday to visit the model vegetable farms
near Banjul that were the brainchild of the ROC agricultural mission
stationed in Gambia. The farms have not only gained a reputation as
the model of agricultural development in Gambia, they have also
greatly helped improve the Gambian people's livelihood.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to sign a joint communique with Jammeh on
Monday to further cement bilateral ties before proceeding to Burkina
Faso and Chad, the two other stops on the president's landmark tour
of Africa.</P>
      <P>Before arriving in The Gambia, Chen and his delegation had
visited Taiwan's Latin American allies of the Dominican Republic,
Nicaragua, and Costa Rica.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S CLOUD GATE SHINES AT OLYMPIC ARTS FESTIVAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  21  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The reputation of Taiwan's Cloud Gate
Dance Theater Company seems to have been confirmed by the fact that
it was invited to perform at the Olympic Arts Festival in Sydney.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA, Jon-Claire Lee, representative of
the Cloud Gate in Australia, said that organizers considered the
possible political repercussions of choosing a dance troupe from
Taiwan before making their final decision.</P>
      <P>The organizers sent a letter to the Chinese embassy in Canberra,
telling them that the Cloud Gate would be invited to perform and, to
their delight, the answer from mainland China was positive, Lee said.</P>
      <P>"I was thrilled with the successful result, though it took me
about two and a half years to arrange and negotiate for the Cloud
Gate Theater to be part of the Olympic Arts Festival, which I regard
as a very significant occasion due to its magnitude and the massive
publicity given to participants," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Craig Hassell, general manager of the arts festival, told the CNA
that the organizers informed the Chinese embassy as a gesture of
"courtesy."</P>
      <P>In a speech at the opening night of the Cloud Gate performance on
Saturday, Hassell praised the superb performance put on by the Cloud
Gate on opening night on Saturday, saying the company is one of the
best contemporary dance troupes in the world.</P>
      <P>He and other organizers said they were very satisfied with their
choice of having the Cloud Gate Theater take part in the Olympic Arts
Festival.</P>

level of a strong typhoon at 2:00 p.m. on Monday, the Central Weather

located about 740 kilometers southeast of Taiwan and was moving
steadily in a north north-westerly direction at a speed of 22
kilometers per hour at around 3:00 p.m.</P>
      <P>Packing winds of 51 meters per second at its center, and with a

    <HEADLINE>NATIONAL UNIFICATION GUIDELINES NEED TO BE OVERHAULED: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  21  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Guidelines for National Unification
(GNU) should be overhauled to meet actual needs, as the environments
in both Taiwan and mainland China have changed, a ranking official
from the Presidential Office said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Che-nan, acting secretary-general to the President, said
there is room for debate on whether the contents of the GNU are still
appropriate, as the guidelines were drafted more than eight years
ago, and things have changed drastically since that time.</P>
      <P>In what manner the GNU should be amended or overhauled should be
decided by all members of the National Unification Council, which
will meet for a new round of talks in the near future, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>The guidelines outline the principles and positive steps that
both sides of the Taiwan Strait can take to expedite China's
unification. According to this gradual, sequential plan, unification
is imperative not only for the sake of territorial unity, but also
for the political freedom and equitable distribution of wealth for
all Chinese.</P>
      <P>The guidelines state that China's unification should be achieved
in three phases: a short-term period of exchanges and reciprocity, a
mid-term phase of mutual trust and cooperation, and a long-term
period of consultations followed by unification.</P>
      <P>This phased approach was planned with the full realization that
the unification of China will be a long and arduous process, the GNU
framers wrote.</P>
      <P>China's unification will not be achieved overnight, because the
two sides have divergent social, political and economic systems, not
to mention vast differences in lifestyles. However, there is no fixed
time frame for each stage in the guidelines, which only say that the
speed of progress depends on the pace with which the mainland
authorities respond.</P>
      <P>In response to Chen's remarks that the guidelines need to be
overhauled after weathering eight or nine years of change in the
cross-strait situation, officials from the opposition New Party said
the unification timetable and how the unification should be conducted
can be talked about, but the ultimate goal of unification should
never be altered.</P>
      <P>Lai Shih-pao, whip of the New Party Legislative Yuan caucus, said
the national unification guidelines can be amended, but only in
regards to the timetable and methodology for unification, as some
flexibility is necessary to meet the needs of the country. However,
he stressed, the ultimate goal of the guidelines -- unification -- is
the central guiding idea which should not be changed under any
circumstances.</P>
      <P>Hao Lung-ping, convenor of the New Party's National Election and
Development Committee, said the banner of unification is an umbrella
of protection for President Chen Shui-bian as far as cross-strait
relations are concerned.</P>
      <P>As a national leader who has singled out avoiding war as his
major duty and obligation, Chen understands that waving the
unification banner is the one and only way for him to maintain peace
and stability across the Taiwan Strait, Hao said.</P>
      <P>He added that the contents of the GNU may not be appropriate now,
and need to be revised if that is true, but he stressed that the goal
of unification should never be changed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC WANTS TO LIVE IN PEACE WITH MAINLAND CHINA: VICE PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  21  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said on Monday
that the Republic of China hopes that both sides of the Taiwan Strait
will be able to live in peace and prosperity, and that it has no
intention of provoking the mainland.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks when she received Elie Goldschmidt, chairman
of the Finance Committee of the Israeli Knesset, or parliament.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that Israel is similar to Taiwan in that it is in a
difficult situation in the international community. But Israel has
been more fortunate in that the world has paid a great deal of
attention to the relations between Israel and its neighboring states,
she noted.</P>
      <P>Lu said that since the Chinese Communist Party established its
political regime in the mainland in 1949, it has never exercised
jurisdiction over Taiwan, but most of the countries in the world have
recognized that there is only one China, and that Taiwan is a part of
China, which she said is far from the truth.</P>
      <P>She stressed that the government has no intention of provoking
Beijing, adding that Taiwan hopes to live in peace with mainland
China.</P>
      <P>When both sides of the Taiwan Strait resume their long-stalled
dialogue, the talks must be conducted on a basis of equality, mutual
respect and mutual benefit, rather than one side exerting
overwhelming pressure on the other, she added.</P>
      <P>For his part, Goldschmidt said that it was unimaginable in the
1980s that Israel would sit down at the negotiations table with the
Palestinians because of the two sides' mutual mistrust and
long-standing animosity.</P>
      <P>But he said that Israel is now moving in this direction, adding
that though the process of negotiation is tough and the results still
unpredictable, he said the experience gained during the process is
valuable.</P>
      <P>The Israeli parliamentarian was accompanied on his visit by
Francis Chang, director general of the Department of West Asian
Affairs under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>QUAKES SHAKING KAOHSIUNG AREA ARE NATURAL: CWB</HEADLINE>

(By Yolanda K.C. Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Seismology Center of the Central
Weather Bureau (CWB) said on Monday that the intense earthquakes that
have been occurring in the township of Taoyuan, Kaohsiung County,
over the last two days are a normal phenomenon, judging from past
seismological records.</P>
      <P>Three earthquakes respectively registering 4.4, 4.6, and 4.8 on
the Richter scale, jolted Taoyuan on Sunday, with another three
quakes of magnitude 4.5, 4.6, and 4.0 hitting the same
township between 3:02 a.m. and 3:31 a.m. on Monday.</P>
      <P>A magnitude 5.0 earthquake may sound scary, but the strongest
of those that hit Taoyuan over the weekend, registering this
level, was different from the "921 quake" of last year. The tremors
of that quake lasted for a long time, while this jolt only lasted
for one-tenth of a second.</P>
      <P>Deputy-Director Lu Pei-ling explained that the tremors
occurring in Taoyuan these days are simply the normal phenomena
of energy being released as the township is located in the area of
the Central Mountain range where intense quakes strike every
few years.</P>

(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
may call on opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan in the
first week of September, acting Secretary-General to the President
Chen Che-nan said on Monday.</P>
      <P>It would mark the first time that an ROC president paid a formal
courtesy call on an opposition party chairman.</P>
      <P>The presidential spokesman said at a routine press conference
that he has already picked out three to four different time slots to
fit with Lien's schedule, and that if these times are still
inconvenient for Lien, the meeting could take place at a different
time.</P>
      <P>The president had said during his July 31 press conference that
he would be willing to visit the KMT's headquarters personally to
invite Lien to a cross-party roundtable with the heads of the ROC's
three major political parties.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Che-nan, the president's sincerity so touched
Lien that he wanted to come to the Presidential Office himself. As
both sides want to show respect by visiting each other, Chen Che-nan
said that the meeting between Lien and the president should take
place at a midpoint between the Presidential Office and the KMT's
headquarters, adding that the Taipei Guest House is a possible venue.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Jason Hu responded to Chen Che-nan's statements by
saying that he is unable to confirm the news of the possible meeting,
but that if there is indeed to be a meeting, the venue would be up to
its host, President Chen.</P>
      <P>The president had earlier said that he wanted the roundtable
meeting to take place in August, but plans were shelved as the party
leaders called for preliminary meetings to set up details for the
roundtable meeting, as well as because of scheduling difficulties
brought about by the president, KMT chairman, and opposition People
First Party Chairman James Soong all leaving Taiwan on their
respective overseas trips.</P>
      <P>Lien left for the United States and Canada on a two-week visit
that ended Aug. 15. Soong left for Germany on Aug. 10 to attend a
meeting of overseas Chinese in Europe, returning on Monday. The
president himself is currently on a 13-day, six-nation official state
visit to the Caribbean, Central America, and West Africa.</P>

      <P>Three business leaders traveling

foreign trip suggested to the President that he work to bolster
traditional industries in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin Kun-chung, chairman of the Chinese National Federation of
Industries; Wang You-tseng, chairman of the General Chamber of
Commerce of the Republic of China; and Jeffrey Koo, chairman of the
Chinese National Association of Industry &amp; Commerce, had suggested
earlier this month to Premier Tang Fei that the government spend
NT$300 billion (US$9.67 billion) to buy stocks in Taiwan'
traditional, labor-intensive industries.</P>
      <P>The trio of business leaders again made the proposal to the
President on Sunday, and Koo stressed later that President Chen is
firm in his desire to bolster traditional industries.</P>
      <P>Eugene Chien, deputy secretary general of the Presidential
Office, said that President Chen listened carefully to the business
leaders' report on the difficult situation facing traditional
manufacturers. They expressed their hope that the president would
support labor-intensive industries by stepping in to bolster share
prices in related firms and also to help them obtain financing.</P>
      <P>The three business leaders went on to suggest that the government
grant a six-month suspension on loans made to traditional
manufacturers, which currently fall due at the end of next January.</P>
      <P>President Chen did not give a substantial response to the trio's
suggestion, only saying that he intends to promote actively Taiwan's
economic development after his return this week.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing has agreed to set up an ad hoc
tribunal to settle trade disputes involving Taiwan businessmen
operating in mainland China, a Taiwan business leader visiting the
mainland said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers Association
(TEEMA) President Richard Wu told a group of Taiwan-based journalists
that the Beijing authorities have agreed to establish a "business
court for Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau," to adjudicate disputes
between businessmen from the three areas and their mainland Chinese
trade partners.</P>
      <P>Although the proposed court will also hear disputes involving
businessmen from Hong Kong and Macau, Taiwan businessmen will be its
major users in light of their larger number, said Wu.</P>
      <P>Taiwan businessmen often complain that they cannot get fair
treatment at ordinary courts in mainland China because of the rampant
regionalism and protectionism. In order to address the problem, the
TEEMA has lobbied Beijing for years to set up a special tribunal to
hear such cases, said Wu.</P>
      <P>Wu, who added that he personally has had unpleasant experiences
with Beijing's courts, expressed hope that such incidents will become
a thing of the past after the new tribunal begins operations.</P>
      <P>Wu and his delegation arrived in Beijing on Sunday for a ten-day
visit. They will call on Beijing leaders and tour central and
southern China to research the investment environment.</P>

(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three local high school students were
arrested on Monday for allegedly running Trojan programs to steal
dial-up account passwords from compromised computer systems.</P>
      <P>According to the Ninth Investigation Corps of the Criminal
Investigation Bureaus (CIB), which handles computer crime, the three
teenagers were still beaming with pride during questioning when they
described their attacks.</P>
      <P>The students allegedly scanned specific regions of the Internet
for computers that had already been infected with the SunSeven and
NetSpy Trojan programs, which act as local servers that allow any
hacker with appropriate client programs to remotely access the local
system and acquire otherwise secure information such as passwords.
The stolen information can then allow hackers to run up huge charges
with a victim's Internet service provider.</P>
      <P>CIB officials said that there has been a recent increase in
reports of compromised systems, stolen account numbers, and
skyrocketing dial-up fees that are linked to the two programs.</P>
      <P>Police said that Trojans normally infect large corporate computer
systems, but added that any individual's computer can be vulnerable.</P>
      <P>Most commercial anti-virus programs can only detect popular
Trojans, while the rest slip past unnoticed. With over 600 Trojans
out in cyberspace and a noted lack of anti-Trojan programs that can
recognize them all and weed them out, computer users should be wary
of opening any executable email attachments, even from known sources.</P>
      <P>Strange or unexplained dialogue boxes with conversation or

    <DATELINE>Ouagadougou,  Burkina  Faso,  Aug.  21  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China
President Chen Shui-bian is scheduled to arrive in Burkina Faso on
Monday for a three-day visit to the West African nation.</P>
      <P>Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore will lead all his
government officials and "mobilize citizens in the capital" to give
Chen a grand reception upon his arrival at Ouagadougou airport,
according to unnamed reports.</P>
      <P>Compaore, 49, is very friendly towards the ROC. He had visited
the ROC three times since the two countries restored diplomatic
relations in 1994 and is said to have been much impressed by the
ROC's progress in the fields of politics, economy and society.</P>
      <P>Compaore has also cited "the Taiwan formula" as a paragon for the
development of his own country and always attends the ROC's national
day reception held by the ROC Embassy in Burkina Faso each Oct. 10.</P>
      <P>The former Upper Volta changed its national name to Burkina Faso
in 1984. Burkina, in local language, means "honest people," and Faso
means "land of the ancestor."</P>
      <P>A landlocked country, Burkina Faso lies on the southern edge of
the Sahara desert. It occupies an area of 274,200 square kilometers
and has a population of 11 million.</P>
      <P>Burkina Faso's climate is dry with a rainy season that lasts for
just two months per year. Infertile soil forces three million of
Burkina Faso's people to work in neighboring countries and they are
the biggest contributors to the country's foreign reserves.</P>
      <P>The impoverished West African nation's per capita income in 1998
was just US$255.</P>
      <P>Compaore grabbed power in a 1987 coup and his rule has been
marked by a struggle between him and opposition leaders. Abandoning
his former leftist leanings, he has sought to "establish a democratic
system" and has improved the nation's economy.</P>
      <P>In a "multi-party" presidential election in December 1991,
Compaore won by a huge margin. The opposition refused to participate,
however, claiming that the election had been fixed.</P>
      <P>He was re-elected in 1998.

      <P>Falun Gong sect members in Sydney,
encouraged by Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer's support,
are holding a one-week show in the city's Chinatown to confront
mainland China's harassment and threats.</P>
      <P>The show, which opened on Aug. 19, includes a video shot in New

practicing Falun Gong, a form of deep breathing used to promote
spiritual, mental and physical health. Photos of practitioners are
also on display.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA on Sunday, Kao Yuan, an Australian
Chinese member, said: "We are putting on the show to confront any
Chinese harassment and threat of crackdown outside of China. We are
not afraid of any Chinese diplomats' threats because they have
absolutely no rights to harass us in Australia."</P>
      <P>Kao was referring to reports that mainland Chinese diplomats in
Australia were harassing Falun Gong members, accusations that have
been vehemently denied by the mainland.</P>
      <P>Kao said the mainland Chinese authorities are trying to eliminate
Falun Gong and its members because they are "desperate" they will be
usurped by the sect, despite the fact that the sect is peaceful in
nature.</P>
      <P>He said the sect members in Sydney and Canberra were feeling
encouraged after Downer told a visiting mainland Chinese delegation
last week to stop harassing Falun Gong members in Australia.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan wrote an open
letter on Monday to invite his fellow party members to re-register
with the party to reconfirm their memberships.</P>
      <P>The letter will delivered through the party's apparatus to its
members across the island, asking them to stand up and be counted and
acknowledge their loyalty to the party.</P>
      <P>Recalling the hardships the KMT has gone through in the last
hundred years, the KMT leader urges his comrades in the letter to
follow the footsteps of the party's prominent members, many of whom
have given their lives for the party's cause in the past.</P>
      <P>Lien acknowledges the deep sorrow he felt after being defeated in
the May 18 presidential election -- the first time the party had been
stripped of the power to rule in more than five decades.</P>
      <P>"Instead of fraying our nerves and beating us completely, the
temporary loss in the presidential election will only prompt all of
us to fight tooth and nail for the party's ultimate victory," says
Lien's letter.</P>
      <P>Noting that KMT members have always come forward in force to
buttress their party whenever the organization created by ROC
founding father Sun Yat-sen was in crisis, Lien urges his fellow
members to reconfirm their commitment to KMT, and vows to fight
shoulder to shoulder with them "for the party's brighter future."</P>
      <P>The KMT, which boasts a membership of 2.4 million, was divided in
the presidential election between Lien Chan and former KMT
Secretary-General James Soong who ran as an independent, effectively
handing victory to the Democratic Progressive Party candidate Chen
Shui-bian, who won by a narrow margin.</P>
      <P>The rift between Lien and Soong led to a massive breakaway of
Soong' KMT followers who formed their own People's First Party with
Soong as their head.</P>
      <P>In order to "clean its own house" after the division, the KMT
launched the re-registration of its membership with the purpose of
regrouping their followers and paving the way for party primaries as
a method of choosing party candidates for public office.</P>
      <P>Lien and several elder KMT statesmen will re-register their
memberships on Sept. 1 as a publicity stunt to encourage other
members to follow suit, said KMT party officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TRAVELERS SPENT US$ 2.03 BILLION OVERSEAS IN SECOND QUARTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  21  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan travelers spent US$2.03 billion
overseas in the second quarter of this year, an indication that the
people of the island have gradually emerged from the shadow of the
disaster caused by the Sept. 21 earthquake last year.</P>
      <P>Although US$126 million less than the US$2.16 billion spent in
the previous quarter, it is far more than the US$1.75 billion
registered in the last quarter of 1999, when the island was still
reeling from the 7.3-magnitude quake which claimed the lives of 2,400
in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The second quarter's spending brought the island's total
tourist spending in the first half of this year to US$4.19 billion,
and more spending is expecting during the seasonal travel peak of the
third quarter, according to an analyst with the Central Bank of
China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the island's domestic tourism earned US$955 million,
which is US$US$20 million less than the previous quarter. This
revenue was also expected to surge in the third quarter.</P>
      <P>In related news, the public sector's outstanding foreign debt
declined to US$31 million as of the end of March, which is a historic
low against the 1982 peak of US$7.1 billion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OVERHAULING GNU MIGHT DAMAGE CROSS-STRAIT STABILITY: KMT OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 21 (CNA)
(By Alice Liang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The director of the opposition Kuomintang's
Department of Mainland Research said on Monday that overhauling the
Guidelines for National Unification (GNU) would damage cross-Taiwan
Strait stability.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung was reacting to remarks by Acting
Secretary-General to the President, Chen Che-nan, who said the GNU
should be overhauled to meet actual needs, as the environments in
both Taiwan and mainland China have changed.</P>
      <P>However, Chang said that according to President Chen Shui-bian's
remarks that cross-strait reunification was not the only choice,
overhauling the GNU would affect the main direction of the
cross-strait relationship development and might also start a domestic
war of words on independence versus unification.</P>
      <P>Chang said Presidential Office officials have expressed the
intention to overhaul the GNU many times. However, they have never
explained the direction such an overhaul would take. Chang said that
is the reason he has maintained his conservative attitude toward a
GNU overhaul.</P>
      <P>He emphasized that the present GNU does not force Taiwan to
handle the cross-strait unification issue, which is to the advantage
of the people. In addition, under the democratic system, any
important development in the cross-strait relationship should be
agreed upon through public opinion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLINTON GOV'T URGED TO LIFT RESTRICTION ON TAIWAN LEADERS US VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug. 21 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen &amp; Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A heavyweight US congressman on Sunday
criticized the Clinton Administration's restrictions on meetings
between US congressmen and Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
when the latter made a one-night stopover in Los Angeles recently.</P>
      <P>Samuel Gejdenson (D-Conn.), a minority member of the House of
Representative's International Relations Subcommission, said that
Chen and Taiwan deserve to receive fair treatment. He added that the
Clinton Administration should permit ROC leaders to make contact with
US parliamentarians and related US government officials.</P>
      <P>In an article published in the Washington Times on Sunday, he
described a meeting scheduled between members of the House of
Representative's International Relations Subcommission and Chen as
"proper and important."</P>
      <P>About 15 parliamentarians from the Democratic Party and the
Republican Party had originally planned to meet with Chen on Aug. 13.
Yielding to political pressure from Washington and Beijing, however,
Chen was forced to say he would not attend, so the meeting was
canceled, he said.</P>
      <P>He said members of Congress have long had the freedom to meet
with world leaders and to travel to places the administration cannot,
including Cuba, North Korea, Iraq and Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>"These meetings present vital opportunities to discuss issues of
mutual concern that directly affect the US national interest," he
said.</P>
      <P>Gejdenson said he regretted that the meeting with Chen was
canceled due to the US executive branch's adherence to an executive
order issued more than 20 years ago that limits Taiwan leaders'
visits to the United States or meeting with US officials.</P>
      <P>He stressed that in the changing times, Congress must keep
focused on US policy towards Taiwan. "We must find ways to reduce the
threat of war between Taiwan and China and in particular, to
counteract China's buildup of missiles pointed at Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the House of Representatives has already
overwhelmingly approved the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, which
will strengthen the US-Taiwan defense relationship, but this
important bill remains bottled-up in the Senate. The Congress must
encourage the administration to find meaningful ways to involve
Taiwan in international organizations, to the benefit of both Taiwan
and the international community, he said.</P>
      <P>He said that members of Congress traveling in Asia routinely
visit Taipei to meet with senior officials, and that it is time
high-ranking Taiwan officials be permitted to come to the United
States to meet with member of Congress and relevant US officials.</P>
      <P>The United States must try to find some way to afford Taiwan's
leader the respect he has earned, he said, adding that meetings of
this kind would send a strong message to mainland China that the
United States is committed to defending Taiwan and its democracy in
deeds rather than words.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Blaise
Compaore of the West African state of Burkina Faso declared on Monday
that he will spare no effort in seeing the Republic of China re-enter
the United Nations and other international organizations.</P>
      <P>"We strongly support the efforts employed by the Republic of
China in view to breaking through its diplomatic isolation because we
think that the international community cannot continue to ignore a
nation of 23 million inhabitants," he told CNA in an interview.</P>
      <P>Shortly before welcoming his counterpart, Republic of China
President Chen Shui-bian, on a visit to Burkina Faso, President
Compaore reiterated that it was a great honor for the whole nation to
welcome President Chen. He stressed that he attaches great importance
to the visit.</P>
      <P>The ROC president arrived in Ouagadougou late Monday afternoon
with a 80-strong entourage for a three-day official visit. The ROC
resumed diplomatic relations with Burkina Faso in 1995 after 22 years
of suspension.</P>
      <P>Refuting criticism of the ROC's alleged so-called "money
diplomacy," President Compaore noted that relations between Burkina
Faso and the Republic of China are based on friendship and
solidarity.</P>
      <P>"Our two nations are motivated to working toward a world of
justice and peace," he said, adding that the importance of the
bilateral relationship has been perceived through the positive
results recorded in various fields of cooperation during the past
years.</P>
      <P>Under the bilateral Technical Cooperation Agreement signed in
1996, the ROC sent a 12-member team of experts to help develop
Burkina Faso's rice cultivation and also five doctors to improve
medical services in the West African nation. The ROC government has
also provided some financial aid to build irrigation systems, to help
with reforestation efforts in the northern regions of Sahel, and to
establish a handicraft industry.</P>
      <P>President Compaore also expressed the hope that the two countries
can cooperate in the private sector so as to further strengthen their
overall relationship. He said agriculture and related industries, as
well as textiles, are potential areas of investment for Taiwan
investors.</P>
      <P>In his view, such cooperation is very promising because Burkina
Faso is located at the hub of the 70-million consumer common market
of the West African Economic and Monetary Union, which was
established on Jan. 1 this year among eight French speaking nations
in the region.</P>

      <P>President Chen, heading a large delegation of government
officials, business executives and journalists, arrived in the
Burkina Faso capital of Ouagadougou from neighboring Gambia around
17:30 p.m. for a three-day state visit.</P>
      <P>Chen was accorded a red-carpet welcome, complete with a 21-gun
salute upon his arrival at the airport. Burkina Faso President
Blaise Compaore personally presided over the grand welcoming ceremony
to greet the first Asian leader to his country.</P>
      <P>A large crowd of Burkina Faso nationals decked out in
traditional costumes and performed folk songs and dances

presented three special gifts -- fresh water, a white live goat and
a bronze statue -- to signify Burkina Faso people's hearty welcome

    <HEADLINE>MOFA READY TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE FOR LEE'S VISIT TO JAPAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
on Tuesday that it will provide the necessary assistance for former
President Lee Teng-hui's visit to Japan.</P>
      <P>Vice Foreign Affairs Minister David Lee was responding to a
report on Monday which said that the former president hopes to visit
Japan in October.</P>
      <P>But the MOFA has yet to receive any requests for assistance
pertaining to the ex-president's planned visit, nor has it received
related reports from the ROC's Representative to Japan Lo Fu-chuan,
said Lee, adding that if there is such a need, the ministry will
provide assistance.</P>
      <P>Liu Tai-ying, president of the Taiwan Research Institute, said on
Monday that the former president, who is now serving as the honorary
chairman of the private think tank, is keen on visiting Japan, hoping
to attend a meeting of the Asian Outlook, which he co-founded in
1989, and also to call on his alma mater Kyoto Imperial University,
as well as to meet several groups that are friendly to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Vice Foreign Minister said that the exchanges between Japan
and Taiwan are close and that there have been many invitations to the
ex-president from Japanese private groups, but added that the
ministry currently is not making any preparations for such a visit.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin Chin-ching, representative of the Association of
East Asia Relations, also said on Tuesday that many private groups
from Japan have invited Lee Teng-hui to visit Japan because of their
admiration for the former president.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that many people in Japan had extended invitations in
various ways hoping that Lee would be able to visit Japan after
stepping down as the ROC head of state in May.</P>
      <P>But as Lee's status is still a sensitive issue because of his
past position, Lin said that it is better that the visit takes place
in a most natural way.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that as People's Republic of China Premier Zhu Rongji
is scheduled to visit Japan in October, this makes Lee's planned
visit uncertain, adding that the chances of the former ROC head of
state visiting Japan before the end of the year are not to high.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN STOCK INDEX DECLINES OVER JITTERS ABOUT ECONOMIC OUTLOOK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's share prices reversed its
upward trend seen in the past five consecutive trading sessions
and closed 1.7 percent lower on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Stock Exchange weighted price index, the market's
key barometers, fell 139.83 points to close at 8,118.05, on turnover
of NT$77.97 billion (US$2.52 billion).</P>
      <P>Market analysts attributed the fall to a combination of factors,
including profit-taking by short-term players and jitters about the
island's economic outlook caused by lower-than-expected results of
July's export orders, which slid 0.7 percent from the previous month
to US$12.99 billion.</P>
      <P>As for the sharp decrease in daily turnover, analysts said the
reason was that many players kept on the sidelines due to a looming
typhoon and imminent announcement by listed firms of their business
records for the first half of this year.</P>
      <P>A total of 156.92 million shares changed hands during the
three-hour trading session.</P>
      <P>The price indexes for the eight major categories all closed

    <TEXT>
      <P>Strong winds had knocked out the
electricity supply for some 900 households in Taitung, southeastern
Taiwan, as of noon on Tuesday, as Taiwan braced for Typhoon Bilis,
the strongest typhoon to hit the island so far this year.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Bilis, which has been upgraded to the level of a
super-typhoon due to its high-speed winds, was centered 210
kilometers southeast of Taitung at 3 p.m. on Tuesday and was moving
steadily in a west-northwesterly direction at a speed of 22
kilometers per hour.</P>
      <P>Strong winds and heavy rains began to pound Taitung, nearby
coastal areas, and offshore Orchid and Green Islands early on Tuesday
morning.</P>
      <P>The winds had been growing in strength since 9 a.m. Tuesday, but
other than the power blackout, there were no reports of major
calamities. Air, sea and railway traffic have all been suspended in
Taitung County.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Tang Fei on Tuesday urged the public to be
prepared for Typhoon Bilis, saying that people should pay attention
to their safety, remain indoors and avoid unnecessary outings.</P>
      <P>Tang urged the residents in the eastern regions of Taiwan to be
well prepared for the typhoon so as to minimize its damage, while
people in Keelung, Taipei, Taoyuan and Ilan should also be on alert.</P>
      <P>Tang noted that the government's weather bureau had predicted
that the typhoon will land on Taiwan between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m.
Tuesday, and that it will leave Taiwan at around 7 a.m. Wednesday. As
the storm's duration is expected to be very long, Tang warned the
public to be careful of fallen advertisement boards and trees on the
streets.</P>
      <P>He also instructed local governments to persuade residents living
in mudslide-prone areas to evacuate to safety shelters.</P>

by ten efforts, you will use a thousand efforts. Let a man really
proceed in this manner, and, though dull, he will surely become
intelligent; though weak, he will surely become strong."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>CLOUD GATE DANCERS WOW AUSTRALIAN CRITIC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, Aug. 21 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cloud Gate Dance Theater, one of very
few international dance troupes invited to perform at the Olympic
Arts Festival in Sydney, won a rave review in a mass circulation
newspaper here on Monday, as the company continued its show for the
third consecutive day on Monday.</P>
      <P>Art critic Deborah Jones, who penned the article, praised Cloud
Gate choreographer Lin Hwai-min and his production of "Nine Songs,"
describing him as "a master of choreography who seamlessly joins the
ancient Asian with the utterly contemporary."</P>
      <P>"He makes visible the great flow of time and history, linking the
traditional and the here and now to fashion a piece that has
political and social relevance, yet makes one understand that
everything moves on," she said.</P>
      <P>She praised Lin's long view of time and history. "In Nine Songs
-- based on 2500-year-old Chinese poems -- seasons pass, epochs come
and go, the realm of the gods elides with that of humankind, and
there is struggle and acquiescence."</P>
      <P>"There is also glorious dancing. The intense, powerful Cloud Gate
performers have a kind of internal muscularity that lets them explode
or stretch a moment out until every bit of essence has been
extracted, but there is never any sense of such skill being used for
mere pyrotechnical display," she said.</P>
      <P>"At the end of 'Nine Songs' there is silence and a river of
light. To Lin Hwai-min, one suspects, we are, somehow, always
waving," she added.</P>
      <P>Organizers of the arts festival said that the review would likely
tempt more and more people to attend Cloud Gate performances of "Nine
Songs" on Monday and Tuesday, and also increase ticket sales of the
troupe's production of "Moonwater," slated for August 25 to 27 at Her
Majesty's Theater in Sydney.</P>
      <P>On Saturday and Sunday, the first two nights of the performance,
about 80 percent of the theater's 1500 seats were taken, the
organizers added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARMED INTRUDERS ATTEMPT BREAK-IN AT ROC DIPLOMAT'S RESIDENCE IN MALAWI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Lilongwe, Malawi, Aug. 22 (CNA)
(By Yang Hui-chen and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Four armed men attempted to break
into the local residence of a Republic of China diplomat, but were
deterred by a warning shot and fled the scene.</P>
      <P>A secretary at the ROC embassy surnamed Tsao told the Central
News Agency that he was asleep when his night-shift security guard
blew a whistle at around 12:10 a.m. on Sunday, alerting him to the
presence of intruders on his property.</P>
      <P>The guard said that four men, each armed with a knife, broke into
the yard. After he blew the whistle, two of the intruders confronted
and threatened him in an attempt to keep him quiet, while the other
two men cut the main power line to Tsao's residence and ordered Tsao
to open the door.</P>
      <P>Tsao said that the houses in his neighborhood are often broken
into, and that frequent warning shots can be heard at night to deter
unwelcome guests. However, this was the first time that intruders
ever tried to force their way into his house, he added.</P>
      <P>After the four men tried to force open his door and windows with
blunt instruments, Tsao fired a shot through the front door with his
handgun, registered with the police for self-defense.</P>
      <P>Tsao said that he couldn't hear any sounds from outside the door
after he fired the shot, but he suspected that the intruders might
have still been lurking outside the door, so he called for backup on
his mobile phone.</P>
      <P>Because Malawi policemen are often late to arrive at crime scenes
due to transportation difficulties, ROC Ambassador to Malawi Chen
Hsi-tsan called up three other embassy personnel to rush to Tsao's
residence.</P>
      <P>A search revealed that the suspects had escaped, and no signs of
injuries were found.</P>
      <P>According to the ROC embassy in this Southeast African nation,
Malawi is considered to be a friendly country, but that an economic
decline in recent years has pushed more and more people into crime.
Residences of other embassy personnel have been burglarized in the
past, but such blatant attempts at robbery as this case usually occur
in more rural residential areas.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND BANKS MAY BE ALLOWED TO SET UP LIAISON OFFICE IN ROC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China will consider the
feasibility of allowing mainland Chinese banks to set up
representative or liaison offices in Taiwan, Vice Finance Minister
Yen Ching-chang said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Yen said since the government has agreed to a phased opening for
local banks to establish footholds in mainland China, it will
simultaneously mull the possibility of opening the door to mainland
banks intending to tap the Taiwan market in line with the principles
of fairness and parity.</P>
      <P>Beijing authorities reportedly have made a goodwill response to
the ROC's decision to allow a phased opening for Taiwan banks to set
up footholds on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under
mainland China's State Council, was quoted as having said that
Beijing will lower its requirements for Taiwan banks to open branches
on the mainland and will also all Taiwan bank branches to operate
mainland currency (renminbi)-denominated banking services. Chen's
remarks have caught attention in the local banking community.</P>
      <P>Yen, however, would not make any comments on grounds that Chen's
remarks have not been officially confirmed. Instead, he said if the
report about Chen's statements is correct, the ROC would welcome
such mainland moves.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government basically adopts a positive attitude
toward the proposal of allowing local banks to set up liaison
offices on the mainland, Yen said some issues need to be evaluated
further.</P>
      <P>For instance, Yen said that the ROC government hopes to
known whether mainland China would allow Taiwan's banking
inspectors to inspect branch operations after a liaison office is
upgraded to a branch.</P>
      <P>"We must also evaluate the possible impact if mainland China
imposes restrictions on Taiwan inspectors in auditing operations of
Taiwan banks' mainland branches," Yen noted.</P>
      <P>Sean C. Chen, also a finance minister, said last week that the
Ministry of Finance is working with the Central Bank of China and the
Mainland Affairs Council on drafting a comprehensive package of
regulations governing applications by local banks to open a
representative office on the mainland. The package will be
referred to the Cabinet for approval soon, Chen said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra, Aug. 22 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With superb technique and worldwide fame,
the Cloud Gate Dance Theater Company has successfully avoided
political opposition from mainland China to perform at the Olympic
Arts Festival in Sydney, putting Taiwan in the spotlight in Australia
and many other countries as well.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, Cloud Gate representative Jon-Claire
Lee said that the organizers decided last year to invite the
Taiwan-based dance troupe to perform at the arts festival, an
important preliminary event of the 2000 Olympic Games. He stressed
that the company was the only Asian dance troupe to perform there.</P>
      <P>But before the official announcement last October, the organizers
had feared the possible repercussions from mainland China, which
might have objected to the international publicity that the
performance would generate for Taiwan, and because of Australia's
strict one-China policy.</P>
      <P>Seeking to ease the situation, the organizers had sent a letter
to the Chinese Embassy in Canberra, telling mainland officials that
Cloud Gate would be invited to perform. Lee said that to their
delight, the answer from mainland China was positive -- they did not
oppose the invitation.</P>
      <P>"With the tacit understanding of Beijing, the organizers went
ahead with their official launch of the dancing performance and made
an official announcement that Cloud Gate will perform at the arts
festival," Lee said.</P>
      <P>"I was thrilled with the successful results, though it took me
about two years and a half to arrange and negotiate for the Cloud
Gate Theater to be part of the Olympic Arts Festival, which I regard
as a very significant occasion due to its magnitude and massive
publicity to be given not only to the company, but also to the
Republic of China, as well," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Craig Hassell, general manager of the arts festival, told CNA
that the organizers had informed the Chinese embassy as a gesture of
"courtesy."</P>
      <P>In a speech on Saturday, opening night of the Cloud Gate
performance, Hassell expressed his thanks to the ROC government for
making the Cloud Gate performances possible by providing US$400,000
in funding so that the troupe could stage their show in Sydney during
the arts festival.</P>
      <P>He praised the superb performance of Cloud Gate on opening night,
citing the company as one of the best contemporary dance troupes in
the world.</P>
      <P>"Organizing the arts festival is not an easy task because we have
to match the scale of the 2000 Olympic Games, which is the world's
biggest sports event," he said.</P>
      <P>He and other organizers said they were very satisfied with their
choice of the Cloud Gate Theater as part of the Olympic Arts
Festival.</P>
      <P>Founded in 1973 by Lin Hwai-min, then a student of world-renowned
Martha Graham, the Cloud Gate troupe has given at least 2,000
performances in five continents over about 27 years. More than one
third of the performances have been given in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin said he was proud that the troupe has toured extensively in
Europe, North America, Asia and Australia, dancing from one stage to
another and performing on such occasions as the 25th anniversary of
Pina Bausch's Tanztheater Wuppertal and the Adelaide Festival, and at
venues including Sadler's Wells Theater and the Kennedy Center.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Cloud Gate is acclaimed as "Asia's leading contemporary dance
theater and one of the finest dance companies in the world."</P>
      <P>"It's the first time for us to perform at the Olympic Arts
Festival and we are excited to have such an opportunity to present
our best performance in such an auspicious occasion," Lin said.</P>
      <P>"We have won lots of friendship, respect and admiration in many
countries, thanks to our unswerving efforts to present our best to
them. Above all, our extensive tours to many countries have put
Taiwan on the global map," he said.</P>
      <P>To the Republic of China, it is well beyond reach from diplomatic
front because Taiwan is always being strangled and isolated, thanks
to constant threat and pressure from mainland China, political
analysts said.</P>
      <P>Professor Hsu Chia-shih, chairman of the Cloud Gate, said Lin and
his troupe have provided foreigners in many countries another
perspective on the image of Taiwan, which has been notoriously known
as an island of disaster and fist-fighting.</P>
      <P>"Our parliament is known for fist-fighting and name-calling
because our MPs like to quarrel. That often leads to fist-fighting in
the parliamentary floor to force their case. Last September, Taiwan
was for the first time in one century as a place of disaster just
because of the onslaught of 7.8 degree earthquake," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>The quake killed about 2,400 people and made tens of thousands of
people homeless in central Taiwan, making the island instantly famous
worldwide from such a natural calamity, he noted.</P>
      <P>"But the superb Cloud Gate performances give Taiwan a very good
image internationally," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Two key dangers agreed with Hsu's remarks. They are Wu I-fang,
who portrays a god, and Lee Ching-chun, who portrays a witch in "Nine
Songs."</P>
      <P>"I feel thrilled and hilarious every time I and my colleagues
perform no matter in Taiwan or abroad. The feedback is spontaneous
from our audience. Especially, the support given to us from overseas
Chinese in many countries, they just want to see our performances no
matter how far they are away from the venues we performed," Wu said.</P>
      <P>"I try our very best to perform so that people enjoy our
performances. But at the same time, we have one burden to carry
wherever we go -- that 's to make Taiwan known to many people in the
world," Lee Ching-chun said.</P>
      <P>Both Wu and Lee said they were especially delighted to perform at
the Olympic Arts Festival, because it's part of the major cultural
event going along with the 2000 Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>"Being able to perform at the festival is our best opportunity to
present not only our dancing technique, but also win more friends
from Australia and many other countries to be represented at the same
occasion," Wu said.</P>
      <P>More than 10,000 athletes from over 100 countries will compete in
the Olympic Games from mid-September.</P>
      <P>Jon-Claire Lee and Hsu Chia-shih said the Cloud Gate performances
will generate more admiration and respect for the ROC on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"This is a precious thing we value much more than others," Hsu
said.</P>

government to show the original copy of the joint declaration of the
Cairo Conference issued on Dec. 3, 1943.</P>
      <P>The letter pointed out that the committee had already sent a

    <HEADLINE>TOO EARLY TO TALK ABOUT OVERHAULING UNIFICATION GUIDELINES: PFP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  22  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party Chairman
James Soong said on Tuesday that it is still too early to talk about
overhauling the Guidelines for National Unification (GNU), as the
government has yet to show consistency over cross-Taiwan Strait
policies.</P>
      <P>Reacting to remarks by Acting Secretary-General to the President
Chen Che-nan, who said on Monday that the GNU should be overhauled to
meet actual needs as the environments in both Taiwan and mainland
China have changed, Soong said Chen's idea is tantamount to an action
trying to alter pivotal national policies.</P>
      <P>Soong said Chen's uttering of the remarks on behalf of the
government, before a President Chen Shui-bian-proposed roundtable
meeting of major political party leaders has been held to canvass
opinions from the opposition politicians on important national
issues, is tantamount to making a declaration before a decision has
been made.</P>
      <P>Soong, who organized his own political party after losing the
March 18 presidential election to Chen Shui-bian by a narrow margin,
applauded the creation of the roundtable meeting, saying it will have
a positive influence on solving differences among parties on major
national issues.</P>
      <P>He suggested to Chen that the new government try to work out
concerted cross-strait policies which are consistent and have
continuity in order to regain the people's confidence in the
government.</P>
      <P>He also criticized Chen's current overseas visit as "badly and
hastily timed."</P>
      <P>Soong asked scathingly that if the 13-day, six-state trip was as
well prepared as the new government has claimed, how come Foreign
Affairs Minister Tien Hung-mao was not accompanying the president
throughout the entire trip? He said Tien, who left Chen to
participate in a meeting somewhere else, should return to Chen's side
immediately before the trip wraps up on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Soong, who was the first and last popularly elected
Taiwan provincial governor, welcomed the government's recent actions
to renew the investigation into the highly publicized murder of Navy
Captain Yin Ching-feng some six years ago.</P>
      <P>Soong said the government should give the investigators a free
hand to get to the bottom of the case even at the cost of the
reputations of some "high level" people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC GIO CHIEF CLARIFIES `MONEY DIPLOMACY' CRITICISM ON BBC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  Aug.  21  (CNA)
(By Mark Ou and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China government spokeswoman
Chung Chin has denied in an interview with the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC) that the ROC has resorted to "money diplomacy" to
promote its external relations.</P>
      <P>Chung, also director-general of the Government Information Office
(GIO), is currently accompanying ROC President Chen Shui-bian on a
six-state "journey of friendship" aimed at bolstering Taiwan's
diplomatic ties with its allies in the Caribbean, Central America and
West Africa. She gave the interview with the BBC on Sunday.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Chung said developing mutually beneficial
cooperative ties is the primary direction for the new ROC
government's diplomatic work.</P>
      <P>Chung said the international community used to have
"misunderstandings" about the ROC government's economic aid to its
diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>In fact, Chung said, the previous Kuomintang government
accomplished many outstanding diplomatic achievements and that
financial aid was only a part of its diplomatic work. Moreover, she
went on, the ROC's economic aid to its allies has also formed an
integral part of "the global foreign aid project."</P>
      <P>Chung pointed out that the ROC's current Democratic Progressive
Party-led government gives priority to promoting substantive
cooperation with its allies.</P>
      <P>"The ROC looks forward to strengthening cooperation with its
allies in economic, trade, cultural, political, democratic system
development and other related fields," Chung noted.</P>
      <P>During his current visit, Chung said, Chen has assured leaders of
the ROC's allies that his administration will faithfully fulfill its
obligations under existing bilateral agreements signed by the
previous administration on lending, financing or direct economic aid,
based on the principle of government continuity.</P>
      <P>Chung said the ROC's diplomatic allies have benefited greatly
from those cooperative projects over the years. For instance, ROC
medical, agricultural and fishery missions have helped cultivate a
generation of young professionals in the host countries and have
helped promote their overall economic growth.</P>
      <P>Asked how Chen's administration will cope with mainland China's
perennial diplomatic embargo against the ROC, Chung said Beijing's
opposition to the scenario that a country simultaneously maintains
diplomatic ties with both sides of the Taiwan Strait has indeed
seriously restricted the ROC's quest for greater "international
space" or higher international profile.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, she said, the ROC will continue forging cooperative
ties with as many countries as possible on an equal, reciprocal
basis.</P>
      <P>Chung further said she sees no contradiction in the ROC's quest
for better cross-Taiwan Strait relations and greater diplomatic
frontiers. "We will continue pushing for normalization of
cross-strait trade, economic and political relations and expanding
bilateral and multilateral international ties," she stressed, adding
that diplomacy is pivotal work for any sovereign state.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LATE ROC PRESIDENT'S SON TO ACKNOWLEDGE ANCESTORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  22  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>John Chang, an illegitimate son of late
Republic of China President Chiang Ching-kuo and a former
high-ranking ROC official, will visit his father's ancestral home on
Wednesday to acknowledge his relationship with the Chiang family.</P>
      <P>Chang, who was secretary-general to the president under Chiang's
successor -- former President Lee Teng-hui -- said that acknowledging
his blood ties was Chiang's dying wish as well as the will of the
three Chiang clan elders who wrote to him three years ago, urging him
to return.</P>
      <P>Chang is scheduled on Thursday to make an offering to the
ancestors of the Chiang clan at the clan shrine in Xikou Township,
Fenghua County, Zejiang Province, in mainland China.</P>
      <P>The late president never acknowledged Chang and Chang's late
brother Chang Hsiao-tzu as his sons and refrained from seeing them
except at open banquets. Even then, they had to keep their distance,
Chang said. It was not until a few years before Chiang's death that
Chang began to bring his father little gifts like ties and shavers,
always delivered through someone else, Chang added.</P>
      <P>He said that he began to make preparations for a trip to mainland
China after stepping down from office in March, and added that the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council has approved his travel plan
on humanitarian grounds.</P>
      <P>In addition to his wife and children, Chang's late brother's
widow and children will join him on the trip.</P>
      <P>Fang Chih-yi, the widow of Chiang Hsiao-yung, one of Chiang
Ching-kuo's three legitimate sons, recently said that if Chang is to
return to the Chiang family, he should first consult Madame Chiang
Kai-shek -- his grandmother -- who lives in New York, and Chiang
Ching-kuo's wife, who still lives in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, Chang said that he had requested to see Madame Chiang
four times, but nothing ever came of his requests. In the end, he
decided against trying to see them again, and asked for Fang's
understanding.</P>
      <P>After paying his respects at the Chiang ancestral shrines, Chang
said, he will be officially "back in the Chiang family."</P>
      <P>He will then travel to Ningpo and lunch with mainland-based
Taiwan businessmen on Friday. The next day, he is scheduled to
proceed to Shanghai, where he will lunch with Taiwan businessmen
there.</P>
      <P>The mainland office in charge of Taiwan affairs in Shanghai will
honor him at a dinner party on Saturday, and he will visit the
Shanghai home of the Kuomintang's founding father, Dr. Sun Yet-sen,
on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chang and his family will then proceed to Quilin, Kuangxi, where
he will offer incense at the tomb of his mother, Chang Ya-juo, on
Aug. 29.</P>
      <P>He is expected to return to Taiwan on Sept. 1.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang, Taiwan's ruling party until
May 20, said on Tuesday that it will return any illegally acquired
assets to the Republic of China's national coffers.</P>
      <P>Chang Tse-chen, director of the KMT's financial department, said
the party has completed an initial check of its assets. According to
Chang, the KMT's total assets are estimated at slightly more than
NT$79.9 billion (US$2.58 billion).</P>
      <P>Chang said the party assets include 14 houses and 100 land
parcels which were given to the KMT with the approval of township
councils during the party's 55-year rule.</P>
      <P>He said that although the presentation procedures fully complied
with existing laws and regulations, doubts have been cast as to the
justification for the gifts.</P>
      <P>"We will conduct a further study of the procedures regarding the
acquisition of each land lot and will then make a public explanation
after finalizing the study," Chang said, adding that if any of the
party assets in question are found to have been illegally acquired,
the KMT will not hesitate to return them to the government coffers.</P>
      <P>Chang said that all of the 114 properties in question were given
to the KMT between 1967 and 1981 when the government had not yet
enacted a local-level self-government law.</P>
      <P>According to an initial check carried out by the party, the KMT
owned 688 buildings and 927 pieces of land around the island, worth a
total of NT$8.83 billion.</P>
      <P>Although the KMT lost the March 18 presidential election, it
still controls a majority in the Legislative Yuan and is reputed to
be the world's wealthiest political party.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC BUSINESS EXECUTIVES MEET MAINLAND VICE PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Aug. 22 (CNA)
(By Chou Hui-ying and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen
said on Tuesday that from now on mainland law enforcement agencies
will be required to inform the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State
Council immediately after they arrest a Taiwan businessman.</P>
      <P>Qian made the statement while meeting with a delegation from
the Taiwan Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers Association
(TEEMA), headed by Richard Wu, also the association's president.</P>
      <P>Qian was quoted as having assured the TEEMA group that
mainland China's Taiwan Affairs Office will offer necessary
assistance to any detained Taiwan businessman and tries to
understand the truth concerning the incident.</P>
      <P>Qian, however, reportedly didn't respond to the TEEMA's proposal
that Beijing set up an ad hoc tribunal to settle trade disputes
involving Taiwan businessmen operating in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Wu told a group of Taiwan journalists on Monday that Beijing
authorities have agreed to establish a "business court for Taiwan,
Hong Kong and Macau," to adjudicate disputes between businessmen from
the three areas and their mainland Chinese trade partners.</P>
      <P>Although the proposed court will also hear disputes involving
businessmen from Hong Kong and Macau, Taiwan businessmen will be its
major users in light of their larger number, said Wu.</P>
      <P>Taiwan businessmen often complain that they cannot get fair
treatment at ordinary courts in mainland China because of the rampant
regionalism and protectionism. In order to address the problem, the
TEEMA has lobbied Beijing for years to set up a special tribunal to
hear such cases, said Wu.</P>
      <P>As Qian kept mum on the "tribunal" proposal, it became
unclear whether Beijing would set up a special business court for
Taiwan business people.</P>
      <P>During Tuesday's meeting, the TEEMA group also exchanged views
with Qian on the opening of direct "three links" -- trade, mail and
transportation -- across the Taiwan Strait, physical safety of Taiwan
business people on the mainland and the opening of the mainland door
for Taiwan banks to set up footholds on the mainland.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, Qian stressed that mainland China hopes the
opening of direct cross-strait three links should be simplified.
Qian was also quoted as having blamed Taiwan for hindering an early
opening of direct "three links."</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan's plan to allow its banks to set up
representative offices on the mainland, Qian said mainland China
welcomes such an opening plan. Qian reportedly said mainland China
would lower its requirements for Taiwan banks to open branches on
the mainland and that it hopes Taiwan banks can be allowed to
make a "landing" on he mainland before Beijing is admitted to
the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is planning to allow its banks to make inroads into the
mainland market in a gradual, phased manner.</P>

      <P>About 80,000 mainland Chinese people are in
Taiwan at any given moment, a situation that challenges the Republic
of China's security fabric, sources from the National Security Bureau
(NSB) said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>After attending an inter-section meeting at the NSB headquarters
on national security, Premier Tang Fei stressed that there is a
critical need for a new, more efficient national security system.</P>
      <P>According to Ting Yu-chou, director of the NSB, which is the top
government agency in charge of information and intelligence gathering
and assessment, cross-Taiwan Strait relations have remained static
for the last three months.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he added, Beijing has "hastened the speed of
drawing in the net that it has cast toward Taiwan," using every
possible means and scheme to suppress Taiwan in the international
community.</P>
      <P>Ting seconded Tang's statement that the creation of a
comprehensive national security mechanism is urgently needed in light
of increasing cross-strait exchanges and the increasing number of
mainland people who visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He added that about 30,000 mainland people are currently living
in Taiwan as residents, while 50,000 others make short term visits as
invited visitors or relatives of Taiwan citizens.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said, the number of mainland stowaways or illegal
immigrants from mainland China has been significantly reduced

reconstruction scandal involving Chungliao Township Chief Wu

Wu's villa on Monday and discovered two truckloads of relief
materials donated for victims of last September's devastating

      <P>Republic of China
President Chen Shui-bian on Tuesday visited a model farm founded with
assistance from an ROC agricultural mission and attended a
ribbon-cutting ceremony for a cooperative agricultural project.</P>
      <P>Chen arrived in the Burkina Faso capital of Ouagadougou from
neighboring Gambia on Monday at the head of an entourage of
government officials, businessmen, and journalists for a three-day
visit to the West African ROC ally.</P>
      <P>Villagers dancing to traditional music welcomed Chen to the model
farm and presented him with two goats, two chickens and a
broad-brimmed rain hat, which Chen -- the son of a farmer -- promptly
donned. He then grabbed the two chickens and posed with the farmers
for photographs.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore, who has
visited Taiwan three times, Chen planted a tree at the village to
signify the never-ending cooperation between Burkina Faso and the
ROC. They then moved on to an agricultural development zone to

hectares of land under rice cultivation, to bring Burkina Faso's
annual rice production up to 24,000 metric tons within five years, he
added.</P>
      <P>Under the project, Taiwan will also assist in the development of
Burkina Faso's water conservancy facilities, agricultural technology,
production, marketing, and farmer's organizations so that the newly
developed farms can continue to run by themselves.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's agricultural missions began assisting Burkina Faso in
1994 and has already completed the development of 1,000 hectares of
rice paddies.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, Chen is scheduled to inspect a bilateral
cooperative program aimed at upgrading the status of women in Burkina
Faso and deliver a speech to the Burkina Faso parliament. He will
also sign a joint communique and give a joint press conference with
Compaore before his departure for Chad to continue his six-state
"journey of friendship" to cement the ROC's diplomatic relations with
its allies.</P>
      <P>Chen had visited the Caribbean nation of the Dominican Republic,
Nicaragua and Costa Rica in Central America, and the Gambia before
coming to Burkina Faso. This is Chen's first overseas trip since
taking office on May 20.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan met with
National Police Administration (NPA) Director-General Wang Chin-wang
on Wednesday to seek police help for nabbing four prisoners who
escaped from a jail in the eastern county of Taitung at midnight.</P>
      <P>During their brief meeting, Chen asked Wang to mobilize police
forces in Taitung County to work together with the prosecution and
investigation authorities to bring to justice the four escapees.</P>
      <P>The four prisoners, identified as Chen Yung-chung, Chiu
Chin-lien, Mao Tsai-pao and Chen Chun-nan, cashed in on the chaos
caused by typhoon Bilis to break out of their cells in the Taiyuan
Prison in the county's Tungho village.</P>
      <P>The Taiyuan Prison provides vocational skill training for its
inmates. Prisoners at other jails can apply to serve prison terms at
Taiyuan if they have good behavior records.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Ministry of Justice has not yet received a detailed
report about the breakout incident. The minister said he plans to
travel to Taitung to inspect the jail in the near future.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Taitung district prosecutor's office is
investigating whether any Taiyuan jail administrators should be held
responsible for the incident.</P>
      <P>Taiyuan administrators said the four escapees, all convicted of
serious crimes, escaped from their cells by destroying a wall. But
many details, including the mastermind of the escape, remain
unknown.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Bilis, the strongest to hit Asia this year, left a trail
of destruction in its wake, killing at least two people. Taitung
bore the brunt of the typhoon's torrential rains and ferocious winds
when it battered the island at around 10:30 p.m. on Tuesday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian telephoned Chief
of the General Staff Tang Yao-ming on Wednesday expressing his
concern about military assistance in relief work after a strong
typhoon hit Taiwan overnight.</P>
      <P>Military spokesman Kung Fan-ding said the president's phone call
from the West African country of Burkina Faso reached Tang's office
at 8:50 a.m.</P>
      <P>President Chen was quoted as having ordered all military units
to do their utmost to assist local-level governments in
post-typhoon relief and rehabilitation work.</P>
      <P>According to Kung, Tang had briefed Chen on the military's
participation in emergency rescue and relief operations since
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Before typhoon Bilis battered the island, the military
already formed a special task force aimed at helping minimizing
possible typhoon damage.</P>
      <P>"Tang has told President Chen that all military servicemen
have suspended vacation leave and are awaiting distress calls in the
barracks," Kung said, adding that so long as any local government
agencies apply for assistance, military units stationed in the area
tend to actively join in rescue and rehabilitation missions.</P>
      <P>As of 11 a.m. Wednesday, Kung said, the military had dispatched
63 servicemen, one ship and seven vehicles to assist in relief work.</P>
      <P>Thanks to well-organized precautionary measures, initial
tallies show that typhoon casualties were not very serious.</P>
      <P>President Chen is currently on a six-state "journey" of
friendship aimed at bolstering the Republic of China's relations
with its allies. He is scheduled to wrap up his visit to Burkina
Faso, the fifth leg of his trip, and travel to Chad on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen had visited the Caribbean nation of the Dominican Republic,

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO PRUDENTLY CONSIDER MAINLAND'S BRANCH OFFICE OFFER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government will
prudently consider mainland China's reported offer of allowing Taiwan
banks to directly open branches on the mainland without going through
the regular three-year waiting period, said Vice Finance Minister
Sean C. Chen on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Describing mainland China's reported offer to allow Taiwan banks
to bypass the process of first having to establish a liaison or
representative office for three years as a goodwill gesture, Chen
said Taiwan will exercise care and thought in considering it.</P>
      <P>Sources from the mainland quoted Li Ruoku, assistant to the
president of the People's Bank of China, as having said recently that
before mainland China is formally admitted into the World Trade
Organization, the mainland financial authorities will consider
skipping the three-year requirement as long as Taiwan banks file
applications.</P>
      <P>The ROC's Chairman of the Bureau of Monetary Affairs, Wang
Yao-hsing, said he does not think Li's remarks, even if officially
confirmed, are true. "It's impossible, at least not for now," he
said.</P>
      <P>Earlier this week, Ministry of Finance (MOF) officials held a
meeting to discuss matters pertaining to liberalizing regulations to
allow for the gradual opening of branches of Taiwan banks on the
mainland.</P>
      <P>After assessing the issues of risk management, financial
monitoring and regulations, as well as related legal issues, the MOF
may allow local banks to branch out to the mainland in the near
future, beginning with the establishment of representative offices,
said the MOF.</P>
      <P>Yen Ching-chang, another vice finance minister, said Tuesday that
the ROC will consider the feasibility of allowing mainland Chinese
banks to set up representative or liaison offices in Taiwan and also
the gradual establishment of local bank branches on the mainland in
line with the principles of fairness and parity.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HK ELITES BIGGEST THREAT TO TERRITORY'S DEMOCRACY: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  23  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong's political elites are the
principal threat to autonomy and democracy in the PRC special
administrative region under their jurisdiction, said an American
expert on Asian affairs.</P>
      <P>Eric Bjornlund, senior associate at the Washington-based National
Democratic Institute for International Affairs, wrote in this
summer's issue of Hong Kong Update that until popular and
international pressure force those elites to respect the pledges
already made to Hong Kong as a whole, "the promise of full democracy
in Hong Kong will remain unfulfilled."</P>
      <P>Since its reversion to Communist Chinese sovereignty on July 1,
1997, "Hong Kong's commitment to democracy and fundamental rights has
remained suspect," he wrote in the quarterly published by the Center
for Strategic and International Studies.</P>
      <P>While the Beijing regime has largely refrained from interfering
with Hong Kong's autonomy and way of life, Hong Kong authorities and
elites have themselves manipulated democratic institutions and
undermined the autonomy of the judiciary, pointed out Bjornlund, who
is also the Asia director of the National Democratic Institute for
International Affairs.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, the Hong Kong government has changed the
system of electing representatives to the Legislative Council, added
appointed members to district councils, dissolved elected municipal
councils, and invited Beijing's reversal of Hong Kong court
decisions.</P>
      <P>Most troubling, Bjornlund noted, while the Hong Kong Basic Law
established a 10-year transition toward democracy, Hong Kong
officials have specifically refused to commit to full democracy at
the end of that period.</P>
      <P>Chief Executive C.H. Tung and other Hong Kong government
officials have argued against amending the Basic Law to accelerate
the transition to full democracy. But more ominously, notwithstanding
the Basic Law's goal of universal suffrage, Tung has refused to
accept that fully democratic elections should be held at the end of
the 10-year transition period.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong's autonomy is also a fundamental part of its democracy.
noted Bjornlund, adding that the negotiated compromises that led to
Hong Kong's reversion promised the territory autonomy as a kind of
protection for the freedoms that its citizens enjoyed.</P>
      <P>This autonomy was to include a judiciary independent not only of
executive or legislative interference, but also of interference from
Beijing. "But the constitutional arrangements cannot provide
democracy if the Hong Kong government itself invites such
interference," he emphasized.</P>
      <P>"In short, the main impediment to autonomy and democratization in
Hong Kong has been the authorities and elites in the territory
itself," he concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING SHOULD NOT CURTAIL FREEDOM IN HONG KONG: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug. 23 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing should realize that curtailing
Hong Kong's rights and freedoms in order to punish advocates of
Taiwan independence is unlikely to make the concept of `one country,
two systems' attractive to Taiwan, commented Frank Ching, senior
editor of the Far Eastern Economic Review, in this summer's issue of
Hong Kong Update.</P>
      <P>Ching wrote in the quarterly published by the Washington-based
Center for Strategic and International Studies that up to April this
year, reports by the British Foreign Office, the US Department of
State, and the European Union have all been generous in their praise
of Communist China for demonstrating restraint in its handling of
Hong Kong, adding that things have been going so well that the world
is no longer focusing much attention on Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>"But there are disturbing signs that, just as the world is
letting down its guard, the situation in Hong Kong may be
deteriorating. Chinese officials are demonstrating a tendency to put
the mainland's political interests ahead of those of the Special
Administrative Region (SAR), and two recent incidents illustrate this
emerging tendency," said the former Wall Street Journal correspondent
in Beijing.</P>
      <P>The first incident of Communist Chinese interference occurred in
April when Wang Fengchao, a deputy director of Beijing's Liaison
Office in Hong Kong, told the local media that it could not treat
news about Taiwan as just ordinary news, saying it had to be handled
with a special sensitivity.</P>
      <P>Wang's comments were apparently the Beijing government's response
to Hong Kong media actions, and not his personal views, pointed out
Ching. The day after Wang's remarks, the Communist press in Hong Kong
and the spokesmen for the PRC Foreign Ministry as well as the Hong
Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the State Council echoed his
position.</P>
      <P>He said Wang's remarks are very troubling because they go beyond
what any Communist Chinese official has previously said concerning
freedom of the press in Hong Kong. But Wang had also made it clear in
his comments that Beijing expects the situation to be resolved when
the Hong Kong SAR introduces legislation to implement Article 23 of
the Basic Law, making it a crime for anyone to advocate Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>"If such legislation does pass, however, the SAR government will
certainly lose much credibility in the public's eyes, and Hong Kong's
relations with the central government will be badly strained," wrote
Ching.</P>
      <P>The second incident Ching pointed to occurred in May when He
Zhiming, another official of the Liaison Office, issued a
not-so-veiled warning to Hong Kong businessmen not to trade with
Taiwan businessmen who advocate independence.</P>
      <P>It appears his remarks were not a reflection of pressure from
Beijing due to the fact that Mr. He was not supported by the
Communist press or by spokesmen for the Beijing regime, "but it is
evident that his words represent the unspoken views of central
government officials who wish to see advocates of Taiwan independence
punished," wrote Ching.</P>
      <P>He stressed it is significant that both incidents of interference
relate to the issue of Taiwan. The policy of "one country, two
systems" was adopted with Taiwan in mind and applied to Hong Kong
with a vision to making the SAR a model for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But Beijing should realize that curtailing Hong Kong's rights and
freedoms in order to punish pro-independence advocates is unlikely to
make the concept of "one country, two systems" attractive to Taiwan,
noted Ching.</P>
      <P>These recent incidents show that while Beijing exercised
self-restraint in the early years of the Hong Kong SAR, "now is not
the time to be satisfied, or believe that all is well with Hong Kong.
The monitoring of Hong Kong affairs by the US and other governments
should continue, especially since China has shown a tendency in
recent months to flex its muscles in Hong Kong with little regard for
its promises of noninterference," concluded Ching.</P>

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The University of Chicago's space dust
instrument (SPADUS) has detected a cloud of tiny debris particles
that was scattered into space when the upper stage of a Chinese Long
March 4 rocket unexpectedly exploded March 11 after five months in
orbit.</P>
      <P>The US Space Command detected the explosion immediately, but the
Chicago finding marked the first time that scientists have been able
to link ultra-small particles to the break-up of a particular
satellite, said Nicholas Johnson, chief scientist for orbital debris
at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The largest of the particles are barely large enough to be seen
with the naked eye. The particles, although tiny, race around the
earth at a speed 19 times faster than a speeding bullet, fast enough
to scratch a space shuttle window on impact or cause potential
problems during a space walk.</P>
      <P>"For example, if we think there's a chance of the space station
going through one of these very small particle clouds, we may decide
to postpone a space walk," Johnson added.</P>
      <P>The smaller particles also pose a minor but continuous threat to
orbiting satellites, said Anthony Tuzzolino, the University of
Chicago scientist who heads the SPADUS project.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER TANG INSPECTS TYPHOON-HIT EASTERN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hualien,   Taiwan,  Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei made an
inspection tour of the eastern Taiwan county of Hualien Thursday to
signify his concern about damage caused by a devastating typhoon
which ripped through the island Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Premier Tang first inspected a pomelo orchard in Hualien's Juisui
township. Tang assured the owner of the orchard that the government
will offer NT$30,000 (US$967.74) in subsidy for each hectare of land
for damage to the fruit grown in the orchard in accordance
with current regulations.</P>
      <P>Tang also ordered relevant agricultural administration
agencies to help promote sales of mature fruits swept down by the
storm.</P>
      <P>Later on, Tang inspected a run-down breakwater in neighboring
township of Yuli. The breakwater, built during the Japanese colonial
rule of Taiwan, needs renovation. Tang directed relevant government
agencies to take immediate steps to repair and reinforce the
breakwater to protect the Yuli coast from the force of ocean waves.</P>
      <P>Tang also toured another typhoon-hit Hualien township of
Fuli to see for himself the typhoon damage to the area.</P>
      <P>After the inspection tour, Tang declared Hualien as a disaster
zone which will receive priority central government assistance
in rehabilitation work.</P>
      <P>Tang also directed that power supply to the three hardest-hit
Hualien townships -- Juisui, Yuli and Fuli -- should be fully
resumed by Friday noon.</P>
      <P>Tang further said the government will subsidize Hualien county
farmers who saw their farms flooded in the wake of the storm. The
government will offer NT$100,000 in subsidy for each hectare of
affected farmland, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tang said he will direct the Cabinet to study the
feasibility of offering financial subsidy to the people whose houses
were partially or fully destroyed by the typhoon. In the past, the
government didn't offer subsidies for this kind of typhoon victims.</P>
      <P>Tang was accompanied by several central and local government
officials, including Interior Minister Chang Po-ya, on the
inspection tour.</P>
      <P>Tang and his entourage visited neighboring Taitung County in the
afternoon. Taitung County bore the brunt of the storm.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Bilis, the strongest to hit Asia so far this year, swept
over Taiwan from Tuesday evening through Wednesday, leaving at least
11 people dead, five missing and 108 others injured. According to
initial tallies, the storm also left 309 houses completely destroyed
and 1,499 houses partially collapsed.</P>
      <P>The storm has also prompted President Chen Shui-bian to cut
short his current six-state "journey of friendship" aimed at
bolstering the Republic of China's diplomatic relations with its
allies.</P>
      <P>Acting Secretary-General to the President Chen Che-nan said
President Chen is scheduled to return to Taiwan at 3:00 p.m. Friday.
The president will directly take a flight from Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport to the central county of Nantou where
eight people were buried alive by mudslides caused by
typhoon Bilis.</P>
      <P>Chen Che-nan said President Chen is also scheduled to make an
inspection tour of the eastern counties of Hualien and Taitung on
Saturday.</P>
      <P>President Chen, who is currently in the African state of Chad,
was originally scheduled to return from his first
post-inauguration overseas visit on Saturday. He decided to return
ahead of the schedule after the typhoon, the most powerful to hit
the island in 40 years, wreaked havoc in Taiwan.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's stock prices closed 0.2 percent
lower Thursday due mainly to a weakening of large-cap blue chips in
the traditional industry sector.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Stock Exchange (Taiex) weighted price index, the
market's key barometer, lost 19.21 points to close at 8,098.84, on
turnover of NT$80.93 billion (US$2.61 billion).</P>
      <P>The Taiex opened higher on Wall Street's overnight rally, but
selling pressure quickly emerged as the index approached the
psychologically important barrier of 8,200 points and wiped off
earlier gains.</P>
      <P>Market analysts said the index is not expected to breach the
8,200 level in the near term without fresh leads.</P>
      <P>Thanks to good market prospects, semiconductor and electronics
stocks remained strong amid active buying during the three-hour
trading session.</P>
      <P>A total of 1.45 billion shares changed hands, marking a modest
increase from Tuesday's trading volume. The market was closed
Wednesday as typhoon Bilis swept over the island.</P>
      <P>The price indexes for the eight major categories closed mixed,
with electrical and electronics issues registering a 0.6 percent
gain; cement issues, down 2.2 percent; plastics, down 2.8 percent;
textiles, down 2.4 percent; construction, down 2.7 percent; financial
and banking stocks, down 0.8 percent; foodstuff, down 2 percent; and
pulp and paper, down 1.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Losers outnumbered gainers, 382 to 127, with 73 stocks remaining
unchanged.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO NEED FOR MEETING WITH PRESIDENT, SAYS KMT CHAIR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lien Chan, chairman of the opposition
Kuomintang, said on Thursday that there is no need for him to meet
with President Chen Shui-bian for a talk.</P>
      <P>"I don't even know what the necessity for the talk is," Lien, who
is also former vice president of the Republic of China, was quoted by
local media as saying.</P>
      <P>"If it were necessary, I'd be willing to meet with Chen," he
reportedly added.</P>
      <P>Reacting to Lien's remarks, acting Secretary-General to the
President Chen Che-nan said that President Chen, who is currently on
an overseas trip but will return ahead of schedule due to the
emergency situation at home in the wake of Typhoon Bilis, will
continue to demonstrate his sincerity in trying to meet with Lien in
the near future.</P>
      <P>The Chen-Lien meeting, proposed by President Chen in his July 31
press conference, is considered a preliminary rendezvous leading to a
cross-party roundtable meeting of the heads of Taiwan's three major
political parties.</P>
      <P>President Chen had earlier said that he wanted the roundtable
meeting to take place in August, but plans were shelved as the party
leaders called for preliminary meetings to set up details for the
roundtable meeting, as well as because of scheduling difficulties
brought about by the president, KMT Chairman, and opposition People
First Party Chairman James Soong all leaving Taiwan on overseas
trips.</P>
      <P>When acting Presidential Secretary-General Chen Che-nan said on
Monday that the proposed Chen-Lien talk is expected to be held in the
first week of September, KMT Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng showed
his explicit displeasure. Reports said that Lin telephoned Chen
Che-nan the same day and scathingly asked Chen why he had made a
declaration on a matter that was as yet far from decided.</P>
      <P>Whether Lien's Thursday remarks signaled the death of plans for
the Chen-Lien meeting or the cross-party roundtable meeting remains
to be seen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXPERT SEES CHINA STRENGTHENING ITS CURRENCY AFTER WTO ENTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is likely to strengthen
its currency rather than letting it weaken after it joins the World
Trade Organization (WTO), according to former Australian ambassador
to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Ross Garnaut, who headed the Australian Embassy in China from
1985 to 1988 and is now an economics professor at the Research School
of Pacific and Asian Studies at Australian National University in
Canberra, said China's currency was more likely to appreciate than
depreciate, due to systematic changes within its financial system to
occur over the first few years after it joins WTO.</P>
      <P>His forecast that the Chinese yuan will appreciate is in striking
contrast with Chris Nailer, a Singapore-based forecaster, who said
earlier that China would devalue its currency by about 20 percent in
two stages during 2003 and 2004, as its current account balance is
seen as turning negative in 2003.</P>
      <P>He said China's imports would grow faster than its exports after
the impact of the WTO membership began to take effect in 2002.</P>
      <P>The Australian on Thursday quoted Garnaut as saying that China
had emerged from the Asian financial crisis more confident about its
role in the global and regional economies, and with greater standing
among its neighbors.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS FACING HEADACHES FROM FOREIGN ATHLETES' LUGGAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  12  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian customs officers are facing
new headaches every day, as more and more foreign athletes enter
Sydney with luggage containing banned items, including weapons and
raw meat.</P>
      <P>A customs spokesman told reporters that officers had to detain
Russian rowers who entered Australia carrying dozens of kilograms of
raw meat, as well as a Japanese shooter who failed to declare his
pistols as dangerous items. The officers have also had to deal with
yachts, kayaks and canoes that arrived as normal luggage instead of
cargo.</P>
      <P>He said Russian and Japanese athletes were simply not familiar
with Australia's border controls.</P>
      <P>"There (have) been a few headaches, let's just say that," he
added.</P>
      <P>The officers are also facing paperwork for a large number of
crates containing tons of medicines for each team. In addition, they
have to make special checks on each of the 237 horses brought in for
the equestrian events.</P>
      <P>Another 200 special chemicals and biological weapons-proof suits
that were sent from the United States to supply Sydney's
anti-terrorism police may face tax and import duties.</P>
      <P>Above all, customs officers have to do their best to explain
Australia's rules and regulations to athletes before they arrive. But
some mishaps have been unavoidable, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Altogether, more than 10,000 athletes from over 100 countries are
due to arrive from August to early September to compete in the
Olympic Games, the spokesman said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MUSICIAN ENCHANTS AUSSIE AUDIENCE WITH SUPERB TECHNIQUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, Aug. 24 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>World-renowned violinist Lin Cho-liang on
Wednesday enchanted an audience of about 700 Australians in Canberra
with his technical mastery and interpretive skills, as he performed
pieces by Mendelssohn and Mozart under the baton of a most
experienced and dynamic conductor, Sergiu Comissiona.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by the 104-member Asian Youth Orchestra, Lin drew an
enthusiastic 10-minute ovation from the audience in the Canberra
School of Music's Llewellyn Hall.</P>
      <P>It was a warm-up performance for Lin, who will play a show on
Friday at the Opera House in Sydney. It was also the first
performance for the Taiwan-born violinist at the Olympic Arts
Festival, part of the celebration leading to the Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>Lin said he has made nearly 2,000 performances worldwide in the
past 20 years, but this was the first time he was invited to perform
at the Olympic Arts Festival.</P>
      <P>"I feel very honored and pleased to have the chance of playing at
the Olympic Arts Festival," he told CNA in an interview after the
concert on Wednesday night.</P>
      <P>Founded 12 years ago and based in Hong Kong, the Asian Youth
Orchestra comprises 104 young musicians from 12 countries, including
21 from Japan, 20 from Taiwan, 19 from South Korea, 13 from Hong Kong
and five from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lin said he plans to return to New York after his performance at
the festival to prepare for other concerts in the United States later
this year and more concerts in Australia next year.</P>
      <P>The 40-year-old Lin is going to become a first-time father in
January 2001. He has been married for about five years, and his wife,
now working as a medical doctor in a New York hospital, hails from
Meinung in Pingtung.</P>
      <P>The couple met in 1993 when Lin was staging a solo performance in
Atlanta, and his current wife helped him turn the page during his
performance.</P>
      <P>"It was just a fateful coincidence when I met my present wife
because she replaced her sick friend to do the job for me," Lin said.
The pair dated each other for a couple of years, and got married five
years ago.</P>
      <P>"I have been very busy traveling to many countries in the past
five years, and feel very excited because I am going to be a father
for the first time," he said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Typhoon Bilis, which killed at least 11
people and injured several dozens of others when it roared across
Taiwan on Tuesday and Wednesday, also wreaked damage of more than
NT$3.7 billion (US$119 million) to the island's agricultural sector,
the Council of Agriculture (COA) reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the latest COA tally, agricultural damages from the
latest typhoon had reached NT$3.754 billion as of noon Thursday, with
the eastern counties of Taitung and Hualien bearing the brunt of the
destruction.</P>
      <P>Losses due to damaged agricultural produce or crop-bearing plants
have hit NT$3.662 billion, losses due to flooded or washed-away farm
lands have reached NT$29 million, and livestock and animal husbandry
damage have topped some NT$62 million, COA officials said.</P>
      <P>Agricultural damage reports from Taitung and Hualien Counties
have both reached NT$1 billion. Similar losses in Taichung County
exceed NT$700 million, followed by Nantou County's NT$456 million,
and Kaohsiung County's NT$212 million.</P>
      <P>Farmers and planters of the five hardest-hit counties are now
eligible to apply for relief aid and low-interest loans to help them
get back on their feet, COA officials said.</P>
      <P>Agricultural crops that bore the full brunt of Typhoon Bilis
included pears, litchis, pomelos, bananas, papayas, watermelons and
sugar cane, they noted.</P>
      <P>Bilis, the strongest storm in the West Pacific this year, wreaked

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE PRESIDENT SAYS CHEN ASKED HIM TO CHAIR NUC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Aug.  23  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu &amp; Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wang Jin-pyng, president of the
Legislative Yuan of the Republic of China, broke his silence
Wednesday to confirm that President Chen Shui-bian has asked him
several times to chair the National Unification Council.</P>
      <P>Wang said that in addition to turning down Chen's offer, he
suggested that Chen himself serve as NUC chairman.</P>
      <P>He also told the president that the NUC should operate according
to the established political system as this is what the great
majority of Taiwan's populace expects.</P>
      <P>Wang made these remarks at an airport press conference in San
Francisco held upon his arrival here. Wang will attend the 23rd
Annual Convention of the Benevolent Associations of Taiwanese in
America scheduled to be held in the Bay City on Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, Chen said that the non-partisan ad hoc
committee on cross-strait relations headed by Academia Sinica
President Lee Yuan-tseh is an advisory group, while the National
Unification Council is an institute that integrates the opinions of
local political party leaders so as to help the nation implement the
mission of national reunification.</P>
      <P>He has also consulted with Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and
other senior KMT officials on Chen's proposal, Wang said. "We reached
a conclusion that the NUC should be chaired by the nation's
president, and we (the KMT) will render our assistance," he added.</P>
      <P>Wang stressed that he disagreed with Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) proposals that the NUC be suspended, but said that he agrees
that the contents of the NUC could be adapted to changing situations
in cross-strait relations if it is necessary.</P>
      <P>Chen, a DPP member, is seen as reluctant to serve as NUC chairman
due to internal conflicts such a position would cause within his
political party. The DPP advocates Taiwan independence, while the
purpose of the NUC is the island's unification with mainland China.</P>
      <P>At the airport to greet Wang upon his arrival included Tsao
Tung-po, deputy director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office
in San Francisco, Hung Tu, former national assemblyman, and others.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN ARRIVES IN CHAD TO GRAND WELCOME</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>N'Djamena,  Chad,  Aug. 23 (CNA)
(By Y.Y. Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian arrived in the central African country of Chad
Wednesday for a whirlwind overnight state visit.</P>
      <P>With the understanding of the Chadian government, President Chen
has decided to cut short his visit to Chad, the last leg of his
six-state "journey of friendship," as a strong typhoon just wreaked
havoc in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chadian President Idriss Deby presided over a grand welcoming
ceremony, complete with a 21-gun salute, to greet Chen upon his
arrival at the N'Djamena international airport.</P>
      <P>The express its gratitude for the ROC's assistance, the Chadian
government pooled its resources to welcome Chen, the second
non-African leader to visit Chad after the late French President
Charles de Gaulle. Chad used to be a French colony.</P>
      <P>The Chadian people were given a half-day off to facilitate
participation in welcoming activities. A large crowd of N'Djamena
residents turned out to greet Chen. They made long lines along the
road linking the airport to Deby's official residence where
President Chen would stay during his overnight visit.</P>
      <P>After listening to ROC Ambassador to Chad Chiu Chung-jen's
briefing on the current state of bilateral relations, President
Chen paid a visit to his Chadian counterpart at Deby's office.</P>
      <P>During their talks, Deby reaffirmed his country's staunch
support for the ROC's bid to join the United Nations and other major
international bodies.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Deby decorated Chen with the Order of Grand
Cross, Chad's highest national honor, in appreciation of
Chen's efforts to promote ROC-Chadian relations.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a state banquet in honor of Chen, Deby said Chad
sincerely welcomes Chen's visit. He further said the ROC has offered
wide-ranging assistance to Chad since the two countries resumed
diplomatic ties slightly more than three years ago. As most of the
ROC aid programs are highly effective in helping boost Chad's
national development, Deby said the Chadian people have longed
awaited the top ROC leader's visit.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chen said the ROC is more than willing to share
its developmental experience with Chad and other allies. As a member
of the international community, Chen said, the ROC takes pleasure in
helping other countries because it once received assistance from the
United States in the process of its development.</P>
      <P>Noting that both the ROC and Chad have limited natural
resources, Chen said the two countries should cooperate to create
"infinite possibilities."</P>
      <P>In a briefing on current ROC-Chadian relations shortly after
Chen's arrival, Ambassador Chiu told Chen that the ROC's three-year
assistance to Chad is very fruitful. Chiu said he is the most
popular ambassador in Chad and the first foreign envoy to be
decorated by the Chadian government during active service. Nowadays,
Chiu said, all Chadian officials and ordinary people are
aware of Taiwan. "They all know that the ROC's head of state i
coming for visit," he added.</P>
      <P>The Chadian government began to broadcast programs introducing
the ROC on its television channels a week before Chen's arrival.
Chad's state-owned TV company also gave a live broadcast of the state
banquet in honor of Chen.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, Chen will hold a breakfast meeting with the
eight ROC ambassadors stationed in Africa, including Chiu. In
addition to Chad, the ROC has seven other diplomatic allies in
Africa -- Burkina Faso, the Gambia, Liberia, Malawi, Sao Tome
and Principe, Senegal and Swaziland.</P>
      <P>Chen will also visit the construction site of a
Taiwan-financed bridge and attend a highway christening ceremony on
Thursday. The new road will be named the "Chen Shui-bian Boulevard"
in honor of Chen.</P>
      <P>The ROC president is scheduled to wrap up his Chad visit after
issuing a joint communique and giving a joint press conference with
Deby around Thursday noon.</P>
      <P>Chen and his entourage of government officials, businessmen and
journalists will return to Taiwan Friday afternoon after a brief
transit stop in Dubay.</P>
      <P>This is Chen's first overseas trip since taking office on May
20. He had visited the Caribbean nation of the Dominican Republic,
Nicaragua and Costa Rica in Central America, the West African states
of the Gambia and Burkina Faso before coming to Chad.</P>
      <P>After his return, Chen will immediately take a flight from
Chaing Kai-shek International Airport to the central Taiwan county
of Nantou where eight people were buried alive by landslides caused
by Typhoon Bilis.</P>

    <HEADLINE>UNEMPLOYMENT HIGHER, BUT JOB PICTURE HEALTHY: DGBAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Alice Liang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the fact that the Republic of
China's unemployment rate hit 3.06 percent in July this year, the
employment environment is taking a turn for the better, the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said
on Thursday.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials said the average monthly jobless rate from
January to July was 2.85 percent, slightly higher than a forecasted
2.8 percent. However, the DGBAS said that the average unemployment
rate for the entire year will not exceed 2.8 percent.</P>
      <P>Even if more people are losing their jobs, DGBAS officials said
that Taiwan's unemployed are finding new jobs more quickly. The
average of period for a successful job search shortened in July to
22.3 weeks, down 1.2 weeks from the same figure in June and
indicating a brighter employment environment, the officials said.</P>
      <P>According to the DGBAS sources, there were 9.81 million workers
in Taiwan's labor pool in July, an increase of 43,000 on the same
figure for June; while the number of employed workers hit 9.51
million, some 26,000 higher than the previous month. That left some
300,000 people out of work in July, an increase of 17,000 from the
same figure in June, said the DGBAS.</P>
      <P>According to the DGBAS, workers from 15 to 24 years of age were
most likely to be unemployed, as that age group suffered a jobless
rate of 8.24 percent. Meanwhile, 25- to 49-year-olds fared better,
with an unemployment rate of 2.48 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT TO INSPECT REGIONS AFFECTED BY BILIS AFTER RETURN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>N'Djamena,  Chad,  Aug. 24 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian will head directly to regions hardest-hit by Typhoon Bilis
after he makes an earlier-than-expected return from his six-state
overseas trip on Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen, currently in Chad on the sixth and last stop of his
"journey of friendship" to ROC allies in the Caribbean, Central
America, and West Africa, had been originally scheduled to return on
Saturday.</P>
      <P>However, Chen decided to move up his return because of heavy
damage caused to Taiwan by the strongest typhoon to hit the island
this year.</P>
      <P>Bilis roared across Taiwan Tuesday night, leaving heavy
casualties, damaged farmlands and mammoth crop losses in its wake.</P>
      <P>After his return, Chen will head directly to Nantou, central
Taiwan, which was also hard-hit by last September's devastating
earthquake, to inspect the storm's damage on temporary housing units
still occupied by victims of the temblor.</P>
      <P>Chen was severely criticized during his term as Taipei's mayor
for failing to return immediately from a vacation in Hawaii after a
typhoon struck Taiwan. On this trip, Chen kept in close contact with
Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Tang, and other high-ranking
officials, and finally decided to return ahead of schedule.</P>
      <P>Before traveling to Chad, Chen had visited the Caribbean nation
of the Dominican Republic, the Central American countries of
Nicaragua and Costa Rica, and Gambia and Burkina Faso, both also in
West Africa. It is his first official overseas trip since assuming
the presidency May 20.</P>
      <P>During the visit to Burkina Faso Aug. 23, Chen decided to return
home one day ahead of schedule, and also canceled a press conference
that had been scheduled for Saturday morning.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY MIGRATES TO MAINLAND CHINA (1)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's electronics industry began to
shift its labor-intensive production lines to mainland China more
than 10 years ago due to rising costs at home. With operational
centers in Taiwan and production lines in mainland China, the move
has set a profit-proven business model.</P>
      <P>Impressed by the business model set by the downstream assemblers
and manufacturers of computer peripherals, upstream chip
manufacturers, which are still subject to government restraints
regarding investment in mainland China, are quietly deploying across
the strait.</P>
      <P>Monitors and scanner manufacturers were among the first to move
their production lines to the mainland when international competition
became more and more severe and profit margins were cut further and
further. Quite a few manufacturers have boosted the production
capacities of their mainland factories while folding up their
production lines in Taiwan altogether.</P>
      <P>For medium- and low-level scanner manufacturers, mainland China
is not only ideal as a production site, it is also a market of
tremendous potential. Microtek International, for instance, with a
manufacturing center in Jiangsu Province and 150 sales outlets all
over the mainland, has already grossed 40 percent of mainland China's
market for medium- and low-level scanners.</P>
      <P>Plastic circuit board (PCB) manufacturing is a booming
electronics sector in mainland China, thanks to investment from
Taiwan as well as multi-national corporations. Facing rising
production costs and mounting resistance from local
environmentalists, PCB manufacturers have found that migration to the
mainland is the only option to maintain their competitive edge. Now,
the mainland is the world's fourth-largest PCB supplier, next only to
the United States, Japan and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The booming PCB sector in mainland China has inspired Taiwan's
materials and plastics industries to explore the tremendous market
there. Elite Material is boosting the production of its Kunshan plant
in Jiangsu, while Nan Ya Plastics, a subsidiary of the Formosa
Plastics Group, will invest US$75 million to build new plants in
Jiangsu Province that will begin production in 2002.</P>
      <P>Like the PCB sector, Taiwanese desk-top computers are largely
produced by Taiwan-owned factories in the mainland. Statistics
compiled by the Institute of Information Industry (III) show that in
the first half of this year, Taiwan manufacturers produced 13.35
million desk-top computers, 5.6 million of which were assembled in
the mainland.</P>
      <P>Hou Hai Precision Industry, the world's No. 1 desk-top computer
supplier, for instance, is making 90 percent of its deliveries from
factories in the mainland. The office in Taiwan is in charge of
taking orders, purchasing, designing and molding.</P>
      <P>Lap-top computer manufacturers are still restricted by the
government with regard to investing in the mainland. However, several
manufacturers, including Compal Electronic, Inventec Corp. and
Twinhead International have set up marketing outlets there to
familiarize themselves with the investment environment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROSECUTOR CONFIRMS TRAVEL BAN ON SEVERAL NAVY OFFICERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An ad hoc panel charged with the
investigation into the death of a navy captain seven years ago has
taken action to ban several navy officers from going overseas pending
their interrogation, said State Public Prosecutor General Lu Ren-fa
on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lu, who was named by Premier Tang Fei to lead the probe into the
death of Navy Captain Yin Ching-feng, confirmed press reports that
several navy officers had been put under the travel restriction, but
declined to reveal how many officers were named or why they were
named.</P>
      <P>He also said that all of those barred from traveling abroad are
still in the country.</P>
      <P>In response to questions from reporters, Lu said his panel has
almost completed their review of all the documents concerning the
case, and has found that several questions needed to be clarified.
Interviews with people possibly involved in the case will begin soon.</P>
      <P>Yin, who died mysteriously in 1993, was then chief executive for
the navy's weapons acquisition programs, including the purchase of
four frigates from France. A six-year investigation into his death by
a joint task force of the military and police has turned up nothing.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian ordered that the investigation be
reopened on July 31, after press reports in France said that huge
kickbacks were paid to Taiwan officials involved in buying the four
frigates.</P>
      <P>The China Times, a mass-circulated local newspaper, said earlier
this week that Yin was murdered by colleagues at the General
Headquarters of the Navy after he threatened to go public with
information about their irregularities in the deal.</P>
      <P>The paper said Lu's panel has prohibited fifteen navy officers
from traveling overseas. However, it added that retired captain Chen
Lu-tseng, who was the chief of staff of then-Navy chief Chuang
Min-yao, and who was named by the paper as the person most wanted to
be questioned by investigators in the case, is now in New Zealand.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao
presided over the annual meeting of the heads of the Republic of
China's diplomatic missions in the United States on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-jen, ROC Representative in the United States, and the
heads of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Offices in Los Angeles, San
Francisco, Seattle, Kansas City, Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Guam,
Honolulu, Houston, Miami and New York attended the two-day meeting.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-tung, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) and Chen Jung-chieh, vice chairman of the
Cabinet-level Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, were also invited
to attend the meeting.</P>
      <P>According to custom, the annual meeting has always been held in
Washington, D.C. and chaired by a vice minister. This year, the
United States agreed for the first time since diplomatic ties between
the two nations were severed that a meeting chaired by a foreign
minister could be held on US territory. This is seen as an indication
that Taipei-Washington relations are steadily improving.</P>
      <P>However, the US government has not allowed an ROC foreign
minister to visit Washington since officially recognizing the regime
in Beijing. Therefore, the meeting was held in Los Angeles instead.</P>
      <P>As the meeting was of a closed-door nature, the agenda, contents
of the meeting will not be disclosed. It is believed that the
discussions will focus on the US general election in November,
Taiwan-Washington relations and Beijing-Washington ties.</P>
      <P>The meeting will close on Thursday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER ROC OFFICIAL VISITS ANCESTRAL SHRINE IN MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Zhejiang,   mainland   China,   Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>John Chang, an
illegitimate son of the late Republic of China President
Chiang Ching-kuo, made an offering to the ancestors of the Chiang
clan at the family shrine in mainland China on Thursday.</P>
      <P>An emotional Chang, who took his mother's family name, said
from now on he is "officially a member of the Chiang family."</P>
      <P>Chang's wife and their three children as well as the widow and
children of Winston Chang, Chang's late twin brother, also paid
respects to the Chiang clan ancestors in the same ceremony.</P>
      <P>The widow of Winston Chang said she believes that her husband's
soul was also present at the traditional ritual of paying tribute to
one's ancestors.</P>
      <P>The rite, held at the clan shrine in Xikou township, Fenghua
County in the southeastern mainland province of Zhejiang, was
witnessed by six Chiang clan elders.</P>
      <P>Chang, 58, said the long overdue rite has given him "peace of
mind" because acknowledging his blood ties was the late President
Chiang Ching-kuo's dying wish.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chang said he has no intention of changing his
family name to Chiang. "I will keep my mother's family name in
memory of her," he explained.</P>
      <P>After paying tribute to the Chiang clan ancestors, the Changs
visited the tombs of the parents of the late President Chiang
Kai-shek and the grave of the mother of the late President Chiang
Ching-kuo. Chang is a grandson of Chiang Kai-shek who moved to Taiwan
in 1949 after losing a civil war to the Chinese communist forces on
the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chiang Ching-kuo never publicly acknowledged Chang and Chang's
twin brother Winston as his sons and refrained from seeing them. It
was not until a few years before Chiang's death in 1988 that Chang
began to bring his father little gifts like ties and shavers, always
delivered through someone else.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, three Chiang clan elders on the mainland
wrote to him three years ago, urging him to return to visit the
family shrine.</P>
      <P>Chang said he began to make preparations for the trip after
stepping down from the post of secretary-general to former President
Lee Teng-hui in March.</P>
      <P>Chang, a career diplomat, also once served as secretary-general
of the Kuomintang, Taiwan's ruling party until May 20. He has held no
public office since the KMT lost the March 18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chang and his family will then travel to Ningpo and lunch with
mainland-based Taiwan businessmen on Friday. The next day, he is
scheduled to proceed to Shanghai, where he will lunch with Taiwan
businessmen there.</P>
      <P>The mainland office in charge of Taiwan affairs in Shanghai will
honor him at a dinner party on Saturday, and he will visit the
Shanghai home of the ROC and KMT founding father, Dr. Sun Yet-sen, on
Sunday. Chang and his family will then proceed to Queilin, Guangxi,
where he will offer incense at the tomb of his mother, Chang Ya-juo,
on Aug. 29. He is expected to return to Taiwan on Sept. 1.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Top Republic of China government officials
spent Thursday inspecting the areas that received the heaviest
battering as Typhoon Bilis crossed the island the day before, leaving
heavy casualties and agricultural damage in its path.</P>
      <P>ROC Vice President Annette Lu inspected earthquake- and
typhoon-torn Nantou County and encouraged local residents to bounce
back from the devastating natural disasters like "unbendable lotus
flowers" while Premier Tang Fei inspected the eastern counties of
Taitung and Hualien, declaring them to be natural disaster regions
eligible for state relief.</P>
      <P>Urging Nantou citizens to rise above the difficult times, Lu
witnessed the "graduation" ceremonies of 13 mothers who undertook
sewing training to acquire new job skills after last year's killer
Sept. 21 earthquake destroyed homes and depressed the local economy.</P>
      <P>Lu also praised returning students who spent the summer serving
their home county, and added that she is certain this year will be a
particularly significant period in their lives.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the disaster region residents have only two
major demands from the government -- a place to live and a job to go
to -- Lu said that the government's post-quake reconstruction
committee should answer to the people and show substantial results by
the earthquake's first anniversary in September.</P>
      <P>She also paid her respects to the families of seven Nantou fruit
pickers and a six-year-old girl who were buried alive overnight by a
mudslide that washed away the hut in which they were sheltering from
the strong winds and torrential rains brought on by Bilis.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tang inspected damaged granaries, orchards, levees,
and roads in Taitung and Hualien counties, which bore the brunt of
the typhoon's fury.</P>
      <P>He declared that farmers in the two counties are eligible for
relief aid and low-interest loans and added that relief aid of
NT$30,000 (US$966) per hectare of fruit trees should be handed out
within a month for it to be effective. NT$500,000 (US$16,100)
emergency loans will have an interest rate of 4.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) reported over NT$1 billion-worth
(US$32 million) of crop damage for each of the two counties. Tang
directed the COA to release onto the market frozen vegetables it had
helped farmers put into storage earlier, in order to maintain
sufficient supplies and keep market prices from increasing too much.</P>
      <P>He also directed his staff to look into helping the affected
farmers to limit their damage by processing the tons of windfall
fruit.</P>
      <P>According to disaster relief regulations, rice from damaged
public granaries will be made into rice wine, while any surplus will
be dried. Financial aid will also be provided to repair the
granaries.</P>
      <P>Tang watched soldiers from the military's Hualien-Taitung Defense
Command as they transferred wet rice from the damaged Fuli Village
granary to be dried and stored in another granary. He also inspected
the damaged granary and directed state-run Taiwan Power Company to
repair damaged power lines by Friday morning in order to limit
further losses for the farmers.</P>

      <P>Powerful Typhoon Bilis had caused losses
worth more than NT$4 billion (US$120 million) in Taiwan's
agricultural sector as of Thursday, according to a spokesman for the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>He said the losses included NT$3.94 billion-worth of crop losses,

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT WRAPS UP STATE VISIT, RETURNING HOME</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>N'Djamena,  Chad,  Aug. 24 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian wrapped up his visit here ahead of schedule Thursday after
issuing a joint communique with Chadian President Idriss Deby.</P>
      <P>Chen and his entourage of government officials, businessmen, and
journalists will make a transit stop in Dubai, the largest city in
the United Arab Emirates, before arriving at Taiwan's Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport at 3 p.m. Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen decided to cut short his visit to Chad -- the last leg of
his six-state "journey of friendship" to the ROC's allies in the
Caribbean, Central America, and Africa -- to take charge of the
situation at home in the wake of Typhoon Bilis.</P>
      <P>He was originally scheduled to return to Taiwan on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Upon his return, Chen will immediately take a flight from the
airport to the central Taiwan county of Nantou where eight people
were buried alive by landslides caused by the typhoon.</P>
      <P>In his joint communique with Deby, Chen reiterated the ROC
government's promise to strengthen existing cooperative relations and
expand the areas of cooperation, urging private enterprises in both
nations to establish partnerships through the use of all existing
channels.</P>
      <P>The two heads of state also expressed their pleasure at the sound
bilateral relations as seen from the continued high level visits and
mutual support of the same international issues.</P>
      <P>Deby reiterated the Chadian government and people's firm support
for the ROC government's right to participate in all international
organizations, especially the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Chen and Deby expressed their mutual concern for the worsening
conflict situations in Africa and urged for dialogue through the UN
and other regional organizations to resolve disagreements.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Chen held a breakfast meeting with the eight
ROC ambassadors stationed in Africa. In addition to Chad, the ROC has
seven other diplomatic allies in Africa -- Burkina Faso, the Gambia,
Liberia, Malawi, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal and Swaziland.</P>
      <P>He thanked the ambassadors for their work and reminded them that
no ally is too small or too big, and that developed and undeveloped
nations alike are all important friends to the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen also visited the construction site of a Taiwan-financed
bridge and attended a highway christening ceremony. The new road was
originally to be named "Chen Shui-bian Boulevard" in his honor, but
Chen suggested that it should renamed "Republic of China Boulevard,"
at which N'Djamena Mayor Ali Haroun said that because the bridge is
to be called "Taiwan Bridge," perhaps the highway leading to it could
also be called "Taiwan Boulevard."</P>
      <P>Chen also visited a local hospital to inspect the work of an ROC
medical team and later visited the ROC-assisted Farcha oil refinery
plant.</P>
      <P>The "journey of friendship" is Chen's first overseas trip since
taking office on May 20. It took him to the Caribbean nation of the
Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica in Central America, and
the West African states of the Gambia, Burkina Faso and Chad.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET DENIES 'RESHUFFLE' REPORT, FORMS FINANCIAL PANEL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet Friday denied a press report
that the three-month-old Cabinet will undergo its first partial
reshuffle at the end of this month.</P>
      <P>Chang Ping-nan, deputy director-general of the Government
Information Office (GIO), told a routine news conference that Premier
Tang Fei already denied the report Thursday.</P>
      <P>A local newspaper claimed that both the Presidential Office and
the Cabinet had reached a consensus that at least two or three
Cabinet members will be replaced late this month.</P>
      <P>During an inspection tour of the typhoon-affected regions in the
eastern counties of Hualien and Taitung, Premier Tang said he was
surprised by the report. "There is no such thing," the premier
added.</P>
      <P>Acting Secretary-General to the President Chen Che-nan has also
dismissed the report as "sheer speculation."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Tang announced at a weekly Cabinet meeting
on Friday that the Cabinet will form a special economic and financial
task force to work out feasible measures to cope with relevant
issues faced by the country.</P>
      <P>According to a GIO press release, Tang will personally head the
panel and Central Bank of China Governor Perng Fai-nan will serve as
its chief executive secretary.</P>
      <P>Members of the group include Finance Minister Shea Jia-dong,
Economics Minister Lin Hsin-yi, Cabinet Secretary-General Wea Chi-lin
as well as Chen Po-chih, chairman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development, and Lin Chuan, director-general of the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics.</P>
      <P>From now on, the GIO statement said, the panel will meet
regularly to discuss major financial and economic issues and
recommend measures for resolving them.</P>
      <P>Tang's Cabinet has been criticized for failing to present
consistent, coherent and clear-cut economic and financial policies.
The results of some public opinion polls also show that the approval
ratings for senior financial and economic officials are generally
low. Against this backdrop, some news media have speculated that
certain Cabinet members in the relevant fields may be replaced.</P>
      <P>Observers said the formation of the new Cabinet financial and
economic panel is part of Premier Tang's efforts to signify the
importance the new government attaches to financial and economic
issues as well as to invalidate any Cabinet reshuffle reports.</P>
      <P>During Friday's Cabinet meeting, Tang also reiterated the
government's concern about the development of traditional industries
which face many difficulties due to changing global market situation.</P>
      <P>In another news development, the Ministry of Finance will
sponsor a seminar on the country's current financial problems
over the weekend in the central Taiwan county of Nantou, which bore
the brunt of the devastating "921 earthquake."</P>
      <P>The Aug. 26-27 seminar will discuss three major themes -- public
debt management and major government financial sources; how to
improve the financial status of local governments; and a
mechanism to cut government expenditures and save resources.</P>
      <P>More than 100 legislators, scholars, industry delegates, central
and local government representatives have been invited to
attend the seminar to present policy proposals or options.</P>
      <P>Premier Tang, Vice Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, Cabinet
Secretary-General Wea Chi-lin, Finance Minister Shea Jia-dong,
Interior Minister Chang Po-ya, Transportation and Communications
Minister Yeh Chu-lan, Vice Economics Minister Lin Yi-fu, CEPD
Chairman Chen Po-chih and GIO Director-General Chung Chin will all
attend the seminar.</P>
      <P>Two former Finance Minister Paul Chiu and Lin Chen-kuo have also
been invited to attend the meeting to provide counseling

    <HEADLINE>'ONE CHINA' POLICY GOOD FOR TAIWAN, CHINA: US EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug. 24 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It makes a great deal of sense for the
United States to maintain its "one China" policy, because it reduces
the possibility of war across the Taiwan Strait, compels PRC
modernization and democratization, and buys time without endangering
Taiwan, claimed an American defense expert Thursday.</P>
      <P>Nicholas Berry, senior analyst at the Washington-based Center for
Defense Information, wrote in a commentary that "one doesn't have to
be a devotee of Beijing to realize the one-China policy serves
American interests and, over the long term, serves the interests of
Taiwan and even the mainland Chinese."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that understanding how the one-China policy
affects the policies of Beijing and Taipei confirms its usefulness:</P>
      <P>-- Reduces possibility of war. Virtually no analyst believes that
the PRC leaders are not serious when they talk about the necessity of
territorial integrity. And the fact that national unification is a
deeply cherished dream by virtually all mainland Chinese is widely
recognized. People's Liberation Army leaders are extremely patriotic,
fiercely supportive of unification, and deeply suspicious of foreign
meddling what they regard as "China's internal affairs."</P>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui's 1995 pro-independence speech at his alma
matter, Cornell University, mobilized PLA officers to press Beijing's
political leadership to hold military exercises off Taiwan's coast.
"Quite simply, Taiwan independence means war. No government in
Beijing could tolerate the permanent division of China. Peace,
therefore, depends on maintaining the one-China principle which the
US one-China policy supports," wrote Berry.</P>
      <P>-- Compels PRC modernization and democratization. As long as the
one-China principle is maintained, the PRC is obliged to pave the way
towards reunification by becoming more like Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The PRC's systems are the ones undergoing fundamental change.
Mainland leaders may not want democracy, but creating a vibrant
economy balloons the middle class that does want more freedoms and
participation in public policy. The closer the mainland's economy and
political system approach Taiwan's, the faster reunification will
occur. The one-China principle backed by the US one-China policy puts
the burden on Beijing to modernize," argued Berry.</P>
      <P>-- Paves the way for cross-strait exchanges. As long as the
United States maintains the one-China principle as the basis of its
overall China policy, Taipei will not go off on its own and challenge
Beijing with a declaration of independence. Alone, Taiwan's prospects
in a long-term conflict with the mainland are not good.</P>
      <P>Instead, Berry said, "by not challenging the one-China principle
(while not surrendering by accepting that Beijing is the only
government for all of China), Taiwan opens the way for greater direct
trade, communications and transportation with the mainland. This will
help China modernize, sustain progressive leadership in Beijing,
break down emotional barriers across the Taiwan Strait, and increase
the cost if Beijing considers taking military action against Taiwan."</P>
      <P>-- Buys time without endangering Taiwan. Taiwan has de facto
autonomy now, and its democracy and economy are well established.
"Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian has reasonably stated that the
Taiwanese people would have to approve reunification. Current trends
are favorable for increasing the convergence of the two societies.
Why disturb the status quo?" asked Berry.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEMOCRACY IS PREREQUISITE OF CROSS-STRAIT UNIFICATION: ACTIVISTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,   Aug.   24   (CNA)
(By M. J. Tsou and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democracy in mainland China is a
prerequisite of cross-strait unification, a group of Chinese
democracy activists residing in France said Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a letter to the European Daily News, the four Chinese
democracy campaigners stated that if Beijing wishes to see a peaceful
and unified China, it must first accept and recognize the fact that
Taiwan and mainland China are two separate political entities. They
also added that Beijing must first initiate and deliver democracy on
the mainland.</P>
      <P>The European Daily News is a Chinese-language newspaper in Paris,
and an offshoot of Taipei's United Daily News.</P>
      <P>The letter was jointly authored by Chinese dissidents Xue
Chaoqing, Zheng Qi, Jiang Ping and Hu An. They said that there is no
doubt that mainland China is keenly eager for peace and unification
with Taiwan, but that authorities in Beijing must first ease controls
on democratic activities and allow mainland people the freedom of
speech, freedom of publication, and freedom to organize groups.</P>
      <P>Only when the Chinese public really have the right to know and
the right to express themselves can all Chinese people around the
globe work together to accomplish the ultimate goal of unification,
the activists said.</P>
      <P>They stressed that above all, all parties concerned must respect
the truth of history -- that there are two separate political
entities in China under two different governments.</P>
      <P>One such entity is the Republic of China government in Taipei,
the sovereignty of which covers all of Taiwan's territory, including
the offshore islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Penghu, and other tiny islets
in the South China Sea, they said. They added that the other
political power is the PRC government in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Any party that does not recognize this historic truth and insists
on proclaiming itself "the only legitimate Chinese government" is
showing a hegemonic mentality, which simply demonstrates that its
unification drive is part of a "united front" against Taiwan, they
continued.</P>
      <P>The letter urged both sides of the Taiwan Strait to take the
first step toward reconciliation and use the terms "Taipei
government" and "Beijing government" to refer to one another.</P>
      <P>A truce must come before any peace, they went on, suggesting that
the Taipei government renounce the use of force to "recover" the
mainland, and urging the Beijing government to renounce the use of
force to "liberate" Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Chinese democracy campaigners also gave Beijing the thumbs
down for its attempt to impose the "one country, two systems" scheme
on Taiwan. The mainland imposed the controversial system on Hong Kong
after the territory's handover from British rule.</P>
      <P>It will be a dead-end alley for Beijing if it sticks to its
totalitarianism on one hand and attempts to have the 23 million
people in Taiwan return to its fold on the other, they said. The
public in Taiwan will never be willing to unify with the mainland
under Beijing's communist totalitarianism, they said.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, the Chinese activists said they wrote the letter
to mark the significance of the soon-to-open World Chinese Convention
on the Promotion of Peaceful Unification, which they said would serve
as a great inspiration for Chinese people from across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>They said they keenly hope that Taiwan and the mainland will
reunify along the lines of East Germany and West Germany, and create
a government of freedom, democracy and peace to rule the two sides.</P>
      <P>The World Chinese Convention on the Promotion of Peaceful
Unification is being organized by the Chinese Unification Promotion
Federation in Europe. The event is scheduled to be held Aug. 26-27 in
Berlin, with scholars, officials and democratic campaigners from
Chinese communities around the world participating.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A mishap involving a Uni Air plane has
thrown the operation of Kaohsiung International Airport into chaos,
forcing the cancellation of more than 120 flights between Thursday
afternoon and Friday morning.</P>
      <P>The Uni Air plane, flying from Taipei to Kaohsiung on Thursday
afternoon, overshot the main runway because of slippery conditions
caused by heavy rains in the wake of Typhoon Bilis. Fortunately, no
passengers were hurt when the plane finally came to a halt on a
grassy area 50 meters away from the runway.</P>
      <P>For safety reasons, the airport was closed to deal with the
aftermath of the incident, forcing the cancellation of both domestic
and international flights.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, continuing rains softened the ground under the plane,
which became trapped in the mud, making efforts to remove it more
difficult. The plane was finally towed away from the scene at 8:25
a.m. Friday morning, and the airport was reopened at 9:07 a.m.</P>
      <P>Uni Air has apologized to all other airlines for the
inconvenience caused by the mishap.</P>
      <P>Airport officials said that more than 120 flights were canceled
between Thursday afternoon and Friday morning. Friday morning's
flight schedule was also thrown into chaos, and the air traffic at
the airport returned to normal only in the afternoon, they added.</P>
      <P>Despite the complaints of passengers, the officials said that the
cancellation of the flights was caused by unavoidable factors, and it
will be difficult for the affected passengers and airlines to obtain
compensation.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu on Friday urged
the nation to move toward high technology development, saying that it
is the only way to ensure Taiwan's continued development and
prosperity.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks after listening to a briefing of the
Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at National Cheng Kung
University in Tainan, southern Taiwan, which was the first stop on
her current "high-tech journey."</P>
      <P>Lu, who has been appointed as the convenor of a technology
consultation task force at the Presidential Office, noted that
President Chen Shui-bian had expressed in his inaugural speech that
he envisions transforming Taiwan into a "green silicon island."</P>
      <P>She said that with so many people living on such a small island,
Taiwan has no other choice but to develop its high-tech skills,
especially in the face of strong competition from mainland China. She
added that technological development is a worldwide trend in which
Taiwan must participate.</P>
      <P>She stressed that local people should attach equal importance to
production, ecology and human lives, which she said is the gist of
the concept of the "green silicon island."</P>

      <P>Several social groups, including the Taiwan
Labor Front (TLF) and the Social Legislation Movement Federation, are
opposed to the national pension scheme put forward by the Council of
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), officials of the social
groups said Friday.</P>
      <P>The groups have formed an alliance to oppose the national pension
schemes issued by both the new and old governments, because both
schemes are not well-developed, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>The alliance of national pension system promoters criticized the
national pension system proposed by the CEPD as the worst plan yet.</P>
      <P>TLF Secretary-General Hsu Chu-feng said the Democratic
Progressive Party (DDP) has strayed from its professed ideal of
supporting politically and economically weak groups.</P>
      <P>Hsu added that the CEPD's scheme would force people to save money
for themselves, and is also socially unfair. Moreover, the suggested
pension payments would be too low to protect the economic security of
Taiwan's elderly, he said.</P>
      <P>The alliance maintains that any well-developed system should
include a monthly pension of NT$6,000, he noted. Meanwhile, the
government should develop a sound system of taxation to increase its
financial resources, he said, adding that the public should not be
subject to other insurance fees.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT'S 1ST POST-INAUGURATION OVERSEAS TRIP DRAWS MIXED REVIEWS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   25   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's first
post-inauguration overseas visit, which ended Friday, has drawn
mixed evaluations from local politicians.</P>
      <P>While government officials recognized the positive results of
Chen's six-state "journey of friendship," some legislators cast doubt
on the effectiveness of the president's 12-day overseas visit.</P>
      <P>Chen, accompanied by a large entourage of government officials,
businessmen and journalists, left Taipei on Aug. 13 for a journey
aimed at bolstering the Republic of China's diplomatic relations with
its allies.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on the just-concluded trip, Lo Chih-cheng,
director of the Research and Planning Board of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, said the president's hectic globe-trotting visit was
fruitful.</P>
      <P>Lo said the visit, which took Chen to the Dominican Republic in
the Caribbean, the Central American countries of Nicaragua and Costa
Rica, and the Gambia, Burkina Faso and Chad in West Africa, has
helped signify the ROC's sovereign status and cement its ties with
its diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>Following Chen's visit to the three African countries, Lo said,
all of the ROC's eight African allies have promised not to attend a
forum to be sponsored by Beijing to boost its ties with African
states. Beijing had invited Taiwan's African allies to attend the
seminar as observers.</P>
      <P>In the face of Beijing's intensified efforts to court Taiwan's
allies, Lo said Chen's trip has contributed to consolidating ties
with the ROC's allies.</P>
      <P>He said that although some people criticized the timing of Chen's
trip, the fact that he managed to embark on an overseas visit after
being in office for less than three months manifests the ROC's
political stability following its first democratic transition of
power between different political parties.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lo went on, Chen's good rapport with the grassroots
that was illustrated throughout the trip has won recognition from the
ROC's allies.</P>
      <P>"The six-leg journey has also allowed Chen to forge personal
friendships with foreign leaders and to gain a better understanding
of the work situation of our diplomatic corps," Lo added.</P>
      <P>Legislators of different political stripes generally recognized
Chen's efforts to bolster the ROC's relations with its allies and to
upgrade Taiwan's international profile.</P>
      <P>Legislator Fan Yang-sheng of the opposition Kuomintang said
Chen's trip was an overall success. "In addition to winning the
friendship of foreign allies, Chen has helped boost the morale of our
agricultural and medical service missions in those countries," he
added.</P>
      <P>However, some lawmakers, including several of those from Chen's
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), criticized the new government for
failing to use "new thinking" to break the Beijing-imposed diplomatic
embargo against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Parris Chang claimed it is not enough that the new
government seeks only to defend the achievements made by the previous
KMT administration. He also cast doubt on the government's promise to
honor all aid offers or plans made by its predecessor.</P>
      <P>Chang said the new government should not follow the previous KMT
administration's "money diplomacy" tactics and should instead use
"new thinking" to work out new strategies to expand the ROC's
diplomatic frontiers.</P>
      <P>He said the new government must also tighten the tracking and
supervision of all existing aid programs to ensure their
effectiveness and prevent any irregularities in the conducting of any
foreign aid project.</P>
      <P>Chang also criticized the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' failure to
protest against what he described as unreasonable US restrictions on
the president's activities during his overnight transit stay in Los
Angeles on his way to the Dominican Republic, the first leg of his
overseas visit.</P>

      <P>So far, the mainland's semiconductor sector still lags far
behind, partially because Beijing is on the list of countries subject
to a US hi-tech export embargo. Its prospective entry into the World
Trade Organization will help the mainland to obtain technology and
equipment and this will accelerate the development of its hi-tech
industries. Well aware of this change of climate, foreign investors
are keen to enter the mainland hi-tech sector.</P>
      <P>Several multinational corporations already have plans to
introduce to the mainland the 0.25 micro technology applied to
eight-inch integrated circuit (IC) chip production.</P>
      <P>The 0.25 micro technology is much more advanced than the 0.35
micro technology, the highest level currently existing in the
mainland. Most of the chip factories there are producing six-inch IC
chips using 0.8 micro-1.0 micro technology.</P>
      <P>WTO membership, the lifting of the hi-tech embargo by the United
States, and a large number of well-trained electronics engineers have
created an advantageous environment for mainland China to elevate its
electronics industry. Taiwan's IC sector is well aware of the
importance getting a toehold in the mainland market before their
Western counterparts.</P>
      <P>Since the government has not yet relaxed its restrictions on
upstream electronics manufacturers' investments in the mainland,
investors need to seek detours and at least two industrialists in
Taiwan have made contact for preparations to establish eight-inch IC
chip factories in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>However, capital investment for an eight-inch IC chip factory in
the mainland is estimated at over US$1 billion and local chip
manufacturers are still hesitant over making such a big investment on
the other side of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>One industrial analyst suggested that Taiwan's semiconductor
manufacturers interested in migration to the mainland might set up
packaging and testing facilities there in the initial stage and
expand to IC design at a later date. In fact, among the new IC
packaging and testing plants in mainland China, two are operating
with Taiwan capital.</P>
      <P>Executives of IC manufacturers in the past few months have been
frequent visitors to the mainland market, although several major
manufacturers have said recently that they have no immediate plans to
move their IC production lines there.</P>
      <P>The manufacturers are watching developments closely. With the
maturing of the downstream assembling, components and peripherals
sectors, it is only natural for the upstream semiconductor suppliers
to move their production lines and distribution centers closer to the
market, but the timing depends on when the government will lift its
ban on such investment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAINAN MAYOR FACING TRIAL ON CORRUPTION CHARGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan,   southern  Taiwan,  Aug.  25  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tainan prosecutors
announced on Friday that they had amassed sufficient evidence to
secure a conviction for Tainan City Mayor Chang Tsan-hung on
corruption charges.</P>
      <P>Chang, who was formerly a key figure in the promotion in the
United States of Taiwan Independence, is suspected of negligence
while serving as Tainan mayor for his part in large-scale bribery and
bid-rigging over a canal project in the southern city.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors recommended that Chang be sentenced to a 12-year
prison term and that he be stripped of his civil rights for a further
10 years.</P>
      <P>Chang, 64, who holds a doctorate in chemical engineering from
Rice University in the United States, was elected mayor of Tainan in
1997.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors said they are also seeking a 15-year term, a
10-year disenfranchisement and a NT$20 million fine for Tung
Mei-chen, believed to the mastermind behind the scandal surrounding
the NT$500 million project.</P>
      <P>According to the prosecutors, Tung, director of the Tainan City
Urban Development Bureau, conspired with city government advisers Hsu
Cheng-hsiung, Yuan Hua-lun and Hsieh Ching-sung to invite Japanese
construction company Nikken Industrial to participate in bidding for
the canal reconstruction project.</P>
      <P>After Nikken agreed to pay NT$5 million to "grease the wheels,"
Tung, who was officially in charge of the project, arranged for
Nikken to be made the priority choice in an open bid for the project,
which included the building of several bridges and extensive
tree-planting along the banks of the canal.</P>
      <P>According to other city government officials who said the whole
project had appeared fishy from the very start, the whole process was
flawed and biased in every respect.</P>
      <P>Hsu was recommended to face a jail sentence of 13 years, while
advisers Yuan and Hsieh face jail sentence of 12 years each.</P>
      <P>Three local representatives of the Japanese company, identified
only as Sato, Isemura and Murakami, will also face jail sentences of
between two and three years for their involvement in the scandal, if
the prosecutors are successful.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOUTH OF BIG UNDERSEA HOT SPRING DISCOVERED OFF TAIWAN COAST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, Aug. 25 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The mouth of a high-temperature undersea
hot spring discovered recently in waters near Taiwan confirms the
belief of an oceanographic geologist that a big shallow undersea hot
spring, probably the largest on earth, is located to the northeast of
the island.</P>
      <P>Prof. Chen Chen-tung of National Sun Yat-sen University said he
and his research team found the chimney-like opening of an undersea
hot spring earlier this month only a few dozen meters off Gueishan
(Turtle Hill) Island, off the northeastern Taiwan city of Ilan.</P>
      <P>The hot spring mouth has a diameter of about four meters, stands
six meters tall and is located about 20 meters below sea level.</P>
      <P>In April last year, Chen and his researchers found Taiwan's first
undersea hot spring, also near Gueishan. The spring, which was
unrecorded in any local historical or geological archives, consisted
of eruptions of billowing steam mixed with sulfur fumes, with
temperatures as high as 102 degrees Celsius, Chen said.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to prove that a group of undersea hot springs
actually exist to the northeast of Taiwan, Chen and his researchers
set up several thermometers in the area to record the temperature
variations, but they soon "disappeared."</P>
      <P>Undaunted, Chen and his team continued their undersea research
and finally discovered the big mouth of the undersea hot spring.</P>
      <P>Chen, who was contracted by Taiwan Power Company to probe the
undersea area offshore from a nuclear power plant located in
northeastern Taiwan and examine the influence of the plant's
discharged water on the nearby ocean, said his main mission is to
find out whether or not heavy metal pollution in the waters near
Gueishan Island is caused by natural elements brought about by the
eruptions from the undersea hot springs.</P>
      <P>He said his discovery may help detect tectonic plate activity and
eventually contribute to earthquake prediction.</P>
      <P>The professor said before the Gueishan discovery, only Japan and
Italy have reported discoveries of undersea hot springs.</P>
      <P>He said he felt that similar undersea hot springs should be found
in the Taiwan area, which is located on the Pacific Rim, or "ring of
fire," where oceanic tectonic plates are exceptionally active.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Air Force offered
Friday to hand over to prosecutors a safe belonging to an arms broker
involved in the controversial death of a navy captain in 1994.</P>
      <P>Air Force General Headquarters said in a statement that they had
asked the Taipei District Court for permission to relieve itself of
the safe reportedly owned by Shan Yi-cheng that is believed to hold
clues to the death of Capt. Yin Ching-feng.</P>
      <P>The air force issued the statement after opposition legislator
Lee Ching-hua went public with allegations that the air force had the
safe and asked air force authorities to hand it over to prosecutors
charged with investigating Yin's death.</P>
      <P>The air force admitted that it had the safe, but said it had been
asked by the Taipei District Court to keep it. The safe had been left
in air force quarters vacated by Shan after investigators raided it
following the death of Yin, who was chief of the navy's weaponry
acquirement program in 1994.</P>
      <P>Shan left Taiwan after 1994 but was brought back in July this
year after being detained in Hong Kong for illegal entry. He has been
detained by the Taipei District Court in an unrelated case since his
return, but prosecutors want to question him over his role in death
of Yin, whose body was found on Dec. 9, 1994 after he had threatened
to go public with irregularities in the navy's arms purchases.</P>
      <P>The probe into Yin's death has picked up new momentum after
President Chen Shui-bian, fed up with the military's fruitless

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN VOWS TO FINALIZE TYPHOON RELIEF WORK SOON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Nantou,  Taiwan,  Aug.  25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian pledged
on Friday to complete typhoon-related rehabilitation work in one
month.</P>
      <P>Chen made the promise during an inspection tour of a grassroots
community in Puli in the central Taiwan county of Nantou, which
was seriously hit by typhoon-driven rainstorms earlier this week.</P>
      <P>Chen cut short of his first post-inauguration overseas visit and
returned to Taiwan Friday afternoon because of his concern about the
damage caused by typhoon Bilis which swept over the island from
Tuesday evening through Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen, accompanied by Premier Tang Fei, took a flight aboard
Taiwan's "Air Force One" presidential plane to central Taiwan
immediately after he got off a chartered commercial airliner that
took him on his six-state overseas visit and returned to Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan at 2:50
p.m.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed his sorry for failing to stay with all fellow
countrymen when the powerful typhoon, the strongest to hit Asia so
far this year, ripped through Taiwan.</P>
      <P>When he was still on visit in Africa, Chen said, he was very
concerned whether Nantou County residents could withstand the severe
test of typhoon Bilis after they had endured a devastating
earthquake last September and a series of follow-up mudslide
disasters.</P>
      <P>After seeing many temporary houses in the Niuwei community
partially destroyed by the typhoon, Chen said the government will
offer the most lenient subsidies to typhoon victims. The Niuwei
community was built after the 921 earthquake to accommodate quake
victims.</P>
      <P>Chen recognized the concerted efforts made by Premier Tang and
all relevant government agencies to minimize the typhoon damage.
"Thanks to appropriate precautionary measures, we have managed to
largely minimize the typhoon-related damage," he said.</P>
      <P>The president also expressed his gratitude for military
servicemen, police and firefighting officers for their contribution
to emergency rescue and relief operations. "I also hope all troops,
policemen and firemen will continue their efforts to complete
rehabilitation work as soon as possible."</P>
      <P>Typhoon Bilis wreaked havoc on the island, leaving at least 11
people dead, five missing and more than 100 others injured. It also
destroyed or partially damaged some 2,000 houses around the island.
Agricultural and fishery losses were estimated at NT$4.1 billion
(US$132.26 million).</P>
      <P>Chen directed the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture to offer
the best possible subsidies to farmers and fishermen affected by the
typhoon in line with relevant government regulations within a
month.</P>
      <P>Nantou County Magistrate Peng Pai-hsien told President Chen that
the county government already gave NT$10,000 (US$322.58) to each
victim in the Niuwei community in the wake of typhoon. The Buddhist
Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation has also promised to help
repair all damaged temporary houses in the community within
two weeks, Peng said.</P>
      <P>Chen said he had given three phone calls to Premier Tang
during his visit in Africa to get the latest
typhoon-related information. Chen also telephoned Vice President
Annette Lu, Chief of the General Staff Tang Yao-ming and Vice Premier
Chang Chun-hsiung, who concurrently served as convener of the
national emergency rescue center, to ask for their assistance in
disaster prevention and rescue missions.</P>
      <P>Chen's 12-day, six-state "journey of friendship" took him to the
Caribbean nation of the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua and Costa Rica
in Central American and three African nations -- the Gambia, Burkina
Faso and Chad. The visit was designed to signify the ROC's
first peaceful, democratic transition of power and to cement the
ROC's relations with its diplomatic allies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP ISSUES 6-POINT STANCE ON CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's opposition People First Party
(PFP) issued a lengthy report Friday on its basic views and stances
on relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>PFP Chairman James Soong, a former Taiwan governor and ROC
government spokesman, personally unveiled the report at a news
conference.</P>
      <P>Soong, who lost his presidential bid with a narrow range in the
March 18 presidential election, said he hopes the new ROC government
will refer to the report in formulating a new cross-strait policy
that complies with the common interests of all residents in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The report outlined the PFP's basic stances on cross-strait
relations as follows:</P>
      <P>-- Residents in Taiwan are both Taiwanese and Chinese; both
sides of the Taiwan Strait are parts of the "whole China" in
historical, cultural and geographical terms; but Taiwan is by no
means part of the "People's Republic of China";</P>
      <P>-- The Republic of China has been an independent sovereign state
since its establishment in 1912; this is an indisputable fact;
although the two sides remain divided over the definition of "one
China," all parties (including the international community) must
respect the "status quo" on both sides of the Taiwan Strait;</P>
      <P>-- Either side of the Taiwan Strait now has a legitimate
government that exercises effective jurisdiction within its scope;
and each side has its own rights and obligations concerning
international affairs;</P>
      <P>-- The call for "Taiwan secession" would hurt ethnic feelings of
the people on both sides, hinder the development of mutually
beneficial economic relations across the Taiwan Strait, and make it
even more difficult to maintain cross-strait balance and peaceful
co-existence;</P>
      <P>-- The PFP does not rule out the possibility of
multi-integration between the two sides so long as the free will of
all Taiwan residents are fully respected; nevertheless, the party
would never accept the Beijing-proposed "one country, two systems"
unification formula.</P>
      <P>The report also offered some suggestions for the future
development of cross-strait ties:</P>
      <P>-- The two sides should forge a "peace framework" based on the
1992 consensus, sign a "peace agreement" under this mechanism, set up
a "military buffer zone" and promise not to use force to change the
status quo in the Taiwan Strait;</P>
      <P>-- The two sides should adopt confidence and security building
measures, promote regular security dialogue and develop a direct
dialogue mechanism to avoid misjudgment of the situation;</P>
      <P>-- The two sides should establish direct dialogue channels for
talks on economic, banking, agricultural and transportation affairs
to boost constructive interaction and protect the rights of Taiwan
investors on the mainland;</P>
      <P>-- The two sides jointly set up an elite forum to pool wisdom of
experts and scholars on both sides to work out feasible measures to
ensure peaceful development of cross-strait ties;</P>
      <P>-- After both sides join the World Trade Organization (WTO), they
should push for direct trade, mail and transportation links based on
the principles of "dignity, parity, security and reciprocity" and
boost economic cooperation by setting up "free trade zone," "customs
alliance" and "common market";</P>
      <P>-- Mainland China provides incentives and necessary protection
to attract Taiwan investors to help develop mainland China's less
developed inland areas;</P>
      <P>--Mainland China should stop blocking Taiwan's bid to join the
WTO and other international economic, cultural and sports
organizations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP UNVEILS GUIDELINES ON ITS MAINLAND CHINA POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 25 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP) on
Friday unveiled the theme of "respect for history, acknowledgment of
reality and joint efforts for peace" as the guidelines of its
mainland China policy.</P>
      <P>On the eve of the departure of its legislative caucus for a trip
to the mainland, the party also called on Beijing to pursue peace
with Taiwan on the basis of a consensus reached in 1992.</P>
      <P>Refusing to take sides in the long-standing argument between
Taiwan's pro-reunification and pro-independence forces, PFP leader
James Soong took pains to position his party as "pragmatic" in terms
of its approach toward the mainland.</P>
      <P>Soong pointed out in a statement issued by the PFP that the
resolution of the disputes between Taiwan and mainland China lies in
respect for the will of the people of Taiwan, awareness of the
mainland's transformation and knowledge of the international
political reality.</P>
      <P>According to the statement, the PFP believes that both Taiwan and
mainland China are parts of a reunited China, that the Republic of
China is a sovereign state, and that both Taipei and Beijing are
legitimate regimes which govern effectively within their own
jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>At a press conference called to announce the statement, Soong
claimed that most of Taiwan's people emigrated from mainland China,
and that the long history of living together has given rise to a
sense of unique identity among them, no matter when they arrived on
the island.</P>
      <P>This unique "Taiwan sense" demands that "Taiwan's interests be
given top priority," which is why the pro-reunification advocates
cannot win the support of the majority, he continued.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Soong said he felt that the pro-independent
forces on the island have ignored the transformation that the
mainland is undergoing, in particular Beijing's forthcoming admission
to the World Trade Organization and its full integration into the
global economy.</P>
      <P>Like it or not, he said, Taiwan will be exposed to the
ramifications of Beijing's economic and political transformation, and
should carefully assess its impact on the island before responding.</P>
      <P>Noting that the international political situation will inevitably
influence Taiwan's dealings with the mainland, Soong blamed the
government for what he called its "wait and see" approach to Beijing.
Instead, he went on, the government should stay abreast of the
stances of the major powers on the issue of Taiwan and take advantage
of any favorable circumstances to deal with Beijing.</P>
      <P>The conflict between Taiwan and the mainland is neither ethnic
nor nationalist in character, but rather one that stems from
different political systems and thereby should be eliminated through
economic cooperation, according to Soong.</P>
      <P>He urged both sides of the Taiwan Strait to resume dialogue on
the basis of the consensus reached during 1992, which he described as
"one China de jure, and two administrations de facto."</P>
      <P>The 1992 consensus led to the first official dialogue between the
two sides in Singapore in 1993.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET APPROVES GOVERNMENT'S FY 2001 GENERAL BUDGET PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan passed the central
government's fiscal 2001 general budget plan at its weekly meeting on
Friday.</P>
      <P>The central government's fiscal 2001 revenues in the general
budget are set at NT$1,458.5 billion, an increase of NT$98.1 billion,
or an annual growth of 7.2 percent compared with fiscal 2000.</P>
      <P>Fiscal 2001 revenues account for 13.6 percent of the island's
gross national product (GNP), compared with 13.7 percent in fiscal
2000.</P>
      <P>Offsetting the central government's fiscal 2001 revenues with the
expenditures in the general budget, there appears a shortfall of
NT$149.7 billion, compared with a NT$152.8 billion shortfall in
fiscal 2000.</P>
      <P>This shortfall, plus NT$255.7 billion in due debt principals,
will make a total shortfall of NT$403.6 billion, which the government
plans to replenish by issuing government bonds, making use of budget
surpluses accumulated in previous fiscal years, as well as making use
of the debt fund.</P>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei said that because a new law governing the
allocation of government revenues and expenditures attributes to
local governments several tax resources that originally belonged to
the central government, it will be more difficult for the central
government to raise funds to pay for major national development
projects.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT'S APPROVAL RATING UP IN WAKE OF OVERSEAS VISIT: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's approval rating
has risen 4 percent following his first post-inauguration overseas
visit, according to the results of a public opinion poll released on
Saturday.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 857 adult residents randomly selected from
around the island was conducted by the Chinese-language United Daily
News (UDN) Friday evening.</P>
      <P>Poll results show that 64 percent of the respondents said they
are satisfied with President Chen's performance, up 4 percent
from the level recorded in a similar UDN survey conducted on the eve
of his departure for his six-state "journey of friendship".</P>
      <P>According to the same tallies, the percentage of those
discontent with Chen's performance declined to 25 percent to 30
percent. And 11 percent said they have no special opinion about
Chen's performance.</P>
      <P>Chen left Taipei Aug. 13 to start his globe-trotting journey
aimed at bolstering the Republic of China's relations with its
diplomatic allies. The visit took him to the Caribbean nation of
Dominican Republic, Nicaragua and Costa Rica in Central America and
three African states -- the Gambia, Burkina Faso and Chad.</P>
      <P>Chen was originally scheduled to return Saturday, but he decided
to cut short his stay in Chad after a strong typhoon wreaked havoc
in Taiwan. Chen returned a day early on Friday and immediately
traveled to Nantou to inspect several typhoon-damaged residential
communities in the central county.</P>
      <P>The UDN poll found that 36 percent support Chen's early return,
but 49 percent said they think that Chen should have completed his
diplomatic tour as originally scheduled. Fourteen percent didn't
answer the question.</P>
      <P>In the wake of Chen's first diplomatic tour, the ratio of people
dissatisfied with the ROC's current diplomatic situation declined 5
percent to 39 percent, while the percentage of those satisfied with
the situation increased 6 percent to 38 percent.</P>
      <P>However, the UDN poll found that 70 percent of the respondents
couldn't fully identify the countries that Chen had visited.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 71 percent of those interviewed said they are
satisfied with the Cabinet's performance in coping with typhoon
Bilis which swept over the island Tuesday evening through Wednesday
morning and left at least 11 people dead. Only 10 percent gave a
negative evaluation of the Cabinet's anti-typhoon measures.</P>
      <P>In addition, 67 percent said they think that the premier should
personally inspect typhoon-affected regions.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the president needs to inspect typhoon-affected
areas, 54 percent said "yes," while 35 percent said they see no
need for the president to make such kind of inspection tours.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING URGED NOT TO IMPOSE POLITICAL BARRIER TO '3 LINKS'</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China should not impose any
political barrier to the proposed opening of direct "three links"
across the Taiwan Strait, a senior mainland affairs official said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Jan Jyh-horng, director of the Research and Planning Department
of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, which charts Taiwan's
policy toward the mainland, was responding to mainland Chinese Vice
Premier Qian Qichen's remarks on the "three links" issue.</P>
      <P>Qian said during a meeting with a delegation from Taiwan's
United Daily News (UDN) press group that the opening of direct
cross-strait trade, mail and transportation links "could be
easily resolved under the 'one China' principle."</P>
      <P>As Beijing's "one China" principle downgrades the Republic of
China's sovereign status, Jan said, Qian's remarks were tantamount
to setting a political barrier to opening the "three links."</P>
      <P>Without the removal of political barriers, Jan said, the two
sides cannot sit down to discuss technical issues regarding the
opening of direct cross-strait "three links."</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC government has drawn up a timetable for
opening direct "three links," Jan said the realization of the
opening plan hinges on whether mainland China can face up to the
reality and resolve practical problems in a pragmatic manner.</P>
      <P>Jan further said the MAC is always ready to open talks with the
mainland on practical "three links" issues. "We hope mainland China
can deal with economic topics, such as the 'three links' issue,
based on the principle of reciprocity," Jan said, adding that
mainland China should not reject talks simply for political
purposes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKER ALLEGEDLY INVOLVED IN FRAUD CASE RELEASED ON BAIL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  26 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei district prosecutors said Saturday
that they will appeal against Taipei District Court's early morning
decision to release on bail a lawmaker allegedly involved in a real
estate deal suspected to be fraudulent.</P>
      <P>On Friday, opposition Kuomintang legislator Wang Ling-lin became
the first lawmaker under the new Democratic Progressive Party
administration against whom a formal petition has filed to be held
incommunicado, which usually suggests that a prosecutor wants to be
certain the accused will not have the opportunity to destroy evidence
or influence potential witnesses.</P>
      <P>Wang, the son of business tycoon Wang You-tseng, head of Rebar
Group, was released on NT$15 million (US$483,000) bail following a
4:50 a.m. court decision that there is little risk of Wang destroying
any evidence as "the prosecutors already know where most of the money
went."</P>
      <P>Taipei Prosecutor Weng Hung-tsai and Prosecutor-General Huang
Shih-ming expressed their disappointment over the district court's
ruling and said that they will appeal the decision. However, because
the Legislature will again be in session starting Sept. 1, Wang will
be protected by the Republic of China Constitution from any court
summons, arrest, or prosecution until the next legislative recess,
they added.</P>
      <P>Wang had been charged with breach of trust and falsifying
documents for his alleged role in the sale of a tract of land owned
by his company, Far Eastern Silo and Shipping (FESS), to the
state-run Taiwan Development and Trust Corp. (TDTC), in 1999.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors suspect Wang, who is chairman of FESS, of
conspiring with TDTC directors to inflate the price of the land,
which FESS had bought in early 1998 for NT$845 million (US$27.2
million). FESS developed the property and sold it to TDTC a year
later for NT$1.82 billion (US$58.6 million).</P>
      <P>Wang argued that the price was reasonable and offered to cancel
the sale and return the money if TDTC shareholders refused to accept
the deal. The case went public earlier this year after TDTC
shareholders found out about the high price charged by FESS for the
land.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors also grilled Wang over some NT$189 million in
possible kickbacks that went through several personal accounts before
being deposited into his Chung Ting Co. on the same day that FESS
first signed the contract to buy the tract of land.</P>
      <P>Investigations also showed that FESS may have paid some NT$300
million less than the reported original purchase price of NT$845
million, prosecutors said.</P>
      <P>Wang denied the allegations of fraud and said that the
transferred funds were actually a loan to an old friend.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN INSPECTS TYPHOON-AFFECTED EASTERN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taitung,   Taiwan,   Aug.   26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian
Saturday made an inspection tour of the eastern Taiwan counties of
Taitung and Hualien, both of which were hit hard by a strong typhoon
earlier this week.</P>
      <P>President Chen first inspected Taitung County's Tungho Village,
which is known for its fruit production. Chen looked somber when he
saw many fruits on the ground of a large orchard in the village.</P>
      <P>"It's a heart-rending sight," said Chen, the son of a farmer
from southern Taiwan. "I will ask relevant agricultural
administration agencies to hand out disaster relief money to all
farmers within one month to compensate their typhoon-induced losses."</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has often been hit by earthquakes and
typhoons, Chen said all local residents should not be daunted by
such natural disasters and should adopt comprehensive precautionary
measures to minimize the possible damage.</P>
      <P>Among post-typhoon rehabilitation work, Chen said priority
should be given to resumption of normal power and water supplies to
meet the people's basic living demand.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Bilis, the strongest storm to hit Asia so far this
year, ripped through Taiwan Tuesday night, leaving at least 11
people dead, several others missing and many private homes and
public facilities destroyed or damaged. Initial tallies also show
that agricultural losses in Taitung County alone were estimated at
NT$1.2 billion (US$38.71 million).</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Taitung County Magistrate Chen Chien-nien,
President Chen later inspected a breakwater in Chengkung township
where the nucleus of typhoon Bilis swept over.</P>
      <P>The Paishoulien breakwater, which was built decades ago to
protect the coast from ocean waves, was damaged by strong winds. Chen
ordered relevant government agencies to complete repair and
rehabilitation work as soon as possible to ensure safety of residents
in the coastal region.</P>
      <P>President Chen then traveled to the neighboring county of
Hualien to inspect damaged roads, railway, farms, electricity and
water supply facilities and collapsed houses in the region.</P>
      <P>Hualien County Magistrate Wang Ching-feng briefed Chen on the
typhoon damage and progress in rehabilitation work and funds needed
for various relief programs.</P>
      <P>After listening to Wang's briefing, Chen directed Economics
Minister Lin Hsin-yi and Council of Agriculture Chairman Chen
Hsi-huang to offer typhoon-affected regions all necessary assistance
and subsidies.</P>
      <P>Chen later toured a railway repair project in neighboring Kuangfu
village to express his appreciation of the contribution of railway
engineers and workers to rehabilitation work.</P>
      <P>Chen said he has directed all government agencies to work hard
in order to complete typhoon-related rehabilitation work in one
month.</P>
      <P>Chen also expressed his sorry for failing to stay with all fellow
countrymen when the powerful typhoon hit the island. At that time,
Chen was on a state visit in the African state of Chad.</P>
      <P>Chen recognized the concerted efforts made by Premier Tang Fei
and all relevant government agencies to minimize the typhoon damage.
"Thanks to appropriate precautionary measures, we have managed to
largely minimize the typhoon-related damage," he said.</P>
      <P>The president also expressed his gratitude for military
servicemen, police and firefighting officers for their contribution
to emergency rescue and relief operations.</P>
      <P>Chen cut short his first post-inauguration overseas visit
because of his concern about the typhoon damage. He wasted no time
after his return on Friday. Once his chartered plane landed at Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport, he got on another jetliner and flew
to the central county of Nantou where a mudslide killed eight people
during the storm.</P>
      <P>Chen gave three phone calls to Premier Tang during his visit in
Africa to get the latest typhoon-related information. Chen also
telephoned Vice President Annette Lu, Chief of the General Staff Tang
Yao-ming and Vice Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, who concurrently served
as convener of the national emergency rescue center, to ask for their
assistance in disaster prevention and rescue missions.</P>
      <P>Chen's 12-day, six-state "journey of friendship" took him to the
Caribbean nation of the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua and Costa Rica
in Central American and three African nations -- the Gambia, Burkina
Faso and Chad. The visit was designed to signify the ROC's
first peaceful, democratic transition of power and to cement the
ROC's relations with its diplomatic allies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An ongoing European trade and tourism fair
at the Taipei World Trade Center will not be held again next year due
to budget constraints facing its local organizers, the Ministries of
Foreign Affairs and Economics Affairs, sources said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Eurogate 2000, a four-day event bringing together 100 firms from
Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Macedonia, Hungary, Lithuania,
and Latvia, cost US$400,000, according to the Foreign Ministry's
Department of European Affairs. Most of the funds went to air freight
and shipping fees for the goods, customs fees, and exhibition hall
decorations.</P>
      <P>The department added that despite the success of Eurogate, which
is now being held for only the second time, across-the-board cuts in
the administrative budget will force the government to stop
sponsoring the event.</P>
      <P>Because last year's trade fair helped attending countries open up
new markets and forge new trade ties with local buyers, some
expressed regret at the news of the event's termination.</P>
      <P>Poland dominates the trade fair floor this year, with more than
40 stalls displaying jewelry, amber, lamps, coffee, agricultural
equipment, electronic goods and iron products.</P>
      <P>Macedonia, which is taking part in the fair for the first time,
has more than 30 booths featuring spirits, dairy products and
agricultural products.</P>
      <P>Czech firms are showcasing their stained crystal glassware and
ceramics, while Hungarian companies are offering their wines, foie
gras and honey. Slovenia was late in applying to take part in the
show, and is consequently featuring only catalogues of its products.</P>
      <P>Eurogate 2000 is open to the public free of charge from 9 a.m. to

    <HEADLINE>US ASKED TO LIFT THE BAN ON MEETINGS WITH TAIWAN OFFICIALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  25  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Seven Democratic members of the U.S.
House of Representatives wrote a letter to State Secretary Madeleine
Albright Friday, requesting that the State Department "take the
necessary steps to end the inappropriate ban on high-level visits
between elected Taiwanese officials and U.S. officials, including the
democratically-elected president of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>They also requested the State Department to immediately conduct a
review of the Clinton administration's policy on visits by high-level
Taiwanese officials to the United States.</P>
      <P>"We are writing to express our disappointment at the State
Department's restrictions on Taiwan's democratically-elected
President, Chen Shui-bian, during his transit stop in Los Angeles
this past weekend," the congressmen told Albright.</P>
      <P>A number of Democratic and Republican members of Congress sought
to meet privately with President Chen on Sunday, August 13.
"Unfortunately, he was unable to attend the meeting due to pressure
from the U.S. State Department," the officials said in the letter.</P>
      <P>They pointed out that the United States has fought for democracy
around the world and "is without a doubt the world's leading
democracy as we enter the new century. Yet, when visiting the U.S.,
Taiwan's president was denied the basic rights of freedom of speech
and freedom of assembly. The 23 million people of Taiwan have built a
mature democracy over the past decade. We wanted to speak with
President Chen about his country's accomplishments and its plan to
support U.S. interests in Asia."</P>
      <P>"U.S. policy toward China and Taiwan should be evenhanded," said
the Democratic representatives.</P>
      <P>"It is the responsibility of both sides of the Taiwan Straits to
come to a mutually acceptable, peaceful resolution that has, as
President (Bill) Clinton has repeatedly stated, the 'assent' of the
people of Taiwan. Since Jiang Zemin comes to the U.S. to give his
views, Chen Shui-bian and his ministers should have the same right,"
they added.</P>
      <P>The seven Democratic congressmen who signed the letter are
Sherrod Browne (Ohio), Robert Menedez (N.J.), Tim Holden (Pa.), David
Wu (Ore.), Robert Wexler (Fla.), Peter Deutsch (Fla.), and Edolphus
Towns (N.Y.).</P>
      <P>Dr. Chen Wen-yen, president of the Formosan Association for
Public Affairs, said Friday, "We.....strongly hope -- since it is not
only in the interest of Taiwan but also in the interest of the United
States to communicate directly with elected and appointed top
officials of Taiwan, including the President -- that next to this
letter, legislation will be introduced when Congress returns in
September calling for a complete lifting of all restrictions on
high-level visits by these officials to the United States."</P>
      <P>"The fact that the letter is signed by seven Democrats,
significantly adds to the weight of the letter. This illustrates that
the anger amongst Members of Congress about the fashion in which

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING REMAINS A REPRESSIVE REGIME: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  26 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is not yet a full member
of the international system and remains a repressive autocratic
regime, a leading Australian expert recently said.</P>
      <P>In an interview with The Australian Financial Review, Professor
Stuart Harris, former head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and
now most senior China expert at Australian National University in
Canberra, described mainland China as "a dissatisfied status quo
member."</P>
      <P>Mainland China is dissatisfied because it is not yet a full
member of the system, he said, noting that Beijing is still outside
the World Trade Organization and feels it is not properly recognized
as a major power.</P>
      <P>He said mainland China is not a bomb-thrower seeking to overturn
the system, and it will eventually become fully integrated and
recognized in the international system.</P>
      <P>But he also said mainland China is not yet an ideal state,
because it remains a repressive autocratic regime.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that President Jiang Zemin appears to have won
the argument against the mainland's hawkish conservatives by getting
them to agree that mainland China should be patient with Taiwan in
its search for eventual reunification.</P>
      <P>The recent meeting of mainland leaders at Beidaihe ended up with
the leadership agreeing to refrain from any military action against
Taiwan for at least five years, the daily reported.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT HAS HARD TIME MAKING ENDS MEET: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Nantou,  Taiwan,  Aug.  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei said Saturday
that the government has a hard time making its ends meet because the
existing budget law has failed to achieve desired efficacy since its
enforcement.</P>
      <P>Tang made the remarks at the opening of a two-day seminar on the
government's current financial difficulties. The seminar, held at
the mountain resort of Hsitou in the central county of Nantou, was
organized by the Ministry of Finance with a view to pooling wisdom
of officials, scholars, industry executives and parliamentarians to
help resolve the government's budget deficit problems.</P>
      <P>Tang said the government will inevitably rely on debts to make
its ends meet over the next few years. "Improving the government's
financial status is an urgent problem. I earnestly hope that the
current seminar can help crank out measures to control government
expenditure and create new financial sources in order to establish
a sound government financing system," he noted.</P>
      <P>The premier pointed out that the government's budget deficits
are expected to swell in the next few years because of a
combination of factors, including budget shortages of local-level
governments, the planned implementation of a national pension system,
reconstruction of the 921 earthquake-affect areas, infrastructure
construction, military build-up and scientific, technological,
cultural and educational development.</P>
      <P>In addition to cutting government expenditure and expanding
taxation base, Tang said, the government hopes to attract private
investment in public infrastructure construction to help reduce
financial burden of the national coffers.</P>
      <P>Tang further said he hopes the ongoing seminar will focus
discussion on three key directions -- helping establish a stable,
non-barrier investment climate; improving the taxation system,
expanding tax base and establishing a fair, reasonable taxation
climate; and upgrading the efficacy of budget control, strengthening
financial management and streamlining the budget allocation system.</P>
      <P>This was the first large financial meeting since the Cabinet
formed a special task force to facilitate formulation of sound
financial and economic policies. The four-star-general-turned-premier
said he will take part in all panel discussions in order to gain a
better understanding of proposals presented by all participants.</P>
      <P>The agenda for the two-day seminar include three major topics --
government debt management and financial sources for major
administrative programs, such as the new national pension system and
post-earthquake reconstruction projects; how to improve and
rationalize the financial system of county and city governments; and
how to upgrade efficacy of government spending and attract
private investment in infrastructure construction.</P>
      <P>More than 100 government officials, scholars, experts,
parliamentarians, industry executives and local government
representatives are attending the seminar to present their
views and recommendations. The seminar will close on Sunday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China
Vice Premier Chang Chun-hsiung on Saturday inspected the progress of
the ad hoc committee tasked with post-quake reconstruction,
instructing it to complete its work as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Chang pointed out five major focus areas in reconstruction
efforts -- housing, work and education, mudslide prevention work,
industry revival, and public construction. He encouraged the
committee to face up to the challenge.</P>
      <P>In his first visit to the central Taiwan county of Nantou since
taking his current post Aug. 1, Chang encouraged the members of the
committee -- of which he is deputy convener -- to put their best
efforts into the reconstruction of the area.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that it will not be easy to resolve some of the
issues that come up during the process of reconstruction, because
they are decades-old problems handed down from the past. However,
this is a test for the new government, which must go all out to
resolve the "deep-rooted illnesses," he added.</P>
      <P>Last year's Sept. 21 temblor, which measured 7.3 on the Richter
scale, claimed the lives of more than 2,400 people across Taiwan and
wrought havoc in Nantou, where it was centered.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO TAIWAN-BORN LINS IN THE SPOTLIGHT AT OLYMPIC ARTS FESTIVAL (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug. 26 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two Taiwanese artists, choreographer Lin
Hwai-min and violinist Lin Cho-liang, were in the spotlight Friday at
the Olympic Arts Festival in Sydney, a precursor to the 2000 Olympic
Games scheduled to begin in mid-September.</P>
      <P>Lin Hwai-min, 53, is currently two productions -- "Nine Songs"
and "Moonwater" -- with the Cloud Gate Dance Theater Company he
founded in 1973. "Nine Songs" attracted huge audiences at Her
Majesty's Theater in Sydney, where it was staged from Aug. 19 to 22.</P>
      <P>The opening night of the second production -- "Moonwater" -- was
even more successful, as it nearly drew a full house on Friday,
according to organizers of the festival.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, violinist Lin Cho-liang, 40, enchanted an audience of
about 1500 music lovers at the Sydney Opera House with his superb
interpretations of pieces by Felix Mendelssohn and Wolfgang Amadeus
Mozart.</P>
      <P>Lin Cho-liang played as a soloist accompanied by the 104-member
Asian Youth Orchestra under the baton of Sergiu Comissiona, one of
the most experienced and dynamic conductors in the world.</P>
      <P>Art critics here have said that both Lins are superb artists in
their fields.</P>
      <P>The two Lins have several things in common. They were both born
in Taiwan and are proud of their country. Both are striving to become
perfect in their professions, thus winning a worldwide reputation as
a result of their unswerving efforts.</P>
      <P>The elder Lin has devoted about 27 years of his life to Cloud
Gate, choreographing its performances to entertain people not only in
Taiwan, but also many countries throughout the world.</P>
      <P>The younger Lin has also devoted more than 20 years of his life
to perfect his skills so that everywhere he goes, he can enchant his
audiences with his interpretations of western classical music.</P>
      <P>Both Lins strive to promote their birthplace and put Taiwan on
the map through their efforts. Lin Hwai-min and his Cloud Gate
Theater carry spread Taiwan's name through dancing, while Lin
Cho-liang often speaks of his birthplace with his fans and has even
brought home famous musicians, such as cellists Yo-yo Ma and Carter
Brey and violinists Gil Shaham and Mark O'Connor, to take part in his
brainchild -- the Taipei Chamber Music Festival.</P>
      <P>Both Lins are inspirations to the younger generation in their
respective fields, commentators said.</P>
      <P>Even after reaching a global status, they continue to practice
daily to develop their creativity in their own professions to
entertain people throughout the world, they added.</P>
      <P>"I still have to practice two to three hours a day so that I can
maintain and even improve my skills," Lin Cho-liang said in an
interview with the CNA.</P>
      <P>He said the Taipei festival, which began last year, drew a large
crowd, and the second festival in May this year attracted about
30,000 people.</P>
      <P>"I plan to have another festival in two years so that I can bring
more musicians and give more people in Taiwan a chance to enjoy their
music," Cho-liang said.</P>
      <P>Lin Cho-liang said no matter where he goes and lives, his heart
will always be in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin Hwai-min said he was delighted very much to have more people
to see the Cloud Gate performances because "our success can boost the
international image of Taiwan" so that more and more people can know
more about his birthplace.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Lin Cho-liang said although the two artists' performances are at
different venues in Sydney, watching Cloud Gate's dancers had given
him the desire to foster future collaboration with Lin Hwai-min, whom
he admires and respects very much.</P>
      <P>"I hope our performances in Sydney will serve as a small step for
future collaboration between Mr. Lin and myself, so that both Lins
are highlighted on the same stage," he told CNA.</P>
      <P>"I believe we could have some collaboration in the future," Lin
said.</P>
      <P>Lin Hwai-min said such a collaboration is possible, but both
artists would need to discuss it extensively in the future. "I hope
there will be such an opportunity some day," he added.</P>
      <P>Lin Cho-liang told CNA that he would continue playing until he is
65 years old, meaning that he will perform for another 25 years.</P>
      <P>Lin Hwai-min said he would try his best to continue creating new
productions to spread Cloud Gate's global recognition as long as he
can.</P>
      <P>"If I can not continue, I will resign, and hopefully our new
blood will carry on," he said. Lin declined to predict how long he
would lead Cloud Gate.</P>
      <P>After the Olympic Arts Festival, the first invitation to such an
event for both Lins, they will continue their busy performing
schedules in different countries. The younger Lin will go back to New
York where he lives with his wife. He said he will prepare for
touring concerts in the United States later this year, and then go
back to Australia next year.</P>
      <P>The elder Lin and his Cloud Gate Dance Theater will put on five
performances in Auckland before returning to Taipei for a short
break. He and his troupe will also visit Lyon and Berlin in
mid-September to continue their performing journeys.</P>

TROPICAL STORM MIGHT THREATEN TAIWAN

Taipei, Aug. 27 (CNA) A tropical storm, the 12th of this year's
typhoon season, is looming in the Pacific and might pose a threat to
Taiwan in two days, said the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) Sunday.

Tropical Depression Prapiroon packed winds exceeding the
18-meter-per-second threshold of a tropical storm at 2:00 a.m. early
Sunday. It was centered about 1,000 kilometers southeast of Taiwan,
and was moving in a north-northwest direction.

Its tropical storm-force winds extend 180 kilometers from its
center, and might pick up force and threaten Taiwan in the next two
days, depending on air pressure conditions over the Pacific, said the
forecasters.

If air pressure turns higher over the next two days -- which is
very likely according to the current weather conditions -- Prapiroon
will make landfall on northern Taiwan, said the CWB. Otherwise, it
will swerve toward the East China Sea with only its outward spiraling
air currents touching the island, said the forecasters.

Either way, the island will be affected by the storm's outward
circling air currents in two days, so the CWB forecasts heavy rains
for that time.

The island's weather was sunny with afternoon showers Sunday,
said the CWB.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>NATIONAL UNIFICATION NOT ONLY OPTION: DPP OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  27  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said national unification is not the only
option for Taiwan and the concept should be adjusted to conform to
mainstream values.</P>
      <P>Yen Chien-fa, director of the DPP's Department of Chinese
Affairs, made the remarks when he presented the result of a poll
Sunday.</P>
      <P>The poll showed that up to 90.5 percent of people in Taiwan do
not agree with mainland China's statement that Taiwan is a province
of the People's Republic of China and that it is not qualified to
join the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Some 72.9 percent of the people agreed with former President Lee
Teng-hui's remarks that the Republic of China on Taiwan is a state,
and not a province of the People's Republic of China; while 68.3
percent of those polled also said that the ROC should formally
recognize the PRC as a country.</P>
      <P>Yen said that experts and scholars on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait should pay attention to the results of the survey, which shows
that people in Taiwan have not dramatically changed their opinions on
this issue over the long term.</P>
      <P>Lan Shih-chung, director of the DPP's Taipei City Chapter, said
that the establishment of the National Unification Council was aimed
at soothing those who are pro-unification during the rule of the
Kuomintang, the former ruling party. He said that the council should
not become the burden of the DPP, and that his party has long held
that the operation of the NUC should be adjusted.</P>
      <P>Both Yen and Lan said the NUC's operation should be changed to
conform with the public's views, but they also added that the council
should not be scrapped at the present stage.</P>
      <P>The poll also showed that 50.7 percent of the people think that
the ties between Taiwan and the mainland are "special state-to-state
relations," while 27.7 percent of the people believe that they are
"normal international relations."</P>
      <P>Lin Yi-hsiang, deputy director of the KMT's Committee of Policy
Coordination, said that the results of the poll conformed to similar
surveys in past years.</P>
      <P>The poll found that three months after President Chen Shui-bian's
inauguration in May, 20.4 percent of respondents said they hope that
the status quo can be maintained for now and the island be unified
with mainland China later, 37.6 percent said they hope to keep the
status quo and decide later whether to unify with the mainland or
declare independence, and 12.6 percent said they hope to maintain the
status quo permanently.</P>
      <P>Compared with a survey conducted in January, two months before
the presidential election, the ratio of supporters of a permanent
status quo is slightly lower, while those who want a rapid
unification or independence has increased slightly.</P>
      <P>The poll also showed that 73.7 percent of the people think that
President Chen's recent visit to six states in the Caribbean, Central
America and West Africa was helpful to promoting diplomacy, and that
76.5 percent of the people believed the trip has not increased
cross-strait tensions.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by Trendgo Survey Research Center at the
commission of the DPP's Taipei City Chapter between Aug. 24-25 on
people above 20 years of age. Some 1,033 effective samples were
collected with a margin of error of three percent, the DPP said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DIPLOMATIC SERVICE TO REPLACE MILITARY SERVICE NEXT YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 27 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Young men in Taiwan will be able to opt for
diplomatic jobs in 2002 as an alternative to the current two years of
compulsory military service, according to a proposal put forward
recently by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).</P>
      <P>Conscripts who are trained experts in medicine or agriculture or
who have good command of foreign languages will be able to choose to
work for the MOFA or aid Taiwan's allies instead of serving in the
armed forces, said Lo Chih-cheng, chairman of the Research and
Planning Committee under the MOFA.</P>
      <P>The diplomatic service is the brainchild of President Chen
Shui-bian, who made it part of his campaign platform during the March
presidential election. A draft plan worked out by the MOFA on the
basis of Chen's idea calls for the selection of conscripts with
special expertise to work for the ministry or aid Taiwan's allies as
workers in non-governmental aid groups, said Lo.</P>
      <P>In light of the fact that a large part of Taiwan's 29 allies are
Francophone states in Africa, Lo said, military draftees with good
command of French will be tapped by the MOFA to help it deal with
African states, or else to be posted overseas to work as interpreters
at Taiwan's agricultural or medical missions.</P>
      <P>Owing to the fact that living conditions in many of Taiwan's
African allies are harsher than those in Taiwan's two frontline
islands, Kinmen and Matsu, draftees posted there should be
compensated with better payment or shorter length of service than
ordinary conscripts, said Lo.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, it would be better if draftees assigned to overseas
jobs would keep their civilian status rather than be considered as
military personnel, given the sensitivity of host countries to the
presence of foreign military, said Lo.</P>
      <P>Taiwan introduced an alternative service to replace its
compulsory military service this year, as previous years had seen too
many draftees. About 6,000 conscripted men have been assigned on a
voluntary basis to perform community service or help police to keep
peace and order this year.</P>
      <P>Those who work in the alternative services are still considered
to be military personnel.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei said Sunday that the
government will not be able to begin implementing the national
pension scheme on Jan. 1, 2001, as had been originally planned.</P>
      <P>Tang made the remarks at the closing of a two-day seminar on
current financial problems in Nantou County, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Participants in the seminar, while discussing the financing of
the national pension scheme on Saturday, agreed on the principle of
tax hikes, but said Sunday that additional taxes will not be the only
source of funds for the program.</P>
      <P>But Tang said Sunday that further discussion is needed on whether
or not to raise taxes, adding that the national pension scheme
involves many complex factors.</P>
      <P>Tang noted that when the Legislature passed the national pension
scheme, it agreed in principle that it would be implemented on Jan.
1, 2001. But as it is now already late August, there is not enough
time to prepare for the pension's implementation, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Nantou County Magistrate Peng Pai-hsien suggested in
the seminar that Nantou County be authorized to issue lottery tickets
to raise funds for reconstruction work in his home county, which born
the brunt of last year's devastating Sept. 21 earthquake.</P>
      <P>Tang said that the lottery idea also needs further study. He said
the market for lotteries in Taiwan is very limited, and that it would
not be profitable if too many lotteries were implemented at the same
time.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Ministry of Finance has already authorized the
Bank of Taiwan to issue lottery scratch tickets, and there will be
another lottery later, which he said would fill market demand.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China is stepping up efforts to crack
down on Christians for fear that religious activities may grow out of
control and threaten the stability of the atheistic government, a
human rights group reported here Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and

arrested nearly 200 Christians in various parts of the country,
including some 130 in Xihua county in Henan province, and more than
50 in Guangshui city in Hubei province, Yucheng county in Henan
province, and Hejin city in Shanxi province. All of them were
arrested on charges of attending "illegal meetings" of "evil cults."</P>
      <P>Chinese official statistics showed that there are six million
Catholics and 12 million Protestants in China. But the information
center quoted experts as saying that the number of all
Christians in the country is more than 40 million.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A highway bridge linking Kaohsiung and
Pingtung Counties in southern Taiwan collapsed suddenly Sunday
afternoon, leaving at least 20 people injured as five vehicles
plunged into the river and another 16 were stranded on the sloping
deck, said the police.</P>
      <P>Most of the injured were rushed to hospitals in Pingtung County.
Injuries included fractured bones and internal hemorrhaging, but none
were fatal, said hospital sources.</P>
      <P>Rescuers said they would continue searching the river bed for any
possible missing vehicles or injured until evening. They have
condoned off the multiple-span beam bridge after cracks began
appearing on other sections of it.</P>
      <P>The bridge collapsed at 3:21 p.m., according to police sources.
Without any warning, a span under the bridge suddenly fell, causing a
roughly hundred-meter section of the bridge to collapse, according
local television footage.</P>
      <P>The reinforced concrete Kaoping Bridge, named after the river it
runs across, is part of the major outbound road in island's
southernmost county of Pingtung. The bridge was built in 1978 and was
a total of 1990 meters long.</P>
      <P>Some of the bridges pier foundations were dangerously exposed to
water currents after sand and grit nearby them were dug up illegally
to use as construction materials, according to local reports.</P>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei and Minister of Transportation and
Communications Yeh Chu-lan rushed to the scene shortly after learning
about the incident.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT TIES VERY TENSE AFTER PRES. ELECTION: SEF OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San   Francisco,   Aug.   26  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu &amp; Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior official of the
Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Saturday that
cross-strait relations once became very tense after the March 16
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Shi Hwei-you, vice chairman and secretary general of the SEF,
said that although the situation has been restored to normal, both
Taipei and Beijing should seek a "middle way measure" to resolve the
knotty issue of "one China."</P>
      <P>Shi made these remarks at the 23rd Annual Meeting of the Taiwan
Benevolent Association of America now being held in San Francisco.</P>
      <P>He said that cross-strait relations descended into "unimaginable
tension" as mainland fighters and warships crossed over or approached
the middle line of the Taiwan Strait, which separates Taiwan and
mainland China, after the election results were made known.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's announcement of the five "noes" in his
inaugural message on May 20 has eliminated the misgivings of both
mainland China and the United States, Shi went on.</P>
      <P>Shi said that President Chen has stated that he will respect the
spirit of the 1992 consensus reached between Taiwan and mainland
China so as to attempt to resolve the deadlocked ties across the
Taiwan Strait. The 1992 consensus left both sides agreeing on the
respective interpretation of the "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>Both Taipei and Beijing should positively seek a "middle way
measure" to resolve the "one China" dispute, Shi added</P>
      <P>Shi, who has participated in negotiations with Beijing under the
Kuomintang Administration, called on Beijing to give up its hardline
"three steps" policy toward Taiwan, which holds that there is one
China, Taiwan is an inseparable part of it, and the People's Republic
of China is the sole legitimate government of all of China.</P>
      <P>Beijing's hardline policy will not only increase cross-strait
tensions, but could also affect the admissions of Taipei and Beijing
into international organizations such as the World Trade
Organization(WTO), Shi added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  27 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Most of the soybeans used to make food in
Taiwan are "gene-modified" (GM), but this vital information is
invariably missing on the labels of related products, an
environmentalist group said on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Liu Ming-lung, secretary-general of the Qualitative Environment
Fund, said at a press conference that ten of the soy product samples
tested by the Fund, namely bean-curd and soybean-milk, were found to
be made of GM soybeans.</P>
      <P>Additionally, one of four bands of potato chips, US-imported Pink
Potato Chips, also turned out to be made of GM crops.</P>
      <P>Liu attributed the results to the island's imports of GM soybeans
from the United States.</P>
      <P>Although the Fund's test was not designed to check whether or not
GM foods are safe, which might take generations to understand fully,
consumers at least should be informed of what they are eating, said
Liu.</P>
      <P>He urged the government to oblige food manufacturers to reveal
any GM ingredients on product labels, in order to allow consumers to
choose for themselves whether or not they want to eat GM foods.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Premier Tang Fei on
Sunday ordered the law-enforcement authorities under the Justice

Kaoping bridge linking Kaohsiung and Pingtung Counties.</P>
      <P>About 100 meters of the 2,400-meter bridge collapsed suddenly on
Sunday afternoon, sending 16 vehicles and one motorbike crashing
against the tilting span.</P>
      <P>A total of 22 people were taken to hospitals nearby for
treatment. Most suffered from light injuries, and no one was killed.</P>
      <P>Tang flew to the scene from Taipei shortly after learning of the
accident. He conveyed President Chen Shui-bian's deep concern about
the injured and the cause of the accident.</P>
      <P>The premier expressed apology to the injured and the public for
inconvenience caused by the collapse, and said that the government
will consider paying compensation for the injured people.</P>
      <P>Tang asked government units concerned to find out the cause of

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT SAYS HIS OVERSEAS VISIT DOESN'T WORSEN CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday
that relations across the Taiwan Strait does not worsen over his
first post-inauguration overseas visit.</P>
      <P>Speaking at his third press conference since taking office on
May 20, Chen said mainland China has so far neither issued any
statements nor taken any actions unfavorable to Taiwan following its
recent policy review meeting at the summer resort of Beidaihe.</P>
      <P>Before his departure for his six-state "journey of friendship,"
some observers expressed worries that Chen's diplomatic tour might
enrage Beijing and defer resumption of the long-stalled cross-strait
dialogue.</P>
      <P>"The result proves that such worries are unjustified," Chen
said, adding that his 13-day "journey of friendship" is fruitful and
has not strained cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Chen said his just-concluded visit, which took him to the
Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Gambia, Burkina Faso
and Chad, has helped signify the Republic of China's sovereign
status and bolster its diplomatic ties with its allies.</P>
      <P>Chen said his "summit diplomacy" has enabled the world to "see
the ROC and the democratic and economic achievements created by
the 23 million people of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"The visit has made me even more deeply and vividly feel
the importance that our country wins diplomatic recognition of other
countries," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen said he has acquired many valuable experiences
through his first overseas visit as the ROC's head of
state.</P>
      <P>"Seeing the real situation of our allies and meeting with our
diplomatic corps on the frontline have given me new ideas and new
thinking concerning our future diplomatic strategy and work," Chen
noted.</P>
      <P>Chen rejected description of the ROC's aid to its allies as
"dollar diplomacy," saying that the ROC should display humanitarian
concern and assistance to needy countries.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC's agricultural and technical missions have
contributed to many ROC allies' agricultural and fishery
development, Chen suggested that the ROC consider sending more
volunteer corps to other countries to assist in their economic
development.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed his gratitude for the hospitality extended to him
by the ROC's allies in the Caribbean, Central America and Africa. He
also expressed his appreciation of proper handling of post-typhoon
rehabilitation work done by Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Tang
Fei and Chief of the General Staff Tang Yao-ming during his absence.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that
after three months in office, the Republic of China's government
should not consider itself "new" any longer, and instead, the
administration should fully demonstrate its ability and efficiency to
meet the expectations of Taiwan's public.</P>
      <P>Chen said that by now, Cabinet officials should be "capable
hands" in their respective fields. He said if anyone cannot cope with
the ongoing reform efforts, he or she will be replaced, adding that
there was never any promise that each Cabinet member would be
retained throughout the four-year term.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks during a press conference after
returning home from a "journey of friendship," his first overseas
trip since the May 20 inauguration. The press conference was the
third of its kind over the past three months.</P>
      <P>Chen said he will allow Premier Tang Fei's Cabinet more space and
opportunities in order to improve the performances of its ministers.</P>
      <P>Stressing his philosophy that a good manager should "fully trust
the persons employed, but don't employ persons who are not trusted,"
Chen said it's time for the government to strive ahead at full speed
and if there were people who cannot keep up the pace or cope with the
tempo, they should be replaced.</P>
      <P>Chen said there is no need for the administration to reshuffle
its personnel, but changes of Cabinet officials can be made if
necessary. "Time does not allow us to hesitate or condone," he
stated.</P>
      <P>"There will be hope for change and reform only when we neglect
none of our duties," he continued.</P>
      <P>Reacting to the president's remarks, Government spokeswoman Chung
Chin said the Tang Administration has no plans to reshuffle its
personnel, at least not in the immediate future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LASER EYE SURGERY CAN POSE DRIVING RISK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Aug.  27 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Citing laser eye surgery as a risk factor
for unsafe driving, the Canadian Medical Association is recommending
that doctors test the night vision of patients who may be
experiencing visual difficulties following surgery.</P>
      <P>"What we're essentially saying is that refractive surgery has
some impact on patients in their night-time vision," said Dr. David
Irving, chairman of the committee that drafted the latest edition of
Determining Medical Fitness to Drive, a guide for physicians.</P>
      <P>The guide lists laser eye surgery as one of several medical
conditions known to cause problems with night vision or "contrast
sensitivity." Contrast sensitivity is the ability to see in
low-contrast conditions such as dim light or darkness.</P>
      <P>Physicians use the guide to help determine whether particular
patients are unable to drive. In all Canadian provinces except
Alberta and Quebec, doctors are legally bound to report those
patients to transport authorities.</P>
      <P>Adding laser surgery to the list of risk factors represents a
warning to both patients and doctors, said the experts committee,
which was assembled by the Canadian Ophthalmological Society to draft
the guidelines for the CMA.</P>
      <P>Last year, in Canada alone, about 100,000 people had laser eye
surgery, and the worldwide figure for the same period approached one
million. The Canadian guidelines are seen as likely to have some
impact on future regulations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN REAFFIRMS DESIRE TO MEET KMT CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed his
desire on Monday to meet opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan
for discussing major political issues and relations across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen said at his first press conference since return from his
first post-inauguration overseas visit that he is willing to meet
Lien under any format for an exchange of views on political issues,
cross-strait ties and domestic reforms.</P>
      <P>Prior to his departure for his six-state "journey of
friendship," Chen said he looks forward to meeting Lien, also a
former vice president, after his return from the trip.</P>
      <P>However, Lien said shortly before Chen's return that he sees
no necessity for a Chen-Lien meeting. Lien's remarks cast a shadow
over the prospect for a meeting between the president and the top
leader of the KMT, which ruled Taiwan for 55 years until May 20 and
still controls a majority in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chen said he intends to pay a visit to Lien to listen to the
KMT's opinions about major problems facing the country. "I have no
predetermined stance on the timing, venue and conditions for the
meeting," Chen said, adding that he sincerely hopes to meet Lien at
any time and place and under any format convenient for Lien.</P>
      <P>The proposed Chen-Lien meeting is expected to serve as a prelude
to a long-talked-about roundtable meeting between Chen and heads of
ruling and opposition parties to forge a consensus on cross-strait
ties, domestic inter-party relations, Cabinet-parliamentary
relations and other major reform issues.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC URGES CROSS-STRAIT TALKS ON 'MINI DIRECT LINKS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Aug.  28  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice
Chairman Chen Ming-tung on Monday urged mainland Chinese authorities
to return to the negotiating table to resume the long-stalled
cross-strait dialogue, beginning with talks on the "mini three direct
links."</P>
      <P>Chen said the government is taking a positive stance on the
implementation of the so-called "mini three direct links" -- direct
trade, shipping and communications links between the Republic of
China's offshore islands of Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu with mainland
China -- and concrete plans are expected to be put on the
drawing-board in the near future.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that mainland Chinese officials and experts will join
their Taiwan counterparts for talks on details pertaining to the
"mini direct links," since the matter is of profound importance to
the development of cross-strait relations, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Chen urged mainland authorities and experts to "sit and talk"
with their Taiwan counterparts on the "mini links" so as to rebuild a
mechanism of interaction and pave the way for resuming the
cross-strait dialogue, which was unilaterally suspended by Beijing in
July 1999 after then-President Lee Teng-hui redefined the
Taiwan-mainland China relations as "special state-to-state"
relations.</P>
      <P>Chen continued by saying that Taiwan's national security will
remain the top concern when the "mini links" are considered. As for
other issues involving trade, shipping, finance and communications
with the mainland, participation by experts and personnel from both
sides of the Taiwan Strait is needed, so as to jointly work them out.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks during a hearing hosted by Kuomintang
Legislator Chen Ching-pao in Kinmen Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen, who represents the frontline outpost area of Kinmen, warned
that if the "mini links" plans are not well planned, the impact on
Kinmen and Taiwan will be irreversible.</P>
      <P>The legislator singled out several matters as his major concerns
about the proposed "mini links," including the misgivings of Kinmen
residents aged above 60 who bitterly remember when mainland Chinese
pirates sailed across the "narrow ditch" from the mainland to Kinmen
to rob and loot in Kinmen decades ago.</P>
      <P>He also noted that cheap and abundant mainland laborers may take
employment opportunities away from Kinmen residents once the "mini
links" are open.</P>
      <P>Three major topics are expected to be discussed at the Kinmen
hearing over the next three days -- how to develop Kinmen into a
duty-free shopping paradise, how to build Kinmen into a recreation
park on the sea, and how to develop Kinmen into a special zone for
business and trade.</P>
      <P>Relevant officials from the Cabinet-level MAC, the Ministry of
Finance and the Council for Economic Planning and Development have
flown to Kinmen for the hearing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WEATHER BUREAU ISSUES LAND WARNING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued a
land warning for northern and northeastern Taiwan Monday afternoon in
anticipation of Tropical Storm Prapiroon.</P>
      <P>The weather forecasters said that as of 3 p.m. Monday, the
tropical storm was centered over seas 630 kilometers east-southeast
of Taipei. It was moving at a speed of 18 kilometers per hour in a
west-northwesterly direction, and has a radius of 250 kilometers.</P>
      <P>The CWB officials said that the storm's path is unlikely to
change, and that only northern and northeastern Taiwan are likely to
be within its radius. Nevertheless, they added that other areas will
face rains due to the storm's peripheral air streams.</P>
      <P>The CWB's land warning covers Keelung, Ilan, Taipei and Taoyuan,
and the forecasters warned residents in those areas to be on guard
against torrential rains.</P>
      <P>Ships navigating in seas off the coasts of northern, northeastern
and southeastern Taiwan should also be on high alert, they added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PEOPLE TO DECIDE THEIR OWN FATE: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reiterated on
Monday that the future of Taiwan will be determined by the free will
of the 23 million people on the island.</P>
      <P>In response to questions about cross-strait relations and their
future direction in his first press conference since returning from a
six-state, 13-day visit to the Caribbean, Central America and West
Africa, the president reaffirmed that it will depend on the free will
and choice of Taiwan's people. "No political party or any individual
can make the decision for them unilaterally," Chen added.</P>
      <P>He also spoke of the stance of the United States, noting that US
leaders at both the Republican and Democratic National Conventions
stressed that cross-strait issues must respect the decisions of the
peoples on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. Chen added that both of
the major US parties' platforms agree on this point.</P>
      <P>He said that as the president of the Republic of China, he must
handle cross-strait issues in a manner that respects the consensus of
the people, and there will be no "preset stances or conclusions, and
any options will be possible."</P>
      <P>He said that he is willing to listen to the views of the people
as he urged all political parties to forego their ideological
differences and party interests, putting the interests of the nation
and the people on top.</P>
      <P>He noted that US President Bill Clinton has said repeatedly that
the solution of the cross-strait problem must be acceptable to
Taiwan's populace.</P>
      <P>The latest poll on cross-strait relations also showed that most
people in Taiwan do not want to be a part of mainland China, which he
said is a fact that even the United States could not force Taiwan
people to change, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The poll also showed that around 70 or 80 percent of the people
are in favor of maintaining the current cross-strait status quo, he
noted.</P>
      <P>But he also said that the mainland still wants Taiwan to accept
its cherished "one China" principle, which would turn Taiwan into a
part of the People's Republic of China and force it to accept the
"one country, two systems" formula, which he said goes against the
wishes of most people in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president also urged caution against the remarks of leaders
in Beijing, who say one thing to Taiwan, but another thing to the
international community as far as cross-strait relations are
concerned.</P>
      <P>He said that "from the communiques that mainland China signed
with more than 160 countries in establishing diplomatic relations, as
well as from the information we have gathered," mainland China's "one
China" means the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The president again urged the mainland to show "sincerity,
creativity and wisdom" in dealing with Taiwan, to shelve their
differences with Taiwan, and to sit down and improve cross-strait
relations by finding a definition of "one China" acceptable to both
sides.</P>
      <P>But Chen also said that during his recent overseas visit,
mainland China showed restraint, which he said was a demonstration
that cross-strait relations have not worsened, but rather have become
stable.</P>
      <P>He said that whether the two can make a breakthrough in
cross-strait relations depends on both sides using wisdom.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT RECEIVES CHAIRMAN OF KIWANIS INTERNATIONAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 28 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
received Kiwanis International Chairman Bo Shafer on Monday and
thanked him for the global service organization's long-term
contributions to world society.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that Kiwanis International's goal of serving the
public is the same as that of his just-concluded "journey of
friendship" to the ROC's allies in the Caribbean, Central America,
and West Africa.</P>
      <P>He said that the global village should not be differentiated into
the strong and the weak, and that national boundaries, skin color and
racial heritage should not matter because helping someone is the same
as helping oneself, and giving another a chance is giving oneself a
chance.</P>
      <P>For that reason, the ROC must do its best to assist any allies
that are in need of help, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Shafer said that Kiwanis International originally began by
focusing on local public welfare activities but moved on to
international activities, without regard for national boundaries. He
added that the main cause it is supporting at the moment is
coordinating with the United Nations Children's Fund to help
eliminate iodine deficiency in children around the world.</P>
      <P>Turning to Kiwanis International's 2001 World Conference, Chen
said that it is very exciting for Taiwan to be the first Asia-Pacific
host nation of the annual meeting in 87 years. The conference is
expected to draw more than 10,000 Kiwanis members to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he was an active proponent of bringing the Kiwanis
World Conference to Taipei while he was still mayor of the city.
Therefore, he added that he will be very happy to attend the opening
ceremony of next year's meeting as the nation's president.</P>
      <P>Last year's annual Kiwanis International Asia-Pacific Conference
was also held in Taipei. It was attended by more than 3,000
representatives from the region's 15 member countries.</P>
      <P>Kiwanis International, which has its headquarters in the US state
of Indiana, has more than 8,700 branches with 320,000 members in 81
countries. Its members undertake various charity activities and
social services aimed at helping to improve people's lives.</P>
      <P>Kiwanis International's ROC district, based in Taichung, was
founded in 1967, and has set up over 270 branches across Taiwan with
more than 20,000 local members.</P>

      <P>Officials of the
Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) on Monday
uncovered a criminal ring importing phony leather goods in Taichung
County.</P>
      <P>The suspects have been importing knock-offs of leather products
with famous brand names, according to the officials. Investigators
said they seized a total of 4000 phony products, worth a total of
NT$40 million (US$1.29 million).</P>

      <P>They added that the ring had been importing the counterfeit goods
mainly from Guangzhou in mainland China's Guangdong province, and
then selling the products to downstream distributors.</P>
      <P>More than 100 crimes involving counterfeit products have been

    <HEADLINE>TOUGH COMPETITION FOR GARBAGE COLLECTOR JOBS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It was no Olympic race, but the competition
was just as fierce as some 3000 hopefuls sprinted down the running
track with heavy sandbags on their backs, trying their utmost to get
across the line faster then their opponents.</P>
      <P>With each runner carrying a 15-kilogram sandbag, the nervous
racers took turns running on the track at Taipei Physical Education
College in a 90-meter dash competition to decide whether they are
physically qualified to work as the cleaners and garbage collectors
that Taipei City Government needs to hire this year.</P>
      <P>Some runners managed to finish the 45-meter round-trip dash
without losing steam, but many stumbled and fell down out of sheer
nervousness.</P>
      <P>They had reasons to be nervous -- the acceptance rate of the test
is about only 4 percent, much lower than Taiwan's hotly-contested
College Entrance Examination.</P>
      <P>According to Taipei City Government's Vocational Service Center,
some 6,000 people are vying for 150 openings as garbage collectors.</P>
      <P>Even though a good education is not among the prerequisites of
the job, many applicants have completed their high school education
and some are even college and university graduates, said Vocational
Service Center Director Kuo Chi-yi.</P>
      <P>The hopefuls had already sat through a written exam and another
physical test, which required the candidates to knot plastic garbage
bags to see whether they were quick and efficient enough to collect
the city's garbage.</P>
      <P>The man who came in first in Monday's sandbag running competition
won because he was fast and steady, said the judge panel. Asked why
he took part in the garbage collector job test, he said, "There is
nothing wrong with being a cleaner at a time when finding any job is
difficult."</P>
      <P>Some 3,000 other people are expected to compete in similar races
Tuesday for the same 150 openings.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Government has recently been strenuously promoting a
"garbage revolution," which requires city residents to pay for
garbage bags used to contain non-recyclable trash in an effort to
reduce the garbage volume and to increase daily collections of
recyclable waste.</P>
      <P>In order to meet the increased need for manpower the program
entails, the city government's Bureau of Environmental Protection
created 300 new openings for cleaners and garbage collectors. Half of
the spots are reserved for aborigines, people from low-income
families and other less-privileged groups, and 150 positions are to
be filled through an open competition.</P>
      <P>Vocational Service Center officials said people who fail the
competition Monday and Tuesday should not feel too disappointed as
the race is extremely competitive. To further help console the
disappointed, the center has arranged for nearly 600 job openings for
the competitors to choose from, the officials said. These openings
include positions as security guards, building custodians and
cleaners.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWEA ESTABLISHES COMMISSION TO HELP CROSS-STRAIT BRIDES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28  (CNA)
(By Alice Liang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Women Entrepreneurs Association
(TWEA) established on Monday a commission to work on issues relating
to women who cross the Taiwan Strait to marry men from the other
side.</P>
      <P>TWEA President Ma Ai-jeng said that although TWEA's main goal is
to promote cross-strait trade cooperation, the organization saw a
need to form the commission to work on issues related to the status
of cross-strait wives.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that after the two governments allowed their citizens to
visit relatives on the other side, 12,000 mainland Chinese brides
became Taiwan residents. Additionally, more than 30,000 mainland
Chinese brides are still waiting to gain entry into Taiwan, she
noted.</P>
      <P>Many mainland Chinese brides of Taiwanese men suffer from
domestic violence, and because they are unfamiliar with Taiwan, they
don't know where to go for help, she noted.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that the same situation sometimes occurs in
reverse, when Taiwan-born women marry mainland Chinese men and find
themselves in abusive marriages across the strait. The new commission
will not only provide marital abuse hotline services to such women,
but also offer them legal assistance, Ma said.</P>
      <P>TWEA officials said they hope that the special line will provide
complete services to cross-strait women who need help. The hotline
can be reached at 02-2701-8538.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NUC NOT HIGHEST BODY ON CROSS-STRAIT POLICY: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that
the National Unification Council (NUC) is not the final and paramount
policy-making body, but rather a consultation body on cross-Taiwan
Strait relations.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks in his first press conference
since his return last Friday from his six-state, 13-day visit to the
Caribbean, Central America and West Africa.</P>
      <P>Addressing public concerns about whether he will serve as the
chairman of the NUC, he said that until regulations concerning the
establishment of the body are abrogated, the NUC chair should be
occupied by the president.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he has no preconceived views or bias about serving
as the NUC head, but he stressed that the NUC is not the paramount
policy-making body on cross-strait relations, and added that too many
people have the idea that its views are inviolate.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the NUC is no more than a consultation body, just
like the inter-party team headed by Academia Sinica head Lee
Yuan-tseh, and a human rights promotion team and a technology
consultation team headed by Vice President Annette Lu, and that the
president does not necessarily have to serve as its head.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has lashed out at Chen for saying that he will not
serve as the NUC chairman, saying that the decision shows that Chen
is still quietly harboring thoughts of Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>He again endorsed the inter-party team on cross-strait relations
and said it will meet within the next few days. He also added that he
will take part in the meeting.</P>
      <P>He noted that the NUC was established a decade ago for the
president to speed up national unification under the principles of
freedom and democracy, but questioned if the goal of national
unification now enjoys the support of the majority in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that domestic differences on the orientation of the
nation, cross-strait relations and the future of Taiwan remain wide.
As the leader of a democratic county, he said he must listen to views
from all sides, and that the forming of the inter-party team hopes to
forge a national consensus on these questions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT REAFFIRMS `NO COMPROMISE' ON REFORM (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
reaffirmed on Monday his "no nonsense, no compromise" stance on
promoting domestic reforms, saying he will never compromise simply to
win re-election.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is convinced that a popularly elected government
chief can perform his or her official duties well only when he or she
has the determination to serve for just one term and has no ambition
to seek another term.</P>
      <P>"Only with this understanding and resolve can we succeed in
reform and in wiping out corruption and gangster influence in
politics, commonly known as 'black gold' politics," the president
elaborated.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a press conference following his return
last Friday from his first post-inauguration overseas visit that took
him to the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Gambia,
Burkina Faso and Chad.</P>
      <P>Chen said it is now time for his administration to "shift into
high gear." After three months in office, he said, Cabinet members
can no longer use "inexperience" as an excuse for their failings.</P>
      <P>"All Cabinet members should now become capable hands,
particularly capable reform hands," Chen said, adding that the public
will not be forgiving if the government cannot live up to
expectations.</P>
      <P>Chen said he does not rule out the possibility of replacing
unqualified Cabinet members with more competent ones in order to
satisfy public demand.</P>
      <P>In his third press conference since taking office May 20, Chen
delivered a 40-minute speech on his just-concluded "journey of
friendship" and then spent 50 minutes answering 10 questions from
local and foreign journalists.</P>
      <P>Chen described his six-state trip as very fruitful. In addition
to signifying the ROC's sovereign status, Chen said, the visit helped
cement the ROC's relations with its diplomatic allies. The leaders of
all the host countries have reaffirmed their support for the ROC's
bid to join the United Nations and other major international
organizations.</P>
      <P>Chen said the visit has made him even more deeply and vividly
aware of the importance of making sure that the ROC wins diplomatic
recognition from other countries.</P>
      <P>"Seeing the real situation of our allies and meeting with our
diplomatic corps on the frontline have given me new ideas concerning
our future diplomatic strategy and work," Chen noted.</P>
      <P>He rejected a description of the ROC's aid to its allies as
"dollar diplomacy," saying that the ROC should display humanitarian
concern and assistance to needy countries and that the ROC will
continue to offer such aid.</P>
      <P>"It does not cost us too much but it greatly benefits our allies.
Why shouldn't we do it?" Chen asked, adding that all countries in the
world are equal and deserve respect, whether they are big or small,
advanced or underdeveloped, rich or poor.</P>
      <P>Chen praised Taiwan's agricultural and engineering missions which
have helped Latin American and African countries build bridges and
develop farms.</P>
      <P>Noting that ROC agricultural and technical missions have made
great contributions to the economic development of the country's
allies, Chen said the government should consider sending more
volunteer corps to needy countries to assist in their economic
development.</P>
      <P>According to government tallies, the ROC holds a foreign exchange
reserve of some US$110 billion, but its foreign aid accounts for just
0.13 percent of its gross national product (GNP), compared to an
average of 0.24 percent of many other advanced countries.</P>
      <P>"Helping others is a duty we cannot escape and unless we can do
better and more, we are not a member of the global village," Chen
said.

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT REAFFIRMS `NO COMPROMISE' ON REFORM (II)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Turning to the domestic front, Chen said that three months after
the inauguration of his administration, the country's defense and
diplomatic situation, as well as its relations with mainland China,
have gradually stabilized. "From now on, we will shift our focus to
domestic affairs, particularly the campaign against `black gold'
politics and the creation of a better business climate," he noted.</P>
      <P>Asked about whether he would follow the precedent set by his
predecessor and chair the National Unification Council (NUC), Chen
said he feels that "some people" have deified the NUC and deemed it
as an "unchallengeable totem or symbol."</P>
      <P>But, he went on, the reality is that the NUC is not the ROC's
highest decision-making agency concerning cross-Taiwan Strait
relations, and added that the body is basically an advisory board to
the president.</P>
      <P>Like the newly formed cross-party task force on cross-strait
ties, the human rights promotion panel and the science and technology
advisory group, Chen said the NUC is supposed to offer counseling
services to the president and nothing more.</P>
      <P>Touching on the possibility of a long-planned meeting with
opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, Chen reiterated his
willingness to discuss major domestic political issues, cross-strait
relations and various reform programs with Lien.</P>
      <P>Chen said if Lien does not wish to meet him in the first half of
September, he would be willing to wait. "I have no predetermined
opinion concerning the timing, venue, agenda or any conditions. I am
willing to meet him under any format convenient for him. I just hope
that he understands my sincerity," Chen explained.</P>
      <P>The president had said prior to his departure for his 13-day
overseas visit that he would pay a visit on Lien after his return,
but the leader of the ROC's largest opposition party said last week
that he saw no necessity for such a meeting. It remains unclear
whether Lien, a former vice president, will agree to meet Chen in the
near future. Lien lost to Chen, a stalwart of the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party, in the March 18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chen cut short his visit to the African state of Chad -- the last
leg of his six-state journey -- and returned to Taiwan on Friday, a
day ahead of his original schedule, to assess the damage caused by a
strong typhoon that wreaked havoc on the island on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>He wasted no time upon his return, traveling immediately to
typhoon-affected areas in the central county of Nantou, where eight
people were buried alive by mudslides triggered by typhoon-driven
rainstorms. He also toured disaster zones in the eastern counties of
Taitung and Hualien the following day.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed appreciation for the proper handling of
post-typhoon rescue and rehabilitation operations by Vice President
Annette Lu, Premier Tang Fei, Vice Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, Chief
of the General Staff Tang Yao-ming and all relevant Cabinet members
during his absence.</P>
      <P>He also reaffirmed his determination to get to the bottom of the
1993 murder of naval captain Yin Ching-feng and related military
procurement corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>"The Yin case will be an `eternal pain' for the military if it
cannot be solved. It will leave a scar on the integrity of most of
our military servicemen simply because of a handful of officers'
unlawful actions," Chen said, adding that he fully supports the
deepest possible probe of the case. "The Yin case symbolizes the
government's resolve and the start of its anti-black gold crusade,"
he concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WASHINGTON REACTS TO REPORTS OF BOOK SEIZURES BY CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  28  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Reacting to reports that mainland
Chinese customs officials have seized copies of a book because it had
a photograph of President Bill Clinton alongside the Dalai Lama, the
United States said Monday that if the reports are true, such actions
represent a violation of basic rights of expression.</P>
      <P>Answering press inquiries about the reports, State Department
Deputy Spokesman Philip Reeker noted that the reports cited a
mainland Chinese spokesman as commenting that politically sensitive
materials are not allowed to be printed or exported.</P>
      <P>"If the report is true, then it is most disturbing. Seizure of
books in order to impose political or religious control violates
international human rights instruments, including the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which China has signed,"
pointed out Reeker.</P>
      <P>The spokesman then reiterated that "if these reports are in fact
true, we view the seizure as violations of guarantees of freedom of
expression."</P>
      <P>On the three American missionaries detained by mainland China
last week, Reeker said, "We do understand that all three individuals
have been released and are in the process of departing China."
However, he declined to comment on press reports that the
missionaries were beaten and badly mistreated while in detention.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Reeker confirmed that US Ambassador Joseph Prueher has
returned to Beijing after visiting Tibet between Aug. 24 and 27, in
the first such trip by a U.S. ambassador since former Ambassador
James Sasser visited there in 1997.</P>
      <P>While in Tibet, Prueher met with autonomous region and Lhasa city
government officials to discuss human rights and other issues,
including such specific topics as the Tibet Heritage Fund and the
Panchen Lama issue, according to Reeker. The visit also gave Prueher
the chance to explain American policy and Washington's concerns
directly to Tibetan officials, the spokesman said, adding that he did
not have any details of their discussions.</P>

      <P>Tropical Storm Prapiroon has already begun
whipping up the seas off Taiwan's northeast coast, according to
Tuesday's latest announcement from the Central Weather Bureau (CWB).</P>
      <P>CWB officials said that Prapiroon was located 390 kilometers

kilometers, the tropical storm is moving in a northwesterly direction
at 19 kilometers per hour, they added.</P>

storm named Maria, the 13th in the Pacific this year, was being
formed overnight Monday, said an official with the CWB.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT PRESIDES OVER ANNUAL MILITARY EXERCISE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 29 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
and other top-ranking government officials presided over the annual
Hankuang military exercises Tuesday to inspect the results of the
past year's tri-service training.</P>
      <P>President Chen, Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Tang Fei, and
various Cabinet ministers were first briefed on the cross-strait
military situation. They then observed a simulated war game between
two teams, in which some 2,000 computer viruses collected by the
military were used to test Taiwan's ability to attack the enemy and
defend itself in cyber-warfare.</P>
      <P>Entrenched deep within a hillside at the top-security Hengshan
Command Center, Chen relayed his orders through a direct link to the
Army's front-line servicemen using the new Improved Mobile Subscribe
Equipment (IMSE) -- an upgraded version of the US Army's MSE
telecommunications network system.</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of National Defense (MND), the theme of
this year's Hankuang No. 16 war games is "national defense with the
participation of the entire people," and the focus is on "unifying
and mobilizing national strength."</P>
      <P>A military spokesman said that this year's war games marked the
first time that the premier has led Cabinet members to attend the
military's largest annual military exercise.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the MND decided to invite the Cabinet
members to participate because Hankuang No. 16 seeks to examine the
ability of mobilized reserves to support military operations. To do
so, the coordination of all government agencies and their resources
must be strengthened, he added.</P>
      <P>The spokesman cited wartime issues such as medical care,
transportation, and reserve mobilization as possible situations in
which cross-ministerial coordination will be necessary.</P>
      <P>According to the MND, the exercise formally began Monday, and the
simulated computer war games will last until mid-September. Another
stage of the drill is slated for the end of September, when a
tactical mobilization of the reserve engineering corps and a
head-to-head exercise involving actual Navy, Coast Guard, and air
police forces defending the Tamsui River -- which flows through the
capital city of Taipei -- will take place.</P>
      <P>The Navy and Air Force will also conduct small-scale drills
following the conclusion of the simulated computer war games. One
such drill will be the ROC Marines' urban warfare exercises scheduled
to take place in mid-October.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC VICE PRESIDENT TO VISIT ALLIED NATIONS: FOREIGN MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is planning
a visit by Vice President Annette Lu to the Republic of China's
allies in Central America, Foreign Affairs Minister Tien Hung-mao
said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said during his recent visit to the
Dominican Republic that the ROC vice president would visit El
Salvador between September and October, a comment that sparked
interest in the local media.</P>
      <P>Tien noted that El Salvador's leaders had asked Chen several
times to include a stop in that country on his just-concluded
six-nation tour, and that Chen in fact met with El Salvador's vice
president on Aug. 15 in the Dominican Republic, when the two
discussed an exchange of visits.</P>
      <P>Tien said that he would meet with Lu in the next few days to work
out details of her trip.</P>
      <P>Lu confirmed that she will visit ROC allies in Central America
and "other regions" to promote what she called "soft diplomacy," and
added that the president is also in favor of her trip.</P>
      <P>Lu said that her visit in late September will target Central
American allies, especially those that were not included in Chen's
trip.</P>
      <P>She said that the trip, like Chen's, will be aimed at boosting
the confidence of the allies in the ROC's new administration.</P>
      <P>Tien said that Chen's recent "journey of friendship" was
successful -- not only deepening Chen's personal friendship with
leaders in allied countries, but also boosting the ROC's diplomatic
relations.</P>
      <P>He noted that during Chen's visit to the Caribbean nation of the
Dominican Republic, Nicaragua and Costa Rica in Central America, and
the West African states of Gambia, Burkina Faso and Chad, he met with
nine presidents of allied countries, one former president, one prime
minister, and three vice prime ministers.</P>
      <P>Chen invited all these officials to visit Taiwan, invitations
that received enthusiastic responses, said Tien.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister added that Chen's trip was significant in
that it declared the ROC's sovereignty to the international
community. He said he was gratified to see the ROC flag waving in
other parts of the world.</P>
      <P>Despite mainland China's increased diplomatic squeeze on Taiwan,
Tien said that as an independent sovereign state, the leader of the
ROC has an obligation to travel outside the country in an official
capacity whenever the chance presents itself.</P>
      <P>Tien also confirmed that Singaporean Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew
will visit Taiwan this autumn. He said that the government has been
informed of the trip, and that Lee is expected to meet with
President Chen during the visit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FULL TEXT OF ROC PRESIDENT'S AUG. 28 PRESS CONFERENCE (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 29 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
gave a press conference Monday after his return last Friday from his
first overseas visit as head of state.</P>
      <P>He described his trip as successful and vowed to push ahead with
domestic reforms without regard as to whether it will cost him the
chance of being re-elected.</P>
      <P>Chen said it is now time for his administration to "shift into
high gear" and that after three months in office, the members of his
Cabinet can no longer use inexperience as an excuse for their
failings.</P>
      <P>He challenged the democratic process through which the Guidelines
for National Unification were laid down and the National Unification
Council set up, and shrugged off the question of whether he will
assume the NUC chairmanship.</P>
      <P>He dismissed Beijing's alleged softening of its stance on the
"one China" principle as hypocrisy, claiming that Beijing has
characterized "one China" differently at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>Following is the full text of the press conference provided by
the Government Information Office.</P>
      <P>Acting Secretary-General Chen's Remarks:</P>
      <P>Mr. President, Deputy Secretary-General Chien, Ladies and
Gentlemen from the Media:</P>
      <P>Good morning!</P>
      <P>First of all, I would like to welcome each and every one of you
to the Office of the President for today's press conference.</P>
      <P>As you know, this press conference was originally scheduled to be
held on August 26, when the president returned from his trip to the
Caribbean, Central America, and Africa. However, Taiwan was struck by
Typhoon Bilis, the strongest typhoon to have hit Taiwan in a decade.
The president was very concerned about the damage and, therefore,
decided to return one day earlier. President Chen was back in Taiwan
at 3:00 in the afternoon on August 25, and immediately visited the
disaster areas in Nantou County. On the second day, the president
continued his inspection tour in the Hualien and Taitung areas. This
is why the press conference was postponed until this date, and we
would like to apologize to the media for any inconvenience caused by
the postponement.</P>
      <P>I am sure that all of you are interested in hearing the results
of President Chen's first overseas "trip of democracy, diplomacy, and
friendship" since his inauguration, as well as the president's views
on major domestic issues. Now, let us welcome the president to make
some opening remarks, after which he will answer your questions.</P>
      <P>President Chen's Opening Remarks</P>
      <P>Acting Secretary-General Chen, Deputy Secretary-General Chien,
and Friends from the Media:</P>
      <P>Good morning!</P>
      <P>The 13-day "trip of democracy, diplomacy, and friendship" has
ended successfully. I want to thank our friends in the media for
their company and advice, as well as EVA Air for its chartered
service. I also want to thank our colleagues in the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and our embassies and overseas representative offices
for their meticulous preparations. I especially want to thank the
United States and our six diplomatic allies for their kind
arrangements facilitating this visit. Of course, my special
appreciation also goes to the legislators from different parties as
well as the business leaders taking this trip with us.</P>
      <P>This tour has proved that the worries and anxieties expressed
prior to the trip were unnecessary. During our trip overseas, the
domestic political situation was stable and the government functioned
smoothly. The cross-strait relationship, a source of concern, did not
become tense or worse because of an overseas trip by our head of
state. Many had expected some unfavorable comments, actions, or
conclusions emanating from the PRC's Beidaihe conference, but this
view proved to be unfounded. Although we cannot say much about

    <TEXT>
      <P>Before the trip, we never imagined that these friendly countries
would give us such a warm welcome and so much attention. We were very
deeply moved. Take President Hipolito Mejia of the Dominican Republic
for example. While accepting congratulations from the foreign
delegations [after his inauguration], he asked me to join him in
receiving congratulations. President Mejia also introduced me to
other delegations. Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman further
surprised us by making an exception to see us off at the airport. It
was unprecedented. Even when President Clinton visited Nicaragua
there was no such exception. Costa Rican President Miguel Angel
Rodriguez not only invited us to his home for breakfast, but also
introduced us to his party's presidential candidate. There were other
things that deeply impressed us. When President Idriss Deby of Chad
learned that the place we were supposed to stay lacked some necessary
facilities, he especially let us stay at his residence. He then moved
to stay at the presidential office. We learned later that Mrs. Deby
had sent some people to renovate and decorate the residence so that
we would feel more at home. Now, I would like to again express my
heartfelt respect and gratitude to all of them for their hospitality.</P>
      <P>I would especially like to mention how people here had described
conditions in those countries. In fact, such things as sanitation,
food, or housing were not as worrisome as imagined or reported. I
live a very simple life and feel at home wherever I am. I am not
finicky about food or the place I live in. However, before we left
for the trip, many misleading reports frightened the delegation
members. Nevertheless, they also enjoyed their visit to these
countries. Once we were there, nothing unusual happened. I believe we
did not make an effort to understand these countries. Despite the
fact that they have been our friendly allies for many years, we were
not familiar with them, and there were misunderstandings and
barriers. If we carefully compare our life here in Taiwan with that
in these countries, we have to admit that we are very lucky. We
should cherish our achievements and quality of life, none of which
was easily attained. In spite of the fact that we are often
dissatisfied and the government has not yet performed as well as
expected, we are truly one of the luckier nations in the world. As a
member of the international community, every nation is great in its
own way, and every people is indispensable. Every one is equal and
important. In today's world, despite such differences as skin color
or the level of development, all countries are important and equally
worthy of respect. Gambian President Yahya Jammeh said that, although
his country is small, it has a loud voice. Burkina Faso President
Blaise Compaore said that his country has nothing, but work. I
believe that every nation and race has its strengths worthy of
respect. Last night, my wife told me that when the first lady of
Paraguay visited Taiwan, my wife hosted a banquet to honor her.
During the banquet, the visiting first lady told my wife that the
Paraguay government would definitely speak on behalf of the ROC, for
the people of Taiwan joining the United Nations and many other

      <P>Many people here do not realize the national flag is important or
that the national anthem means much. But, on May 20, when A-mei led
in singing the national anthem, she touched the hearts of the
audience. I believe many people shed tears and realized that we could
sing the anthem of the Republic of China so beautifully. For decades,
many people did not appreciate the importance and beauty of our
national anthem. When I stood on the rostrum at national airports
with leaders of friendly nations and listened to the national anthem
of the Republic of China played by their bands, I was deeply moved
and even stirred with pride. Only then did I feel the importance of
our country, the importance of our country's being recognized, and
the importance of our country's international profile. I do not think
all of my compatriots could fully understand and appreciate my
experience, or feel the same way I did.</P>
      <P>During this trip, we not only proclaimed our country's
sovereignty and consolidated friendships with our diplomatic allies,
but also put Taiwan on the world stage. We want to see the whole
world and let the whole world see the Republic of China and the
democratic achievements and economic prosperity resulting from
several decades of effort by the 23 million people of Taiwan. We want
to offer humanitarian assistance and compassion to the world, which
is our responsibility and privilege. This is what Mr. Alexander
Shafer, president-designate of Kiwanis International, said this
morning when I met him and his wife: "Serving people is not a
responsibility but a privilege." If we help other people, it is not a
responsibility. It is a privilege. However, if we do not even do our
duty, can we enjoy the privilege of helping others? I really cannot
imagine why some people do not agree to our providing humanitarian
assistance and economic cooperation. I often think about my own
background. As a child from a poor family, without the assistance of
relatives and friends, or money that didn't need to be returned, or
money borrowed from friends or relatives with no or low interest,
could there be an ROC president today named Chen Shui-bian? It was
because many people helped me to stand up that I was given the
opportunity to serve the people. This is the spirit of the "Son of
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Half a century ago, the United States assisted us in building
Hsiluo Bridge. When I was in the second grade, I had the chance to
drink my first cup of cow milk. It was delicious, and it came from
the United States. To me, having never tasted cow milk, that first
cup was assistance from the US and provided by my school. Can we say
that this was "money diplomacy" by the US? American international
assistance allowed Taiwan to overcome many difficulties and stand up.
Now, we are standing tall and have the opportunity to repay the
global community. Why are we so stingy? Clearly, the United Nations
suggests that foreign aid should account for at least 0.7 percent of
a country's GNP. Currently, the average percentage is 0.24. How about
the Republic of China? Our percentage is only 0.13, half the average
percentage of the UN. Isn't it too low? Perhaps some people think
that if we cannot implement our own social welfare programs, how can
we help other countries? We want to ask, are the American people
satisfied with their social welfare programs? Is every person taken
care of one hundred percent? I don't think so. Several decades ago,
the US gave so much care and help to weak countries in this world,
including Taiwan. Did the American people complain about that? Were

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 29 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Q.4 Mr. President, when you were in the Dominican Republic, you
reiterated your resolution to dig into the Yin Ching-feng case even
though this would rock our nation to its very foundation. Is there
any progress in the case? And to what level of the military officers
will you investigate? Will it shake our national foundation to solve
this case?</P>
      <P>A: In order to stabilize our national foundation, we must
investigate the Yin Ching-feng case and other relevant scandals to
the end. If anything, these cases are the ones that will shake our
national foundation. If these cases are not solved, they will remain
a pain to the military. We can not let the majority of the honest and
nation- and people-loving servicemen bear the humiliation for the
misconduct of a minority of people in the military.</P>
      <P>At the press conference on July 31, I issued an official order to
set up a special investigation committee for the Yin case and other
relevant scandals. State Public Prosecutor-General Lu Ren-fa was
appointed the convener of this committee. The Ministry of Justice,
Ministry of the Interior, and Ministry of National Defense are also
responsible for investigating this case. The committee has been
working very hard during this past month. Papers and files relevant
to the case are so voluminous that the committee couldn't even read
them all in one month's time.</P>
      <P>I would like to affirm the efforts of every member of the
committee, including the prosecutors, members of the Investigation
Bureau, police officers, and relevant units of the military. Every
one of them worked very hard in cooperation during the past month.
This is not easy. Nor is it easy to find new clues for the case and
to make new breakthroughs in this almost "invisible" case. I am very
pleased that we have found something new and made some new
breakthroughs for the case. We did not disappoint our fellow
countrymen. I have to respect the special investigation committee as
well as the independence of the judicial system. Eliminating
organized crime and government corruption is the common aspiration of
everyone. And we have shown our respect for the independence of the
judicial system, when we were cracking down on the organized crime
and government corruption practices in the past. Similarly, we must
show the same respect to the judicial units as we did when they
cracked down on organized crime and government corruption. Therefore,
I told the special investigation committee and Prosecutor-General Lu
not to have any concerns when investigating the Yin case. No matter
how high and broad the level might be and no matter whether those
involved are still in office or retired, we have no boundaries or
limitations for investigating this case. I told them not to worry
about anything, just track it down to the end, and not to disappoint
our fellow countrymen. If we can have any progress and new
breakthroughs for such a dying case, then we can handle any case. If
we can solve the most difficult case that seems to all to be almost
impossible to solve, what case can't we handle?</P>
      <P>I believe that this is just the beginning. The investigation on
the Yin case and other relevant scandals only demonstrate our will
and resolve to eliminate organized crime and government corruption
from our society. There are still some very old cases that were
already given up by many people. For those cases, we cannot comfort
ourselves by saying that it has been so many years, all evidence has
disappeared, and there is no way to solve them. I believe that those
who were involved and have passed away will bless us from heaven. I
am confident that our fellow countrymen will also give their full
support to my new government, as well as to the special investigation
committee for the Yin case, to crack down on organized crime and
government corruption with a comprehensive effort.</P>
      <P>Q.5 At your last press conference, you mentioned that you would
personally go to the KMT building located opposite the Office of the
President and invite KMT Chairman Lien Chan to attend a special
"Bian-Lien meeting." Now that the KMT has already given its formal
response, has any schedule been set for such a meeting? If
successful, will a similar formula be applied to a future meeting
with Chairman James C.Y. Soong of the People First Party?

      <P>However, the Multiparty Task Force is currently being actively
promoted. The first meeting will be held soon, and I will be
participating to give my encouragement and support. After all, the
first article in the Establishing Guidelines for the National
Unification Council clearly states the reason why the president
established the National Unification Council: "Under the principles
of freedom and democracy, to accelerate national unification, conduct
research, and provide consultation on guiding principles." Although
its purposes are quite clear, has it really been carried out? Under
the principles of freedom and democracy, the purpose for establishing
the National Unification Council was to accelerate national
unification. Was this policy objective carried out under the
principles of freedom and democracy? Did they get the people's
consent and majority support? Were the procedures discussed from top
to bottom? Many different opinions have arisen on this subject that
need to be further discussed. Indeed, there are currently many
different domestic views and ideologies with regard to national
status, cross-strait relations, and Taiwan's future, and some of them
are diametrically opposed to one another. As the president of a
democratic state, I must review all of these differing opinions.</P>
      <P>Thus, we hope that the Multiparty Task Force can establish a
consensus from top to bottom amongst the government, political
parties, and the public with respect to cross-strait relations,
Taiwan's future, our national status, and various ethnic problems. I
think that the smooth and efficient operation of the Multiparty Task
Force should be our current priority and fully support President Lee
Yuan-tseh's direction for its future operations. I am here to appeal
to our countrymen, all parties, and all factions, to support and
participate in the Multiparty Task Force. The Multiparty Task Force
is not even operational yet. Do we really want to brush it aside so
quickly to return to the disputes of the National Unification
Council? We need to examine and face many things. For example, did
the past government follow the Guidelines for National Unification
and the National Unification Council? I think that many things have
become too holy. In fact, the main issue is not the National
Unification Council or the Guidelines for National Unification;
rather, the main issue is on practical, day-to-day operations. What
can we do?</P>
      <P>Today, many people can already travel to the Chinese mainland, to
Shanghai or Beijing, and talk with the leadership of the Chinese
Communist Party about cross-strait relations. Why is it that we have
no way to shake hands at home, to meet with each other to discuss
national affairs, to form a consensus between our government and
political parties on cross-strait relations? Is it possible that
domestic politics are more important than the Chinese Communists and
Zhongnanhai? Thus, I sincerely hope all parties and factions can
eliminate their prejudices to discuss national affairs, as it is not
only our right to do so, but our obligation and responsibility.</P>
      <P>Q.2 Just now, you spoke of having high expectations of the new
government and emphasized your willingness to replace government
officials who were not performing well. Just before your return home,
however, there were already rumors of a possible partial Cabinet
reshuffle in light of some of the criticism it has received. Attacks

      <P>Q.8: You mentioned earlier the difficulty of forming a domestic
consensus on cross-strait policy. Recently, Qian Qichen, the vice
premier of the Chinese mainland, gave a new interpretation of the
"one-China" principle. In the second point of this new
interpretation, he says, "both mainland China and Taiwan belong to
one China." What is your response to this statement? What information
do you think he is trying to convey to Taiwan?</P>
      <P>A: It is especially important that we remind everyone to be
cautious of the different remarks made by mainland Chinese officials,
as it is virtually impossible to know for sure whose statements are
true and final and who actually represents their government's policy.
The remarks to visiting groups from Taiwan are often omitted from
formal documents and press releases on the mainland, so how
accountable are such statements? Furthermore, we have noticed that
many international media, research institutes, and experts have
expressed a difference between what the Beijing authorities say in
their statements to domestic audiences and what they say
internationally with regard to Taiwan. Indeed, what they say to the
people on Taiwan is often contrary to what they tell the
international community. If the so-called "one China" principle,
definition, or meaning has changed, then let me ask, what about the
"one China" repeatedly mentioned in their communiques with over 160
nations that have formal diplomatic relations with the Chinese
mainland? The recent information we have regarding Beijing's orders
to their foreign embassies still refers to a so-called "one
China"-the People's Republic of China. If today, Taiwan and the
Chinese mainland are both part of "one China," this "one China"
refers to the People's Republic of China, and the People's Republic
of China is the sole, legitimate government for all of China-if none
of this has changed in their policies and communiques, and if we
merely listen to their self-serving statements and believe them, then
aren't we placing ourselves in a very dangerous position? The Beijing
leaders have different statements for different groups of people.
However, we will continue to act with sincerity, creativity, and
wisdom, hoping that Beijing will eventually respond in kind. We wish
to follow the spirit of dialogue and exchange and set aside
controversies, so that the two sides can meet and talk to improve
cross-strait relations, while seeking a mutually acceptable
definition of "one China." I wholeheartedly believe that such a
definition cannot be unilaterally decided and manipulated by any
single nation, political party, or people. We must meet and discuss
it together. The outcome is true and final only when it is acceptable

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 29 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>We traveled to many countries during this trip. We saw the
Gambia's vegetable cultivation area and found that the vegetables
planted are exactly the same as those we have here in Taiwan. This is
the result of the hard work of our agricultural technical mission
stationed there. Growing vegetables might not mean as much to Taiwan,
but it means a lot to the people of the Gambia. We also visited the
Bagre farm area in Burkina Faso and saw thousands of hectares of lush
rice paddies beside the dam. The irrigation ditches there are like
the Chianan Irrigation System near my hometown. However, developing
the land is easier said than done, as this area was covered by stones
that had to be exploded before cultivation was possible. So many
members of our agricultural technical mission stayed there for three,
five, or even ten years without getting any preventive inoculations
or taking any medicine. They work silently and contribute what they
know to that place.</P>
      <P>In Chad, we saw that Taiwan Bridge will be opened to traffic next
year. Chad has long been divided into north and south by a river.
Over the past 40 years, there has only been a rickety one-way bridge
connecting the two sides. Now the two-way Taiwan Bridge will be
opened to the public next year, and people from the north and the
south of the country will be able to cross the bridge from both
directions. As Chad President Idriss Deby said, Taiwan Bridge not
only connects south and north Chad, but also Chad and Taiwan. It is a
bridge of friendship between Chad and the ROC. To us, it costs not
much, but to Chad, it is something that makes their lives so much
easier. So, why not extend a hand of friendship?</P>
      <P>Travel in these countries is very inconvenient. Before I left
Chad, I had breakfast with our eight ambassadors stationed in African
nations. I told them, "The eight of you are like the eight fairies
crossing the sea. You eight fairies crossed the South China Sea and
then the Indian Ocean to Africa. As frontline members of the
diplomatic corps, you are the greatest and have made wonderful
contributions to your nation. You should each receive a medal." Some
of them told me that they had spent seven or nine days traveling to
Chad from their respective offices before they could meet me. They
could not fly to Chad directly, as we did by chartered flight. Before
we went on our trip overseas, we took medicine and immunization
shots. But they said that they had no vaccinations or medicine and
would seek help only after they fell ill. It was the same for our
agricultural specialists. And aren't the medical teams just as
impressive? It seems that we have difficulty supplying the required
agricultural people. The older generation has done very well, but the
younger generation doesn't seem to be doing as well. Can we consider
"foreign service in lieu of military service"? Can we promote a kind
of "peace corps"? Let's take students in our agricultural colleges
for example. If they are willing to join a "peace corps," we can
offer them foreign language and professional training, including
courses at the foreign diplomacy college to be established by the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. When they graduate, they can join the
"peace corps" or agricultural technical missions. They will not have
to serve in the military. The "peace corps" can be an alternative to
military conscription, and an alternative foreign service. We can
offer them a high salary, and perhaps they can serve five years
instead of two. After five years, they might wish to remain on the
agricultural technical missions and even start a new career overseas.
These are areas where we can dedicate our efforts. I believe tha t
many of our young people have such aspirations. Helping others is
helping yourself. I raise this proposal, so we can encourage each
other.</P>
      <P>Finally, I must emphasize that although diplomacy is important,
domestic affairs are even more so. As the president of the nation,
one must see and feel the suffering of the people. Even as I was in
Africa, my heart was at home in Taiwan, and I was concerned about the

      <P>As a head of state visiting abroad, I was required to follow
international protocol. With the understanding of the counterpart,
some adjustments in the schedule could be made. Idriss Deby, the
president of Chad, told me it was best not to pressure myself. If he
were in the same situation, he would make some adjustments to the
schedule and return home at an earlier date. I felt especially
comforted by the fact that government affairs had not been adversely
affected by my trip aboard. The crises were smoothly managed. As
Typhoon Bilis was approaching, I called Premier Tang and Vice Premier
Chang, waking them up at midnight and repeatedly exhorting them to
make good preparations for the typhoon. After the typhoon struck, I
made calls and inquired about the damage. Without the most up-to-date
information and assurance of the current situation via reports every
two hours, my worries could not be reduced. During the typhoon, I was
in direct contact with the vice president, the premier, the vice
premier and the chief of general staff eight times, and found my mind
constantly on the situation in Taiwan. I reached a decision to change
my schedule and return at an earlier date. Very soon I arrived home,
saw our people in the disaster areas, and shared their pain. But I am
grateful to the outstanding performance of our servicemen, police,
firefighters, and personnel in the weather, transportation,
electricity, and water supply bureaus and other departments. They
were the first to respond and reacted immediately. I would like to
again express my thanks and praise for their courageous work. I wish
to thank Vice President Lu, Premier Tang, Vice Premier Chang, Chief
of General Staff Tang, and related agencies for their efforts. They
did an excellent job managing emergency situations.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, we handled the Kaohsiung-Pingtung Bridge incident very
well. Since the Pa-chang Creek accident, we must be on full alert and
must not make any excuses or be slow to respond. We must mobilize to
save lives. I could sense that these two incidents have mobilized
everyone. However, if like yesterday, proper precautions had been
made, I believe many unfortunate situations and accidents could be
minimized. If we can prevent disasters, why shouldn't we?</P>
      <P>Today is the 100th day of the new administration. In the past
three months, we have had the excuse of being the "new driver on the
road." But from now on, we cannot use it as an excuse anymore. We
must "become experienced drivers" to meet our citizens' great
expectations. We must work to solve the serious, chronic problems in
a short period of time. We must implement reforms and pursue
progress. I believe we do not have time to waste or procrastinate.</P>
      <P>The neophytes in government must now enter a new stage of
experience. Such numerous trials as eliminating "black gold" politics
(organized crime and government corruption), improving the social
order, investigating the murder of navy procurement officer Captain
Yin Ching-feng, stimulating the economy, maintaining public safety,
raising the quality of life and environmental standards, conducting
reforms, promoting a multiparty task force, strengthening the
communication and coordination mechanisms between the Legislative and
Executive Yuans, and, finally, achieving rapprochement between
political parties and coordination between the ruling and opposition
parties all lie ahead to challenge and continually test us. I would
like to reiterate that in the short time of four years, I will do my
best. I would like to remind all members of the new administration to
cherish this time and make the best of it. Running for a next term is
not on our mind, but rather fulfilling our duties and doing a good
job in governing our country. All government officials and I will
show our willingness to do things right during this term, which is
far more important than thinking about running for the next term. In
the coming four years, all government officials should be on high
alert. No laziness, hesitation, or shirking responsibility is allowed
in the new administration.</P>

      <P>I will not let you down and will work hard. In the future, I will
devote more time to domestic affairs. Once we have stabilized
cross-strait affairs and foreign relations and enhanced the morale of
our military forces, I will spend more time and energy on domestic
affairs, especially in the areas of economic revitalization,
administrative efficiency, and the elimination of "black gold." I
will not compromise because of ballots, nor will I be hypocritical or
wishy-washy in order to be elected the next term, otherwise, not only
the people of Taiwan but also I myself will not be satisfied. Because
of the general dissatisfaction, we have room for improvement. And
because I am dissatisfied, I will work all the more.</P>
      <P>Thank you all once again. I hope our friends from the media will
not hesitate to give me their comments and criticism.</P>
      <P>Q.1 During your stay abroad, there was a major domestic issue
regarding the chairmanship of the National Unification Council. The
chairman is the president, according to the Statute for the
Establishment. What is your opinion now? On the other hand, acting
Secretary-General Chen thought that, since the Guidelines for
National Unification were made in 1989, it is time to revise them.
What is your personal opinion? In the future, how can we distinguish
between the functions and responsibilities of the National
Unification Council and those of the Multiparty Task Force?</P>
      <P>A: I sincerely appreciate everyone's concern and comments about
the National Unification Council, the Guidelines for National
Unification, and related issues. In my inaugural address on May 20,
2000, I already publicly declared that so long as the Communist
regime does not use military force against Taiwan, the National
Unification Council and the Guidelines for National Unification will
not be abolished. This statement has not changed. Although there are
no questions regarding abolition, there are other issues that we must
face, which cannot be avoided. As there are still many people who are
confused about these issues, I would like to take this opportunity to
give appropriate explanations and guidance.</P>
      <P>For example, some people misperceive the National Unification
Council as the highest policy-making and ultimate decision-making
agency on cross-strait policy. In reality, however, the National
Unification Council is simply another consultative body, much like
the Multiparty Task Force, the National Human Rights Consultation
Task Force, and the Science and Technology Consultation Task Force.
All of these organizations are merely consultative agencies to the
president. Thus, the National Unification Council is not the final
decision-making body on cross-strait issues, nor is it the highest
policy-making agency.</P>
      <P>Another popular misconception is the belief that the National
Unification Council is a sacred and inviolable entity. In actuality,
the Establishing Guidelines for the National Unification Council
proclaimed by the president in 1990 have been continuously revised
and were changed in 1993, 1995, and 1997. Since the Establishing
Guidelines for the National Unification Council have already been
revised three times, they are obviously not sacred or inviolable.</P>
      <P>Members of the National Unification Council serve for terms of
one year, and those one-year terms have now been completed.
Naturally, if the council continues to exist, we must either

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 29 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A: I emphasized earlier that I have a very simple philosophy when
it comes to appointing personnel: "Appoint a person without any
doubts, do not appoint a person if there are any doubts." Since the
government officials have already been appointed, this means that I
do not have the slightest doubt about their abilities. I have given
them an opportunity to perform over the past three months, and I am
ready to give them even more opportunities in the future. For
instance, I hope that the financial and economic task force recently
established by the Executive Yuan will take a vigorous and aggressive
approach and not give society the impression that it is in disarray
or is lacking in direction with its economic and financial policies.
I consider this to be very important. The government is like an
enterprise: we are more concerned with team performance than
individual performance. If an individual performs well, but the team
does not, then the individual is not any better off. However, if the
team performs well, then the individual will naturally be in a good
position as well. A good team needs good members. Thus, I believe we
should give our new government-the Tang Cabinet-more time and greater
opportunities. Regarding the problems that have occurred in the past
three months, we could possibly say that we were "new drivers on the
road." However, we cannot use this rationalization to shirk our
responsibilities in the future. Society has very high demands, and my
expectations are no less. I sincerely hope that the new government,
the Tang Cabinet, and all of the ministries and commissions will
devote their full efforts to their work. I would like to remind our
ministers and heads of commissions that three months have passed
since the new government took office. If they have failed to push on
with their work because of personnel problems or because subordinate
department heads have been unable to coordinate their work in a
united effort, then I am sorry to say that adjustm ents must be made.
They have to be made-without hesitation, hypocrisy, procrastination,
or delay. I hope that our ministers and heads of commissions realize
that if they want to thoroughly implement the ideals and reforms of
the new government, then "everything will depend on human effort."
Each staff member must put "heart" into their work; if the heart is
not in it, then adjustments must be made to the staff. I hope that
our ministers and heads of commissions will review this matter
thoroughly and make the necessary personnel adjustments. Otherwise,
we will not be able to proceed with certain matters, and by then, it
might be too late to lay blame.</P>
      <P>Q.3 The US State Department recently issued a report on the human
rights of foreign laborers for various nations. It listed the ROC as
having the second worst record in the world. Such a record is bound
to damage our diplomatic efforts. What is your opinion on this
report?</P>
      <P>A: It is vital that the ROC performs a serious self-examination
and reviews both the criticism and advice being given. However, I
have said that establishing a nation based on human rights will be
the goal of the new government. Furthermore, I have consistently
encouraged everyone to let the ROC on Taiwan become a new landmark
for human rights in the 21st century. While striving for this
ultimate goal, though, it is important that we sincerely confront all
of the criticisms being made to our freedom and human rights record,
as such criticism usually signifies that our measures are
insufficient. Thus, I will ask the Executive Yuan, the Council of
Labor Affairs, and all other relevant government agencies to work
together and thoroughly review the human rights situation of foreign
laborers working in the ROC, and I will demand that they make changes
to improve those conditions.

    <TEXT>
      <P>A: I sincerely appreciate all of the comments and advice that
have been offered to both myself and the new government by people
from all walks of life, including different political parties and the
media. We especially appreciate the comments given by the KMT and
have listened to their opinions with an open mind. Indeed, with
respect to a few matters, we would particularly like to invite KMT
Chairman Lien Chan to meet with us and discuss them in person, as I
hope he can provide us with further insight into his opinions.
Nevertheless, we only have one nation and one national interest. I do
not believe any single political party would place their party's
interests before or above it. Similarly, I do not believe any
political party would place their own interests above those of the
people, and the KMT is no exception. For the sake of our nation's
future, the future of cross-strait relations, and the many
initiatives and reforms that are taking place in domestic affairs, I
again invite Chairman Lien, with utmost sincerity, to meet with me.
If he does not have time now, I can wait. If he cannot make it today,
I will wait until tomorrow; if he cannot meet me tomorrow, I will
wait until the day after; if he cannot meet this week, I will wait
until next week; and if he doesn't have time this month, I will wait
until the following month. I can afford to wait until he has time for
me to visit him. If the KMT headquarters is not an appropriate place
for such a meeting, that is fine. We can choose a different location.
Nothing-neither the time, place, form, or conditions-is preordained.
I sincerely represent both the nation and the government when I ask
for the opinions of Lien Chan, chairman of the largest political
party, the KMT.</P>
      <P>Naturally, this same sincere invitation is extended to the
leaders of all of Taiwan's primary political parties. In fact, we
have already made similar consultative arrangements in private. I
really do appreciate the opinions offered to us so far, and hope that
Chairman Lien can feel and accept my unreserved sincerity.</P>
      <P>Q.6 The Legislative Yuan is currently discussing whether to
postpone the approaching general interpellation session. Legislative
Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng has said that you favor postponing it.
If so, why?</P>
      <P>A: I exchanged views on this issue with the heads of all five
Yuans prior to my tour, and we agreed that the interval of time
between the last general interpellation, which lasted until the end
of July, and the next one, which would begin as soon as the
legislators meet in September, was probably too short. That is, if we
had the general interpellation immediately after the next
administrative report in early September, it might be too close to
the previous one, which lasted for a month and was just completed at
the end of July. Was postponement possible? The reasons for
postponement had nothing to do with Premier Tang or his health. The
only consideration was the length of the previous general
interpellation and the fact that it lasted so late into July. Was it
suitable or necessary to have another right away in September? I
brought the issue up merely as an exchange of views with President
Wang of the Legislative Yuan, and he thought the request reasonable.
Whether it will be postponed, however, will depend on inter-party
negotiations and communication between the Legislative Yuan and
Executive Yuan. We will respect the opinions of all political
parties, and we do not have any predetermined opinions. We simply
raised the issue and are discussing the facts.</P>
      <P>Q.7 It was the position and hope of the previous administration
that the Chinese mainland and Taiwan could be unified someday under
democracy. However, you have previously mentioned that unification is
but one of several options. Does this imply that unification might
not be possible?</P>
      <P>A: The new administration has already clearly explained this
issue. As I said in my inaugural speech on May 20, I hope the leaders
on both sides can deal with the future question of "one China" using
their wisdom and creativity under the basic principles of democracy
and parity. I believe that the future development of both
cross-strait relations and Taiwan itself will follow this direction.

      <P>Q.9 You mentioned earlier your expectations of the new Cabinet
and your opinions on its performance. How do you feel about Vice
President Lu's performance during your 13-day trip overseas? Also,
what is your view on her idea of relocating or renovating the Office
of the President?</P>
      <P>A: I would like to express both my appreciation and approval of
Vice President Lu's performance during my absence. Indeed, not only
did Vice President Lu perform well, but everyone-Premier Tang, all of
the relevant ministries, and everyone working on the front-line
during the typhoon period-did their jobs very well. Thus, I would
like to express an equal amount of appreciation and approval for
their performance.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Office of the President, we believe the building is
still in fairly good condition. Thus, there is no need for
renovation. Besides, I do not think renovating the Office of
President should be a priority for the new administration. I would
rather improve the living standards of our people, government
efficiency, and the investment environment for factories and
businesses, than renovate the Office of the President.</P>
      <P>Q.10: You just mentioned that the future for both the people on
Taiwan and cross-strait relations should respect the will of the
people on Taiwan. By what means do you hope to understand the will of
the people? You also said that such a problem should be discussed at
a roundtable meeting attended by the leaders of all three major
political parties and a special Multiparty Task Force. However, some
political parties are not giving their support to a Multiparty Task
Force. Under such circumstances, do you think that a consensus
reached by the two mechanisms just stated can really represent the
will of the people? Or do you think that other means should be
considered, such as a plebiscite, to truly reflect the will and
desires of the people? Indeed, if the two mechanisms reach completely
different conclusions, can using a plebiscite be completely ruled
out?</P>
      <P>A: A public opinion poll conducted yesterday indicated that more
than 80 percent of the people on Taiwan believe we should join the
United Nations. This is news that the Chinese communists do not like
to read. In fact, not only do they dislike it, but they have also
consistently boycotted and stymied any attempt made by the ROC to
participate in any international organization, including the United
Nations. This poll also revealed that between 70 and 80 percent of
the people on Taiwan prefer to maintain the status quo, regardless of
what direction cross-strait relations take in the future. The Beijing
authorities, however, want us to accept their "one-China" principle,
which would downgrade Taiwan as a part of the PRC. They also want us
to accept their so-called "one country, two systems" formula, which
would make Taiwan another Hong Kong or Macau. All of these things
obviously violate the will of the majority of the people on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>We are encouraged, however, by the remarks made by both the
Republican and Democratic parties in the United States-and especially
those made by President Clinton-that any final resolution to
cross-strait issues must respect the will of the people on Taiwan.
Public opinion polls currently indicate that most of the people on
Taiwan do not wish to be a part of the Chinese mainland, and this is
a fact that neither the US government nor the US people can force us
to change. Thus, during my transit through the US, Chairman Richard
Bush welcomed us on behalf of the US government and people. At that
time, he told me that the US government expressed its utmost support
and admiration for our new government's management of cross-strait
relations. Consequently, we do not feel that current cross-strait
relations are deteriorating, but rather, believe that we are still in
control of the situation.</P>
      <P>What we must do now is show our wisdom and creativity and make

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 29 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou on Tuesday blamed
the central government -- which has been bemoaning its own financial
difficulties -- for increasing its own annual budget while cutting
funding for his city.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the city's 2001 fiscal budget, which was approved by
the Taipei City Council on Tuesday, is 9 percent less than last
year's. He cited a smaller portion of the central government's
"budget pie" and insufficient tax income as the reasons for the
reduction -- the biggest drop since Taipei came under the central
government's direct jurisdiction in 1968.</P>
      <P>The central government's 2001 annual fiscal budget, which is
pending legislative approval, increased in contrast by over 6 percent
over the previous year.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet announced in mid-July that the special municipalities
of Taipei and Kaohsiung -- Taiwan's two largest cities -- will
receive 43 percent of the total amount destined for the nation's
cities, counties, townships, and villages, down from 47 percent in
fiscal 2000.</P>
      <P>Ma pointed out that the budget cut has affected several programs
such as labor insurance subsidies, high school student incidental
fees, medical subsidies for children under three years of age, and a
mental handicap subsidy that President Chen Shui-bian established
while he was still Taipei mayor.</P>
      <P>Ma went on to say that all cities should have their own roles,
and that Taipei is no different. Taipei represents Taiwan, he
claimed, and urged the central government to respect the legal status
of Taipei as a special municipality.</P>
      <P>He added that the imbalanced development of the nation's cities,
townships, and villages can be traced back to the central
government's hold on power and money. He urged the Taiwan public to
understand the importance of Taipei in adding to Taiwan's
competitiveness in the world, and not to try to "isolate" the city by
advocating equality regardless of the effects.</P>
      <P>Saying that the struggle for central funding has made him realize
that Taipei should follow a more self-sufficient path, Ma said that
his city will "walk ahead of the central government" within legal
limits instead of waiting for approval for everything, including
subsidies and sources of income.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MASTER HSIN TAO PROMOTES CROSS-STRAIT RELIGIOUS EXCHANGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Aug.  29  (CNA)
(By Eric Tseng and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Master Hsin Tao of Taiwan's Buddhist
Lingchiu Mountain Group is scheduled to play host to a breakfast
gathering Thursday to entertain religious leaders from Taiwan and
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Master Hsin Tao, who is leading a 15-member Taiwanese delegation
to the Millennium World Peace Summit of religious leaders which
opened Monday at the United Nations, said the Taiwan delegates have
had exchanges with the eight-member mainland Chinese delegation since
the first day of the summit.</P>
      <P>Religious people from both sides of the Taiwan Strait have worked
strenuously to enhance social stability and international harmony,
Hsin Tao said.</P>
      <P>Hsin Tao is scheduled to deliver a speech to the World Peace
summit on Thursday, the last day of the summit, to advocate praying
for world peace through the power of religion. He gave a five-minute
speech to the gathering on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Master Sheng Yen, one of the most reverend religious leaders in
Taiwan and founder of the Buddhist Foundation of the Dharma Drum
Mountain, delivered a speech to the summit Tuesday and said a prayer
in front of the summit before it split into discussion sessions.</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen stressed the importance of respect and tolerance,
saying that every one in the world has the right to exist and develop
and this right should be respected and tolerated.</P>
      <P>Despite having no official connection to the United Nations, the
first two days of the four-day summit are being held at the UN
headquarters, while the third- and fourth-day activities will take
place at New York's Waldorf Hotel.</P>
      <P>The meeting of more than 1,000 leaders drew controversy before it
even began when participants learned that conference organizers did
not invite the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, to
the event, for fear of offending mainland China.</P>
      <P>Master Sheng Yen and Master Yi Fa of Fokuangshan, another
prominent religious leader in Taiwan, are attending the summit in the
name of US Buddhist or religious groups, also apparently for fear of
retribution by Beijing.</P>
      <P>CNN founder Ted Turner, who is one of the financiers of the
summit, was invited to speak to the conference Tuesday. He said all
people around the world -- despite their differences in culture,
religion and other issues -- should not make distinctions between one
another. The media mogul stressed that there is only one kind of
people on the globe -- human beings.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROMOTING 'DIPLOMACY OF ALL PEOPLE' IS PART OF GOV'T POLICY: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 30 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Promoting the "diplomacy of all the people"
is part of the policies of the Republic of China government and will
be implemented beginning next year, a ranking official of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wei Wu-lien, director of a MOFA agency in charge of diplomatic
personnel training and nurturing, said concrete measures to
facilitate diplomacy of all the people have already begun. He added
that the new diplomatic line is aimed at materializing President Chen
Shui-bian's ideals of launching diplomacy of all the people, human
rights diplomacy and enabling Taiwan to play a greater role in the
international community.</P>
      <P>Noting that manpower is of the essence in achieving a nation's
revival, while education will be the foundation for a 100-year
national reconstruction, Wei said that nurturing talent and manpower
on a broad basis can help raise Taiwan's international
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>By promoting diplomacy of all the people, efforts and resources
from the government and the private sector can complement each other
in action so as to strengthen Taiwan's diplomatic front and make the
voices of Taiwan people heard more clearly, he added.</P>
      <P>Wei quoted a survey conducted by National Chung Cheng University
on the commission of the MOFA in July as indicating that 82 percent
of Taiwan citizens support the government's idea of establishing new
institutes of diplomacy studies as one method to promote diplomacy of
all the people.</P>
      <P>To begin with, the MOFA has organized short-term workshops on
international affairs and related activities. The first of which is
scheduled to kick off on Sept. 4, Wei said.</P>
      <P>Aides to lawmakers, political party workers in charge of foreign
affairs, local personnel working in international non-governmental
organizations, and other related talent will be accepted to attend
the international affairs workshops, he noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO PLAN FOR AMENDING UNIFICATION GUIDELINES: PRESIDENTIAL AIDE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  30  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has no plan to
amend the Guidelines for National Unification at the moment, acting
Secretary-General to the President Chen Che-nan said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen was responding to press reports that senior mainland Chinese
leaders have said if Taiwan revises its unification guidelines, it
will constitute a new barrier to communications across the Taiwan
Strait. Mainland leaders were also quoted as having claimed that
Taiwan's move to amend the guidelines will mark a dangerous alarm to
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Chen said the president clearly stated in his Aug. 28 press
conference that whether the Guidelines should be revised he will
fully respect mainstream public opinion concerning the issue.</P>
      <P>The Guidelines were formulated in 1991 during the Kuomintang
reign to serve as the highest directives governing Taiwan's policy
toward mainland China. The long-term goal of the Guidelines is to
establish a democratic, free and equitably prosperous China.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the newly formed Multiparty Task Force will
meet soon to discuss cross-strait relations and forge a national
consensus on all related issues.</P>
      <P>Chen said all the 25 members of the Multiparty Task Force will
hold a preliminary meeting Friday and will open its first formal
meeting at the Taipei Guest House Saturday.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Multiparty Task Force is composed of people with
different professional and political backgrounds, Chen said the
panel is expected to help forge a national consensus on
the delicate cross-strait issue and provide relevant counseling
services to the president.</P>
      <P>"President Chen will deliver a speech at the task force's meeting
on Sunday to express his support for the group and his expectations
of the panel's role in forging a national consensus on the future
development of cross-strait ties," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh, who concurrently serves
as convener of the Multiparty Task Force, is also expected to speak
at the meeting to call for resumption of the long-stalled
cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>In an effort to clarify speculation that the Multiparty Task
Force may discuss the role and function of the National Unification
Council (NUC) at its first meeting, Lee told the press Tuesday that
the NUC will continue to exist even after the inauguration of the
Multiparty Task Force.</P>
      <P>"The Multiparty Task Force will neither come up with a new
document as future cross-strait policy guidelines nor will it affect
the NUC's operations," said Lee, also a Nobel laureate.</P>
      <P>The Multiparty Task Force office said it has not arranged an
agenda for the panel's first meeting. "To show respects for all
members, the agenda will be decided after the task force holds a
preliminary meeting," said an office spokesman.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Presidential Office officials reiterated on
Wednesday that the Multiparty Task Force will not replace the NUC.
They further said the time is not right to discuss the
NUC-related problems.</P>
      <P>One of President Chen's close aides said the president touched
on the NUC issue during his Aug. 28 press conference mainly because
more than 80 percent of the respondents to a recent public opinion
poll on cross-strait ties said they prefer to maintain the status
quo. "As the finding runs counter to the NUC's ultimate goal, the
president has mentioned the issue in hopes of inspiring further
thinking of the issue," said the aide.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARMS SALES LIKELY TO CAUSE US-MAINLAND CHINA FRICTION: US ANALYSTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug. 29 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Since mainland China continues to link
its arms exports to other sensitive issues such as US military sales
to Taiwan, US concerns about specific sales will likely be a periodic
source of tension in relations between Washington and Beijing,
according to two American experts in East Asian affairs.</P>
      <P>Bates Gill, director of the Center for Northeast Asian Policy
Studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC, and Evan S.
Medeiros, a senior research associate with the East Asia Project at
the Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Monterey, California, made
the prediction in a co-authored report on mainland Chinese arms
exports.</P>
      <P>The two experts said that despite the declining volume of
mainland Chinese arms exports and its shrinking market share in the
international arms market, Beijing's arms exports will continue to be
an issue of concern for US policymakers and analysts.</P>
      <P>To be sure, they said, Beijing has made various pledges to halt
exports of missiles and related technologies to South Asia and the
Middle East. But two analysts put little faith in such rhetoric.
"China's current commitments are mostly bilateral, political promises
made in the context of US-China bargaining; they do not appear to be
rock-solid and unequivocal."</P>
      <P>Thus, a major downturn in PRC-US relations could lead Beijing to
overturn commitments and enter upon a new round of arms exports, they
added.</P>
      <P>The experts said such a scenario is not unlikely, given the range
of Beijing-Washington differences -- especially over security issues
like Taiwan. "China continues to link its restraint in arms exports
to diminishing US arms sales to Taiwan, and China could use its arms
exports to particular countries (such as Iran) as leverage in
bilateral debates over Taiwan-related issues," they said.</P>
      <P>Indeed, the PRC's vehement opposition to current US proposals to
provide Theater Missile Defense technology to East Asian partners,
especially to Taiwan, "could trigger a new round of arms exports from
Beijing," they wrote. They added that PRC officials have already
indicated that they consider TMD sales to Taiwan to be a form of
missile proliferation, which may lead Beijing to reconsider its
existing missile nonproliferation commitments.</P>
      <P>The experts noted that further complicating these issues are the
ambiguities and lack of transparency surrounding mainland China's
official policies and processes related to arms exports. The
principles which guide Beijing's official arms exports policy are
sufficiently flexible to justify almost any export on the grounds
that it contributes to the legitimate defense requirements of the
recipient.</P>
      <P>In addition, the 1997 PRC regulations covering military product
exports are vague on key points such as the numbers and types of
military organizations that can export arms. In aggregate, they said,
"these ambiguities are particularly worrisome because they can
provide opportunities for Chinese entities to illicitly export
military goods without the knowledge of central government
authorities."</P>
      <P>For example, the experts pointed out, reports surfaced in early
1999 that a mainland Chinese company had sold some type of
short-range missiles and long-range artillery systems to Armenia. But
in response to protests by Azerbaijan's Foreign Ministry, China's
Ambassador to Armenia Zhu Zhaoshun and Vice Foreign Minister Wang
Yingfan admitted that Beijing did not know of or approve the deal.</P>

      <P>In the meantime, Scobell wrote, it is vital for the United States
to recognize mainland China's sensitivity to TMD. It would be
foolhardy -- indeed, dangerous -- not to take the Chinese threats
seriously, he warned. "We must take every opportunity to remind China
about the destabilizing and threatening effect of the recent missile
buildup it has undertaken in the Taiwan Straits," he said.</P>
      <P>But he also urged Beijing to be sensitive to Taiwan's security
worries. "China should recognize that it is only natural with such a
proximate and growing threat that Taiwan would want to improve its
missile defense. Moreover, if Beijing wants to prevent Taipei from
deploying TMD, it should ask itself what steps China could take to
eliminate or minimize Taiwan's desire for such a system," he pointed
out.</P>
      <P>Scobell said it is likely that Communist China's defense
establishment will strengthen over time. However, rather than
obsessively focusing on the emergence of a more powerful threat,
mainland China's neighbors and the United States should pay more
attention to the strategic implications of a weak Communist
leadership.</P>
      <P>"Indeed, China today is not as powerful or as a significant
player as it is often made out to be. And there is the possibility
that China might become weaker militarily and economically and
perhaps evolve into a looser federal system or in a more extreme
case, even to fragment," he stressed.</P>
      <P>"While the possibility may be low, it cannot be completely ruled
out, and this eventuality must be seriously considered as a future
scenario. The dangers of not contemplating the unthinkable are
evident when one recalls that few analysts in the 1980s anticipated
or even entertained the possibility of a Soviet collapse," he wrote.</P>
      <P>Although arguing that Communist China will not succeed in
becoming a military world power during the next 10-15 years, the
analyst said this does not mean that he believes that mainland China
doesn't pose threat to the Asia-Pacific region. "Indeed, the
widely-held conviction that the PLA poses a modest or nuisance threat
gives rise to a dangerous tendency to downplay or dismiss the very
real threat China's military presents," he emphasized.</P>
      <P>Despite assurances that Beijing will be too preoccupied with
domestic matters to have time to get involved in foreign military
adventures, it should be remembered that leaders in Beijing seem
particularly prone to perceiving foreign threats if the mainland is
beset by domestic upheaval, he noted.</P>
      <P>That is especially if Beijing concludes that there is
"collaboration" between internal and external forces as in the case
of the popular pro-democracy protests of Spring 1989, Scobell said.
It is precisely at these moments when Beijing is likely to lash out,
in order to demonstrate to its enemies that it remains vigilant and
prepared, he added.</P>
      <P>However, Scobell said, rather than fear a highly-capable PLA
winning stunning victories, the militaries of the Asia-Pacific region
should be more concerned about the prospects of spectacular failure
for the mainland's armed forces.</P>
      <P>"The most plausible scenario is Taiwan. Failure on a grand scale
can come about either if China's leaders mistakenly believe the PLA
can win in a specific scenario and so proceed to launch an attack, or
if Beijing believes it is unlikely to win but has no choice but to go
ahead and attack anyway," he said.</P>
      <P>Either way, the results of a failed PRC military strike may be
worse than victory, particularly in the case of action in the Taiwan
Strait, Scobell said. This is because where Taiwan is involved,
Beijing is unlikely to admit defeat and desist, he said.</P>
      <P>If the PLA is vanquished on the battlefield Communist China is
likely to persist in its quest, and Beijing will seek to rebuild its
military might in order to ensure success the next time, the US
expert predicted. Thus, defeat will probably prolong and heighten
tensions in the region, rather than clear the air, he said.</P>
      <P>Scobell warned that such a PLA defeat might very well spark a
serious regional arms race, as mainland China's neighbors would
perceive an increasingly threatening security environment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S TREND MICRO OFFERS CURE TO WORLD'S 1ST PALM VIRUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  30  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan-based anti-virus software company
Trend Micro Devices Inc. on Wednesday offered a cure to the first
virus attacking handheld personal digital assistants (PDAs) using the
Palm operating system.</P>
      <P>Researchers of Trend Micro's "e Doctor Lab" said the latest
virus, a type known as a Trojan horse and dubbed "Palm.Liberty.A",
has the appearance of an upgrade for a Palm program, but instead
deletes most files from the PDA.</P>
      <P>Palm.Liberty.A is being distributed under the file name
"Crack1.1" through Internet Relay Chat, a network of chat sites. When
run, it deletes all the programs on the user's Palm device, though it
leaves the address book data, calendar and other databases intact,
Trend Micro researchers said.</P>
      <P>Trend Micro made a name for itself when it became the world's
first software company to devise a program to counter the infamous
Melissa virus. Trend Micro released its anti-Melissa program just 20
minutes after the virus was discovered. The company operates a
research center in California's Silicon Valley, and is the first
Taiwanese high-tech company to be listed on Japan's stock market.</P>
      <P>Trend Micro's team also reacted quickly to the first Palm virus,
which was discovered only on Tuesday. The firm's anti-virus
specialists reminded Internet users to be extremely careful when they
download any file from the Net.</P>
      <P>Internet users are welcome to visit Trend Micro's website at
http://wtc.trendmicro.com/taiwan/ to keep abreast of the latest
developments regarding viruses as well as download Trend Micro
software to detect and remove destructive programs from their own
systems, they noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MULTIPARTY TASK FORCE IS PRESIDENT CHEN'S POLITICAL PLOY: KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang issued a lengthy
statement Wednesday to explain its stances on the National
Unification Council (NUC) and the newly formed Multiparty Task Force
on relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The KMT, which ruled Taiwan for 55 years until May 20 and
now still controls a majority in the Legislative Yuan, issued the
statement after a weekly meeting of its elite Central Standing
Committee.</P>
      <P>The KMT statement came just ahead of the inauguration of the
Multiparty Task Force, which was formed under the Republic of
China's new Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-led government. The
25-member task force will hold a preliminary meeting Friday and
open its first formal meeting this weekend.</P>
      <P>The KMT claimed that the Multiparty Task Force is merely
President Chen Shui-bian's political ploy to weaken the role of the
NUC and even to completely replace the NUC, which was set up in 1990
during the KMT reign to serve as the president's advisory board.</P>
      <P>Since the NUC has functioned well over the past decade, the KMT
said, it couldn't understand why President Chen would form another
body for similar consultative purposes.</P>
      <P>Blaming the Multiparty Task Force as a redundant organ, the KMT
accused President Chen of intending to use the so-called consensus to
be worked out by the panel as an excuse to justify his refusal to
chair the NUC or his plan to abolish the NUC.</P>
      <P>The KMT also criticized Chen for his failure to consult with it
before recruiting several of its individual members to join the task
force, saying the practice runs counter to the norm of party
politics in democratic countries.</P>
      <P>The KMT further warned that the creation of the Multiparty Task
Force to discuss Taiwan's future at this moment could ignite a new
round of debate on whether Taiwan should seek cross-strait
unification or move toward independence. "Our observation is that
such debate would add up to uncertainty in cross-strait relations
and such development does not comply with the mainstream public
desire for stability in the Taiwan Strait," the KMT statement said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the KMT pointed out that nearly all other opposition
parties support the KMT-established mechanism for handling
cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the KMT said, President Chen's urgent
task does not lie in seeking cross-party consensus on cross-strait
ties, but rather in forging an intraparty consensus within his own
DPP on the issue.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the weekly KMT meeting, Su Chi, a former Mainland
Affairs Council chairman, said President Chen's overture that
unification is just an option for Taiwan's future will not
have any constructive impact on the development of
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>"Open-ended debate on Taiwan's future at this moment will only
cause uncertainty and anxiety among local people and will not help
mitigate cross-strait tension," Su warned, adding that a new round
of "unification-independence" debate could even affect domestic
economic development and social stability.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Premier Tang Fei on
Wednesday directed the Transportation Ministry and the Public
Construction Committee to keep the effects on traffic of the Kaoping
Bridge collapse to a minimum.</P>
      <P>After hearing reports from the two Cabinet-level bodies, Tang
ordered repairs on the highway bridge connecting Kaohsiung and
Pingtung counties to be completed by April next year. He also
instructed that a new bridge spanning the Kaoping River should be
completed within three years.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, he said, related agencies should maintain
careful surveillance of the increased loads on other bridges over the
Kaoping River caused by the closure of the collapsed bridge, and
should also heighten nationwide inspections of all bridges.</P>
      <P>A 100-meter section of the 2,000-meter Kaoping Bridge collapsed
Sunday afternoon, taking 18 vehicles crashing down with it. Some 22
people were injured in the incident, but there were no fatalities.</P>
      <P>At a weekly Cabinet meeting, Minister of Transportation and
Communications Yeh Chu-lan reported to Tang that her ministry has
already directed related agencies to plan alternate traffic routes.
Four national and provincial highways have been mapped out as
possible detours, she added.</P>
      <P>Yeh went on to say that most detour signs have already been put
in place and the rest will be ready by the end of the week at the
latest. Her ministry has also ordered a print run of new road maps
showing the detours.</P>
      <P>She added that her ministry is obligated to take full
responsibility for the 22 injured people and said an ad hoc team will
be formed to assist the injured with their medical care and
compensation-related matters.</P>
      <P>Lin Neng-pai, chairman of the Public Construction Commission,
said at the same meeting that his commission has already formed a
special task force to probe the bridge collapse and that the team is
scheduled to announce its preliminary investigative conclusions and
recommendations on Saturday.</P>

parties to discuss whether to postpone the opening of the next
general interpellation session from its scheduled date of Sept. 15.</P>
      <P>Wang, who had just returned from a visit to the United States,

there will be more time to prepare for the main focus of the new
session -- a review of the general budget of the central government.</P>

      <P>The total market value of shares on the
Taiwan Stock Exchange (TSE) has been cut by 14 percent, or NT$1.39
trillion (US$44.83 billion), during the last three months, according
to statistics released Wednesday by the TSE.</P>
      <P>The TSE Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX), the key

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL BUDDHIST MASTER CALLS FOR MUTUAL RESPECT AMONG RELIGIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Aug.  29  (CNA)
(By Eric Tseng and C.M. Huang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Master Sheng Yen, founder of Taiwan's
Buddhist Foundation of the Dharma Drum Mountain, called on Tuesday
for mutual respect and tolerance among religious and other groups to
ensure world peace.</P>
      <P>He said he believes all religious and spiritual leaders are
peace-loving people, but "there still exists the fact that different
religions clash or even provoke wars against each other."</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen made the call on the second day of the Millennium World
Peace Summit for religious and spiritual leaders which opened at
United Nations Headquarters a day earlier. Over 1,000 religious and
spiritual leaders from all over the world are attending the four-day
meeting. The gathering provides a forum to explore ways to resolve
world conflicts and achieve world peace.</P>
      <P>The senior monk, who was the first speaker, asked the world's
religious and spiritual leaders to be tolerant of each other. "If you
find that the doctrines of your faith contain something that is
intolerant of other groups, or contradicts the promotion of world
peace, then you should make new interpretations of those doctrines,"
he said.</P>
      <P>"Every wholesome religion should get along peacefully with other
groups so that it can, step by step, influence humankind to stay far
away from the causes of war," he added.</P>
      <P>He also stressed that religious people should cultivate wisdom to
help them resolve problems such as poverty, environmental pollution
and conflicts.</P>
      <P>People around the world, despite their different faiths, should
respect and love each other because "we are neighbors in the global
village. Indeed, we are all sons and daughters born of the same
Mother Universe," he explained.</P>
      <P>It was his second speech since the meeting opened. During the
opening ceremony, he introduced his ideas of how to "uplift the
character of mankind and build the world into a pure land." The
Buddhist leader is attending the meeting in his capacity as founder
of the Dharma Drum Mountain Buddhist Association of the United
States, apparently because the organizers feared it would offend
Beijing if he came as a representative of the Taiwan headquarters of
the organization.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet, was not
invited to the meeting due to pressure from mainland China, but he
prepared a message that was read to the meeting by one of his
representatives.</P>
      <P>In addition to Master Sheng Yen, several other Buddhist leaders
from Taiwan are also attending the meeting, including Master Hsin Tao
of the Lingchiu Mountain and Master Yi Fa of the Buddhist Fukuangshen
Group.</P>
      <P>The summit is being held at two locations, with open dialogues
held at United Nations Headquarters and closed-door sessions taking
place at a New York hotel. The meeting will close on Thursday.</P>

    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Aug.  30  (CNA)
(By Mike Chang &amp; Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono on
Wednesday reiterated Japan's hope that the cross-Taiwan Strait issue
will be resolved peacefully through dialogue.</P>
      <P>"This is our consistent stance," Kono said while giving a keynote
address to 130 faculty members and cadres at China's Central Party
School in Beijing, according to reports reaching Tokyo.</P>
      <P>Speaking on Taiwan, Kono said Japan will continue to maintain
unofficial relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that in order to safeguard peace and stability
in Northeast Asia, a dialogue mechanism must be set up among the
nations of the region to further promote understanding.</P>
      <P>Touching on the Korean peninsula issue, Kono suggested that North
Korea, South Korea, the United States, Japan, mainland China and
Russia should set up a "six-member organization" to promote dialogue
between Seoul and Pyongyang.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Tokyo-Beijing relations, Kono noted that
anti-Beijing feeling is escalating in Japan. Beijing's national
defense budget increases year by year and Beijing's failure to
appreciate Japan's economic assistance to Beijing have also invited
criticism and doubt from the Japanese people, he said.</P>
      <P>He said future Japanese economic assistance to Beijing must get
the understanding and support of the people of both nations. Japan
had originally planned to offer a special loan of 17.2 billion yen to
Beijing, but it has been shelved due to objections from the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) over Beijing "spy ships" operating in
Japanese territorial waters.</P>
      <P>Kono said that he has suggested that the two sides set up a
mechanism to resolve the ship incursion dispute and added that he
reached a tentative agreement on the matter on Aug. 28 with his
mainland counterpart Tang Jia-xuan. Details of the agreement will be
discussed in September, Kono saidn.</P>
      <P>Touching on Beijing's opposition to a proposed theater missile
defense system (TMD) to be jointly produced by Japan and the United
States, Kono said that Japan has not yet decided whether it wants to
be part of the system.</P>
      <P>He also categorically denied that there has been a revival of
militarism in Japan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei on Wednesday instructed
related agencies to be cautious of a possible change in direction of
Typhoon Maria and to make preparations to avoid possible storm
damage.</P>
      <P>Tang issued his instructions after listening to a report by Chao
Kang, chief of the National Fire Administration, regarding measures
to reinforce disaster prevention and rescue operations.</P>
      <P>Maria, the 13th tropical storm this year, remained stationary
Wednesday afternoon in the South China Sea near the Tungsha Islands
and weather forecasters said it would probably move northeastward
toward southwestern Taiwan in the near future.</P>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) had just lifted a land warning
for Typhoon Prapiroon, but warned that seas around Taiwan's northern
and northeastern coast were still under Prapiroon's influence.</P>
      <P>Although Prapiroon did not cause much damage to Taiwan, the
disaster prevention and rescue centers around this island were still
on the alert for Maria.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MANY ROC AGENCIES BACK CONTINUED FREEZE ON FILIPINO WORKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  30  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Many government agencies and private
associations Wednesday gave a thumbs-down to a proposal to lift a ban
on the import of Philippine workers.</P>
      <P>Officials from relevant government agencies and representatives
from private industry and manpower agencies associations voiced their
opposition at an inter-ministerial meeting called by the
Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA).</P>
      <P>The CLA announced in May a three-month import ban on workers from
the Philippines, effective from June 1, due to a combination of
factors, including Manila representative office's frequent
interference in disputes between Filipinos and local employers.</P>
      <P>As the ban is set to expire Thursday, the CLA invited officials
from various agencies and trade associations to discuss whether the
ban should be extended or lifted.</P>
      <P>The inter-ministerial meeting, chaired by CLA Vice Chairman Kuo
Chi-jen, was attended by officials from the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, the National Police Administration, the Bureau of
Immigration, the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD), the Chinese National Federation of Industries, the ROC
General Chamber of Commerce (GCC) and manpower brokerages
associations in Taipei, Kaohsiung and other major cities around the
island.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, CEPD officials and representatives from major
trade and manpower agents associations called for an extension of the
ban on the grounds that more time is needed to ascertain Manila's
sincerity in wishing to resolve some unsolved problems involving
Filipino workers.</P>
      <P>For one thing, they said, the abscondence rate among the workers
remains high. Of the 5,234 unaccountable absconding foreign workers,
2,666 are Philippine nationals. CLA tallies show that Philippine
workers' abscondence rate stood at 2.47 percent in July, the highest
rate among all foreign workers.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials said the Philippine government has not fully
fulfilled the five ROC demands for improving Philippine
worker-related issues over the past three months, including whether
the Philippine government has agreed to pay the medical bills of
illegal Filipino workers and repay the funds that the CLA paid in the
past.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials further said that although the Manila Economic and
Cultural Office (MECO), which represents Philippine interests in
Taipei in the absence of formal diplomatic ties, promised not to
interfere with labor-management disputes involving Philippine
workers, it remained unclear whether it would present a written
guarantee.</P>
      <P>GCC representatives complained that MECO had still failed to take
steps to discourage legally imported Philippine workers from
absconding, while some manpower agents complained that Philippine
officials are not polite when dealing with them over relevant issues.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, some manpower agencies from central Taiwan said
they support the lifting of the import ban as it would help local
high-tech companies to resolve manpower shortage problems.</P>
      <P>After the debate, CLA Vice Chairman Kuo did not make an immediate
decision on whether the ban will be retained or lifted after the
current ban expires at the end of August.</P>
      <P>He said the CLA will make a final decision within two days, based
on the opinions expressed by the various quarters.</P>

      <P>The opposition Kuomintang, which lost its
55-year grip on power in Taiwan in last March's presidential
election, has urged its members to re-register between Sept. 1 and
Dec. 31.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan and the four party vice chairmen will take
the lead by re-registering at the party's Taipei City Committee on
Sept. 1, accompanied by Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who is also a
party member.</P>
      <P>Chan Chun-po, director of the KMT Taipei City Committee, told the
media that re-registration of party members is an important step in
the party's reform efforts.</P>
      <P>He noted that the move is also directly connected with next
spring's nomination of KMT candidates for the election of legislators
and with next summer's direct election of party chairman by party
members.</P>
      <P>The KMT boasted of having 2.5 million members before the
presidential election. But after the election, the party discovered
that the figure had been inflated.</P>
      <P>The KMT National Congress has adopted a comprehensive reform

    <HEADLINE>FORMOSA PLASTICS TO BEGIN OIL SALES IN SEPTEMBER</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Formosa Plastics
will produce an annual 6.4 million tons of diesel, 4.29 million tons
of gasoline, and 3.81 million tons of naphtha starting September, a
senior official of the Taiwan plastics giant said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Introduction of the company's petroleum products to the local
market in September will break the decades-old state monopoly in the
local oil industry.</P>
      <P>Wang Yung-fa, vice manager of Formosa Plastic's oil refining
department, said that the company's new 407-hectare refinery plant
will manufacture 12 petrochemical products, including diesel,
gasoline, naphtha, and aviation fuel.</P>
      <P>Wang added that the plant's daily oil refinery capacity is
450,000 barrels, making it the largest oil refinery in the world to
be built in such a short time. Construction of the plant cost NT$93
billion (US$3 billion), he said.</P>
      <P>Chi Chun-chin, vice president of Formosa Life Station, Taiwan's
first private oil company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Formosa
Plastics Group, said that approximately 300 gas stations nationwide
have already joined its franchise.</P>
      <P>Chi said that another 550 gas stations are expected to become a
part of the company's franchise by the end of next year and possibly
help Formosa Plastics garner 50 percent of the market.</P>
      <P>With the Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) monopoly on the local oil
market broken, oil prices will be set by free market factors for the
first time.</P>
      <P>A senior CPC official said that Formosa Plastics' entry into the
local oil market will help lower prices, but added that an expected
rise in international crude prices in September will likely maintain
upward pressure on local oil prices.</P>
      <P>The official said that some gas stations may sacrifice their
profit margin temporarily in order to be more competitive.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that domestic consumer prices are facing a
sensitive moment due to the recent passage of several typhoons.
Therefore, he said, the CPC is not willing to adjust its prices for
fear of triggering an increase in consumer prices.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REVENUE OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE EXPECTED TO GROW BY 20%</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The telecommunications service will grow by
around 20 percent this year, according to figures released Wednesday
on the eve of the Taipei international telecommunications show.</P>
      <P>According to the China External Trade Development Council, the
increase has been due to the liberalization of the telecommunications
market and the increasing popularity of the Internet over the past
two years.</P>
      <P>The council said that the domestic production value of Taiwan's
telecommunications industry in 1999 totaled NT$116.63 billion
(US$3.75 billion), while its overseas production value reached
NT$24.36 billion.</P>
      <P>In terms of the structure of the products, 1999 was a year that
saw the rising popularity of mobile phones, with production of 1
million in Taiwan and 1.8 million overseas.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the market for buyers of second mobile
phones will surpass that of first-time buyers, with ample room for
growth.</P>
      <P>Some 84 percent of locally produced telecommunications products
were for export, with the top three destinations being North America
(43 percent), Western Europe (20 percent), and mainland China (11
percent).</P>
      <P>One noteworthy phenomenon is that the mainland China market was
larger than that of Japan (9 percent).</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the telecommunications industry will see a
dramatic increase this year, with domestic production value of
telecommunications products growing by 38.9 percent to reach
NT$162.06 billion (US$5.17 billion), while the growth of overseas
production value will reach a whopping 127.4 percent, or NT$55.39
billion (US$1.78 billion).</P>
      <P>In the telecommunications service market, the number of mobile
phone users grew by 144 percent last year, while the number of
Internet users grew by 59 percent. The revenue of telecommunications
services was NT$233.5 billion (US$7.5 billion)last year, and this
year is expected to grow by 20 percent to NT$279.9 billion (US$9

    <HEADLINE>MAC WILL MULL 'KINMEN SPECIAL ZONE' PROPOSAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,   Aug.   30   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will mull the
proposal to develop the frontline island of Kinmen into a "special
trade zone" after the "mini three links" across the Taiwan Strait
are opened smoothly, a senior official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>John C.C. Teng, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland
China, made the statement at a public hearing on Kinmen's
future economic development.</P>
      <P>The hearing was organized by opposition Kuomintang
Legislator Chen Ching-pao to discuss pros and cons of the planned
opening of "mini three links," which refers to the opening of direct
trade, postal and shipping links between Taiwan's outlying islands
of Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu and mainland China's southeastern
coastal cities such as Xiamen and Fuzhou.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen said the government should simultaneously
consider developing Kinmen into a "special economic zone" for
Taiwan-mainland China trade to help boost the frontline's economic
development.</P>
      <P>In response, Teng said the proposal deserves further discussion.
"In fact, the 'special zone' concept is not new in Taiwan. We
already have export processing zones, high-tech industrial parks and
offshore cross-strait transshipping center. We can apply these
successful experiences to boost Kinmen's development," he noted.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Teng said, all the above-mentioned projects have
managed to succeed mainly because they have been implemented only
after long-term planning and extensive discussion.</P>
      <P>At the moment, Teng said, the MAC focuses its efforts on
evaluating the possible impact of the opening of "mini three links"
on Kinmen's security, law and order, as well as its overall
economy.</P>
      <P>"We hope the opening will not cause any adverse impact on the
well-being of all Kinmen residents and our country's overall
defense operations," Teng said.</P>
      <P>He noted that the MAC will unveil a detailed evaluation
report in mid-September as originally scheduled. "We will then begin
practical planning work to pave the way for actual opening of 'mini
three links,'" Teng added.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday
that public service enriches life, self-sacrifice makes life more
meaningful and helping others makes life more colorful.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with recipients of this
year's "Good Men, Good Deeds" Award. A total of 85 individuals and 45
groups were cited this year for their public-spirited deeds and
contributions.</P>
      <P>The human rights lawyer-turned-president said he is convinced
that everybody is a good person and can do good deeds every day and
everywhere.</P>
      <P>Many of this year's award recipients had contributed greatly to
relief and rehabilitation work after Taiwan was rattled by a
devastating earthquake on Sept. 21, 1999.</P>
      <P>Chen said the 921 earthquake shattered Taiwan's landscape,
destroyed many homes and claimed some 2,400 lives. "Thanks to your
humanitarian concern and voluntary assistance, many earthquake
victims have managed to get on their feet again. I appreciate and
admire your great contributions," he added.</P>
      <P>Saying that all Taiwan residents, regardless of their ethnic
origin, profession, social status or political affiliation, form one
big family, Chen said "all family members should help each other
without prejudice or bias."</P>
      <P>Chen said he believes that the contribution of each "Good Men,
Good Deeds" award recipient marks an epic story and can serve as good
materials for school textbooks.</P>
      <P>Touching on his just-concluded overseas visit, Chen said he feels
proud to see ROC religious, charity, educational, medical and
agricultural groups offer assistance and services to the ROC's
allies.</P>
      <P>"Following my first post-inauguration overseas trip, I have come
to understand that service is not an obligation, but a privilege," he
said, adding that the ROC should help its allies with economic
development because doing so is tantamount to helping itself.</P>
      <P>Chen's Aug. 13-25 "journey of friendship" took him to the
Caribbean nation of the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua and Costa Rica
in Central America, and three African states -- the Gambia, Burkina
Faso and Chad.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou confirmed
Wednesday that he will jointly sponsor a cross-Taiwan Strait ties
forum with Hsu Hsin-liang, senior adviser to the president, in
mid-September.</P>
      <P>He was responding to domestic media reports that the Rising
People Foundation led by Hsu, and the New Taiwanese Foundation
chaired by Ma, are planning to hold a supra-party cross-strait ties
round-table forum in mid-September.</P>
      <P>It was reported that organizers will invite the chairmen of the

People First Party -- Frank Hsieh, Lien Chan and James Soong -- as
well as several others well-versed in cross-strait affairs, including

      <P>Ma urged the public not to associate the forum with "unnecessary

terms with the supra-party ad hoc group on cross-strait affairs
advocated by President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>He also noted that the agenda of the forum has yet to be

      <P>Meanwhile, Ma said that a visit to mainland China on Sept. 4-13

magazine reported in its Sept. 8 issue.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Vice President Hu Jintao is to take over
from Jiang Zemin as Communist Party general secretary and state
president. Jiang will retain his chairmanship of the Central Military
Commission, thus remaining the power behind the throne.</P>
      <P>In addition, the report went on, Guangdong Communist Party
Secretary Li Changchun has replaced Vice Premier Wen Jiabao as the
front-runner for Premier Zhu Rong-ji's job. Zhu has long made it
clear that he does not wish to serve a second term and Li's Guangdong
roots may help defuse resentment about the ever-expanding clout of
Jiang's "Shanghai faction," according to the magazine.</P>
      <P>Hu and party personnel chief Zeng Qinghong will be in charge of

    <HEADLINE>ADMINISTRATION NEEDS TO SHARPEN ITS COORDINATION: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 31 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei admitted on Thursday that
there are some aspects of the administration's efficiency that need
to be honed, particularly in its coordination capabilities.</P>
      <P>In his first press conference since taking office on May 20, Tang
promised to the country that his administration is willing to listen
to any advice and criticism that comes from a spirit of good will to
improve the government's performance and efficiency. "Criticism is
the driving force behind progress," he said.</P>
      <P>Tang, who was defense minister before being appointed premier by
President Chen Shui-bian after Chen won the 2000 presidential
election and ended the Kuomintang's 55-year grip on executive power
in Taiwan, said that the Executive Yuan will lose no time in speeding
up the administrative locomotive so as to "more quickly address the
public's urgent needs and better safeguard their interests."</P>
      <P>The premier stressed that the administration has no plans to
reshuffle its personnel, at least not in the immediate future.</P>
      <P>He said it is unfair to judge a minister's performance or
capability after only three months. "If anyone is to blame for the
administration's not-so-commendable performance, then that person is
me," Tang proclaimed.</P>
      <P>Tang made the remarks three days after President Chen said in his
latest press conference that if there were "people" (Cabinet
officials) who cannot keep up the pace or cope with the tempo of the
ongoing reform efforts, they should be replaced.</P>
      <P>Tang spelled out his administrative guidelines and goals at the
press conference. He said the Executive Yuan has completed a
preliminary blueprint for developing Taiwan into a "green silicon
island," and plans to usher Taiwan into the era of the "knowledge
economy" so as to allow the island's residents a better living
environment while retaining its economic competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Reacting to wide criticism of the new government's economic
policies and a spate of major mishaps, including the Pachang Creek
tragedy and the collapse of Kaoping Bridge, Tang said that these
abnormalities are reflections of a breakdown of public integrity and
law and order, as well as a symbol of Taiwan's decreasing
international competitiveness.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that if these trends are not effectively reversed,
the country's long-term development will be hindered.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANTI-CORRUPTION CRUSADE AIMED AT CREATING BETTER CLIMATE: PM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei said Thursday that the
government's current campaign against corruption in financial
institutions is mainly aimed at creating a better business climate
and maintaining long-term economic stability.</P>
      <P>The four star-general-turned-premier made the remarks at his
first press conference since taking office on May 20.</P>
      <P>Tang said although the government's investigations into loan
scandals or kickback scams involving some local financial
institutions have caused a stock market slump, the efforts to stamp
out corruption will have a positive effect on Taiwan's overall
business environment in the long run.</P>
      <P>Noting that lending irregularities in the financial institutions
are "minority cases" after all, Tang said the ongoing
anti-corruption campaign will only bring about "short-term" pain.</P>
      <P>"If we are daunted by 'short-term' pain and fail to take action
against corruption in banking institutions, we may have to endure
'long-term' pain and a gloomier future," the premier warned.</P>
      <P>Tang rejected allegations that the current probes into bank
lending activities are a government tactic to win back the
public's support after many of its policy goals, directions and
measures failed to live up to public expectations.</P>
      <P>"The government has no political consideration in launching the
anti-corruption campaign," Tang stressed, adding that the
government's only concern is to wipe out irregularities and
streamline financial market order.</P>
      <P>Tang further said Taiwan's economic fundamentals are healthy and
sound. "My observation is that the recent stock market plunge was
mainly caused by psychological factors or confidence problems," he
noted.</P>
      <P>In fact, Tang said, the public need not be pessimistic about the
country's economic prospects. "Most of our listed companies have
registered gains in their business turnover so far this year, and
our exports and industrial production continue rising," he added.</P>
      <P>Turning to the national pension system issue, Tang said the
government must exercise prudence in designing and implementing the
proposed social welfare program.</P>
      <P>"Many countries have suffered setbacks in implementing a national
pension system. We cannot afford to endure a failure. We must
carefully craft a well-designed system to cater to the domestic
demand and ensure its success," Tang said.</P>
      <P>As local economists and experts in the relevant field remain far
divided over the designing and timing for implementation, Tang
said the government will not decide when the pension system will
be inaugurated until after further discussion with the
legislature.</P>
      <P>The government has mulled the national pension system issue for
more than 10 years and has been working on details of the system
in the past four years. However, the nation still fails to forge
a consensus on most of the details concerning the system. Premier
Tang said earlier this month that the proposed national pension
system cannot be inaugurated in January 2001 as originally promised.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE FARMERS HIT HARD BY CHINA'S ECONOMIC REFORMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  31 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hundreds of millions of Chinese farmers
have been hit hard as they missed out on the benefits of mainland
China's economic reforms, forcing them to resort to demonstrations
against the growing abuse of power by local officials.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Hong Kong, The Australian Financial Review on
Thursday reported that the villages around Fengcheng in the
impoverished central province of Jiangxi -- a key recruiting ground
for the Chinese Communist Party during the late 1920s and early 1930s
-- are now at the vanguard of a new social movement in mainland
China, with up to 20,000 poor farmers rioting last week in protest of
onerous local taxes.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted the Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human
Rights and Democracy in China as revealing that at least 50 farmers
had been arrested after attacking the offices and homes of local
government officials, and prompting Beijing to send more than 2000
police to villages around Fengcheng. By last Wednesday, the protests
spread to other towns of Yuandu, Baitu, Duantang and Xiaotang, the
daily reported.</P>
      <P>"Farmers do not have enough to eat, while even a junior Yuandu
township official will be able to own at least a car and a house,"
the daily quoted an unnamed farmer at Yuandu as saying.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that many of the rural communities that
account for 70 percent of China's population of 1.3 billion are
increasingly missing out on the benefits of Beijing's program of
economic reform, which was started in 1978 by Deng Xiaoping, the late
former paramount leader.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted a recent study by China's Rural Development
Institute as indicating that the average income of urban workers in
1999 was 2.65 times that of rural workers, compared to 2.51 times
greater than rural laborers in 1998.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAINAN SCIENCE PARK TO BE COMPLETED AHEAD OF SCHEDULE: NSC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan  County,  Aug.  31  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Development of Taiwan's second
science-based industrial park will be completely finished in 2005,
about five years ahead of schedule, National Science Council (NSC)
Chairman Weng Cheng-yi said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Tainan Science-based Industrial Park (TSIP), patterned after
Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park in northern Taiwan, is touted
as Taiwan's second "Silicon Valley" and is located in Hsinshih
township in the southern Taiwan's Tainan County.</P>
      <P>By 2005, when the site has been fully completed, about 200
high-tech companies over a span of ten years are expected to begin
operations there, Weng said, adding that these firms will hire some
77,000 employees and generate business worth over NT$900 billion
(US$29 billion) every year.</P>
      <P>Noting that the development of such high-tech industrial centers
is based on a "win-win" principle, Weng said the southern science
park will not only be the latest engine of Taiwan's "knowledge
economy," but also will become a locomotive power for economic,
social and cultural development in nearby areas.</P>
      <P>TSIP is committed to being a good neighbor to proximate areas,
Weng added. In the future, he said, the southern science park will
combine its industrial operations with a protected natural sanctuary.
It will include a museum, and also conserve several invaluable
archaeological sites and some parts of a sugar cane plantation, he
said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Chun-wei, director of the TSIP Preparatory
Committee, the park will consist of an area of 638 hectares, of which
262 hectares will be reserved for company and plant locations. So
far, 70 percent of roads in the park have already been completed, 70
percent of the public facilities are available, but only about 5
percent of the projected landscape development has been finished,
Chen noted.</P>
      <P>TSIP, which became partially operational in 1998, currently has
42 companies on its registration list. Of the total, 13 have already
become operational and begun commercial production, while six have
just begun construction and development.</P>
      <P>Water supply, an issue of concern to many industrialists, will be
tackled in time, Chen continued. Daily water consumption is
forecasted to reach 200,000 metric tons eventually, and the volume is
expected to be supplied jointly by Taiwan Water Company and the Chia
Nan Farmland and Irrigation Association, he said. To further secure a
safe supply, Chen said, TSIP authorities may also consider the
establishment of a desalination plant.</P>
      <P>The park will have its own incineration plant, landfill and waste
water processing system to manage waste from TSIP companies, Chen

    <HEADLINE>'ENDEMIC' FINANCIAL STORM IS UNLIKELY IN TAIWAN: BUSINESS MAGNATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 31 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An "endemic" financial storm is unlikely to
occur in Taiwan as the country's business and industrial structures
are healthy and sound, a local business magnate said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Jeffrey Koo, chairman of the Chinese National Association of
Industry and Commerce, discounted current worries that the
government's ongoing anti-corruption campaign, which has driven the
local bourse to a new low and sent shock waves through the island's
banking institutions, will eventually trigger an "endemic" financial
storm.</P>
      <P>Koo said the Asian economic crisis, which began to batter Asia in
late 1997, was mainly caused by excessive borrowing in Southeast
Asian countries -- which is not the case in Taiwan. He added that any
dramatic economic crash on the island is unlikely, as Taiwan has
almost no foreign debt and holds foreign reserves of greater than
US$120 billion.</P>
      <P>Koo, who was part of President Chen Shui-bian's entourage
visiting Central America and Africa earlier this month, said that
unless a war erupts, the government should never step in to intervene
in the stock market.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he pointed out, the Taiwan stock market has
developed in a biased and abnormal manner, with the majority of funds
pouring into technology stocks while prices of traditional industrial
stocks have dropped to levels below their initial offering price.</P>
      <P>Koo said this situation, which is seldom seen in other countries,
can only be alleviated if the government addresses it with power and
determination.</P>
      <P>However, Koo did not elaborate on exactly how the government work
to revive the local bourse.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO URGENCY TO DISCUSS NUC PROBLEMS: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei said Thursday he sees no
urgency for the Republic of China government to handle issues
related to the National Unification Council (NUC) and the Guidelines
for National Unification at the moment.</P>
      <P>Tang made the statement in response to an inquiry about his
views concerning relations across the Taiwan Strait at his
first press conference since taking office on May 20.</P>
      <P>Both the NUC and the unification guidelines are part of the
ROC government's mechanism for handling cross-strait ties. Both of
them were set up or formulated a decade ago during the Kuomintang
reign.</P>
      <P>Following the transition of power from the KMT to the
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), there have been
discussions whether the unification guidelines should be revised,
whether President Chen Shui-bian should follow the precedent set by
his predecessor to chair the NUC, and other related issues.</P>
      <P>Asked about his views on the NUC and the unification
guidelines, Premier Tang said he is not in a position to make any
comments on the issue because the NUC is basically a consultative
body to the president.</P>
      <P>But at the request of journalists, Tang still expressed his
opinions about the issue. Weighing the current circumstances, Tang
said, it is not the right time to discuss whether the unification
guidelines should be amended or whether the NUC should be abolished.</P>
      <P>The four star-general-turned-premier further said he hopes that
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can resume regular dialogue as
soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Tang pointed out that the current cross-strait deadlock lies in
different views on "one China." Noting that Beijing interprets "one
China" as the "People's Republic of China," Tang said the Republic of
China government and people cannot accept Beijing's "one China"
principle, which downgrades the ROC to a province under the PRC.</P>
      <P>Tang stressed what the ROC wants is "dignity" and "parity" in
dealing with Beijing. "So the ball is now in Beijing's court. We
hope mainland will make positive response to our numerous goodwill
gestures and resume cross-strait dialogue on an equal, reciprocal
basis," he added.</P>
      <P>Asked about the role of the newly formed Multiparty Task Force
for cross-strait ties, Tang said the formation of the new body is
part of the government's efforts to seek a national consensus on the
future development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Tang said as local people remain divided over whether Taiwan
should move toward independence, seek cross-strait unification or
maintain the status quo, the new 25-member Multiparty Task Force is
expected to help forge a national consensus to serve as a basis for
future cross-strait negotiations.</P>
      <P>The Multiparty Task Force, headed by Nobel laureate Lee
Yuan-tseh, will hold a preliminary meeting Friday and is scheduled
to call its first formal meeting Saturday.</P>
      <P>The task force, composed of representatives from across the
political and social spectrum, will serve as an advisory board to the
president.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Tropical Storm Maria, the 13th such storm
in the Pacific this year, is now moving on a northward path and is
less likely to influence Taiwan, officials of the Central Weather
Bureau (CWB) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The 13th tropical storm has changed its direction from northeast
to north, and it is moving at 12 kilometers per hour, the officials
said. Maria was located 500 kilometers from the southwest coast of
Taiwan and was moving at 12 kilometers per hour at 9:30 a.m.
Thursday, they added, noting that it is less likely to affect the
island.</P>
      <P>But the CWB said that if the storm changes its direction again
and begins moving to the east, seas near Taiwan will be within its
radius.</P>
      <P>The officials said that because of Maria's surrounding air flows,
southern and southeastern Taiwan had showers Thursday. The weather in

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan biotechnology
company is conducting R&amp;D in pharmaceutical ingredients, with a view
to penetrating the global pharmaceutical market worth more than
US$300 billion, a company executive said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Scinopharm Taiwan, based in the Tainan Science-based Industrial
Park (TSIP) in southern Taiwan, has been one of the top companies in
R&amp;D of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) in the world, and
plans to mass-produce APIs in two years' time.</P>
      <P>Scinopharm General Director Ma Hai-yi said that in global terms,
the American pharmaceutical market accounts for 39 percent, the
European market accounts for 29 percent and the Japanese market
accounts for 18 percent. She added that there are no barriers in the
pharmaceutical market, noting that medicines that pass US Food and
Drug Administration testing can begin mass production.</P>
      <P>She explained that the first stage of medicine production is
material sourcing, followed by intermediates, API, and dosage in that
order. However, she went on, APIs have been explored less, which is
what motivated her company to investigate this area.</P>
      <P>Thanks to government assistance in capital and preferential
measures offered by the TSIP, the company was established in only 14
months, four or five times more rapidly than would be possible in the
United States, Ma said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER CALLS FOR PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei said Thursday his Cabinet
will step up efforts to upgrade operational efficiency and improve
inter-department coordination to live up to the public expectations.</P>
      <P>The four star-general-turned-premier made the pledge at his
first press conference since taking office on May 20.</P>
      <P>Tang said a slew of disasters in recent months, including the
toxic chemical solvent pollution of the Kaoping River, the Pachang
Creek rescue bungle and the collapse of the Kaoping Bridge,
highlighted a decline in the government's competitiveness.</P>
      <P>If the government fails to take bold steps to reform, Tang said,
Taiwan's overall national development will further affected.</P>
      <P>Tang said the new government team will accelerate reform and
develop a sound administrative system to upgrade civil service
quality and efficiency.</P>
      <P>The premier reaffirmed the government's determination to forge
ahead with a sweeping crackdown on corruption, economic crime and
gangster involvement in politics, commonly known as "black gold
politics."</P>
      <P>Noting that corruption and various forms of economic crime
would threaten Taiwan's economic foundations, Tang said the
government would not ease off the anti-"black gold" campaign even
though the crackdown had caused a slump in the local stock
market in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>Tang said Taiwan's current economic fundamentals are sound and
healthy. "There is no reason for pessimism over the local stock
market since our economic basics are healthy and positive," the
premier noted.</P>
      <P>He further said the ongoing crackdown on business crime and
corruption in the financial institutions was meant to help the
financial sector solve problems to prevent the country from plunging
into an economic storm caused by accumulated business
irregularities.</P>
      <P>Tang called for public confidence in Taiwan's economic prospects
and asked the public to "bear the short-term pain in order to seek
long-term financial stability."</P>
      <P>Tang said the four special investigative teams under the
anti-"black gold" action center have been working hard to probe
corruption and kickback charges to help establish clean politics.</P>
      <P>Starting next year, Tang said, the Cabinet will set up a public
infrastructure bidding center to handle public tender for large-scale
government procurement and construction projects.</P>
      <P>"Starting next year, the new bidding center will handle
tender for any government procurement or construction project worth
NT$100 million or over to avoid irregularities," Tang explained.</P>
      <P>In a 20-minute speech delivered before fielding questions from
reporters, Tang outlined his Cabinet's blueprint for Taiwan's future
economic development.</P>
      <P>Tang said his Cabinet will endeavor to lay a sound system within
the shortest possible period of time to facilitate the development
of "knowledge economy."</P>
      <P>"We will update our legal rules and establish a healthy
system to ensure that Taiwan matches the levels of advanced
countries in the domain of knowledge economy in 10 years," the
premier said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Tang said, the Cabinet has drafted a package of
measures to develop Taiwan into a "green silicon island" in the new
century. "In tandem with the global development tempo, we will give
priority to technological innovation, high-quality production and
sustainable and environment-friendly growth," he added.</P>
      <P>In an effort to help local financial institutions upgrade
competitiveness, Tang said the government is amending the existing
banking law to give local banks a freer hand in investment in
relevant fields and merger with other financial institutions.</P>
      <P>Touching on relations across the Taiwan Strait, Tang said the
government will gradually ease restrictions on cross-strait
merchandise, personnel, capital and technological exchanges in
line with the development of bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Tang said the government hopes to make its cross-strait trade
policy an integral part of its overall industrial development
policy. "Therefore, we are ready to push for normalization of
cross-strait commercial exchanges. We hope mainland China will
respond to our goodwill appeal and start cross-strait talks on all
relevant issues based on the principles of mutual respect and
reciprocity."</P>

    <HEADLINE>DENIM GIANT FINDS NEW LEASE OF LIFE IN CENTRAL AMERICA, AFRICA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31 (CNA)
(By  C.P. Wang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Branching out may not be an easy task for
many local businesses, but one Taiwan-based denim giant has
successfully done so, both in Central America and Africa.</P>
      <P>Nien Hsing Textile Co., Ltd., a Taipei-headquartered denim
garment producer, has set up five factories in Nicaragua, two in
Lesotho, and one in Mexico over the past decade, setting a success
model for Taiwan firms -- especially those in the so-called "sunset
industries" -- wishing to expand into other countries.</P>
      <P>Founded in 1986, Nien Hsing is currently the world's largest
jeans maker, with an annual output of 40 million pairs, and is also
the sixth-largest denim maker, producing 60 million yards per year.</P>
      <P>Nien Hsing Chairman Chen Ron-chu, a savvy business management
maestro who played a key role in transforming his company into a
world-class specialized manufacturer of denim fabric and garments in
just a few years, granted an exclusive interview with CNA recently.
Following is the full text of the interview:</P>
      <P>Q: As Nien Hsing is a textbook model for expanding into Central
America and Africa, can you tell us what pushed you to make the move
when you did?</P>
      <P>A: Troubled by rising production costs and a serious labor
shortage at home, many local textile firms chose to move to mainland
China and Southeast Asian countries. But in view of the United
States' keen interest in promoting the formation of the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) area at that time, coupled with
a follow-up Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) Enhancement Act to help
neighboring poor countries, Nien Hsing decided to edge into Central
America to take advantage of the duty-free initiatives provided by
the United States to countries in that region.</P>
      <P>As it has been predicted that the CBI Enhancement Act will
officially become effective on Oct. 1 this year, Nien Hsing's
relocation to Mexico and Nicaragua, as well as to Lesotho and
Swaziland in Africa, will undoubtedly boost its future
competitiveness and profitability.</P>
      <P>Q: What is Nien Hsing's main business sphere and its major
markets?</P>
      <P>A: Our company is principally a jeans producer, although we plan
to diversify into the casual wear market through a merger with a
local firm this year. Currently, Nien Hsing is the only jeans factory
in the world with an entire production line -- from roving, dyeing
and weaving, through finishing. We have factories in Taiwan, Mexico,
Nicaragua and Lesotho.</P>
      <P>With the expansion of a Nicaragua plant to be completed this
year, Nien Hsing is expected to become the world's No. 1 jeans
producer. Famous US chains like Wal-Mart, JC-Penny, K-Mart, Sears and
Target are our major clients, all of whom maintain very close
relations with our company.</P>
      <P>Q: What are Nien Hsing's prospects for future profit and
development in Africa?</P>
      <P>A: In addition to our present two garment factories in Lesotho,
three more production plants and one more textile mill will begin
mass production by 2001. Profits chalked up by the jeans garment
division and the textile mill in that African country are estimated
at NT$1.5 billion and NT$550 million, respectively, per year. To sum
up, Nien Hsing's African plants are expected to produce a profit of
at least NT$2.05 billion annually.</P>
      <P>Q: What do you think of Nien Hsing share prices?</P>
      <P>A: I strongly believe that Nien Hsing's earnings per share can
reach NT$4 this year, since the company's profit margin has continued
to grow in recent years. But to tell the truth, NT$50 per share is
really too cheap for the company. Nien Hsing's share price would hit
NT$100 if it were a hi-tech firm.</P>
      <P>As a result of Nien Hsing's fast expansion in Central America and
Africa, we would like to assure the general public that long-term
investment in our company will be a solid move, and I predict that
the firm's African plants will begin to post investment profits
within two years.</P>

      <P>Ex-Republic of China representative in the
United States Steven Chen said Thursday that no matter who wins the
upcoming US presidential election, US foreign policy will not be
drastically changed.</P>
      <P>Chen said that "we should not expect the upcoming US president to

"we should watch closely the outcome of the US presidential election
in November."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the coming two years will be important for

transition of power in the ROC, the US presidential election, and the
fact that Beijing's political structure is expected to be
restructured next year.</P>
      <P>Delivering a lecture at the Foreign Ministry, Chen backed his
analysis by pointing out that former US President Ronald Reagan said
during his election campaign that he would restore diplomatic

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian met Thursday with
officials of a local association promoting international music
recording exchanges and said Taiwan has to make more efforts on
copyright protection.</P>
      <P>Exchanging views on copyright protection, Chen said in reference
to record piracy that he can sympathize with record companies because
during the presidential election, the company manufacturing official
"Ah Bian" paraphernalia suffered losses because of people selling
pirated knock-offs.</P>
      <P>He added that in a new economic era, outstanding competition can
inspire creativity. Taiwan has to become a country which can protect
copyright and also produce new intellectual properties.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the government, the public, education, and
cultural policies all have to cooperate to reach this goal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC-SENEGAL TIES REMAIN STABLE: ENVOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  Aug.  30  (CNA)
(By M. J. Tzou and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Diplomatic relations between the Republic
of China and Senegal remain stable and friendly, ROC Ambassador Tou
Choou-seng said here Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tou, who is currently on a vacation trip in Paris, was
responding to a report that ROC-Senegal relations are in jeopardy.</P>
      <P>"The report was false," Tou said, adding that relations between
the two countries are still growing steadily.</P>
      <P>Tou said Senegal President Abdoulaye Wade sent a message to ROC
President Chen Shui-bian immediately after learning that a strong
typhoon wreaked havoc in Taiwan last week.</P>
      <P>In his message to President Chen, Tou said, Wade expressed his
sympathy and concern about typhoon damage to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speculation about ROC-Senegal relations arose after President
Chen visited three of the ROC's African allies -- the Gambia, Burkina
Faso and Chad -- from Aug. 20-24. Chen's failure to make a visit to
Senegal, which borders the Gambia, gave rise to the concern that
relations between the two countries might be in trouble.</P>
      <P>Tou, who met Chen in Chad, said the speculation is unfounded.
"I already conveyed Wade's regards and invitation to President Chen
during our meeting in Chad," the ambassador recalled. Chen held a
breakfast meeting with all of the ROC ambassadors stationed in its
eight African allies during his brief state visit to Chad.</P>
      <P>Tou said Chen had canceled his originally planned visit to
Senegal with the consent of Wade's administration. "Senegal was
deleted from Chen's itinerary mainly because August is traditionally
a summer vacation period in the West African country, and most
government agencies would have been open for only half-days," Tou
explained.</P>
      <P>In addition to strong official ties, Tou said, civilian
exchanges between the ROC and Senegal are also close. According to
Tou, major ROC religious and charity groups, including the
Buddhist Fokuangshan (Buddha Light) Association and the Buddhist
Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Association, have actively helped boost
civilian cooperation between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The Fokuangshan Association recently donated a batch of
wheelchairs to handicapped Senegal people and the Tzu Chi
Association has frequently donated medical equipment to the country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW TAIPEI SUBWAY SECTIONS OPEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 31 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
said Thursday that the steady progress of the Taipei Mass Rapid
Transit System project was "inexplicably exciting," as if he -- a
former Taipei mayor -- were witnessing the birth of his own children.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks as a special guest of Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou at an inaugural ceremony for the subway's Hsiao Nanmen Line
and the Nankang Line's Hsinpu section, which boasts the nation's
longest underground cross-river tunnel at 1.9 kilometers.</P>
      <P>The Mucha Line -- the first section of the subway network to be
constructed -- began operating in March 1996, while Chen was still
Taipei mayor. Successive lines -- Tamsui, Chungho and Hsintien --
were completed in the following three years, opening in 1997, 1998,
and 1999, respectively. Parts of the Nankang and Panchiao lines also
went into service in December 1999.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Ma thanked his predecessors for their efforts and
said that after seeing the subway systems in many other countries, he
feels Taiwan's can rank as one of the best in the world. He added
that many European Council of Commerce and Trade representatives in
Taipei have told him that it is "first class."</P>
      <P>Ma also urged the central government to provide funding for the
continued construction of the subway system, saying that a recent
government subsidy of NT$10 billion (US$322 million) was well short
of the originally promised NT$25 billion (US$805 million).</P>
      <P>Chen responded to Ma's request by saying that the central
government's budget will continue to worsen if local governments such
as Taipei's do not shell out the required amount in national health
insurance fees.</P>
      <P>Earlier this week, Ma blamed the central government -- which has
been bemoaning its own financial difficulties -- for increasing its
own annual budget while cutting funding for his city. Taipei's
recently approved annual budget for fiscal 2001 is 9 percent less
than that of 2000, while the central government's budget -- pending
legislative approval -- will go up by 6 percent.</P>
      <P>Prior to the inauguration ceremony, a memorial stone was erected
at the Panchiao Line's new Chiangtzu Tsui station to show respect for
some 40 workers who were stricken with decompression sickness during
construction of the system. They suffer from the condition -- which
usually hits divers who ascend too quickly -- because of the depth of
the subway lines and the improper use of pressure-equalizing air
locks during construction.</P>

      <P>The chief of the general staff of the
Republic of China armed forces said on Thursday that mainland Chinese
missiles cannot sway the will of the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Tang Yao-ming said that so long as the Taiwan people consolidate

      <P>He noted that during the 1958 shelling of Kinmen, the tiny island
withstood a mainland Chinese barrage of some 400,000 shells, and that
compared with the 1958 shelling, the M-missiles of today have merely
an increased range.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has never renounced the use of force against
Taiwan. A simulated war game mounted for President Chen Shui-bian on

    <HEADLINE>EXCERPTS OF PREMIER TANG'S PRESS CONFERENCE Q&amp;A SESSION (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 31(CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Instead of confirming the need to reshuffle
the Cabinet, Premier Tang Fei on Thursday gave his colleagues some
indirect encouragement in response to questions at the end of his
first press conference since taking office May 20.</P>
      <P>He also defended the government's campaign against the so-called
"black gold politics" which was blamed by critics as contributory
fator to the stock market nose-dive and blasted as a plot to divert
the public's attention from the Cabinet. Tang argued that the
benefits of the campaign far overweigh the suffering which might be
brought by the crackdown.</P>
      <P>The fundamentals of the stock market are good and there is no
reason for investors to withdraw in panic, he claimed.</P>
      <P>He played down the urgency of considering a revamp of the
controversial Guidelines for National Unification, the democratic
basis of which was challenged by President Chen shui-bian on July 28.
Tang said that now is not the appropriate time for a revision.</P>
      <P>Following are excerpts of the question-and-answer session of
Premier Tang Fei's press conference:</P>
      <P>Q. Although you said in last week's Cabinet meeting that there
was no plan to shake up the Cabinet, President Chen Shui-bian said
later in his Aug. 28 press conference that he would not rule out the
possibility of replacing Cabinet members "who are incompetent, do not
cooperate with the leaders, or are unable to do their jobs well."</P>
      <P>Is Chen's warning a hint that a Cabinet reshuffle is in the
pipeline? Is there any Cabinet member who falls into any of the three
categories and should be dismissed? Since the three-month test period
you set for your Cabinet has expired, do you think it is time to
reorganize the Cabinet now or pending the Legislature's forthcoming
general interpellation session? If you have no intention of
reorganizing the Cabinet now, when will you weigh the possibility?</P>
      <P>A: I said I would review my agenda rather than the performance of
my Cabinet after three months into my office, because three months is
too short to judge a government's work. All of you can examine
whether my administration's agenda as I mentioned above are tasks
needed to be done urgently right now.</P>
      <P>The question of whether the Cabinet should be reshuffled depends
on the Cabinet members' capability, performance and their ability to
look forward. Three months after the Cabinet was in place, we do not
see any need to take action. Certainly we would use President Chen's
three-point instruction as a measure to gauge the performance of
every Cabinet member, and ask them to do their jobs well.</P>
      <P>Q: Although you say that three months is too short to measure
Cabinet members' performance, you do admit that there is still room
for improvement in the government's policy-making process and
inter-agency contacts. Why do you think this ruling team which did
not command a high approval rating in polls will improve its
performance in the next three or six months?</P>
      <P>A: I would like to give my Cabinet fair judgment. We were sworn
in on May 20 and showed up at the Legislative Yuan for interpellation
by various committees. They then braced for the general
interpellation at the Legislative Yuan in July, and turned to
policy-setting only after August. It is unfair to pass judgment on
their performance simply by their deeds in a single month. If there
is any liability for retaining the Cabinet, let it fall on me.</P>
      <P>Q: The local stock market started its downward spiral almost from
the very beginning of the new Cabinet's operations, which reflects
the public's lack of confidence in the government. Now the government
is stepping up its crackdown on so-called "black gold politics." Is
this just a plot to divert public attention from the government's
inefficiency?</P>
      <P>A: I would like to ask the general public if the "black gold
politics" should be eradicated, or if the crusade should be shelved.
First, in the respect of getting rid of irregularities in the
financial sector, if we do not stamp out irregularities and get our
house in order now, when should we start? Illegal loans and irregular
lending are, at best, exceptions rather than rules. Should we endure
the short-term suffering by clearing the scandals or be dogged by the
ailments for a long time? The campaign against "black gold" is aimed
at pursuing the country's long-term stability.</P>
      <P>Second, there is a continuity in the government's work. Our new
ruling team has to carry on the work started by our predecessors
while setting a direction for ourselves. Personally, I think my
Cabinet is working overtime. I wish the general public, as well as
the mass media, would examine our policy to see if we are on the
right path.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 31(CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Q: You indicated a few days ago that the national pension system
cannot be implemented next January. Can you tell us why? Is it
because the two proposals planned by the administration are
imperfect?</P>
      <P>A: The national pension program has been planned for ten years
and more active planning has been carried out in the past four years.
However, since there were many different opinions during discussions,
we have decided that further discussions on the two proposals by
representatives and various political parties are needed.</P>
      <P>We hope the final results will be accepted by the majority of the
public.</P>
      <P>Q: The performance of the Taiwan Stock Exchange at present seems
no better than under the old administration. What can be done to
promote the stock market?</P>
      <P>A: Our economy is basically healthy and sound, and the problem we
face today is the so-called "confidence" issue. Nevertheless, we do
have a few traditional industries that are encountering crisis, and
the crackdown on crime has also affected some industries. In general,
though, they are all in the same psychological phase.</P>
      <P>We have no reason to be pessimistic about our stock market.</P>
      <P>Q: Can you list some policies in the fiscal year 2001 budget that
reflect your personal character?</P>
      <P>A: We hope that in the coming year we can increase revenue
through tax reforms, open more sources of income and cut down
expenses, and boost other governmental income in order to have more
budget to promote what we intend to do.</P>
      <P>Q: There have now been 12 premiers since the government moved to
Taiwan. Among them, who do you prefer? How do you hope your Cabinet
will be remembered? Would you consider running for vice president or
even president after accomplishing your mission as premier?</P>
      <P>A: Each of the 11 premiers who preceded me made outstanding
contributions to the nation.</P>
      <P>Maybe people misunderstand that I do not have political ambition
and wishes for the future, because after all, I am not a political
scientist and my age is already not suitable for me to pursue further
political positions. However, when I accepted the invitation of the
president to be premier, I hoped that my role would help the
government first to stabilize and then to seek development.</P>
      <P>President Chen also expressed his hope that I can make some
administrative reforms during my premiership, just as the reform
projects I carried out in the Ministry of National Defense while I 
was defense minister.</P>
      <P>I am fortunate in that I have outstanding Cabinet members and I
believe we can promote various reform projects, including financial,
economic and political reforms. I also believe that after three
months, it is now time for us to enter a better situation, so we
should spare no efforts to promote these projects.</P>
      <P>I also expect criticism and advice from the public and I will do
my best to promote the projects.</P>
      <P>Q: You once said that because you do not have to face election,
your words will be honest. However, the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) will be facing legislative, county, and mayoral elections
next year. How will you achieve a balance between the DPP's campaign
pressure and carrying out your own administrative goals? And how will
you strike such a balance, seeing that your Cabinet and the
Legislative Yuan have had many differences of opinion over the past
three months?</P>
      <P>A: Our nation has been around for five thousand years. What
enables us to hold a nation together for so long is because our
political ideology is about "walking the middle path." A lot of young
people nowadays are not very willing to ask what the "golden mean"
is. Actually, it is about making compromises. Democratic politics is
in reality a system of finding happy mediums where we abide by the
majority's opinion while respecting that of the minority. Speaking
the truth is necessary, but sometimes it brings negative effects. So
sometimes truth and lies need to find a happy medium. Therefore,
democracy is about negotiations and compromises.</P>
      <P>Q: Do you think President Chen Shui-bian should take over the
chairmanship of the National Unification Council (NUC)? If he does
not take the chairmanship, what effect will it have on cross-strait
relations?</P>
      <P>A: First of all, the NUC is an advisory body and not a government
agency that answers to the Cabinet. Therefore, it is inappropriate
for the Cabinet to make any criticism of the NUC. Under the
circumstances, it is not an urgent necessity for the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council to discuss the issue of the NUC or the
National Unification Guidelines.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Q: From public opinion polls, we can see that the people are not
very satisfied with your administrative work of the past three
months. Do you think your work will be able to benefit the DPP's
legislative elections next year?</P>
      <P>A: If we pursue short-term benefits, it may act as a kind of
obstacle to long-term development. I have already mentioned that if
corruption in our banking institutions is not wiped out, it will
shake the nation to its foundation. The legal action being taken
today will help resolve the problems in the financial sector. If we
are afraid of this short-term pain and do nothing, then it will
really lead us into a financial storm.</P>
      <P>Q: Can you interpret for us why your public opinion rating has
always been higher than that of the entire Cabinet, and even higher
than that of the president. Also, under the president-premier system,
who do you think should take more responsibility for the government's
current performance?</P>
      <P>A: I am very grateful for the public's support, but if I am
overjoyed by it, it may have a negative effect on me and my work.
What I am concerned about is the public's appraisal of my Cabinet.
Three months have passed, but we have really only had one month to do
our job. If our Cabinet is judged based on a single month's
performance, I must defend it against this unfairness.</P>
      <P>Q: The stock market hit bottom yesterday, and we have seen the
government trying to save the industries but failing to save investor
confidence. Does the government have any policies to help meet the
urgent needs? What will it save first?</P>
      <P>A: I hope no one will believe the rumor that our economy is
facing a crisis. The economy is fundamentally sound. Foreign
financial experts have said that Taiwan's economic fundamentals are
sound. Listed companies have registered gains, banks have registered
gains in net rates of return. In 1999, it was 5.9 percent. In the
first half of 2000, it was 8.9 percent. Our export orders for the
first half of this year reached US$73 billion, an increase of 20.9
percent from the same period of last year. Exports and imports for
January to June reached US$70.7 billion. June was US$12.4 billion,
while June of last year was US$9.9 billion.</P>
      <P>Q: Do you think touching on the question of whether the National
Unification Guidelines need to be amended or whether President Chen
should chair the National Unification Council will cause another
conflict between Taipei and Beijing?</P>
      <P>A: Both sides of the Taiwan Strait should return to dialogue
within the existing mechanism as soon as possible. The key in the
president's speeches and the government's statements since May 20 is
that we ask for equal status. We hope to resume the negotiation
mechanism soon, but the ball is in mainland China's court. And I have
already mentioned that there is no urgency in discussing the issue of
the National Unification Council or the National Unification
Guidelines.</P>
      <P>Q: How will you garner support from the Legislative Yuan for the
central government's budget for next year, knowing that some ruling
party legislators are not satisfied with the budget?</P>
      <P>A: Because the budget is limited by the amount of income, it
cannot reflect the actual amount that the Cabinet needs to carry out
its policies, and we are not willing to raise taxes too much or raise
the ceiling on government debt. Therefore, under the circumstances,
we hope to explain to each party the content of the budget and limit
unnecessary misunderstandings after getting their opinions.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Q. The Executive Yuan has established a task force on economic
and financial issues, with the premier serving as convener. Can you
tell us the purpose of establishing the task force and the best time
for convening a meeting of the task force?</P>
      <P>A. The task force is a consultative mechanism designed to
coordinate the views of various agencies of the Executive Yuan on
economic and financial issues and to work out a farsighted plan and
review.</P>
      <P>Most ministers without portfolio in the new government have never
worked in administrative institutions before, and it is not easy for
them to play the role of coordinating the various agencies.
Therefore, I came out to head the task force in order to improve
efficiency.</P>
      <P>To cultivate a man to become an expert in both the economic and
financial fields is not easy, and who can assure that a policy solely
made by one convener is without mistakes? The task force is in fact a
mechanism of collective study.</P>
      <P>Q. Let me return to the issue of the stock market. Does the new
government consider it necessary to take action to protect the stock
market, and what is the base-line for government intervention?</P>
      <P>A. Sorry, I cannot answer such a question, as it might mislead
the stock market. In fact, as I have just mentioned, the four
government-operated funds enter the market every day with their own
operations.</P>
      <P>The four funds will make a comparatively concerted policy
intervention only when the stock market is affected by non-economic
factors. We have set no base-line for intervention, and we will
intervene only when necessary.

      <P>Q. Are you considering a Cabinet reshuffle at an appropriate
time, as the ruling party will face an important election next year?</P>
      <P>A. There will be no time factor for a Cabinet reshuffle. It can
take place whenever a policy or implementation error is committed by
a government agency.</P>
      <P>We will not say that a reshuffle will not take place before a
fixed date, but there is also no need to talk about the reshuffle
issue everyday, as every one is working hard.</P>
      <P>Regarding next year's election, it will benefit the ruling party
if the government's administrative measures are affirmed and
supported by the public. Otherwise, the ruling party will be hurt. As
a result, the Cabinet's goal from the beginning is to strive for the
best.</P>
      <P>However, I think that the basic principle is to place top
priority on the country's best interests.</P>
      <P>Q. What is your expectation on the development of cross-strait
relations?</P>
      <P>A. I stated during the Legislative Yuan's general interpellation
in July, my hope is to break the stalemate in the cross-strait
dialogue. The cause of the stalemate is the difference over the "one
China" issue. So long as both sides can return to a parity status, we
can resume bilateral negotiation at an early date.</P>
      <P>Regarding the three cross-strait direct links -- trade, postal
and transport -- we hope to overcome some obstacles in the near
future so that the institutionalized dialogue can be resumed to
resolve cross-strait problems.</P>
      <P>Q. What is your influence on the new government's policies on the
issues concerning national unification, Taiwan independence and
cross-strait relations?</P>
      <P>A. The people of Taiwan have various opinions over whether to
pursue unification, independence or maintain the status quo. That is
why we want to hold round-table and inter-party conferences to
coordinate their opinions. If we 22 million people cannot reach a
consensus, the government will have no foundation upon which to
negotiate with the mainland.</P>
      <P>As diplomatic, national defense and cross-strait affairs are the
responsibility of the president, I rarely raise these matters on my
own initiative, but during July's 12-day general interpellation, I
made many explanations on these issues. You can check the legislative
record to understand my basic stance.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO TRY OBTAINING EARLY WARNING SYSTEM: DEFENSE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Defense Minister Wu
Shih-wen said Thursday that the military will continue to try to
obtain an early warning system after recent war games revealed
Taiwan's limited means to counter mainland Chinese missile attacks.</P>
      <P>At an annual press conference to commemorate Journalists Day, Wu
said that Tuesday's Hankuang No. 16 exercises simulated a mainland
Chinese attack on Taiwan using its Dongfeng 15 guided missiles, with
results showing that Taiwan's Patriot Modified Air Defense System
(MADS) would have a low interception rate.</P>
      <P>Wu explained that no anti-missile system in the world can claim
to have a 100 percent missile interception rate. Even the United
States -- which has been developing such systems for decades -- have
not had favorable test results, he added.</P>
      <P>Wu went on to say that Taiwan's three Patriot batteries are
equipped with a newer system than the one used by the US Army in the
Persian Gulf War against Iraq's Scud missiles. However, he added that
while the Patriot MADS is an anti-ballistic missile system, the Scud
-- against which the Patriot only had limited success -- is not a
ballistic missile.</P>
      <P>Explaining further as to why the annual Hankuang exercises showed
only limited anti-missile capability, Wu said that the three
batteries are deployed around the periphery of Taiwan's major
political and economic center -- Taipei. However, he went on, the
simulated attacks focused on other regions unprotected by the
anti-missile umbrella.</P>
      <P>As a result of the heavy casualties and damage a mainland missile
attack would cause if heavily populated western Taiwan were to be
struck, Wu said that the military is still hopeful it can acquire an
early warning radar system to allow for quicker reaction time when
making defensive preparations.</P>
      <P>Other than using an anti-missile system to counter mainland
attacks, Wu said that immediate dispersion and evacuation would also
be able to limit damage. He further said that if a missile were to
strike Taiwan, panic might ensue, even if the material
destructiveness was limited. Therefore, he added, the people's will
to resist would also be a key factor against missile attacks.</P>
