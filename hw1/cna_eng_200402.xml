    <HEADLINE>CDC FORESEES NO HUMAN BIRD FLU INFECTION AT LEAST BY END OF MARCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is not expected to see any cases of
humans contracting bird flu at least before the end of March, a
senior Department of Health (DOH) official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-yi, deputy director of the DOH's Center for Disease
Control, said Taiwan now has only found a low-pathogenic strain of
the avian flu virus known as H5N2, which cannot infect humans.</P>
      <P>According to medical records, Shih said, it will take several
weeks to six months for the H5N2 strain to mutate to the highly
pathogenic strain of H5N1 virus which can infect humans.</P>
      <P>In terms of this time frame, Shih said, no human avian flu
infection is expected to occur in Taiwan at least by the end of
March.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Shih said, Taiwan must remain on high alert because
the potential of human infection remains high.</P>
      <P>In his view, Shih said, avian flu has been on mainland China for
some time. "Late last year, the animal disease control unit already
discovered the H5N1 virus in a batch of ducks smuggled to the
frontline island of Kinmen from mainland China," Shih said.</P>
      <P>As the H5N1 virus continues to spread across Asia, Shih said,
Taiwan must step up border controls to prevent live animal smuggling
and to quarantine incoming passengers suspected of having come down
with avian flu.</P>
      <P>Asked whether local citizens should still eat poultry, Shih said
he sees no problem in eating chicken meat bearing the "CAS" foodstuff
logo. The label certifies that the bird has been screened by the
government and deemed safe for human consumption.</P>
      <P>However, he urged people to refrain from purchasing chickens
slaughtered on the spot at traditional markets.</P>
      <P>"As slaughtered-on-the-spot chickens have not undergone tests and
refrigeration, they may spread the bird flu virus," Shih said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BRAZILIAN GRANDMA URGED TO COME TO TAIWAN TO TAKE BACK BOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, Feb. 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The uncle of a Taiwanese-Brazilian boy at
the center of an international custody battle said Sunday he hopes
the boy's Brazilian legal guardian will come to Taiwan to take
back the boy in person.</P>
      <P>"I'll feel at ease only when I can hand over my nephew to
his Brazilian grandmother in person," said the boy's uncle Wu
Hou-yen.</P>
      <P> Taiwan's judicial authorities have meted out a final
verdict that the boy's guardianship belongs to his Brazilian
grandmother, Rosa Ergui.</P>
      <P>The grandmother said earlier that she was glad to learn about
the Nov. 13 Taiwan Supreme Court ruling that the boy, Iruan Wu Ergui,
should be returned to her. However, she said she has been unable to
come to Taiwan because she wants to avoid the media spotlight, which
she feels is bad for the boy. Ergui has instead commissioned Brazil's
representative to Taiwan, Paulo A.P. Pinto, to take the boy back to
Brazil on her behalf.</P>
      <P>Wu said he fully respects the judicial ruling, but stressed that
he hopes Ergui can come to Taiwan to take back the boy instead of
asking him to hand over the boy to her proxy.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung District Court has ordered Wu to hand over the
boy, better known as Wu Yi-hua in Taiwan, to his grandmother's
representative by Feb. 5.</P>
      <P>It remains unclear whether the district court will seek local
police's assistance in forcefully taking the boy away from his
Taiwanese uncle's home if Wu fails to voluntarily hand over the boy
by the deadline.</P>
      <P>Iruan was born out of wedlock in Brazil in July 1995 to a
Brazilian mother and a Taiwanese father. His mother died six years
ago and he was brought to Taiwan in March 2001 by his father, who
died a couple of weeks later. Since then, the boy has been living
with his uncle in the southern Taiwan county of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>His grandmother, who became the boy's legal guardian upon his
mother's death, decided to take legal action to regain custody of her
grandson after his Taiwanese uncle refused to let her take him back
to Brazil in 2001.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan regulations, if Wu refuses to comply with the
court order, he can be fined between NT$30,000 and NT$300,000
(US$890-US$8,902), and if he still refuses to hand over the boy, the
court can keep fining him. If Wu continues to hold out, the court
will ultimately order the police to implement the transfer of
custody.</P>
      <P>A support group has been formed in Kaohsiung County, which has
called for donations of NT$10 (US$0.296) per person to help Wu pay
for the fines and support fees for the boy.</P>

    <DATELINE>Tainan,  Taiwan,  Feb. 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui said
Sunday the people of Taiwan should stand united in the face of
mainland China's ever-mounting military threat and diplomatic
stranglehold against the country.</P>
      <P>Lee made the appeal while taking part in a rehearsal in the
southern county of Tainan for a "one-million-persons-hand-in-hand"
rally scheduled for Feb. 28 in support of President Chen Shui-bian's
re-election bid.</P>
      <P>More than 60,000 residents in the Tainan area joined the
rehearsal, holding hands together along a 63-kilometer stretch of
road in protest of Beijing's missile threat and in a show of support
for Chen's referendum plan and re-election bid.</P>
      <P>Lee served as the commander of the northern section of the
60,000-person human chain. He traveled on a vehicle from Tainan
County's Houpi township southward to Shanhua township, the
center point of the human chain. Lee waved to the participants along
the way to boost their morale.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh, who supervised the southern section
of the human chain, traveled from the county's Yungkang township
northward to Shanhua where Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-chih was
overseeing the proceedings of the whole event.</P>
      <P>Lee and Hsieh arrived in Shanghua at around 2:20 p.m. They joined
Su in leading all participants in shouting, "Missiles no, peace yes"
at 2: 27 p.m. The participants then turned to face the Central
Mountain Range and shouted, "Holding hands together to save Taiwan"
and "peace referendum" at 2:28 p.m.</P>
      <P>The participants also sang patriotic songs, including "Stand
United for Taiwan" and "Taiwan All Victory."</P>
      <P>Addressing the rally, Lee said the people of Taiwan should not be
daunted by the nearly 500 missiles deployed by Beijing to intimidate
them.</P>
      <P>"We should not flinch under Beijing's threat. We must instead
stand up to resist mainland China's aggression. With courage, resolve
and unity, we'll be able to defeat any enemy and protect our
democratic homeland," Lee said.</P>
      <P>He further said the Feb. 28 "one-million-persons-hand-in-hand"
rally will be a very important event in Taiwan's 400-year history.
"It will tell the world that the people of Taiwan, regardless of
their ethnic backgrounds, gender, or age are united and resolved to
protect their homeland with peace."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee said President Chen's planned referendum alongside
the March 20 presidential election is a necessary step to consolidate
Taiwan's young democracy. He urged local people to support Taiwan's
first-ever referendum, using their ballots to express their desire
for peace, not war.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Kaohsiung Mayor Hsieh said the
Feb. 28 hand-in-hand rally is seeking to break the world record for
the longest human chain since the Baltic Chain in 1989 when the
people of the three Baltic countries -- Tstonia, Lithuania and Latvia
-- formed a human chain to express their opposition to interference
by Russian Army.</P>
      <P>Hsieh called on local citizens to come out on Feb. 28, which is
Taiwan's Peace Memorial Day, and take part in the "hand-in-hand"
rally to set a new record for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Quoting public opinion survey results, Tainan County Magistrate
Su said the "hand-in-hand" program has received the support of more
than 70 percent of local citizens and that even 40 percent of the
supporters of the opposition presidential ticket of Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman James Soong alo
support the "hand-in-hand" program.</P>
      <P>"I hope more than one million people will join the rally on
that day and hold their hands together along the north-south
provincial highway from Keelung City to Pingtung County for a
distance of 500 kilometers," Su said, adding that the rally will
symbolize unity of Taiwan people and support for the island's
first-ever referendum.</P>
      <P>President Chen announced in last month that a referendum will be
held to coincide with the March 20 presidential election to ask local
voters whether Taiwan should buy more anti-missile weapons if China
refused to withdraw its missiles, and whether Taipei should forge
a framework with Beijing for peaceful interaction.</P>

      <P>The government plans to offer free flu
inoculations to children under age 10 from October, a senior
Department of Health (DOH) official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-yi, deputy director of the DOH's Center for Disease

have a high risk of contracting avian flu.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Shih said, the DOH is scheduled to hold a
meeting of specialists Tuesday to discuss measures to prevent avian
flu from infecting young children.</P>
      <P>The meeting is expected to approve the proposal to have children
younger than 10 inoculated with flu vaccines from October this year,
Shih said.</P>
      <P>At the moment, Shih said, humans do not have antibodies against
the bird flu virus. Those who contract the virus, particularly young
children, are likely to succumb to the disease. "Therefore, we have
tentatively decided to offer free shots of bird flu vaccines to
children aged under 10 from October," he explained.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has offered free flu vaccinations to senior citizens aged
65 and over and several other high-risk groups, including medical
personnel and poultry farmers. The decision to expand free
inoculations to young children comes amid an increase of bird flu
cases in humans in Asia.</P>

wait for my student to make an effort himself to find his way through
a difficulty, before I show him the way myself. I also make him find

pointed out the bearing of a subject in one direction and found that
my student cannot himself see its bearings into other directions, I
do not then repeat my lesson."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>NO NEW CASES OF H5N2 BIRD FLU IN TAIWAN: COUNCIL OF AGRICULTURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 2 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>No new cases of the bird flu caused by the
H5N2 virus have been found since Saturday in Taiwan, a government
official reported Monday,</P>
      <P>Yeh Ying, deputy director-general of the Bureau of Animal and
Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine Department under the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) , said quarantine workers
have stepped up inspections of fowl populations in central and
southern regions and that no fresh cases have been discovered since
Saturday, when about 34,000 chickens were culled at two poultry farms
in Chiayi and Tainan counties.</P>
      <P>The bureau will further intensify inspections and controls to
contain the spread of the less virulent H5N2 strain in Taiwan, at a
time when global concern over the increased spread of the far more
virulent H5N1 virus in mainland China is mounting, Yeh said. She
vowed that the bureau will immediately announce new developments
regarding the disease at home in order not to provoke public panic.</P>
      <P>COA Chairman Lee Chin-lung said the potentially fatal H5N1 virus
is also likely to invade Taiwan on the grounds that many neighboring
countries have reported repeated bird flu cases infected by the
pathogen.</P>
      <P>Lee said the COA must take into consideration the worst-possible
scenario for Taiwan and must take effective measures to contain any
spread of the disease.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) Minister Chen
Chien-jen urged the public to conduct self-health control and
management by taking their temperatures and washing their hands
frequently every day. The DOH will also strengthen checkups at
immigration and customs points across the country, he added.</P>
      <P>In line with the central government's efforts to prevent the
transmission of the H5N1 bird flu virus from the mainland and the
rest of Asia, the coast guard authorities on outlying Kinmen Island
have moved swiftly to clamp down on smuggling along the coast.</P>
      <P>Coast guard personnel all wear protective gear and are equipped
with disinfection facilities to carry out their mission. They have
also called on the Kinmen residents not to buy mainland-made products
in a bid to better protect the island, just opposite the mainland's
Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>Ten Asian countries, including the mainland, Japan, South Korea,
Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, have reported
cases of H5N1 bird flu and the COA has banned imports of poultry
products from the affected countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER URGES BEIJING FOR TRANSPARENCY ON AVIAN FLU IN MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 1 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun called on mainland China
Monday to level with the world about the avian flu situation on the
mainland and to work with neighboring countries and the World Health
Organization (WHO) to combat the disease.</P>
      <P>After being briefed by officials from the Department of Health,
the Council of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection
Administration, the premier said the country should be placed on high
alert to prevent the disease from invading the island.</P>
      <P>As viruses are often passed to human beings from poultry, the
premier asked the customs authorities and the Coast Guard
Administration to exercise the same great vigilance to stop poultry
smuggling as they do to prevent narcotics and weapons from being
brought in.</P>
      <P>In light of the world's experience of fighting severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) early last year, Yu said that the free
flow of information about epidemics in different countries is vital
to eradicating these diseases.</P>
      <P>Since the WHO suspects that the mainland is not being honest
about the bird flu situation there, Yu called on the Beijing
authorities not to repeat the mistake it made when it tried to cover
up the outbreaks of SARS in southern China in early 2003 and to
instead join hands with other countries to defeat the disease.</P>
      <P>Noting that avian flu cases have been reported in South Korea,
Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam and mainland China, the premier said
Taiwan is besieged by countries that have fallen into the grip of
this disease, and it is quite possible that the high pathogenic H5N1
virus, which exists in the systems of poultry and causes flu symptoms
in humans, will be brought into the island and that the government
should do its utmost to prevent this.</P>
      <P>When it comes to fighting avian flu, the premier said, it is
better to err on the side of caution.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is determined to development
Taiwan into an Asian financial hub and welcomes multinational
enterprises that wish to invest in the country and forge joint
ventures with their domestic counterparts, Vice Premier Lin Hsin-i
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Addressing a ceremony in which Britain's Prudential Group and
Taiwan's E-Sun Financial Holding Company signed a strategic alliance
accord, Lin said that the government is determined to bring Taiwan's
financial sector into the international arena.</P>
      <P>Over the years, he noted, the government has lifted restrictions
on investment in the domestic bourse by qualified international
investors, increased the ceiling on overseas investment by domestic
insurance companies from 20 percent to 35 percent of their total
assets and opened cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges of insurance, among
other things.</P>
      <P>In addition, said the vice premier, who also doubles as chairman
of the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) ,
financial reforms have produced fruitful results since the government
took concrete measures in this direction in June 2002.</P>
      <P>As of the end of last year, he continued, Taiwan-based banks had
written off a combined NT$648 billion (US$19.23 billion) in bad
debts, lowering their average overdue loan ratio to 4.33 percent from
a peak of 8.04 percent recorded in March 2001.</P>
      <P>In the last year alone, he said, domestic banks earned a total of
NT$293.8 billion and wrote off NT$163.8 billion in bad loans, while
new non-performing loans registered only NT$3 billion.</P>
      <P>In comparison, he added, domestic banks earned only a total of
NT$262 billion and wrote off NT$230 billion of bad loans in 2001,
while their overdue loans increased by NT$543 billion.</P>
      <P>These figures show that the operation of domestic financial
institutions has returned onto a healthy track, according to Lin.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH TO HOLD MEETING ON AVIAN FLU PREVENTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) will call a
meeting Tuesday to discuss measures to cope with a possible avian flu
outbreak in Taiwan, a senior official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Su Ih-jen, director of the DOH's Center for Disease Control, said
the meeting will focus discussions on preparation for avian flu
vaccines, including expanding the categories of people eligible
for free inoculations.</P>
      <P>Su said the DOH is considering either establishing a laboratory
for producing vaccines against the highly virulent H5N1 strain of
avian flu virus or contracting a noted multinational pharmaceutical
plant to produce the vaccines for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Su said he hopes the Legislative Yuan will support the budget
proposal for the vaccine production plan.</P>
      <P>So far, bird flu has struck at least 10 Asian countries in recent
months and has killed more than 10 people.</P>
      <P>Su said the bird flu strain spreading through Asia, known as
H5N1, has not reached this island. Taiwan, however, has culled 98,000
chickens and ducks infected with a milder strain of flu, H5N2, which
cannot infect humans.</P>
      <P>But Council of Agriculture Chairman Lee Chin-lung said he is
afraid the more virulent H5N1 strain could be carried to the island
by migratory birds or by fowl smuggled from mainland China. Over the
weekend, the council said it believed that bird flu had struck
mainland China as early as last December, noting that several ducks
smuggled from the mainland to the Taiwan-held frontline island of
Kinmen had tested positive for the H5N1 strain.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun urged mainland China Monday to be more open
about its bird flu outbreak, saying hiding information about the
illness ravaging Asia could help the virus spread faster.</P>
      <P>"We know that countries sharing information will be crucial for
containing the disease," Yu said.</P>
      <P>The premier said Taiwan will also take extra measures to
prevent the bird flu, including a crackdown on smuggled fowl and
closer monitoring of chicken diseases at farms.</P>
      <P>Over the weekend, the World Health Organization also appealed
for more urgent action by mainland China against bird flu, calling on
the communist government to share more information about the disease
and step up monitoring for possible human cases.</P>

      <P>The Consumer Confidence Index leveled off in
January, despite indications that the country's economy is turning
upward, according to the Research Center for Taiwan Economic
Development, National Central University in Chungli, Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>Chu Yun-peng, director of the center that compiled the index,
said the index was prepared according to consumers' forecasts in six
economy-related fields for the next six months.</P>
      <P>The survey asked people six questions and translated their
answers into scores which were used to prepare the consumers'
confidence index, according to Chu.</P>
      <P>Compared with one month ago, Chu said, the study showed that
people's confidence in "the time to invest in the stock market" had
risen by 2.9 points, their confidence in the description that the
economy will be steady for the next six months remained unchanged,
but the scores for "the time to purchase durable goods" dipped by 0.7
percent to 100.75. This level is still beyond the 100 points
threshold indicating optimism.</P>
      <P>The confidence in the consumer goods prices dipped by 2.45
points, probably because the survey was conducted against the
background that the country's two fuel suppliers were raising their
oil prices, said Chu.</P>
      <P>The confidence levels in the economic prospects and the
employment rates also dipped by 1.3 points and 0.7 points
respectively, however, they are still 3.2 points and 8.25 points
higher than January, 2003, according to Chu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CALLS FOR BLOOD DONATION DRIVE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged local people
Monday to donate blood to help relieve a serious blood shortage
facing the country.</P>
      <P>Chen made the appeal during a visit to Taipei City's blood
donation center.</P>
      <P>Chen said he had originally intended to donate blood himself.
However, his blood was rejected as he had visited Panama -- a
malaria-endemic area -- less than a year ago. Chen made an official
visit to Panama last November to attend that country's centennial
celebrations.</P>
      <P>According to government regulations, those who have visited a
communicable disease-affected area cannot donate blood within a year
of their return.</P>
      <P>"I feel regret that I cannot donate blood this time around," Chen
said, adding that he will instead encourage the Presidential Office
staff to donate blood to inspire more people to follow suit.</P>
      <P>In his view, Chen said, donating blood is both an act of
self-interest and altruism that can help boost social harmony.
"Through donating blood, we can help save our own lives, those of our
families and those of other people, " he said. "Let us be happy blood
donors."</P>
      <P>Medical sources said nearly all major domestic blood banks are in
dire shortage of various types of blood at the moment.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said
Monday it would like to see the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and
People First Party (PFP) sponsor appropriate activities on Feb. 28,
the island's Peace Memorial Day.</P>
      <P>Wu Nai-jen, spokesman of the presidential ticket of Chen
Shui-bian and his running mate, Annette Lu, for the ruling party,
made the remarks upon learning that the KMT and the PFP are also
planning to hold large-scale activities that day as a part of the
campaign to drum up support for their presidential bid.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan will run against President Chen Shui-bian,
in the March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Wu said, "February 28 is a day when Taiwan people reflect upon
events that are trauma of the nation, " referring to the tragic
incident that took place Feb. 28, 1947 and during the ensuing "white
terror" period where hundreds of local elites were killed.</P>
      <P>"All parties are welcome to plan for activities appropriate to
themselves," Wu said.</P>
      <P>On the part of the DPP, it will hold a "one-million-hand-in-hand"
campaign, with people around the island joining hands on that day to
form a colossal human chain.</P>
      <P>President Chen said last week that the campaign scheduled for
Feb. 28 is aimed at promoting ethnic harmony and demonstrating to the
world that the people of Taiwan are determined to peacefully protect
their homeland.</P>
      <P>The president said that the problem Taiwan faces today is by no
means ethnic disharmony, but rather a problem of national
identification. He said that he regretted that some people who
decline to identify themselves with Taiwan have distorted the
national identify issue as one of ethnic disharmony.</P>
      <P>"This sort of distortion has undermined mutual trust in society
and is detrimental to Taiwan's social harmony, " Chen said, adding
that in the face of the military threat from mainland China, such a
move could bring unprecedented danger to the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president urged all local people to come out for the campaign
to show their resolve to protect Taiwan's hard-won economic and
democratic achievements.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an ethnic equality alliance comprised of cultural and
literary figures announced Monday that it has canceled its scheduled
walk in reminiscence of the darkest chapter in Taiwan's history on
Feb. 28.</P>
      <P>Ku Yi-ling, the liaison official of the recently launched
organization, said that the alliance has decided to adopt another way
to commemorate the day to avoid ethnic issues from polarizing the
public.</P>
      <P>Ku said that the alliance is not opposed to the activities by the
ruling or opposition parties, but the ethnic issue does not only
revolve around national identification, it also deals with the
aboriginal people and foreign spouses of Taiwan citizens, but
obviously the latter two category of peoples are not equally
represented.</P>
      <P>She said that the alliance does not want to emulate the approach
of the political parties to mobilize a multitude of people on the
street, so that they may "blur the real issue that matters."</P>

    <DATELINE>STRAIT Taipei,  Feb.  2 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei-based UNI Airways Corp. is
planning to start a joint venture later this month with a
Xiamen-based ferry company to transport Taiwan businessmen traveling
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, according to a spokesman
for the aviation company.</P>
      <P>The joint venture set up by UNI Airways and the Xiamen-based
ferry company, to be launched on Feb. 16 under the "mini three links"
framework, will offer a sea-air round trip coupon at NT$5,200
(US$155) for travelers between Xiamen and destinations on Taiwan
proper via the outlying island of Kinmen, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Passengers will first ferry between Xiamen and Kinmen before
proceeding to destinations on Taiwan proper -- Taipei, Kaohsiung,
Taichung, Tainan and Chiayi -- on board a UNI airplane from the
island, he explained.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, the joint venture decision was
announced on Jan. 28 after UNI Airways General Manager Su Hong-i paid
a visit earlier the same day to Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng
to seek his approval and cooperation.</P>
      <P>The "mini three links" -- direct trade and transportation service
opened in Jan. 2001 between the Taiwan-held islands of Kinmen and
Matsu, and Xiamen and Mawei ports on mainland China's Fujian province
-- are important channels particularly for the many Taiwan
businessmen based in the mainland before the establishment of full
links between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Su was quoted as
saying.</P>
      <P>Su said that hopefully, Kinmen can be developed into a
transshipment hub across the strait to partially replace Hong Kong
and Macau as regional centers to transport a large number of Taiwan
businessmen traveling across the strait.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, about 200,000 people, including 150,000 Taiwan
business people and their families living in mainland China, use the
"mini three links" gateway every year to travel between the two
sides.</P>
      <P>Kinmen County authorities now are trying to make the central
government ease its current rules on the "mini three links" to
facilitate and expand bilateral exchanges between Taiwan and mainland
China, Lee noted.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of a women's rights activists
organization, along with a group of prostitutes, appealed Monday to
presidential candidates from both the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) and the opposition Kuomintang to come up with more
lenient laws to legalize sex trade workers.</P>
      <P>Wang Fang-ping, secretary-general of the private Je-Je-chuen
Compassionate Concern Association, which fights for the rights of
licensed prostitutes, laborers and housewives, said her group wants
the presidential candidates to promise that Article 80 of the Social
Order Law will be amended so that neither prostitutes nor their
patrons will be punished for engaging in the sex trade.</P>
      <P>Under the existing law, Wang said, only those who provide sexual
services are punished.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's law runs against the world trend as most of advanced
countries have legalized the sex trade and the interests of sex trade
workers are legally protected, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wang said her association is scheduled to organize a rally by sex
trade workers on Feb. 7 to take their appeal to the streets. During
the rally, the answers from the candidates regarding the prostitutes'
appeal will also be made public, she added.</P>
      <P>Wang is known for her strenuous efforts to protect the rights of
women working in the sex trade.</P>
      <P>During her campaign seeking a seat on the Taipei City Council in
late 2002, Wang championed legalization of the sex trade in Taipei.</P>
      <P>She also criticized the city government for its failed efforts to
crack down on illegal sex workers, pointing out that even though
licensed prostitutes and related businesses have been put out of
action, the city has not become any "cleaner, " but instead, the
illegal sex trade has become "even more frenzied."</P>
      <P>Wang, who decided to run for a city councilor's seat from the
Chungshan and Tatung districts, which boast the greatest number of
pubs, brothels and other sex business locations in the city, failed
in that election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INCOMING ALIEN WORKERS MAY BE MONITORED FOR BIRD FLU VIRUS: CLA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the number of people dying of bird flu
virus in southeast Asia rising, the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
may consider taking preventive measures on incoming foreign workers
to prevent the disease from entering Taiwan, CLA Chairwoman Chen Chu
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen said the CLA may consider adopting preventive measures
similar to the ones taken during the height of the outbreaks of
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) last year -- on incoming
workers from Southeast Asian countries that have been identified as
avian flu-affected areas by the World Health Organization.</P>
      <P>One of the preventive measures could be temperature-taking at the
airport upon the Asian workers' arrival in Taiwan, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Implementation details, however, will be worked out after the CLA
communicates with the Department of Health (DOH), Chen added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, officials from the CLA Employment and Vocational
Training Administration said that during the SARS onslaught last
year, workers from the Philippines and Vietnam who were coming to
Taiwan for employment were monitored medically in both their own
countries and Taiwan.</P>

preventive policy regarding Southeast Asian workers, the officials

    <HEADLINE>GUIDELINES NEEDED TO STOP SICK PEOPLE FROM INFECTING OTHERS: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>To prevent the spread of influenza, clear
guidelines should be established regarding when a person should be
prevented from going to work or school because they are ill, an
official of the Department of Health (DOH) said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-yi, deputy director-general of DOH's Center for
Disease Control, made the remarks as more cases of avian flu caused
by the H5N1 virus were reported in Asian countries. Tens of thousands
of chickens have already been destroyed and two more people in
Vietnam have been infected and died from avian flu..</P>
      <P>Though Taiwan is still a bird flu-free country, the authorities are
on high alert and have ordered the killing of tens of thousands of
chickens and ducks.</P>
      <P>Shih said that wearing surgical masks and monitoring a person's
temperature are ineffective measures to combat the problem since the
illness develops before a fever is present.</P>
      <P>It is therefore necessary to establish clear standards to stop
those people who appear to be sick from influenza from going to work
or school to avoid infecting others.</P>
      <P>Shih noted that if avian flu leads to human to human
transmissions, it could be more serious than severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) was last year and the need for vaccines, flu-fighting
medicines and hospital beds will also be greatly increased.</P>
      <P>Shih said that about one in 10 people in Taiwan come down with
the common form of the flu each year and between 3,000 and 4,000 die.</P>
      <P>If the influenza virus mutates and there are no antibodies in
humans, as is the case with the N5N1 avian flu, then the mortality
rates of humans after contracting the disease could be 75 percent.</P>
      <P>Shih said that there have been serious global outbreaks of
influenza every 30 years and each time it was an avian flu virus
passed to pigs, and after one or two years of development, the virus
was passed on to humans.</P>
      <P>He said the global outbreaks of influenza in 1918, 1954 and 1967
followed the same pattern.</P>
      <P>As the top health agency of the nation, Shih said that to prevent
any forms of flu from mutating, vaccination programs will be expanded
to children, and the purchase of influenza-fighting medicines will be
increased. Medical treatment networks will also be expanded and field
hospitals will be established if needed.</P>
      <P>"Overall, the scale of mobilization against the influenza will
surpass that of SARS," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PREPARED TO SIGN MEMORANDUM ON LABOR AFFAIRS WITH INDONESIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will work to sign a memorandum on
labor affairs with the Indonesian government in the near future to
facilitate bilateral cooperation, Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
Chairwoman Chen Chu said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen, who visited Indonesia Jan. 29-Feb. 1 at the invitation of
the Indonesian Ministry of Manpower and Transmigration, said at a
news conference that the CLA is likely to lift a freeze on the
introduction of new Indonesian laborers shortly as she is positive
now that part of the situation that led Taiwan to freeze the import
of Indonesian laborers has improved substantially.</P>
      <P>The memorandum is expected to be forged in three months and will
serve as a guideline for both sides to follow when labor disputes or
controversies arise again in the future, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>The CLA imposed the freeze in August 2002 in retaliation for the
high rate of absconding and illegal work among Indonesian laborers in
Taiwan, as well as the excessively high brokerage fees charged by the
Indonesian side.</P>
      <P>Calling her just-concluded trip to Indonesia a success, Chen said
she and her Indonesian counterpart, Minister of Manpower and
Transmigration Jacob Nuwawea, discussed a wide range of topics,
including how to lower the absconding rate of Indonesian workers in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said during her visit, she and Kuo Fang-yu, director-general
of the CLA Employment and Vocational Training Administration, were
kept abreast of the latest measures that the Indonesian government
has implemented to improve the absconding situation, Indonesia's
labor training and export policy, the qualification verification
system, and the manner of assigning and collecting fees.</P>
      <P>Chen's visit to Jakarta marked the first official visit by a
high-level Taiwan official to Indonesia since Vice President Annette
Lu visited Indonesia in August 2002.</P>
      <P>For his part, Kuo said at the news conference that before the
labor affairs memorandum can be signed, the two countries must iron
out some details, including the question of age. Indonesia hopes that
Indonesian citizens aged 18 or above will be allowed to go to Taiwan
for employment, against the CLA's regulation of a minimum age of 20.</P>
      <P>The two sides must also seek an agreement on the minimum wage
issue. Indonesia hopes that it should begin from NT$16,000, whereas
the CLA's standard is set at NT$15,840, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>On efforts to curb the trend of Indonesian workers to flee from
their workplaces in Taiwan, Kuo said the CLA may consider resorting
to economic means or direct introduction or employment of workers
from Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Before Taiwan and Indonesia forge the labor affairs memorandum,
Kuo said, the CLA agreed to adopt a pragmatic policy for a
"transitional" period, allowing members of the 56,000-strong
Indonesian expatriate body whose work contracts are expiring to stay
on until the bilateral memorandum is hammered out.</P>
      <P>Over the past several months, according to CLA officials, the
situation regarding Indonesian workers absconding in Taiwan has
improved following closer cooperation and communication between the
governments of the two countries.</P>
      <P>The CLA's offer of a three-month assessment period, during which
time foreign laborers who had absconded were allowed to turn
themselves in voluntarily, has also contributed to improving the
situation, the officials said.</P>
      <P>According to CLA tallies, about 70 percent of the foreign
laborers who turned themselves in to Taiwan police between Sept. 1
and Nov. 30 last year for absconding were Indonesian nationals.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had approximately 280,000 legal foreign workers as of June
1, 2003, with most being employed in the manufacturing sector and
some working as household helpers and caregivers. Of the total, Thai
nationals accounted for the largest group at about 102,000 workers,
followed by Indonesians at 73,000, Philippine citizens at 66,000, and
Vietnamese nationals at 37,000.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
said Monday that voting for the presidential election must take
priority over that of a referendum and that the two must be taken as
completely separate issues.</P>
      <P>Wang stressed that the presidential election should be held
first, and urged the Central Election Commission to be careful about
separating the voting. This, he said, would conform to the practice
of democratic procedure.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks as legislators of the ruling and opposition
parties began to register for the new legislative session, which will
open Friday.</P>
      <P>He said that a referendum is the embodiment and implementation of
the people's civil rights and should be respected, but he stressed it
should be separate and unconnected to the vote for president.</P>
      <P>Each eligible voter will be given three ballots on March 20, one
to vote for president and two for the referendum questions -- whether
Taiwan should strengthen its anti-missile capability in the face of
the military threat from the mainland and whether to establish a
peaceful and stable framework for cross-strait interactions.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang told legislators across the party spectrum to
remain neutral, saying, "This will help the image of the Legislative
Yuan."</P>
      <P>He stressed that legislators are entitled to support their
favorite presidential candidates, but they should refrain from using
administrative resources and rights to stump for them.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE TO SUBMIT REFERENDUM QUESTIONS FOR APPROVAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office is scheduled to
submit the two questions for the "peace referendum" to the Executive
Yuan Tuesday for approval, sources from the Presidential Office said
Monday.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan, in turn, is expected to give its approval
Wednesday to the questions advocated by President Chen Shui-bian,
paving the way for the holding of the referendum on the presidential
election day slated for March 20, Presidential Office officials said.</P>
      <P>Quoting Article 17 of the Referendum Law, which was passed late
last year, the officials said that President Chen is empowered by the
law to call a referendum when the nation faces an obvious outside
threat to its sovereignty.</P>
      <P>President Chen announced Jan. 16 that a "peace referendum" would
be held alongside the March 20 presidential election to ask voters
whether Taiwan should further beef up its anti-missile defenses if
Beijing refuses to withdraw the hundreds of ballistic missiles
pointed at Taiwan and whether a mechanism should be established for
negotiating with Beijing a framework for peaceful cross-Taiwan Strait
interaction.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that it will take only 26 days for the country to
get fully prepared for the March 20 "peace referendum," the officials
said.</P>
      <P>Since the referendum is being initiated by the president himself
rather than by the Taiwan people, the initiation process will be much
shorter than the 60-80 days that would normally be required, Central
Election Commission Chairman Huang Shih-cheng said last week.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO RISK IN CONSUMING CHICKEN MEAT OR EGGS: COA HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture (COA) assured the public on Monday that there is no risk
in consuming chicken meat or chicken eggs as high temperatures can
kill the bird influenza virus.</P>
      <P>COA Chairman Lee Chin-lung tried to allay the public's jitters
about the recent outbreaks of avian influenza which have so far led
to the culling of tens of thousands of ducks and chickens on farms in
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As wire reports have also said that thousands of chickens on
poultry farms have been destroyed out of fears of avian flu outbreaks
in Asian countries and that an additional two cases of humans being
infected with the deadly A(H5N1) virus were reported in Vietnam, the
legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
has invited officials from the COA, the Department of Health and the
Environmental Protection Administration to give reports.</P>
      <P>Lee said that Holland, Belgium, Germany and several countries in
Asia have reported the A virus, while Taiwan is still a bird-flu free
area.</P>
      <P>He said that all the fowl on the five chicken farms and one duck
farm in Taiwan where the low pathogenic H5N2 avian flu virus was
detected have since been destroyed.</P>
      <P>The government has also stepped up disinfection work and
compensated the poultry farm owners, Lee said.</P>
      <P>But he also pointed out that as Taiwan lies on the path of
migratory birds, and with the persistent smuggling of poultry into
Taiwan, he would not rule out the possibility of an onslaught of the
high pathogenic A(H5N1) avian flu virus.</P>
      <P>He said the most urgent task now is stepping up overall
monitoring, strengthening the monitoring and sampling stations at the
observation posts set up in Chiayi and the outlying island of Penghu,
and asking the poultry industry to establish high nets to guard
against the fowl coming in contact with one another. "The government
will provide subsidies if necessary, " he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REFERENDUMS MUST BE CARRIED OUT IN LINE WITH LAW: KMT WHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT) fully supports the
holding of referendums in Taiwan but insists that any referendum must
be carried out in line with the Referendum Law, a KMT party whip at
the Legislative Yuan said Monday.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Huang Ter-fu said that the KMT will not
intentionally boycott the referendum promoted by President Chen
Shui-bian which is being referred to by the administration as a
"peace referendum, " but he added that the party is opposed to the
"illegal" referendum that is "being strategically merged" into the
March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, also a KMT stalwart,
said last week that referendums are a right of the people as stated
in the Republic of China Constitution, but added that a referendum
must be held in accordance with the Referendum Law.</P>
      <P>KMT leaders have said recently that Article 17 of the Referendum
Law, which was passed late last year, empowers the president to call
a referendum when the nation faces an obvious and immediate threat.
Such a condition, however, does not currently exist for the holding
of a "defensive referendum, "they said.</P>
      <P>If the government insists on holding a referendum in tandem with
the March 20 presidential election, Huang said, the KMT will then
call for the Central Election Committee to maintain its neutrality in
election affairs and allow the voters to cast their referendum votes
on ballots separate from those for the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, another KMT party whip, Liao Feng-teh, said that the
KMT supports both referendums and the new 10 major national
construction projects which were put forth by the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Liao urged the ruling Democratic Progressive Party not to misuse
the two issues as campaign schemes in the run-up to the presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Liao said that he has learned that many voters have decided that
on the March 20 election day, they will either not accept a
referendum ballot or not mark a choice on the ballot.</P>
      <P>Huang and Liao made the remarks on the first day of the new
Legislative Yuan session, which is expected to become a battlefield
for the ruling DPP and the opposition parties in the run-up to the
presidential election, with the referendum and the budget plan on the
new 10 major construction projects being the core issues of debate.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian announced in mid-January that a "peace
referendum" would be held on the day of the presidential election to
ask voters whether Taiwan should further beef up its anti-missile
defenses if Beijing refuses to withdraw the hundreds of ballistic
missiles aimed at Taiwan and whether a mechanism should be
established for negotiations with Beijing over a framework for
peaceful cross-Taiwan Strait interaction.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WHO OFFICIAL URGES COUNTRIES NOT TO OVERREACT REGARDING BIRD FLU FEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva, Feb. 2 (CNA)
(By C.H. Lu and P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As the bird flu epidemic continues to spread
across Asia, a World Health Organization official on Monday called
for affected countries not to overreact regarding fears the disease
may now be transmitted from person to person.</P>
      <P>The official, who is responsible for the WHO global influenza
program, made the remarks while responding to questions raised by the
Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Although those countries that have been facing bird flu outbreaks
should make efforts to prevent the spread of the disease, he said, it
is not necessary for them to overreact regarding the possibility of
human-to-human transmission of avian flu.</P>
      <P>He made the comments a day after the WHO said that two sisters in
Vietnam who died of bird flu last month probably caught the virus
from their brother -- the first cases of human-to-human infection.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the H5N1 virus has been transmitted among fowl
over a period of time and that more than a thousand people have been
exposed to the virus, the official said the fact that only a few
people have been infected demonstrates that the disease is not easily
transmitted to humans.</P>
      <P>The official noted that the WHO's five-level global alert
mechanism for the bird flu has been maintained at the zero level,
meaning there is no global epidemic. He said the WHO's investigations
have shown there have been no further cases of human-to-human
transmission of the disease.</P>
      <P>Although the WHO will not rule out the possibility, the official
said that currently there is no scientific evidence to confirm that
bird flu will become an epidemic in which the disease is transmitted
among humans.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Renowned AIDS specialist David Ho warned in
Beijing Monday that if the bird flu virus genetically combines with
the human influenza virus to create a new virus, the consequences
could be serious.</P>
      <P>Ho said that the H5N1 avian flu virus, which is more pathogenic
than the H5N2 virus, can be transmitted from fowl to humans, but
added that the possibility of human-to-human transmission is very
low.</P>
      <P>However, if the H5N1 virus combines with the H5N2 human influenza
virus to create a new H5N2 virus, this might trigger large-scale
human-to-human transmissions, Ho said during an interview with
reporters from the Hong Kong-based daily Wen Wei Po. He said that
such a situation would be extremely serious as no people would be
immune to the new virus.</P>
      <P>He added that a major, large-scale outbreak of influenza occurs
about once every 30 years. The most serious outbreak occurred in
1918, with some 40 million people dying from the disease.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore may be free of the deadly bird
flu, but many Singaporeans have been buying prescription flu drugs as
an added protection, especially those who have to travel to affected
countries.</P>
      <P>Experts say prescription flu drugs like Tamiflu can protect
healthy people from the bird flu, as well as prevent lethal
complications for flu victims. As a result, the Raffles Medical Group
of 60 clinics has seen a tenfold increase in demand for Tamiflu in
the past month.</P>
      <P>Tamiflu does not come cheap, costing about US$2.80 per pill. And
unlike a flu vaccine, which can last a year, Tamiflu is only
effective during the period of consumption.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will register his
candidacy for the March 20 presidential election Wednesday, a

      <P>Chen is scheduled to arrive at the Central Election Commission
(CEC) at 11 a.m. in the company of representatives from Taiwan's four

      <P>"The arrangement is aimed at signifying harmony among the four
major ethnic groups -- Minnan (Taiwanese) , Hakka, mainlanders and
Aborigines," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Chen's top five campaign aides, including Premier Yu Shyi-kun,
Taipei County Magistrate Su Tzen-chang and Kaohsiung Mayor Frank

headquarters prior to Chen's registration to expound on the gist of
Chen's platform for his re-election bid, the spokesman went on.</P>
      <P>The upcoming election will be a race between the "pan-blue

    <HEADLINE>DISTRICT COURT TO IMPLEMENT CHILD CUSTODY RULING ON BRAZILIAN BOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Feb.  3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung District Court will use
force to take a boy at the center of an international custody battle
away from his Taiwanese uncle and send him home to his legal guardian
in Brazil if the uncle fails to hand over the boy voluntarily by Feb.
5, a judge said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Liao Cheng-hsiung, a judge at the district court's civil suit
execution department, said the representative of the boy's Brazilian
legal guardian is scheduled to lead a judge and local police officers
to take the boy away from his Taiwanese uncle's home Feb. 6.</P>
      <P>Liao said the court hopes that Wu Hou-yen will voluntarily hand
over Iruan Wu Ergui to his legal guardian's representative in Taiwan
by the Feb. 5 deadline to avoid further unnecessary trouble.</P>
      <P>Since the Supreme Court has meted out a final verdict that the
boy's guardianship belongs to his Brazilian grandmother, Rosa Ergui,
Liao said he hopes Wu will respect the court ruling.</P>
      <P>Rosa Ergui has commissioned Brazil's representative to Taiwan,
Paulo A.P. Pinto, to take Iruan, who is better known as Wu Yi-hua in
Taiwan, back to Brazil on her behalf.</P>
      <P>Iruan was born out of wedlock in Brazil in July 1995 to a
Brazilian mother and a Taiwanese father. His mother died six years
ago and his grandmother was appointed his legal guardian. He was
brought to Taiwan in March 2001 by his father, who died a couple of
weeks later. Wu, the boy's uncle, refused to allow the child to leave
for home, and the boy has since been living in the southern Taiwan
county of Kaohsiung and is now a second-grader at a local elementary
school.</P>
      <P>His grandmother eventually resorted to legal action to regain
custody of her grandson when it became clear that Wu would not let
her take the child back to Brazil in 2001.</P>
      <P>Wu said over the weekend that he hopes Ergui will come to Taiwan
to take the boy back in person.</P>
      <P>"I'll feel at ease only when I can hand over my nephew to his
Brazilian grandmother in person," said Wu.</P>
      <P>However, the grandmother said earlier that she would not come to
come to Taiwan again because she wants to avoid the media harassment,
which she feels is bad for the boy.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan regulations, if Wu refuses to comply with the
court order, he can be fined between NT$30,000 and NT$300,000
(US$890-US$8,902) and if he still refuses to hand over the boy, the
court can keep fining him. If Wu continues to hold out, the court
will ultimately order the police to implement the transfer of
custody.</P>
      <P>A support group has been formed in Kaohsiung County that has
called for donations of NT$10 (US$0.296) per person to help Wu pay
for the fines and support for the boy.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's planned referendum will be
favorable for the future development of cross-Taiwan Strait
relations, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Explaining a statement made by President Chen Shui-bian earlier
that day on the "peace referendum" to be held March 20 to coincide
with the presidential election, Tsai said that the two questions to
be put to the vote in the referendum show that the government is
trying to actively settle the differences between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait by peaceful means.</P>
      <P>She told the foreign diplomats gathered at the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs that Beijing should respect the collective will
demonstrated in the referendum.</P>
      <P>According to Chen's statement, the two referendum questions are
as follows:</P>
      <P>-- "The people of Taiwan demand that the Taiwan Strait issue be
resolved through peaceful means. Should mainland China refuse to
withdraw the missiles it has targeted at Taiwan and openly renounce
the use of force against us, would you agree that the government
should acquire more advanced anti-missile weapons to strengthen
Taiwan's self-defense capabilities?"</P>
      <P>-- "Would you agree that our government should engage in
negotiation with mainland China on the establishment of a peace and
stability framework for cross-strait interaction in order to build
consensus and for the welfare of the peoples of both sides?"</P>
      <P>Referring to Chen's proposal for establishing liaison offices on
each side of the strait by the two sides, Tsai said that her office
does not rule out the possibility that representatives of the
proposed liaison offices will be assigned by the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) of Taiwan and the Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) of mainland China, respectively.</P>

      <P>Senior Presidential Advisor Peng Ming-min,
traveling at the head of a Taiwan delegation, left Tuesday for
Washington, D.C., where he will take part in the 2004 U.S. National
Prayer Breakfast slated for Thursday.</P>
      <P>The delegation also includes Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Kau
Ying-mao, lawmakers Chen Tan-sun and Parris Chang of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party and opposition Kuomintang lawmakers John
Chang and Sun Guo-hua, as well as representatives from the academic
spectrum and the private sector.</P>
      <P>In addition to participating in the Feb. 5. breakfast, in which
delegation members will meet U.S. government officials and their
counterparts from around the world, they will also meet local
political figures, think tank members and Chinese community leaders
to exchange views on U.S.-Taiwan relations and other issues of mutual
concern.</P>
      <P>Dismissing speculation that the trip by Kau and Chen might have
something to do with Taiwan's planned March 20 referendum, Richard
Shih, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said the vice
minister will simply attend the annual gathering and stressed that it
has nothing to do with the referendum issue.</P>
      <P>Both Kau and Chen were members of a propaganda mission recently
organized by the National Security Council to explain to the United
States the purpose and contents of the March 20 referendum called by
President Chen Shui-bian, while Parris Chang was a leader of a
similar mission aimed at European countries.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed prior to his departure from Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport that his trip is totally irrelevant to the
referendum issue and added that no one has instructed them to
publicize the issue in the United States.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHRISTMAS MAY BE MADE NATIONAL HOLIDAY: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that
he will think about reinstating Dec. 25 as national holiday, although
in celebration of Christmas rather than its original purpose of
marking the Republic of China's Constitution Day.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with a group of foreign
Catholic missionaries who have contributed the prime of their lives
to serving the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The holiday was canceled after the government adjusted the
work-week and national holiday schedules a few years ago.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is aware that many Catholic devotees are
discontented with the cancellation of the Dec. 25 holiday. "We'll
further discuss this issue in hope of forging a national consensus.
I'll be glad to see the proposal receive the support of a majority of
local citizens," he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Catholic church has long played an important role
in Taiwan's development and modernization, Chen said he appreciates
the devoted services of the large number of foreign Catholic
missionaries to the people of Taiwan over the decades.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said, many Catholic priests have helped promote
Taiwan's cultural exchanges with other countries as well as assist in
the preservation and dissemination of Taiwan's cultural legacies,
including publishing important dictionaries, translating the Bible
and preserving the languages and cultures of Taiwan's aboriginal
tribes.</P>
      <P>Chen further said he admires Pope John Paul II's efforts to
promote world peace. "I fully support the pope's appeal in his 2004
World Peace Day message that leaders of countries around the world
are obligated to promote peace and that a new world order should be
based on concern, justice and morals," he added.</P>
      <P>The president said he believes that promoting a culture of peace
and creating a goodwill and reconciliatory environment are crucial to
maintaining peace across the Taiwan Strait and ensuring regional
stability and prosperity. He assured the Catholic missionaries that
he will lead Taiwan along the "road of democracy and peace."</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Chen also promised that the Cabinet will use
its reserve funds to pay for the NT$10,000 service fee for each
foreign missionary who applies for permanent residency in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Money is not a problem. The government should pay the charge to
show its gratitude for foreign clergymen who have dedicated
themselves to working for Taiwan throughout the years," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Bush bets America agrees
with his fiscal priorities.

President Bush on Monday unveiled a budget with cuts in domestic
programs but big increases for the military, showing himself a
gambler willing to bet his re-election that he made the correct
fiscal choices.

Mr. Bush's calculation is that voters will care far more about
protecting the nation from another terrorist attack than about cuts
to popular programs, or, for that matter, the record-high deficit.

Wall Street Journal: Bush unveils budget package of $2.4
Trillion.

Preparing the way for his re-election bid, President Bush
proposed a $2.4 trillion budget that promises to sharply slash the
deficit over the coming five years but relies on some fiscal sleight
of hand in an effort to reach his goal.

The budget reflects the president's top political priorities --
taxes and security -- at the expense of other domestic programs.</TEXT>

      <P>Eye specialists in Singapore said Monday
that medicines which alleviate flu symptoms might put some people at
risk of glaucoma or blindness.</P>
      <P>Experts from the National Eye Centre said any medicine which

in the nose and preventing your nose from running, " said Steve Seah,

      <P>"One of the side-effects is the dilation of the pupil. Those at
risk from the disease will suffer a build-up of fluid pressure in the
eye when their pupils dilate, and this leads to glaucoma, " he

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 3 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The central government is planning to build
two de-salination plants on Penghu Island during the next two years
to ease a water shortage that has been a problem for several years.</P>
      <P>The decision was made during a meeting held last week by a
commission under the Executive Yuan chaired by Vice Premier Lin
Hsin-i. Officials attending the meeting discussed issues pertaining
to water, power and medical resources supplies for the outlying
island off Taiwan's southwest coast.</P>
      <P>The decision was finalized after officials from the Taiwan
Provincial Water Company gave a briefing about the present situation
on Penghu, which has been hit by a severe drought over the past two
years, with its reservoirs now nearly dry.</P>
      <P>Construction plans for the two de-salination plants, one capable
of containing 2,500 tons of water and the other 3,000 tons, is slated
to be completed in mid-2005 and 2006 as a means of securing a long-
term water supply for local residents.</P>
      <P>It was also decided that current shipments of fresh water from
Taiwan to Penghu will be maintained until August of this year in the
face of the slim possibility of abundant rainfall in the coming
months.</P>
      <P>Penghu and the rest of the country, particularly the north, have
been troubled by a continued dry spell since 2002. Conserving water
has become an urgent matter for the public and the government.</P>
      <P>In line with government measures, the island county of Penghu has
been under the second phase of water restrictions since May 10, 2003.</P>
      <P>According to a set of water restriction measures worked out by a
national anti-drought task force in March last year, the second phase
comprises a 20 percent cutback in water supply to heavy users such as
car washes, saunas and swimming pools.</P>

      <P>During the question-and-answer session, Chen was asked if he is
re-elected, will he continue his "four noes plus one" pledge outlined
in his 2000 inaugural speech or will he forsake those promises?</P>
      <P>In response, Chen said a promise is a promise. "A promise is
timeless, and I'll never lightly back off my promise," he
stressed.</P>
      <P>Over the past four years, Chen said he has faithfully honored his
"four noes plus one" pledge which includes no change to Taiwan's
national title and flag and no holding of an independence vs.

      <P>If re-elected, Chen said he will definitely repeat the "four noes
plus one" pledge in his inaugural speech.</P>
      <P>Chen, who is running a tight race with the opposition "pan-blue

the current achievements.</P>
      <P>"We'll also do whatever we can to protect Taiwan's sovereign
status quo, democratic status quo, economic prosperity status quo and

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwanese uncle of a
Taiwanese-Brazilian boy at the center of an international custody
battle said Wednesday he will wait for the court to implement its
ruling on the child's guardianship.</P>
      <P>Wu Hou-yen made the remarks after the Kaohsiung District Court
said a day earlier it will use force to take Iruan Wu Ergui away from
his Taiwanese uncle Feb. 6 and send him home to his legal guardian in
Brazil if the uncle fails to hand over the boy voluntarily by Feb. 5.</P>
      <P>Wu said he and his family and members of a support group formed
last year to help Iruan, better known as Wu Yi-hua in Taiwan, will
stay at home Feb. 6 to wait for law enforcement officers to implement
the court ruling.</P>
      <P>According to the district court, the representative of the boy's
Brazilian legal guardian is scheduled to lead a judge and local
police officers to Wu's home in the southern Taiwan county of
Kaohsiung at 10 a.m. Feb. 6.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Supreme Court meted out a final verdict last November
that the boy's guardianship belongs to his Brazilian grandmother,
Rosa Ergui.</P>
      <P>Rosa Ergui has commissioned Brazil's representative to Taiwan, Paulo
A.P. Pinto, to take Iruan back to Brazil on her behalf.</P>
      <P>Iruan was born out of wedlock in Brazil in July 1995 to a
Brazilian mother and a Taiwanese father. His mother died six years
ago and his grandmother was appointed his legal guardian. He was
brought to Taiwan in March 2001 by his father, who died a couple of
weeks later. Wu, the boy's uncle, refused to allow the child to leave
for home, and the boy has since been living in Kaohsiung and is now a
second-grader at a local elementary school.</P>
      <P>His grandmother eventually resorted to legal action to regain
custody of her grandson when it became clear that Wu would not let
her take the child back to Brazil in 2001.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan regulations, if Wu refuses to comply with the
court order, he can be fined between NT$30,000 and NT$300,000
(US$890-US$8,902) and if he still refuses to hand over the boy, the
court can keep fining him. If Wu continues to hold out, the court
will ultimately order the police to implement the transfer of
custody.</P>
      <P>A support group has been formed in Kaohsiung County that has
called for donations of NT$10 (US$0.296) per person to help Wu pay
for the fines and support for the boy.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the support group said Wednesday that the support
group will cooperate with the Brazilian office of the Buddhist
Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation and the Taiwanese Chamber of
Commerce in Brazil in helping Iruan after the boy returns there.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET APPROVES TWO REFERENDUM QUESTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet approved at its weekly meeting
Wednesday the two questions to be put forth for the nation's
first-ever referendum to coincide with the March 20 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>The two questions were listed in a letter sent by President Chen
Shui-bian a day earlier detailing his rationale for holding the
referendum.</P>
      <P>Quoting Chen's letter, Premier Yu Shyi-kun said at a news
conference held after the Cabinet meeting that Beijing's repression
of Taiwan in the international arena and its deployment of hundreds
of missiles against the island constitute a threat that jeopardizes
the country's sovereignty and that the danger justifies a
presidential call for a referendum under the country's newly enacted
Referendum Law.</P>
      <P>Yu said the upcoming referendum will mark a further step forward
in Taiwan's democratic development as it will allow all eligible
voters to decide major national policy issues.</P>
      <P>"A referendum is the most direct, evident and effective
embodiment of democracy. We'll write a new chapter in our political
history by holding the referendum," Yu said.</P>
      <P>He said the Cabinet will direct all relevant government agencies
to administer referendum affairs based on the principles of
"simplicity, convenience, prudence and impartiality."</P>
      <P>In order to prevent Beijing attacking Taiwan, the president said
in his letter, the referendum will ask the following two questions:</P>
      <P>-- "The people of Taiwan demand that the Taiwan Strait issue be
resolved through peaceful means. Should mainland China refuse to

    <HEADLINE>LIEN REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO QUIT PARTY POST IF ELECTED PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan reaffirmed his commitment Wednesday to quit his party post if he
wins the March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lien, who has teamed up with People First Party (PFP) Chairman
James Soong to challenge President Chen Shui-bian's re-election bid,
made the reaffirmation when he was asked by the media whether his
previous promise to quit the KMT chairmanship remains valid and how
the KMT-PFP coalition, more commonly known as the "pan-blue
alliance," will operate provided the Lien-Soong ticket claims victory
in the upcoming election.</P>
      <P>Lien said he would not continue serving as KMT chairman if he
wins the presidency.</P>
      <P>"If I win the election and my current party chairmanship tenure
expires, I won't seek re-election as KMT chairman. I hope to
cultivate a new generation of party elites to lead the KMT to an even
brighter future," Lien said.</P>
      <P>Noting that he personally takes the KMT's loss of power four
years ago as a "blessing, " Lien said the painful defeat has forced
the party to make self-reflections and undergo sweeping intraparty
reforms and restructuring.</P>
      <P>"We have reinvented ourselves, shedding old burdens and
streamlining our bloated party apparatus, " Lien said, claiming that
the KMT has transformed itself into a "lean and mean" organization
with a transparent, efficient and democratic operational framework.</P>
      <P>And if he wins the presidency, Lien said, he will cultivate
younger members to take over the party's helm. "I hope the KMT will
be able to continue moving forward on the basis of its current
achievements under new leadership with new thinking and new working
styles to face even tougher challenges in the future," he added.</P>
      <P>As for the "pan-blue alliance's" future operations, Lien said he
basically hopes to see the two parties merge into a large political
force. "I think such a development will benefit both our two parties
and our country as a whole."</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lien admitted that the merger proposal is only his
personal view. "The realization of the proposal is still subject to
many subjective and objective factors," he noted.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, Lien said, the "pan-blue alliance" has
crafted many viable cooperative mechanisms. "If we win the election,
the alliance will form a professional and competent team to take over
national administration work," he added.</P>
      <P>Lien's remarks were seen as a rebuttal to allegations by some
detractors that once the Lien-Soong ticket wins, their two parties
will engage in a power struggle which they said could bring
misfortune to the country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HOME-RAISED CHICKENS COULD BE OPEN TO AVIAN FLU: HEALTH DEPARTMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official of the Department of Health
(DOH) has advised people against raising their own chickens in an
attempt to avoid coming into contact with avian flu.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-yi, deputy director-general of the health department's
Center for Disease Control, spoke amid reports that some people who
want to eat chicken and eggs are thinking of raising the birds
themselves to avoid buying chickens in the market that could be
infected with the virus that spreads avian flu.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is an avian flu-free country, the emergence of
H5N2, a less lethal form of the H5N1 avian flu virus, in chicken and
duck farms in southern Taiwan has forced the culling of tens of
thousands of fowl.</P>
      <P>Reports that the death toll from the illness in Asia has risen to
13 has also contributed to a sharp decrease in demand for chicken and
related products in local poultry markets.</P>
      <P>Shih said that if people raising chickens do not effectively
isolate their birds from wild birds, their chickens could still come
into contact with infected birds.</P>
      <P>"Don't thing you're smart and can raise healthy chickens, " Shih
said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that professional chicken farms have nets to
prevent wild birds from entering their facilities. They also have the
ability to keep their chicken coops clean of droppings, he added.</P>
      <P>If chickens raised by private individuals do contact bird flu
from an outside animal, he said, the possibility exists of furthering
the rate of mutation of the virus that causes the malady.</P>
      <P>He also said that pet birds are safe if they have not come into
contact with other fowl and there is no need to destroy them.</P>
      <P>Chen Lung-hung, director of the health department's Bureau of
Food Sanitation, also tried to soothe public jitters Wednesday about
the safety of eating chicken and eggs.</P>
      <P>He said that as long as consumers choose products that have the
"CAS" seal indicating that the foodstuff in question has been
inspected by health authorities, there is nothing to fear.</P>
      <P>It is also better to buy eggs with cleaned shells so there will
be no chance of contamination, he said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the flu virus is unable to withstand high temperatures;
for instance, he said, fully cooked chicken or eggs will render the
food safe, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei recorded its coldest January in seven
years, with an average temperature of just 15.4 degrees Celsius,
according to the latest tallies released Wednesday by the Department
of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DBAS) under the Taipei city
government.</P>
      <P>DBAS officials said average temperatures in Taiwan have shown an
upward trend for a long time, but recorded a reverse last year, with
the average temperature in Taipei recorded as 23.5 degrees last year,
down 0.3 degrees from the 23.8 degrees recorded the previous year.</P>
      <P>Due to the onslaught of a series of cold fronts, the
average temperature dropped to just 15.4 degrees in Taipei, setting
a new low in seven years, they said.</P>
      <P>Taipei has also suffered from water shortages in recent years,
the officials noted, pointing out that Taipei received just 1,192.5
millimeters of rainfall last year, lower than the 1,346.4
millimeters recorded the previous year and the lowest on record in 52
years.</P>
      <P>The tallies show that the figure is only 51.59 percent of the
average rainfall of 2,311.6 millimeters over the past decade.
Rainfall in Taipei in every month of last year was lower than that of
the average monthly rainfall over the past decade, with 1.7
millimeters in December 2003 the lowest of all.</P>
      <P>In terms of the number of what the DBAS described as "rainy days,
" except for 134 days in 1963, rainy days in Taipei over the past
five decades exceeded 150, but the figure dropped to 136 days in
2002, and 127 days in 2003, setting a new low.</P>
      <P>Water reserves at the Feitsui Reservoir, which supplies water to
the greater Taipei area, are not satisfactory, the officials added.
They said that the average water level at the reservoir was 146.47
meters last year representing only 15.58 million cubic meters of
waters, the second-lowest figure recorded for years.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Germany-based Festo -- the world's
second-largest pneumatics automation company -- inaugurated an
engineering center in Taiwan Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The center, located at the Engineering Department under the
Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) in northern Hsinchu
County, was set up by Festo with assistance from the Department of
Industrial Technology under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) ,
according to Tsai Hsin-yuan, head of the ITRI'S engineering
department.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, Festo and the ITRI signed a memorandum of
understanding in December last year to forge and boost two-way
cooperation.</P>
      <P>The pact is expected to boost the government's efforts to promote
the domestic hi-tech sector, particularly at a time when the MOEA is
in full gear advocating its "two-trillion, two-star" program aimed at
making Taiwan a key hub of various forms of core high-technology,
Tsai said.</P>
      <P>The opening of Festo's Taiwan engineering center is proof of
Taiwan's competitiveness in technological strength, manpower and
government assistance, Tsai said, pointing out that the German
company chose Taiwan to set up the center after finding that Taiwan
outperforms mainland China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea in all
these fields.</P>
      <P>The company is likely to set up a research and development center
in Taiwan in the future, he added.</P>
      <P>"Didactic, " which is Festo's unit of learning systems for
automation and technology -- will launch an iCIM (Internet Computer
Integrated Manufacturing) program jointly with the ITRI to recruit
and train professional new blood for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Festo (Taiwan) General Manager Liang Chen-chuan,
Festo has funneled NT$50 million (about US$1.5 million) into the
engineering center.</P>
      <P>In the initial stages, Festo will station six engineers from
Germany and six from Taiwan at the facility to focus on the study and
development of compressed air automation components related to the
semiconductor and opto-electronics industries, Liang explained.</P>
      <P>With support from Taiwan's government, academic and industrial
sectors, Festo's engineering center is poised to help Taiwan
companies in related industries upgrade their production levels, he
said.</P>
      <P>Festo, the world's oldest manufacturer of automation with
pneumatic components and systems, was set up in 1925. Its annual
business revenue totals about US$45 billion and its service network
encompasses 176 countries around the world.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REFERENDUM CALLED BY PRESIDENT IS DOUBLY WRONG: KMT CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  4 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The referendum called by President Chen
Shui-bian is the result of a double-barreled mistake, opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan, who will compete against Chen in
the March 20 presidential election, claimed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Referendum Law is seriously flawed in authorizing the
president to initiate a referendum in case of emergency and President
Chen Shui-bian has committed a mistake in using this power in a
situation not intended by the law, Lien said in an interview with a
group of media.</P>
      <P>The president's power to call a referendum in case of emergency
was included in the Referendum Law at the insistence of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) . It is part of the president's
right to address emergencies provided for in the Constitution and
should not be included in the Referendum Law, which is of a much lower
echelon than the Constitution in the legal system, according to Lien.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the power awarded to the president by the Referendum
Law to call a referendum should be invoked only when the country is
threatened by outside forces that might damage its sovereignty.
However, the president has abused this power by organizing a
referendum that is not designed to deal with any emergency at all,
Lien argued.</P>
      <P>Instead of cautioning the president about his mistakes, the
Executive Yuan and other related government agencies have turned a
blind eye to the controversy surrounding the referendum, which is why
many county chiefs are bridling at working with the central
government to implement the referendum, Lien claimed.</P>
      <P>The consequences of the referendum will be far-reaching and both
the KMT and its political ally the People First Party will have to
wait until the referendum's political implications sink in to figure
out a way to address them, Lien went on.</P>
      <P>The president's insistence on pushing ahead with the referendum
has created an uproar on the international stage because it is
considered by many of Taiwan's neighbors as a provocative act. Worst
of all, it strains Taiwan's ties with the United States, which is the
country's most important supporter, said Lien.</P>
      <P>The United States, preoccupied with the problems in Iraq and
North Korea, need Beijing's cooperation and does not want to see
Taiwan divert its attention by causing problems with mainland China.
To be a considerate friend, the president should take into account
the U.S. position and stop the referendum, Lien said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Representative to France
Chiou Jong-nan said Tuesday that the cancellation of visits to Paris
by two senior Taiwan officials will not affect exchanges and
cooperation between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Chiou made the remarks before presiding over the presentation of
the 2004 Taiwan-France Science and Technology Award at the Institut
du France.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's National Science Council Chairman Wei Che-ho was
originally scheduled to travel to Paris to present the award, but he
canceled his travel plan after French President Jacques Chirac
publicly opposed Taiwan's decision to hold a referendum on mainland
China's missile threat to coincide with the March 20 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>For the same reason, Taiwan's top culture administrator --
Council for Cultural Affairs Chairwoman Tchen Yu-chiou -- also
canceled her trip to Paris to present an annual Taiwan-France culture
award on Monday.</P>
      <P>As a result, Chiou presented the culture and science awards,
respectively, on behalf of Tchen and Wei.</P>
      <P>Chiou said the two officials will still visit Paris later this
year, stressing that the recent incident will not affect
Taiwan-France exchanges and cooperation in the long run.</P>
      <P>In comments made during a visit to France by mainland Chinese
President Hu Jintao in late January, Chirac described Taiwan's
referendum plan as a "grave error" and said the referendum initiative
could destabilize the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Chiou said Chirac's "ingratiating manner" toward mainland China
has been harshly criticized by the French news media and many
political analysts.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties, Chiou said,
Taiwan-French cultural and economic exchanges have been growing
steadily. Nearly all France's luxury fashion brands have set up
marketing footholds in Taiwan as they cannot ignore Taiwan's
consumers' strong purchasing power and their quest for high-quality
goods, Chiou said.</P>
      <P>Many French culture officials and members of the diplomatic corps
in Paris attended the eighth Taiwan-France Culture Award presentation
ceremony to express their support for Taiwan, Chiou said.</P>
      <P>The World Culture Hall in Paris received the 2004 culture award
for its efforts to introduce Taiwan's achievements in arts and
culture to France over the past decade.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Patrice Tran Ba Huy, an ear, nose and throat physician
who heads a neurobiology laboratory jointly founded by Paris' Seventh
University and Fifth University and the French National Science
Research Center, received the fifth Taiwan-France Science and
Technology Award for his contributions in promoting bilateral
research cooperation.</P>
      <P>More than 10 ear, nose and throat doctors from various Taiwan

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO DISTRIBUTE 8.5 MILLION CAMPAIGN LEAFLETS ON REFERENDUM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior will distribute
8.5 million campaign pamphlets to prepare for Taiwan's first
referendum to be held alongside the March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Yu Cheng-hsien made the announcement at
a press conference presided over by Premier Yu Shyi-kun after the
Executive Yuan approved Wednesday the two questions to be put to the
referendum vote.</P>
      <P>The premier asked all related government agencies to adopt the
principles of "simplicity, convenience, exercise of caution and
fairness" to ensure that the referendum is a success.</P>
      <P>Accompanying the premier and interior minister at the press
conference were Vice Premier Lin Hsin-i, Secretary-General of the
Executive Yuan Liu Shih-fang, Minister without Portfolio Hsu
Chi-hsiung, Foreign Affairs Minister Eugene Chien, Mainland Affairs
Council Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen and Deputy National Defense Minister
Lin Chong-pin.</P>
      <P>The interior minister said his ministry is busy printing the
referendum campaign pamphlets and producing two TV clips on the
referendum, which should be ready by Feb. 10.</P>
      <P>He said the ministry will distribute the pamphlets to each
household so that the public will understand more about the gist of
the "peace referendum."</P>
      <P>The questions that the president sent to the Executive Yuan for
approval concern the strengthening of national defense and
cross-strait negotiation on an equal footing.</P>
      <P>The first question is designed to tell the public that Taiwan
needs to enhance its anti-missile capability in the face of the
missile threat from mainland China, while the second expresses the
keen desire of the Taiwan people to resume stalled cross-strait talks
and urge Beijing to conduct talks on the establishment of a
cross-strait consultation framework, exchanges on an equal footing, a
political relationship based on mutual respect and avoidance of
military conflicts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLICE SEIZE 30 KG OF HEROIN AT KEELUNG HARBOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Law enforcement officers seized 30 kilograms
of high-purity heroin that had been smuggled in a container from
Thailand to Keelung Harbor, northern Taiwan, and arrested two
suspects, Investigation Bureau (IB) officials announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tipped off that a drug ring was attempting to smuggle the drugs
in a shipping container, the IB formed a squad that swooped on a
container supposedly full of porcelain vases aboard a freighter at
Keelung Harbor Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Law enforcement officers went over the container twice without
finding anything before they found the blocks of heroin, which they
estimated to have a market value of nearly NT$700 million (US$21.6
million), hidden under planking at the bottom of the container.</P>
      <P>They then arrested two suspects involved in the smuggling
operations, Chiang Nien-chu, 51, and Lin Lung-kuang, 48.</P>
      <P>The raid followed a tip-off via "international cooperation
channels" a year ago that the two suspects were going to smuggle in a
large quantity of drugs in a container around Chinese New Year and
they were able to apprehend the smugglers despite the fact that they
repeatedly changed the shipping schedule.</P>
      <P>Judging from the size of the haul, the police did not rule out
the possibility that other suspects may have been involved in the
operation.</P>
      <P>IB officials stressed that they are stepping up information
exchanges with other nations to crack down on drug trafficking
operations and that this cooperation contributed to the Keelung bust,
one of the largest in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>They also said that as of the end of last December, the IB was
holding 2,905.125 kg of confiscated drugs in its warehouses.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FERRY SERVICE BETWEEN KINMEN, XIAMEN ENHANCED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Feb.  4 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The "mini three links" maintained between
Taiwan-held Kinmen Island and Xiamen Port in mainland China's Fujian
Province has entered a new era, with each side now operating three
round-trip passenger ferries per day.</P>
      <P>The new arrangement kicked off Feb. 3 after Kinmen county
officials and representatives from the Xiamen port authorities and a
ferry company agreed upon the new schedule during a meeting Jan. 27
in Xiamen.</P>
      <P>Kinmen Tourism Bureau Director Chen Chao-chin said the mini links
-- direct transport and trade services set up in January 2001 between
the islands of Kinmen and Matsu and the Fujian ports of Xiamen and
Mawei -- served a total of 21,377 passengers during the first year.
The figure rose to 53,681 in 2002 and to 160,103 in 2003.</P>
      <P>A 25-day special package designed to transport a large number of
mainland-based Taiwan businessmen on the route during the Jan. 9-Feb.
2 period surrounding the Chinese New Year holiday season serviced a
total of 22,582 passengers, Chen said, pointing out that the jump in
traveler numbers pushed the two sides to hold talks on stepping up
the ferry services based on the existing framework.</P>
      <P>To begin with, the Kinmen-Xiamen ferry service was irregular
without a fixed timetable. It started to provide a two-weekly service
on a regular basis in May 2002 and this was increased to a three- and
a four-weekly regular round trip service recently, Chen reported.</P>
      <P>The enhanced service now allows passengers to travel between the
two sides within just one day, making it the most economical and
time-saving travel option for the many Taiwan businessmen who have to
travel often between Taiwan and mainland.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the ferry timetables will be adjusted every month
to better serve the passengers, he said the Kinmen county government
is optimistic about the business prospects, as the central government
in Taipei is expected to ease its current rules to permit more people
to use the links in the near future, probably starting from March 1.</P>
      <P>At present, only Kinmen and Matsu residents and Taiwan
businessmen and their families based in Fujian Province are allowed
to use the direct links to travel between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng has demanded that the
central government deploy more coast guard vessels in Kinmen in order
to help strengthen sea traffic security and reduce smuggling in
surrounding waters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT REGISTERS FOR ELECTION CANDIDACY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian and his running
mate, Vice President Annette Lu, registered for re-election candidacy
in the March 20 election Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In an arrangement designed to signify ethnic harmony, the
president and vice president were accompanied by the representatives
of Taiwan's four major ethnic groups -- Minnan (Taiwanese) , Hakka,
aborigines and "mainlanders" -- people who arrived in Taiwan from
mainland China after 1949 -- as well as several prominent women, when
they arrived at the Central Election Commission (CEC) to a warm
greeting from CEC Chairman Huang Shih-cheng.</P>
      <P>They submitted their registration forms and posted a deposit bond
of NT$15 million (US$450,450) according to the regulations under the
Election and Recall Law of the President and Vice President.</P>
      <P>After completing the registration procedure, the president also
shouted out "believe in Taiwan, insist on reforms, " as well as
"victory for referendum and fighting for re-election."</P>
      <P>Chen's supporters had installed two giant "A-bian" -- Chen's
nickname -- dolls outside the CEC building in the morning and wielded
batons to cheer him on, while officials of an alliance distributed
pamphlets urging voters to spoil their ballot papers to boycott the
election, claiming that the campaign expenditures of both Chen and
his rival, Lien Chan of the opposition Kuomintang, have already
topped the ceiling stipulated under the election law.</P>
      <P>Lien and his running mate, People First Party Chairman James
Soong, registered at the CEC later in the day.</P>
      <P>Chen shook hands with each of his supporters as he left the
CEC amid chants of "a peaceful referendum and successful re-election"
by his supporters.</P>
      <P>Prior to their registration at the CEC, the president and the
vice president painted a vision of Taiwan at a press conference held
at their campaign headquarters.</P>
      <P>They were accompanied by top campaign aides, including Chang
Chun-hsiung, secretary-general of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party; Taipei County Magistrate Su Tseng-chang; Presidential Office
Secretary-general Chiou I-jen; and Ke Chien-ming, DPP party whip in
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>With just 45 days to go until the March 20 presidential election
and the nation's first-ever referendum, the president said that this
is a time for democracy to go forward.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan completed its first popular presidential
election in 1996 in the shadow of a missile threat from mainland
China, and the first political power transfer in the 2000
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is confident that the Taiwan people will vote in the
referendum "based on the conviction of believing in Taiwan and
insisting on reforms."</P>
      <P>He stressed that the ballots cast March 20 will not only signify
Taiwan's democracy and peace in the Taiwan Strait.
More importantly, the Taiwan people will continue to pursue
sustainable economic development and high-quality life under the two
pillars of "peace" and "democracy," he added.</P>
      <P>"This is the mission of A-bian and the commitment of the DPP
toward the people," the president said.</P>
      <P>He also said that during a recent rehearsal for a
"one-million-hand-in-hand" campaign scheduled for Feb. 28 -- Peace
Memorial Day -- he was moved to see that everyone, irrespective of
race or gender, held hands, with each person's 10 fingers signifying
the vision of what he called his "10 future Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The future Taiwan will have peace, democracy, economic
prosperity, justice, progress, harmony, clean politics, sustainable
development, voluntarism and dynamism, adding that the vision will be
created by the DPP and the Taiwan people together.</P>
      <P>Just as the party's campaign theme is "Yes! Taiwan! , " the
president said "dreams will come true if you believe in Taiwan and
insist on reforms, " and that Taiwan will surely become a "beautiful
and successful exclamation mark in the 21st century."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI SOCIETY CALLS FOR EFFORTS TO FACILITATE ELECTION DEBATES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The liberal Taipei Society on Wednesday
called for Taiwan's two rival political camps to facilitate the
holding of televised presidential election debates, a ritual which is
likely to hit a snag in the run-up to the 2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Differences and disputes between the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party and the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) have caused
negotiations over the holding of televised presidential election
debates to be postponed to Feb. 8.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Society, founded by a group of liberal scholars, will
not sit idly by and let any camp strategically maneuver to undermine
the holding of televised debates between the two presidential
candidates, Taipei Society Chairman Hung Yu-hung said.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Society does not exclude the possibility of
publicizing the negotiation process and the minutes of the meetings
between the DPP and the "pan-blue alliance" to let the Taiwan public
know exactly which party is being difficult and uncooperative, Hung
said.</P>
      <P>He said that although the Taipei Society will remain neutral and
not take sides during the election season, the group is not
restricting its members from making known their opinions on affairs
and events surrounding the March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Central Election Commission (CEC) has arranged for
the holding of presidential campaign forums on Feb. 21, March 6 and
March 13, respectively, to allow presidential candidates -- President
Chen Shui-bian and KMT Chairman Lien Chan -- to voice their policy
initiatives. Similar forums for vice presidential candidates, namely
Annette Lu and PFP Chairman James Soong, was scheduled to take place
Feb. 28, according to the CEC.</P>
      <P>Each of the forums is set to be 70 minutes long and to be
telecast live nationwide, an official from the commission said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BOMB THREAT SUSPECT TRACKED DOWN IN LESS THAN 20 HOURS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Police have tracked down the individual
suspected of threatening on Tuesday to bomb nine organizations,
police sources said.</P>
      <P>The police nabbed the suspect at his residence in Nankang at
around 3 a.m. Wednesday, 18 hours after he allegedly made the first
threatening call, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Chu Tsung-yun, 46, was arrested on charges of intimidating the
public. The police found in his room several paper notes carrying the
telephone numbers of the organizations that he threatened with bombs
or planned to call, Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) officials
said.</P>
      <P>Chu first called the People First Party legislative caucus at
9:20 a.m. Tuesday, telling the opposition lawmakers that "someone is
going to plant a bomb at the Legislative Yuan building."</P>
      <P>Between 9: 20 a.m. and 11: 50 a.m., Chu made nine calls to
prominent organizations in Taipei, including the Taipei City Hall,
the United Daily News, the IBM Building, the Taipei 101 skyscraper,
and SOGO Department Store, claiming that either "someone is going to
plant a bomb" or "a suicide car will ram into your building at around
noon, " the CIB officials said.</P>
      <P>Discovering no bomb-making devices or materials at his home, CIB
investigators suspect that Chu, who has a master's degree from a
Baptist seminary, probably has mental problems as they found bags of
medication on his table.</P>
      <P>Chang Si-liang, director-general of the National Police
Administration, praised the CIB investigators' excellent performance
in tracking down the suspect in such a short time.</P>
      <P>Chang said the suspect had taken all members of society hostage
by making the bomb threats. Chu's deeds were not only disruptive to
social order, but also "immoral," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>From March 1, people from Taiwan proper or
the outlying island of Penghu will be able to travel on passports
instead of entry and departure permits when traveling between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait via the outlying outposts of Kinmen and
Matsu, the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Those eligible to travel on the routes will include Taiwan
businessmen who have legally registered with the government to do
business on the mainland, along with their employees and dependents,
veterans born in mainland China's Fujian Province and their
dependents, those who are engaged in direct cross-strait
transportation links and leaders of trade and economic activities, as
well as others who are allowed to use the route on a case-by-case
basis.</P>
      <P>But the MAC officials said that those who have registered their
domicile as Kinmen or Matsu for over six months will still have to
present entry and departure permits for travel to and from the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Those who have no permission from the Ministry of the Interior
will be barred from traveling to the mainland via Kinmen and Matsu,
MAC officials added.</P>
      <P>The officials stressed that since the "mini-three links" --
direct trade, transport and postal links -- were established between
Kinmen and Matsu and Fujian Province in January 2001, the government
has made four overviews and has revised related regulations four
times.</P>
      <P>"The MAC will continue to make necessary reviews and adjustments
in view of the implementation of the mini links and the development
of cross-strait interaction," they said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP WILL NOT MERGE WITH KMT BEFORE YEAR-END LEGISLATIVE ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>James Soong, chairman of the opposition
People First Party, said Thursday that his party "will only
cooperate, but will not merge with" its ally the Kuomintang (KMT)
before the year-end legislative election.</P>
      <P>Soong made the remarks while on the campaign trail around several
townships in Taichung, central Taiwan, in response to remarks by KMT
Chairman Lien Chan the previous day.</P>
      <P>Lien, who formed a ticket with Soong to challenge President Chen
Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu in the March 20 presidential
election, said Wednesday that if elected president, he will quit the
party chairmanship in order to allow the nurturing and grooming of
new leaders.</P>
      <P>Lien also expressed hope that the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT
and its two splinter parties, the PFP and the New Party, can move
toward a merger, saying that this would have positive significance
for the nation and its politics.</P>
      <P>Soong said that the first task will be to form a coalition
government if he and Lien are elected in the March 20 election.</P>
      <P>"If elected, the top priority will be to form a strong coalition
government, resume social order, stimulate the economy and resume
cross-strait dialogue so that the people regain their confidence in
the government and the international community resumes confidence in
Taiwan," he said.</P>
      <P>"The KMT and the PFP will only talk about cooperation before the
year-end legislative election, and will not talk about a merger, "
Soong went on, adding that "whether or not the two will merge will be
up to the party members."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, high-ranking KMT officials shared Soong's remarks
Thursday that the KMT and the PFP will only talk about cooperation
before the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President and KMT Vice Chairman Wang Jin-pyng
said that the two parties know the importance of unity and are now
focusing on stumping for Lien and Soong, adding that the question of
merging the two parties should be left until after the presidential
election.</P>
      <P>On Lien's remarks about passing the baton to the next leader if
elected and the "pan blue alliance" merges, Tseng Yung-chuan, a top
campaign aide for the Lien-Soong ticket, also said that "there has
been no talk on the issue within the KMT."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
Taiwan should hold fast to its statehood and that no foreign country
or individual can unilaterally decide the future of Taiwan after the
March 20 referendum.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on cultural affairs organized by the
Association of Community Radio Stations in Paochung, in central
Taiwan's Yunlin County, Chen said that holding the referendum will
allow the international community to know the Taiwan people's
collective will.</P>
      <P>The achievements made by Taiwan in the field of democratic
reforms, ranging from the lifting of martial law, lifting the ban on
organizing political parties and restrictions on media operations, to
the election of the president by popular vote, were not obtained by
chance but by a long and hard fight by the people, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The referendum is the last step in completing Taiwan's
democratization, the president claimed.</P>
      <P>He encouraged the public to "vote for Taiwan" in the upcoming
national referendum, which will be Taiwan's first, and to jointly
write a new chapter of Taiwan's history.</P>
      <P>The two questions that will be put to the referendum vote
initiated by Chen are as follows:</P>
      <P>-- "The people of Taiwan demand that the Taiwan Strait issue be
resolved through peaceful means. Should mainland China refuse to
withdraw the missiles it has targeted at Taiwan and openly renounce
the use of force against us, would you agree that the government
should acquire more advanced anti-missile weapons to strengthen
Taiwan's self-defense capabilities?"</P>
      <P>-- "Would you agree that our government should engage in
negotiation with mainland China on the establishment of a peace and
stability framework for cross-strait interaction in order to build
consensus and for the welfare of the peoples of both sides?"</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWANESE-BRAZILIAN BOY TO RETURN TO BRAZIL FRIDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Feb.  5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The curtain will finally fall on a
three-year-old international custody battle over a
Taiwanese-Brazilian boy Friday with his return to his legal guardian
in Brazil, judicial sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung District Court said Brazil's representative to
Taiwan, Paulo A.P. Pinto, has traveled from Taipei to Kaohsiung in
preparation for taking Iruan Wu Ergui back to Brazil.</P>
      <P>Pinto is scheduled to visit the home of Iruan's Taiwanese uncle
in Kaohsiung County's Chieting township in southern Taiwan at 10 a.m.
Friday in the company of a district court judge and local police
officers.</P>
      <P>The district court said earlier this week that it will use force
to implement the court ruling on the child's guardianship Feb. 6 if
his Taiwanese uncle, Wu Hou-yen, fails to hand over the boy
voluntarily by midnight on Feb. 5.</P>
      <P>Wu said Thursday that he and the boy will stay at home Friday to
wait for the court to implement its custody ruling.</P>
      <P>If all goes smoothly, Iruan will leave Kaohsiung for Hong Kong
Friday evening escorted by Pinto, who has been commissioned by the
boy's grandmother -- his legal guardian -- to bring Iruan home. They
will then take a flight from Hong Kong to Brazil via the South
African city of Johannesburg.</P>
      <P>Iruan, who is better known as Wu Yi-hua in Taiwan, was born out
of wedlock in Brazil in July 1995 to a Brazilian mother and a
Taiwanese father. His mother died six years ago and his grandmother
was appointed his legal guardian. He was brought to Taiwan in March
2001 by his father, who died a couple of weeks later. The boy's uncle
refused to allow the child to leave for home and the boy has since
been living in Kaohsiung and is now a second-grader at a local
elementary school.</P>
      <P>His grandmother eventually resorted to legal action to regain
custody of her grandson when it became clear that Wu would not let
her take the child back to Brazil in 2001.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Supreme Court meted out a final verdict last November
that the boy's guardianship belongs to his Brazilian grandmother,
Rosa Ergui.</P>
      <P>Iruan's classmates held a farewell party for the 9-year-old boy
Thursday. His teacher and all of his classmates gave him gifts. Many
of them, including Iruan himself, broke down in tears when they sang
"Auld Lang Syne, " the famous song of fellowship by Scottish poet
Robert Burns.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, President Chen Shui-bian wrote a message to Iruan
Thursday in his weekly Internet newsletter exhorting him to obey the
law and return home to his legal guardian in Brazil.</P>
      <P>"Everyone must obey the law and even I, the head of state of the
Republic of China, must obey the court's ruling, " Chen said in his
message.</P>
      <P>A letter, reputedly written by Iruan, was sent to Chen before the
Chinese New Year asking for Chen's help to allow him to stay in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A private support group has been formed in Kaohsiung County to
help Iruan and a spokesman said Thursday that the group will
cooperate with the Brazilian office of the Buddhist Compassionate
Relief Tzu Chi Foundation and the Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce in
Brazil in helping Iruan after the boy returns there.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 5 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The production value of Taiwan's information
technology (IT) hardware will post a record high of US$68.4 billion
for 2004, a spokesman for the semi-official Institute for Information
Industry (III) predicted Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-tang, a manager at the III's Market Intelligence Center,
made the forecast on the local industry's trends at a news
conference.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Taiwan's IT hardware sector is expected to continue
bottoming out of a low since 2002 and to set an all-time high in its
output value this year, Chen said the upward trends are a result of
an improved economy around the world.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the domestic IT hardware sector recorded a new
high of US$57.1 billion in its output value for the whole of last
year, with various industries in the sector, including the desktop
computer, notebook, motherboard, server, LCD and digital camera
manufacturers, also setting highs in both production value and output
volume.</P>
      <P>Apart from the IT hardware sector, Taiwan's cellular phone and
telecommunications industries also notched up encouraging results, he
reported.</P>
      <P>The mobile phone industry registered new highs in the fourth
quarter of last year in both production value and output amount, with
double-digit increases, he said. However, he added that the pace of
the growth rate is likely to slow this year on the grounds that
demand from mainland China might fall and that the number of foreign
orders might drop.</P>
      <P>He forecast that Taiwan will produce about 55 million cellular
phones in 2004, representing a growth rate of about 30 percent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two scholars called Thursday for the
establishment of a permanent organization to set up presidential
election debates and other election debates.</P>
      <P>In a seminar organized by the Central News Agency and presided
over by Liu Chih-tsung, CNA editor in chief, to discuss a Feb. 8
debate between Chen Shui-bian and Lien Chan, the two presidential
candidates, Hu You-wei, director of the Graduate Institute of Mass
Communication of National Taiwan Normal University, claimed that
election debates, especially presidential election debates, are more
a source of valuable political and social education for the general
public than a chance for individual candidates to woo voters.</P>
      <P>However, impartial organization of such debates is a difficult
job and only those who have the trust of all candidates can bring
different candidates together in such an event, he said. Since this
job becomes necessary every four years with the presidential
election, that is why the United States set up a Commission on
Presidential Debates in 1987 that has produced every presidential and
vice presidential election debate since 1988.</P>
      <P>With funding from private donations, the commission considers
itself a social education institute that organizes seminars on
elections and publishes the results of its studies regularly.</P>
      <P>Public debate is vital for voters, since the people who put
questions to the candidates in the debates are not chosen from
campaign teams, so that the public might get some "real" information
rather than propaganda, and will get to know the candidates from
their political points of view, Hu said.</P>
      <P>The voters can also compare the different candidates' ideas, he
went on.</P>
      <P>Any organization set up for this task should be non-partisan,
impartial and non-profit, according to Hu.</P>
      <P>Ku Chung-hua, former president of the Taipei Society and a
professor at National Chengchi University, said it is a duty rather
than a right for candidates to air their points of view in public
debate.</P>
      <P>At present, presidential debates are produced by an ad hoc
umbrella organization consisting of the Taipei Society, the Public
Television Service, four national newspapers. This
situation might not change in the foreseeable future, although a
different organization for presidential debate would be helpful in
perfecting the rules for such debates, according to Ku.</P>
      <P>Tsao Wan-ling, a researcher at the Public Television Service,
said the current organizer of presidential debates staged a
successful debate between the candidates for Taipei city mayor in
2002 and has accumulated valuable experience.</P>
      <P>With the presidential election only about a month away, Tsao
said, it is too late to talk about the establishment of a permanent
organization for the 2004 election debate but the idea may be worth
studying after the March 20 presidential election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, JAPAN COOPERATE IN BUSTING CROSS-BORDER DRUG TRAFFICKING RING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau
(MJIB) said Thursday it has cooperated with Japanese law enforcement
officers in busting a cross-border drug trafficking ring attempting
to smuggle 113 kilograms of amphetamines from mainland China to
Japan.</P>
      <P>With information provided by MJIB agents, Japanese law
enforcement officers managed to arrest two masterminds of the
trafficking ring in Yokohama Tuesday and seized the large quantity of
amphetamines hidden in a container, MJIB officials said, adding that
the seizure was worth an estimated NT$1.9 billion at street value.</P>
      <P>The two arrested suspects were identified as Liu Fang-cheng, a
49-year old man from Taiwan's Chiayi County, and Takeshi Sakai, a
naturalized Japanese man of Taiwan origin.</P>
      <P>MJIB officials said the ring had traffickers in mainland China,
Hong Kong and Taiwan with the aim of smuggling mainland China- and
Hong Kong-produced amphetamines to Japan in the guise of legitimate
chemical products.</P>
      <P>The MJIB informed Japanese law enforcement authorities of all
relevant information in early January, the officials said, and a
joint investigative team formed by the MJIB, Japanese police
authorities, as well as Tokyo and Yokohama customs officers, kept
close tabs on the ring's activities.</P>
      <P>Japanese law enforcement officers then discovered a suspicious
container delivered from the southern mainland Chinese port city of
Shenzhen to Yokohama Jan. 27. They arrested Liu and Sakai when the
duo were claiming the container Feb. 3 and later uncovered the
contraband drugs hidden in the container.</P>
      <P>Over the past month, some 20 MJIB agents have been mobilized to
investigate the case, the officials said, adding that Japan mobilized
more than 80 investigators.</P>
      <P>"The two sides have held many rounds of videoconferences to
discuss various technical details and Japan sent liaison officers to
Taiwan to work out various investigative plans, " an MJIB official
said, adding that the case set a good model for international
cooperation in drug busting.</P>
      <P>Japanese law enforcement authorities announced the raid on the
drug trafficking ring simultaneously with the MJIB. It was the
largest drug seizure in Japan in two years.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.   5  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A scholar said Thursday that the
presidential candidates should get used to open debate so that their
views on public policies can be subject to the scrutiny of the
voters.</P>
      <P>Ku Chung-hua, a professor from National Chengchi University, made
the remarks at a forum on how to establish a permanent organization
to handle presidential debate. The forum was presided over by Liu
Chih-tsung, editor-in-chief of the Central New Agency.</P>
      <P>Ku is a former president of the Taipei Society, a group comprised
of liberal scholars, which will be one of the sponsors of a proposed
televised debate between President Chen Shui-bian and his rival,
opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, who are competing in the
March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Ku lamented that Taiwan has not formed the habit of debating
public policy, citing the current difficulty in setting up a date for
the televised debate between the two rival camps as an example.</P>
      <P>He noted that Western education attaches great importance to
dialogue and open communication, while the East tends to stress that
a ruler need not talk too much, so that much of his policy is
shrouded in secrecy.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's political figures need to be re-educated, " Ku said,
adding that "taking part in debates is an obligation. If you want
support from the voters, you should allow yourself to be subjected to
public scrutiny."</P>
      <P>Other scholars and pundits participating in the CNA forum
included Hu Yu-wei, director of the Graduate Institute of Mass
Communication of National Taiwan Normal University, Deputy
Secretary-General Chen Cheng-hsiu of the Association of Terrestrial
Television Networks, Tsao Wan-lin, a researcher at the Public
Television Service Foundation, and Lu Tung-hsi, an executive member
of the Association of Taiwan Journalists.</P>
      <P>The proposed televised presidential election debate will be
jointly sponsored by the Taipei Society, the Public Television
Service Foundation, and four other major newspapers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ku said that an alliance comprised of 11 local TV media

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 5 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The consumer price index (CPI) for January
stood at 100.5 points, an increase of 0.79 percentage points over the
December level, the Cabinet-level Directorate-General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>The growth was the first since June last year, DGBAS officials
said, adding that the January CPI also represents a slight increase
of 0.01 percentage points over the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>Although the officials attributed the rise to higher product and
service prices during the Chinese New Year holiday season late last
month, they claimed that deflation is out of the question amid
noticeable signs of an improved domestic economy fueled by an
economic upturn in the international market.</P>
      <P>Dismissing public concerns as to whether an outbreak of avian flu
in many Asian countries will cast a shadow over Taiwan's rebounding
economy, the officials said that an effective containment of the
disease will in fact boost the economy.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Taiwan's wholesale price index for January was
104.63 points, up by 1.05 percentage points over the December ratio
and up by 2.39 percentage points over the level posted in the same of

    <HEADLINE>ROC DELEGATION TO U.S. NATIONAL PRAYER BREAKFAST KEEPS LOW PROFILE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  5  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-chi and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China delegation
attending the 2004 U.S. National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C.
has kept a low profile amid the current low ebb in bilateral
relations over Taiwan's planned referendum.</P>
      <P>The mission, headed by Peng Ming-min, a senior advisor to
President Chen Shui-bian, arrived in the U.S. capital Tuesday. Its
members include Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Michael Ying-mao
Kau, Legislator Chen Tang-san, Professor Joanne J.L. Chiu and Chia
Hsin Cement Co. Chairman Nelson A.P. Chang.</P>
      <P>The delegation first paid a visit to the Republican National
Committee Wednesday and then held a lunch meeting with members of the
Taiwan Caucus -- a pro-Taiwan subgroup in the U.S. House of
Representatives.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, the group met with scholars at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a noted think tank. After
the meeting, Peng and Kau told Taiwan reporters stationed in
Washington that they had exchanged views with CSIS research fellows
on the referendum plan and other issues of mutual concern. However,
they declined to elaborate on the content of their talks and Peng
said only that the two sides exchanged views candidly.</P>
      <P>Chiu said that the people of Taiwan have been denied a voice in
the international community since the ROC left the United Nations in
1971.</P>
      <P>"The planned referendum to coincide with the March 20
presidential election will offer the Taiwan people an opportunity to
express their opinions on relations with mainland China in the world
arena, " Chiu said. "Therefore, we believe that the nation's
first-ever referendum bears historic significance."</P>
      <P>The delegation was scheduled to hold a similar closed-door
meeting with researchers from another U.S. think tank, the Brookings
Institute, after attending the prayer breakfast Thursday. The group
will also visit the Democratic National Committee and meet with two
influential U.S. congressional members and various Chinese community
representatives before wrapping up its U.S. visit.</P>
      <P>The National Prayer Breakfast is an annual religious gathering
attended by thousands of dignitaries, including the U.S. president,
senior U.S. officials and congressional members, as well as diplomats
and religious leaders from various countries. The purpose of the
gathering is to promote world peace and conciliation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun will give his
administrative reports to the Legislative Yuan when it opens for a
new session Friday.</P>
      <P>The premier will point out that to achieve the "green silicon
island" goal as envisioned by President Chen Shui-bian, the
government will make the bettering of the economy and continued
political and financial reforms as the main focus this year,
according to an advanced copy of his reports sent to the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>The government will also nurture talented people, promote
research, development and innovation, global logistics programs and
quality of life through the implementation of its five-year, NT$500
billion (US$15.06 billion) 10 new major construction projects plan,
the report said.</P>
      <P>As cross-strait relations are special factors that will affect
Taiwan's development, the government will promote a positive
development in cross-strait relations, and will take into
consideration national dignity, security and reciprocal exchanges to
promote cross-strait reconciliation, active cooperation and a lasting
peace, it said.</P>
      <P>Regarding national defense, the report said the government will
continue to upgrade the military's combat readiness and promote the
recruitment of volunteers.</P>
      <P>On the diplomatic front, the government will strengthen
substantive relations with the United States and Japan, promote
active participation of international organizations, raise the
national profile in the world, join hands with private organizations
to promote international cooperation and continue to provide
humanitarian assistance to the social and economic development of
diplomatic allies, the report said.</P>
      <P>On economic development, Taiwan's economy was beginning to
rebound in early 2003, but because of the U.S.-led war against Iraq
and the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in the first
part of the year, which resulted in a negative impact to the economy,
Taiwan's economy recorded a negative growth in the second quarter.</P>
      <P>But the report said that starting from the next half of 2003,
Taiwan's exports improved in line with a global economic rebound. The
nation's economy has flashed a healthy green light ever since July
2003, the report said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's production of DVD (digital video
discs) recorders is expected to hold a second-highest 32 percent
market share globally in 2004, according to forecasts made by the
Topology Research Institute.</P>
      <P>The ratio represents an output level of 15.2 million units out of
an estimated global production of 47.5 million, the institute
predicted, pointing out that Taiwan will only trail Japan. It also
predicted that the world's total output volume may top 110 million
units in 2007.</P>
      <P>Taiwan made about 4.05 million DVD recorders in 2003, accounting
for some 16.2 percent in the international market with a scale of 25
million units, the institute reported.</P>
      <P>Business opportunities provided by the hi-tech device, now
already a common household appliance, are tremendous, as
manufacturers are actively seeking to produce new generations of the
item, a senior researcher at the institute said.</P>
      <P>Falling prices for DVD recorders are expected to push many

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun expressed three wishes
Thursday on Lantern Festival, including the smooth proceeding of
Taiwan's first-ever referendum to coincide with the March 20
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Yu expressed his wishes during a lunch meeting with a group of
reporters covering Cabinet-related news events.</P>
      <P>As Thursday happened to be Lantern Festival, Yu took advantage of
the occasion to extend his best wishes to all local people.</P>
      <P>"Local people traditionally eat round, sweet rice dumplings known
as 'yuan siao' in Chinese on Lantern Festival to symbolize family
reunion and good fortune. I wish all fellow countrymen a happy
Lantern Festival and a prosperous life throughout the year," Yu said.</P>
      <P>He further said a pair of wild magpies have made a home in a
four-storey tree at the courtyard of his official residence since last
November.</P>
      <P>"I took it as a harbinger of good things to come. For instance,
our economy has bottomed out of its year-long recession and is now on
a steady upward swing," Yu said.</P>
      <P>The premier is scheduled to deliver an administrative report at
the Legislative Yuan Friday, which also marks the opening of the
legislature's new session.</P>
      <P>Yu said he hopes his report at the opposition-control legislature
will proceed smoothly.</P>
      <P>He also outlined his "yuan siao three wishes," -- the legislature
passes several important bills, including the statute on the
management of a financial reconstruction fund, the three "sunshine
bills" for the establishment of clean politics and the Executive Yuan
restructuring bill, during its new session; the legislature passes
the budget bill for the 10 New Major Construction Projects; and the
island's historic referendum on mainland China's missile threat turns
out to be a success.</P>
      <P>In order to prevent Beijing from attacking Taiwan, President
Chen Shui-bian has decided to call a referendum to ask local
voters the following two questions:</P>
      <P>-- "The people of Taiwan demand that the Taiwan Strait issue be
resolved through peaceful means. Should mainland China refuse to
withdraw the missiles it has targeted at Taiwan and openly renounce
the use of force against us, would you agree that the government
should acquire more advanced anti-missile weapons to strengthen
Taiwan's self-defense capabilities?"</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN OVERSEAS CHICKEN SALES TAKE FLIGHT AFTER OUTBREAKS OF AVIAN FLU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 5 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's poultry products have been selling
well in Asian markets in recent weeks due to the outbreaks of avian
flu in major Asian chicken exporting countries, a Council of
Agriculture (COA) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>At a time when poultry farms in most of the countries in
Southeast and East Asia have fallen to the scourge of bird flu,
caused by the H5N1 virus, Taiwan's chicken products exports have
picked up after several years of sluggishness.</P>
      <P>Thailand and mainland China have been two major exporters of
chicken meat on the world market. Both of these countries have
reported cases of avian flu. Taiwan has been exporting relatively
much less chicken meat over the past years, not because of inferior
quality, but because the price has been about three times higher than
that for the same products from Thailand and mainland China, COA
officials said.</P>
      <P>According to the Republic of China Chicken Farm Association,
Indonesia recently placed an order for 430 metric tons of Taiwan
chicken meat. The shipment is expected to be made next week after the
food safety and quarantine process is completed, association chairman
Wu Chuan-ching said.</P>
      <P>The association has also recently received orders from Japan and
Hong Kong for six containers of chicken meat, according to Wu.</P>
      <P>Exports to these two places, however, are not expected to be made
in the near future as authorities in Japan and Hong Kong have imposed
a ban on poultry products from Taiwan since early January in the
light of reports that several Taiwan chicken farms destroyed more
than 60,000 birds on suspicion of an outbreak of a less virulent bird
flu virus called H5N2, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Thursday that Taiwan chicken
meat is safe and tasty and that the public can eat as much of it as
they want without worry.</P>
      <P>Yu, nevertheless, reminded people to stay alert against smuggling
of unknown poultry products into Taiwan and to safeguard against wild
birds that might be a source of H5N1 or H5N2.</P>
      <P>In related news, Vice COA Chairman Lee Jen-chyuan said that a
price stabilization mechanism on chicken meat began Thursday to help
the domestic chicken market at a time when Taiwan, as well as most of
Asia, are under threat of bird flu.</P>
      <P>Under the price stabilization program, the COA will spend NT$20
million to promote Taiwan chicken meat in both domestic and overseas
markets, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The COA will also purchase chicken meat whenever the wholesale
price declines to 95 percent of production costs or lower, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He added that currently, the government has a farm product price
stabilization fund totaling NT$76.5 billion. It is estimated that it
would need at most NT$5 billion if the COA were to be forced to
purchase all chicken meat to stabilize domestic chicken prices, Lee
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Four Taiwan citizens were arrested Thursday
for providing people to take tests for international IT
certifications and professional licenses in place of other persons
who paid, the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) reported.</P>
      <P>Tung Pei-chang, Hsu Ching-ping, Hsiung Chih-yuan and a man
surnamed Chang were arrested in Taipei, Taoyuan, Taichung,
respectively, on charges of fraud and violating the Copyright Law,
CIB officials said.</P>
      <P>The group was discovered to have been soliciting customers via
the Internet, including the sites Test4U.net, TaipeiITtest.net and
OPASScertification.net. They were offering advance test questions and
people could who sit for international IT certification and
professional license tests -- tests of Prometric or Pearson VUE -- in
place of customers who would pay NT$10,000 for each subject, CIB
officials said.</P>
      <P>In their online advertisement, the group members boasted that
their advance test questions were obtained first-hand from Prometric
or Pearson VUE tests held in Hong Kong, Singapore, Beijing, the
United States and Canada.</P>
      <P>The group also has paid test-takers who will be coming from
Canada, Macau, mainland China and Taiwan, according to CIB
investigators.</P>
      <P>After preliminary investigations, the CIB officials discovered
that more than 300 people in Taiwan have obtained IT certifications,
including that from Microsoft and other professional licensing and
certifications, through the help of the group.</P>
      <P>Group members, including Hsu, an engineer with an electronics
company in the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park, have netted at

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Thursday called
for the people of Taiwan to build an effective anti-virus network
following the nation's successful containment of severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) last year.</P>
      <P>Chen made the appeal in an article, entitled "Building an
Anti-Virus Network," posted in his Internet Newsletter on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Taiwan has not been placed by the World Health
Organization (WHO) or the World Animal Health Organization on their
lists of bird flu affected areas, the president said that he believes
Taiwan can do even better in preventing disease this year following
an outstanding performance in fighting against SARS last year.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that outbreaks of avian flu have affected ten
Asian countries, including mainland China, South Korea, Vietnam,
Japan and Thailand, the president said, Taiwan has only witnessed a
few cases of low pathogenic H5N1 bird flu virus infection among fowl.</P>
      <P>He urged the people of Taiwan not to overreact to the bird flu
outbreaks, saying that if they take proper health and sanitation
precautions as well as avoid contact with fowl, this will help limit
the bird flu threat.</P>
      <P>The president pointed out that at a meeting held in Thailand last
week, representatives from Asian countries, including Taiwan, and
international organizations, including the WHO and the U.N. Food and
Agricultural Organization, agreed that both the SARS and bird flu
threats are without boundaries and that countries in the same region
should cooperate in dealing with the issue.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the Executive Yuan has already instructed the
relevant government agencies to be well-prepared to fight against
bird flu.</P>
      <P>He also said that the government has decided to adopt strict

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN SENDS EMAIL RESPONSE TO TAIWANESE-BRAZILIAN BOY IRUAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 5 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, in his response
letter to Taiwanese-Brazilian boy Iruan Wu Ergui on Thursday,
exhorted Iruan to be courageous in facing the facts, saying that even
he himself as president, "must obey the law."</P>
      <P>In the president's letter to Iruan posted in Chen's Internet
Newsletter, Chen said that his heart goes out to Iruan, better known
as Yi-hua in Taiwan, considering that at such a young age, the boy
must face such a trying fate and a tremendously difficult choice.</P>
      <P>President Chen said that he shares the feelings of most of the
Taiwan people that Yi-hua should be allowed to stay in Taiwan to live
happily with his Taiwanese uncle and his family, but added that the
boy must return to Brazil as both the Brazilian and Taiwanese courts
have ruled.</P>
      <P>"Even I, as a president, must respect the court ruling, " Chen
said to Yi-hua.</P>
      <P>Chen told Yi-hua in the letter that he is not alone because all
the people of Taiwan support him and consider him "a son of Taiwan."
Chen exhorted Yi-hua to be a good student and love and respect all
his Brazilian family members after he returns to Brazil. "You are
always welcome to return to Taiwan," Chen added.</P>
      <P>The eight-year-old Iruan Wu Ergui, who has been at the center of
an international custody battle, had been scheduled to be returned to
his Brazilian grandmother, his legal guardian, before Jan. 16 as
ordered by the Kaohsiung District Court.</P>
      <P>After Yi-hua's uncle, Wu Hou-yen, failed to return the boy by the
deadline, the Kaohsiung District Court declared on Wednesday that it
will use force to take Iruan Wu Ergui away from Wu's residence Friday
and send him home to his legal guardian in Brazil if the uncle fails
to hand over the boy voluntarily by Thursday.</P>
      <P>It has been learned that Yi-hua's Brazilian grandmother, Rosa
Ergui, has authorized Paulo A.P. Pinto, Brazil's de facto ambassador
to Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties between the two
countries, to take the boy home to Brazil on her behalf.</P>
      <P>According to sources from the Kaohsiung District Court, Pinto is
scheduled to arrive at the court first thing Friday morning and then
accompany the Kaohsiung judges and police, who will "implement the
court order forcibly" to take Yi-hua away.</P>
      <P>It was learned that Pinto will accompany Iruan on a "homecoming"
flight scheduled to depart Friday afternoon and Grandmother Rosa will
be waiting at the airport of Porto Alegre, Brazil, Saturday.</P>
      <P>In response to the Kaohsiung District Court remarks Wednesday,
Yi-hua's uncle said that he will wait for the court to implement its
ruling on the child's guardianship.</P>
      <P>Yi-hua, who is now a second grader at a primary school in
Kaohsiung County, was born in Brazil to a Brazilian mother and a
Taiwanese sailor father. His mother died six years ago, and Yi-hua
was brought to Taiwan in March 2002 by his father, who died a couple
of weeks later. Since then, the boy has been living with his uncle in
Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>His grandmother, who is the child's legal guardian, decided to
take legal action to regain custody after Wu refused to let her take
the boy home to Brazil in 2001. She finally won her case when
Taiwan's Supreme Court rejected an appeal by the Wu family last
November.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung District Court in southern Taiwan served notice to
the Wu family last Dec. 25, demanding that Wu return Iruan to Rosa
Ergui within 20 days. Wu then went into hiding with his entire family
and Iruan.</P>
      <P>The family reemerged Jan. 15 in Chiehting Township, Kaohsiung
County, where they staged a press conference in the company of a
lawyer, a legislator and more than 30 supporters.</P>
      <P>At the press conference, members of the Wu family fell to their
knees, appealing to the Kaohsiung judges to postpone the
implementation of the court order.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the support group said Wednesday that the group
will cooperate with the Brazilian office of the Buddhist Compassion
Relief Tzu Chi Foundation and the Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce in
Brazil in helping Iruan after the boy returns to the South American
country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>UNCLE FAILS TO TURN OVER TAIWANESE-BRAZILIAN BOY IRUAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwanese-Brazilian boy who has been
at the center of an international custody battle and who was set to
be taken back to Brazil to his legal guardian, was not turned over to
authorities by his Taiwanese uncle Friday morning as scheduled,
taking all parties concerned by surprise.</P>
      <P>Iruan Wu Ergui's uncle, Wu Hou-yen, faced Kaohsiung District
Court Judge Liao Cheng-hsiung, Brazil's representative to Taiwan
Paulo A.P. Pinto, and local police officers alone when they arrived
at his residence in Chieting township, Kaoshiung County, at 10: 15
a.m. to pick up the boy as scheduled with the consent of Wu in
advance. Pinto has been authorized by Iruan's Brazilian grandmother
to bring the boy back to Brazil.</P>
      <P>Wu insisted that Iruan's Brazilian grandmother Rosa Leocadia
Silva Ergui should come to Taiwan to take Iruan -- born out of
wedlock in Brazil to a Brazilian mother and a Taiwanese father. He
said he will only hand Iruan over when the boy's grandmother comes to
get him.</P>
      <P>Wu had said Thursday that he and the boy would stay at home
Friday to wait for the court to implement its custody ruling.</P>
      <P>The scheduled handover of the boy Friday was expected to be the
last episode in the international custody battle that has dragged on
for three years.</P>
      <P>Iruan's mother died six years ago and his grandmother was
appointed as his legal guardian. He was brought to Taiwan in March
2001 by his father, who died a couple of weeks later. The boy's uncle
refused to allow Iruan to be returned to Brazil, and the boy has
since been living in Kaohsiung and attending a local elementary
school.</P>
      <P>His grandmother eventually resorted to legal action to regain
custody of her grandson when it became clear that Wu would not let
her take the child back to Brazil in 2001.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Supreme Court made a final ruling last November, saying
the boy's Brazilian grandmother is his legal guardian.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Calling himself a president serving all the
people, President Chen Shui-bian said Friday he won't be held hostage
by any businessman.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the local SET TV, the president was asked
about news reports that one of his ardent supporters, Chang Yung-fa,
the founder of the Evergreen transportation group, has switched his
support to Chen's rival in the presidential race because of his
displeasure with the president's mainland China policy.</P>
      <P>Without mentioning his name, the president said he appreciated a
certain tycoon's support in the past, but donors' financial support
would not influence his administration's policy, which is formulated
to serve the national interest, the interest of all the people.</P>
      <P>He suggested that this businessman wants an immediate opening of
direct transportation links with mainland China, "but this is against
the interests of the country and might damage the security of the
country; therefore, I have to say 'no, sorry. I can't help but say
no, even if that means I lose your support.'"</P>
      <P>"If I listen to your 'orders' because you are my good friend, I
will become a puppet. Then the country won't need a president; just
let a few businessmen rule the country," said Chen.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A center to fight the spread of avian flu
was jointly set up Friday by the authorities of Kaohsiung City,
Kaohsiung County and Pingtung County in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City Mayor Frank Hsieh, Kaohsiung County Magistrate
Yang Chiu-hsing and Pingtung County Magistrate Su Chia-chuan will
serve as leaders of the joint center to fight against the disease.
Infections in birds by the less virulent H5N2 virus have been
reported in southern Chiayi and central Changhua counties.</P>
      <P>Based on a similar set of mechanisms established last year to
contain the outbreak of the potentially deadly severe acute
respiratory syndrome, officials of the three local governments in
charge of tourism, public health and agriculture will also
take part in the task force.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said they have full confidence that their collective
mission will be a success in view of last year's good cooperation and
results.</P>
      <P>In addition to stepping up inspection and monitoring of local
poultry farms, Hsieh said they will also ask the coast guard patrol
authorities to increase surveillance against smuggling along the
coasts in the region.</P>
      <P>He also urged the public not to panic because the virulent H5N1
bird flu virus has not been found in Taiwan and that it is safe to
eat chicken and eggs if they are well cooked.</P>
      <P>The H5N1 bird flu has been reported in about 10 countries in
Asia, including Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, South Korea, Cambodia,

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER URGES LEGISLATURE TO SPEED UP PASSAGE OF IMPORTANT BILLS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun urged the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan Friday to speed up screening
of important bills to facilitate national development on all fronts.</P>
      <P>Yu made the appeal while delivering an administrative report to
the legislature which opened its new session Friday.</P>
      <P>Noting that the legislature only passed 26 of the
126 Cabinet-drafted bills, or 20.6 percent of the total, in its
previous session ending in mid-January, Yu said he is worried
about the legislative delay's adverse impact on national reform
and development. Altogether, Yu said, a total of 318 Cabinet-drafted
bills are still pending legislative approval.</P>
      <P>Yu said he most hopes the legislature can pass the bill
concerning the Cabinet's 10 new major construction projects aimed
at upgrading Taiwan's overall national competitiveness as well as
"sunshine bills" designed to prevent shady money and
gangster links with politics and facilitate establishment of
clean politics during its current session.</P>
      <P>"I hope legislative caucuses of all political groups will
rationally discuss key points of various bills and refrain from
irrational boycott or stonewalling of the passage of major bills,"
Yu said.</P>
      <P>As this was Yu's last administrative report the legislature
before the May 20 presidential inauguration, Yu took advantage of the
occasion to tout the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration's achievements over the past four years.</P>
      <P>Yu said when the DPP took power in May 2000, it inherited a
public debt of more than NT$2.4 trillion. "Over the years, we have
overcome many tough challenges and completed many difficult
reforms. And now the spring has come. Our economy has regained
momentum," he added.</P>
      <P>The premier also took the opportunity to call on local voters to
support the nation's first-ever referendum to coincide with the March
20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>"I hope every voter will cast their ballots to demonstrate to the
world that we are masters of this beautiful island through the
upcoming referendum," Yu said, adding that the historic referendum
will help strengthen and consolidate Taiwan's young democracy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PAN-PURPLE ALLIANCE PUTS FORTH VIRTUAL PRESIDENTIAL TICKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Alliance of Fairness and Justice, also
known as the "pan-purple alliance" in contrast to Taiwan's two major
political forces -- the "pan-green camp" and the "pan-blue alliance"
-- presented its virtual presidential ticket Friday.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the alliance unveiled posters featuring images
of the group's virtual presidential and vice presidential candidates
known as Lin Hsiu-mei and Chang Chih-ching in front of the Central
Election Commission (CEC) to signify the group's determination to
offer voters an alternative platform in the hotly contested
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Friday marked the final day of candidacy registration for the
March 20 presidential election. The "pan-purple alliance" could only
present a virtual ticket because the time for independent hopefuls to
seek the required number of endorsements from citizens expired a
month ago.</P>
      <P>Chien Hsi-chieh, the alliance's convener, said the virtual
presidential ticket will campaign on a platform characterized by six
appeals -- tax reform, economic reform, gender equality, education
reform, peaceful cross-Taiwan Strait relations and equitable
distribution of welfare resources.</P>
      <P>"Our policy initiatives are all designed for the benefit of
ordinary citizens, not any specific political group," Chien stressed.</P>
      <P>Chien said the alliance, which groups 12 associations of the
underprivileged and labor rights activists, is extremely dissatisfied
with policies presented by the two major political camps, which he
said favor large business groups or vested interests rather than
working-class or salaried people.</P>
      <P>Starting next week, Chien said, the alliance will regularly
publicize comments or critiques on policy initiatives advocated by
the pan-green and pan-blue presidential candidates as well as on
their often negative campaign tactics.</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" has fielded a ticket of
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman James
Soong to challenge the re-election bid of the pan-green ticket of
President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu in the
upcoming election. Both teams registered their candidacy Wednesday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MACAU MISSION STUDIES INVESTMENT CLIMATE ON KINMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A seven-member mission from Macau paid a
visit Friday to Kinmen to look for investment and business
opportunities on the outlying island.</P>
      <P>The delegation, formed by representatives from Macau's shipping
and tourism businesses, was warmly greeted by Kinmen County
Magistrate Lee Chu-feng.</P>
      <P>Lee warmly welcomed Macau investment on Kinmen and expressed his
optimism about the island's business environment and future
development, citing a central government plan to enlarge the existing
"mini three links" -- direct trade and transportation services set up
in Jan. 2001 between Taiwan-held Kinmen and Matsu islands and the
Fujian ports of Xiamen and Mawei.</P>
      <P>Lee said he strongly recommended Macau businesses to invest in
building five-star tourist hotels on Kinmen because the central
government in Taipei is to relax its current rules on the "mini three
links" starting from March 1, making trips between the two sides
easier for a larger number of people.</P>
      <P>Business opportunities to be brought about by the "mini three
links" will be abundant, the Kinmen County magistrate claimed. "There
will be no retrogression in developing the 'mini three links' on the
island, " he said, pointing to a growing number of travelers as an
example.</P>
      <P>The "mini three links" was used by 21,377 people in 2001, with
the figure rising to 53,681 in 2002 and to 160,103 in 2003, he said.
During the 25-day period from Jan. 9 to Feb. 2 surrounding the recent
Chinese New Year holiday season, the links serviced a total of 22,582
passengers, he said.</P>
      <P>After visiting facilities related to the "mini three links, " the
visitors said that Kinmen's tourist and traffic sectors could be ripe
with business and investment possibilities should the "mini three
links" be effectively enhanced. They said that Kinmen could be
developed into a second Macau if gambling were legalized for the
frontline island.</P>
      <P>From the beginning of next month, the present "mini three links"
will be also available for residents on Taiwan proper and on the
island county of Penghu as well as for Taiwan businessmen operating
in mainland China outside Fujian province.</P>
      <P>For the time being, only Taiwan businessmen and their families
based in Fujian and residents on the islands of Kinmen and Matsu are
permitted to travel between the two sides via the links.</P>
      <P>In line with the eased rules, ferry services between Kinmen and
Xiamen have been increased from Feb. 3, with each side now operating
three round trips per day to better serve passengers.</P>
      <P>The improved ferry service now allows travelers between the two
sides to come and go in just one day, making it the most economical
and time-saving travel option for the many Taiwan businessmen who
have to travel often between Taiwan and the mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA TO ARRANGE FOR UNCLE TO ACCOMPANY BOY BACK TO BRAZIL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Friday that it will help arrange for the uncle of a
Taiwanese-Brazilian orphan at the center of an international custody
battle to accompany the boy on his journey home to his legal guardian
in Brazil.</P>
      <P>Javier Hou, director of the MOFA's Central and South American
Affairs Department, made the remarks after Wu Hou-yen defied a court
order to give Iruan Wu Ergui up earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Hou said the Taiwan Catholic Mission Foundation (TCMF) , a
non-government charity organization, has agreed to offer funds for Wu
to accompany Iruan on the flight to Brazil to live with his Brazilian
maternal grandmother -- the 8-year-old's legal guardian.</P>
      <P>According to Ho, TCMF Chief Executive Officer Ou Chin-jen has
arrived in Brazil to meet with the boy's Brazilian family, including
his grandmother, to seek their consent to Wu's visit.</P>
      <P>"Ou hopes to arrange face-to-face talks in Brazil between Iruan's
Taiwanese and Brazilian family members, " Ho said, adding that such
talks are expected to help reduce the uncle's defiance of a Taiwan
court order to return the boy to his legal guardian.</P>
      <P>Ho said a trip to Brazil will also enable Wu to see for himself
the boy's future living environment.</P>
      <P>Iruan's grandmother, Rosa Leocadia Da Silva Ergui, has
commissioned Brazil's representative in Taiwan, Paulo A.P.
Pinto, to take the boy back to Brazil on her behalf after Taiwan's
judicial authorities confirmed her guardianship of the boy last
November.</P>
      <P>Pinto was originally scheduled to escort the boy back to Brazil
via Hong Kong and Johannesburg Friday.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by a Kaohsiung District Court judge, Pinto arrived at
Wu's home in Kaohsiung County's Chiehting township in southern Taiwan
Friday morning to pick up the boy. Much to his disappointment, only
Wu greeted them, but the boy was not there.</P>
      <P>Wu claimed that he had not received the court's previous notice
demanding that he hand over the boy voluntarily by Feb. 5.</P>
      <P>The judge, Liao Cheng-hsiung, immediately issued Wu with a new
notice ordering him to turn over the boy by 10 a.m. Feb. 9.
If he fails to do so, he will be taken into custody, Liao said.</P>
      <P>In response, Wu said he wanted to accompany Iruan back to Brazil
in person to return the boy.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Legislator Lin Yi-shih said he supported
Wu's stance. "The child is not an object. You cannot package him and
send him away," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Iruan, who is better known as Wu Yi-hua in Taiwan, was born out of
wedlock in Brazil in July 1995 to aBrazilian mother and a Taiwanese
father. His mother died six years ago and his grandmother was
appointed his legal guardian. He was brought to Taiwan in March 2001
by his father, who died a couple of weeks later. The boy's uncle
refused to allow the child to leave for home, and the boy has since
been living in Kaohsiung and is now a second-grader at a local
elementary school.</P>
      <P>His grandmother eventually resorted to legal action to regain
custody of her grandson when it became clear that Wu would not let
her take the child back to Brazil in 2001.</P>
      <P>A support group has been formed in Kaohsiung County to help the
Wu family in the custody battle. A spokesman for the support group
said earlier this week that the group will cooperate with the
Brazilian office of the Buddhist Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi
Foundation and the Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce in Brazil to help
Iruan after the boy gets home.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COMPENSATION TO BE PAID OUT FOR AVIAN FLU VICTIMS: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will provide compensation of
NT$5 million (US$154,700) to the families of anyone who dies from
avian flu after eating cooked chicken, Premier Yu Shyi-kun said
Friday.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks at a general interpellation session
at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Legislator Chen
Chien-ming raised the proposal that the government should provide
compensation of NT$3 million to "help allay public jitters" about
consuming chicken and related products.</P>
      <P>Chen made the suggestion amid reports of more human deaths in
Asia from avian flu. The reports, combined with the emergence of the
H5N2 virus -- a less virulent form of the H5N1 strain -- in several
domestic poultry farms, have resulted in the culling of tens of
thousands of chickens and ducks.</P>
      <P>However, Yu said that the compensation figure will be NT$5
million.</P>
      <P>The premier also said that the government will make the best
possible preparations against a domestic outbreak of the disease.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, legislators from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and
People First Party (PFP) suggested several measures to help fight the
disease.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Yang Li-huang said that the government should take
action against smuggled vaccines, establish a system of poultry
marking to guarantee quality, and not allow health officials to
"intimidate" consumers and infringe on the interests of poultry
farmers.</P>
      <P>She said that she was informed by some chicken farmers that the
government subsidy for every culled animal is NT$100 per head, lower
than the market price of NT$150, which might lead to unscrupulous
people repacking condemned poultry for public sale.</P>
      <P>She therefore suggested raising the subsidy to nearly the market
value of the poultry.</P>
      <P>In addition, she suggested that the government "give full
compensation" to the chicken farmers who have temporarily closed
their farms and that the compensation should last for at least six
months to help them cut their losses.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Kao Ming-chien claimed that the public has no need
to worry, because the virus type found in local poultry is less
dangerous than the strain sweeping other countries in Asia. In
addition, the government has put in practice several measures to
contain the disease, he said.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Department of Health and and Council of
Agriculture also said that they have provided poultry farmers with
free flu shots since last October and have continued to monitor their
health to reduce the possibility of person-to-person avian flu
transmission.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STABLE CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGES AT VARIOUS LEVELS: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There are stable exchanges on various levels
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, although cross-strait
relations could experience ups and downs at times, the nation's top
mainland China policy planner said Friday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) ,
made the remarks after she was asked about the state of cross-strait
relations by Legislator Chen Chien-ming of the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) at a legislative interpellation session.</P>
      <P>Chen asked Tsai to define the current cross-strait relations as
one of four states -- positive, stable, stalled or tense.</P>
      <P>"Both sides of the Taiwan Strait have stable exchanges on various
levels, " Tsai said, adding however that there are "ups and downs"
when communicating on sensitive issues because of the international
situation.</P>
      <P>She also denied that the four new measures regarding the
interests of Taiwan businessmen operating in mainland China announced
last week by President Chen Shui-bian, who is seeking re-election,
had anything to do with his seeking to boost his re-election chances.</P>
      <P>The four measures cover the expansion of the current direct
shipping links joining the country's two frontline islands of Kinmen
and Matsu, with the Fujian Province ports of Xiamen and Fuzhou,
subject to Beijing's agreement.</P>
      <P>The president also promised to enlarge the planned one-way
charter cargo fights from Taiwan to the mainland to two-way charter
flights and to allow mainland Chinese carriers to provide the service
as well as domestic ones.</P>
      <P>He also promised to allow Taiwan businessmen to claim national
health insurance payment if they seek treatment in hospitals opened
by Taiwan businessmen or medical facilities designated by Taiwan's
Department of Health on the mainland.</P>
      <P>The last of the four measurers is to increase government
subsidies to Taiwan schools on the mainland to about NT$30,000
(US$900) per student.</P>
      <P>"They are part of the measures mulled when the MAC revised the
Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area
and Mainland Area late last year," Tsai said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH LAUNCHES BLOOD DONATION CAMPAIGN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH)
launched a campaign Friday enlisting central government officials to
donate blood to help relieve a serious blood shortage facing the
country.</P>
      <P>A vehicle equipped with facilities for blood donation will travel
around various government agencies, including the Central Bank of
China, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of National Defense, the
Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs over the
next week until Feb. 12 to prompt their staff members to donate
blood.</P>
      <P>DOH Vice Minister Lee Lung-teng took the lead by donating a bag
of blood early Friday when the blood wagon arrived at the Chiang
Kai-shek Memorial Hall complex near the DOH building in downtown
Taipei.</P>
      <P>Quoting remarks made by President Chen Shui-bian earlier this
week, Lee said blood donating is both an act of self-interest and of
altruism that can help boost social harmony. "Let us be happy blood
donors," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Shortly afterwards, Yang Pao-yu, wife of Premier Yu Shyi-kun,
headed the spouses of 14 Cabinet members to the venue to donate
blood.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, the vehicle arrived at the Executive Yuan
building, where many staff members rolled up their sleeves to donate
blood.</P>
      <P>Chang Ing-ell, chief executive officer of the non-profit Chinese
Blood Services Foundation, said nearly all major domestic blood banks
are in dire shortage of various types of blood at the moment,
particularly blood types A, B and O.</P>
      <P>Taiwan needs about 5,700 bags of blood per day, Chang said,
adding that current blood stocks fall below the required seven-day
safety supply level.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KINMEN ANNOUNCES CONTROLS ON IMPORTS OF LIVE POULTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen, Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The county government of the outlying island
of Kinmen announced Friday that all imports of live poultry, frozen
poultry and related products will be controlled and screened during a
nearly 11-month period beginning Friday as part of the local's
government's efforts to ward off a spread of avian flu.</P>
      <P>In the face of an escalating number of reported infections of the
virulent H5N1 avian flu virus in 10 Asian countries, with more than a
dozen people having already died of the disease, Kinmen, which is
located some 24 kilometers off mainland China's coast and relies
heavily on imports for its daily necessities, decided Friday to step
up food safety and animal quarantine checks, county government
officials said.</P>
      <P>Beginning Friday, all in-bound shipments of live poultry, frozen
poultry or cold ready-to-serve meat products will be controlled,
county government officials said, adding that such shipments will not
be allowed in without import-permit documents and papers proving that
the products are come from farms that have not been affected with any
epidemic or diseases over the past three months.</P>
      <P>The controls will remain in place until Dec. 31, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>In related news, officers from the Kinmen Police Department
captured 17 live chickens and ducks on a beach near Kuningtou in
northwestern Kinmen that were believed to have been abandoned by
smugglers while escaping a coast guard patrol.</P>
      <P>The captured birds were handed over to authorities from the
Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ)
under the Council of Agriculture, Kinmen Office, for bird flu virus
examination.</P>
      <P>BAPHIQ authorities destroyed the smuggled poultry after taking
samples from them.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 9 last year, six live red-faced ducks were caught by
Kinmen authorities on a beach in Hsiyuan in northeastern Kinmen
during an anti-smuggling operation, BAPHIQ officials said.</P>
      <P>The six ducks, believed to have come from mainland China, were
destroyed after the BAPHIQ officials took samples of the animals and
sent the samples to a laboratory on Taiwan proper for examination.</P>
      <P>The BAPHIQ lab researchers confirmed later in the month that the
deadly H5N1 virus was present in one of the six ducks.</P>
      <P>Chen Yu-hsin, head of the BAPHIQ Department of Animal Health
Inspection and Quarantine, said that the H5N1 virus can be passed
from animals to humans.</P>
      <P>According to officials from the BAPHIQ Kinmen Office, no cases of
the virus have been discovered on any of Kinmen's 28 poultry farms.</P>

guidance to Palau farmers.</P>
      <P>Taiwan tourists also made 28,000 visits to Palau last year,
making it the largest source of tourists for the West Pacific island
state, they added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JUDGE ORDERS UNCLE ARRESTED IF IRUAN NOT HANDED OVER BY FEB. 9</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Feb.  6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung District Court Judge Liao
Cheng-hsiung on Friday ordered the arrest of Wu Huo-yen if Wu does
not hand over his Taiwanese-Brazilian nephew to the boy's legal
guardian before Feb. 9.</P>
      <P>Judge Liao and Brazil's representative to Taiwan, Paulo A.P.
Pinto went to the Wu residence at about 10: 15 a.m. Friday to pick up
the eight-year-old Iruan Wu Ergui as scheduled but found him not to
be at home. Only the uncle met them at the residence located in
Chiehting rural township in the southern county of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Pinto has been commissioned by Iruan Wu Ergui's Brazilian
grandmother, the boy's legal guardian, to bring Iruan back to Brazil.</P>
      <P>Liao said Wu faces arrest if he doesn't hand over Iruan, better
known as Wu Yi-hua in Taiwan, by 10 a.m. next Monday.</P>
      <P>When Liao, Pinto and police officers arrived at Wu's residence,
Wu insisted that Iruan's Brazilian grandmother Rosa Leocadia Silva
Ergui should come to Taiwan to take Iruan -- born out of wedlock in
Brazil to a Brazilian mother and a Taiwanese father. He said he will
only hand Iruan over when the boy's grandmother comes to get him.</P>
      <P>He added that his older brother, Wu Teng-shu, Iruan's Taiwanese
father, who died in 2001 several weeks after he brought Iruan back to
Taiwan, said before his death that he wanted Iruan to stay and live
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Iruan's Brazilian mother died six years ago, and after the boy's
father died, his grandmother was appointed as his legal guardian.
However, the boy's uncle refused to let Iruan be taken back to
Brazil, and he has been living in Kaohsiung and attending a local
elementary school there since 2001.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Supreme Court last November rejected an appeal by the Wu
family to keep the boy in Taiwan and upheld a Kaohsiung District
Court ruling that the boy be handed over and taken back to Brazil to
live with his grandmother.</P>
      <P>Wu had promised Thursday that he and the boy would stay at home
Friday to wait for the court to implement its custody ruling.</P>
      <P>The scheduled handing over of the boy Friday was expected to be
the last episode in the international custody battle that has dragged
on for three years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE MINISTER MUM ON REPORTS ABOUT MAINLAND ARREST OF TAIWAN SPIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of National Defense Tang Yiau-min
declined to make any comments Friday on media reports that mainland
China has busted a large Taiwan intelligence network by secretly
arresting a number of Taiwanese spies in a raid.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, the intelligence network had been
arduously established by Taiwan's military intelligence agents posted
in mainland China's Nanjing Military Region for many years.</P>
      <P>As it was the largest spy ring raid since mainland China executed
a senior officer of the People's Liberation Army in 1998 after he
was convicted of spying for Taiwan, the reports said, the latest mass
arrest has drawn much attention in mainland society.</P>
      <P>Before attending a Legislative Yuan plenary session, many
reporters repeatedly asked Tang about his views on the reported
mainland arrests of Taiwanese intelligence agents.</P>
      <P>In response, Tang said intelligence gathering is important work
for protecting the nation's security.</P>
      <P>"And it's a norm in democratic countries around the world to
refrain from making any comments on espionage cases, " Tang said,
adding that he hopes local people will support intelligence work and
all personnel involved in the operations.</P>
      <P>As intelligence agents work under dangerous, difficult and
stressful conditions, Tang said, they need tangible and intangible
support.</P>
      <P>"For the sake of protecting our intelligence operators' safety,
we have traditionally not issued any comments on espionage cases. And
I hope both news media and ordinary citizens can support this
practice," Tang said.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, Col. Lee Yun-pu from the Military
Intelligence Bureau under Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense and
several other Taiwan intelligence workers under Lee's leadership
and a senior mainland army officer were arrested by mainland Chinese
authorities earlier this month.</P>
      <P>The reports said Lee was responsible for collecting intelligence
about mainland China's Second Artillery Corps and its East China Sea
Fleet and activities in the Nanjing Military Region.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, Lee had managed to develop an
intelligence network under the guise of a science and technology firm
to spy on the Second Artillery Corps' missile base in Loping in
Jiangxi Province, where hundreds of missiles aimed at Taiwan are
deployed. The reports said Lee's arrest could deal a severe blow to
Taiwan's intelligence work in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a military source who spoke on condition of anonymity
said he thinks that mainland China's latest raid was a retaliatory
move against Taiwan's arrests of several people on charges of spying
for Beijing late last year.</P>

      <P>Foreigners seeking Republic of China
citizenship may soon be required to pass tests demonstrating they
have at least a basic level of Mandarin Chinese proficiency if a
draft revision to the Nationality Law is passed into law.</P>
      <P>According to the draft revision crafted by a legal committee
within the Ministry of the Interior (MOI), foreigners should at least
be able to speak basic Mandarin Chinese and have a basic knowledge of
the rights and obligations of an ROC citizen before being
naturalized.</P>
      <P>The draft revision must first be approved by the Cabinet before
being sent to the Legislative Yuan for possible passage into law.</P>
      <P>The draft revision stipulates that the Ministry of the Interior
will be responsible for mapping out the regulations concerning the
tests, fees and related matters.</P>
      <P>MOI officials noted that many countries require that foreigners
demonstrate a basic proficiency in the national language before being
granted citizenship.</P>
      <P>They said the revision is aimed at motivating foreigners to study
Mandarin Chinese and helping them to adapt more quickly to life in
Taiwan, as well as at encouraging foreign spouses of ROC citizens to
take part in the language classes subsidized by the Ministry of the
Education to enable them to better raise and educate their own

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States is obliged to
assist Taiwan in defending its national security even though the two
countries don't have a defense treaty, a U.S. State Department
official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Randall G. Schriver, deputy assistant secretary of state for East
Asia and Pacific affairs, made the remarks while testifying at
a hearing held by the U.S.-China Economic and Security
Commission, which was set up by the U.S. Congress in 2000 to
regularly review the impact of U.S.-China economic and trade
relations on U.S. national security as well as on the effective
execution of the Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>During the hearing, Patrick Mulloy, a commission member, said it
seems to him that Taiwan doesn't perceive the military threat from
mainland China because it has so far not purchased any weapons the
Bush administration offered to sell some three years ago. He also
said the United States doesn't have formal obligation to defend
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In reply, Schriver said although the United States does not have
a defense treaty with Taiwan, it has obligations to help Taiwan in
self-defense under the Taiwan Relations Act-- the U.S. law that
regulates relations with Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>"The Taiwan Relations Act not only talks about providing weapons
for sufficient self-defense, there's two other operative elements:
one, we have an obligation to maintain the capacity to resist force
if asked to do so; and number two, if there is a threat to the people
on Taiwan, the president would consult with Congress to determine
appropriate action," Schriver said, adding: "That's not a defense
treaty, but there are some very important obligations there."</P>
      <P> Schriver also said he doesn't think that Taiwan doesn't see
mainland China's threat.</P>
      <P> "I don't think it's that Taiwan doesn't see a threat or they
don't agree with us on the threat. I think it's a bit more
complicated than that. But they are having some difficulties with how
they make the resourcing decisions and how they make discreet
decisions along the way to address the threat. But I think there is
an appreciation of the threat among the military and among the
leadership there," he explained.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan-raised hogs are free of the H5 and H7
avian flu viruses, the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA)
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and
Quarantine (BAPHIQ) made the remarks after the World Health
Organization (WHO) warned that once hogs are infected with an avian
flu virus, the possibility of humans being infected will increase.</P>
      <P>BAPHIQ Deputy Director Yeh Ying said the bureau began monitoring
local hogs for influenza in July 1998.</P>
      <P>"Over the past six years, we have never discovered the H5 or H7
avian flu viruses in locally raised hogs," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>In 2003, he said, the bureau examined 1,326 hog serum samples and
1,680 samples of excretion from hog lungs, noses and tracheas
collected from six pork markets and 68 hog farms in Taiwan and 18 hog
ranches on the frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>"We only found common pig influenza viruses in those samples, "
Yeh explained.</P>
      <P>As local poultry farmers usually do not raise hogs, Yeh said, the
possibility of locally raised hogs becoming infected with an avian
virus is relatively low.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire service reports, a Vietnamese official
said earlier in the day that bird flu viruses had been found in
several pigs raised in his country. Several people in Vietnam and
some other Asian countries have died from avian flu infections.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has so far only discovered the less virulent H5N2
strain of the avian flu virus in some poultry farms and is free of
the more virulent H5N1 strain. The H5N2 strain cannot infect humans
while the H5N1 can.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the bureau will step up monitoring of local chicken
and duck farms amid the current avian flu outbreaks in Asia.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, COA sources said Saturday that a total of 120,000
chickens raised at six poultry farms in the central county of Nantou
will be culled Sunday after some of its chickens were tested positive
for H5N2.</P>

      <P>An official of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) on Saturday expressed the hope that the two
rival camps in the presidential campaign can clearly state their
cross-strait policies in a televised debate in the run-up to the
March 20 election.</P>
      <P>Chen Chung-hsin, director of DPP's China Affairs Department, was
responding to earlier remarks by James Soong, chairman of the People
First Party (PFP), who accused the ruling party of trying to brand
him as being in same league with mainland China. Soong is Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan's running mate for the upcoming presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the DPP has taken the view that Taiwan should be
made the top priority and that it is questioning the attitude of the
PFP.</P>
      <P>He noted that several PFP legislators, while reviewing revisions
to the Statute Governing the Relations between the People on Taiwan
Area and the Mainland late last year, had different views regarding
placing restrictions on mainland spouses of Taiwan residents in terms
of obtaining citizenship, and that they want the government to allow
direct cross-strait links even without cross-strait consultations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a top aide from the Lien-Soong presidential campaign

start to debate on real issues soon.</P>

Chen's campaign team, said that polls have shown that the public is
most concerned about the economy, adding that he hopes the debate can

      <P>Ma said the focus of the Sunday meeting will be whether to
include the referendum issue in the debate or whether the issue of
the economy should come first in the planned televised debate.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that recent polls show that 70 percent of the people
believe that economic issues most need to be addressed by the

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The conflict between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait will remain in place no matter who wins the Republic of
China's presidency in the March 20 election, an independent lawmaker
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on Taiwan's national identity problems in
the face of mainland China's rise as an economic powerhouse,
Legislator Sisy Chen said the cross-strait conflict will not come to
an end simply because President Chen Shui-bian wins re-election or
because opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan claims victory
in the upcoming election.</P>
      <P>Sisy Chen, who once served as spokeswoman of the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) before it came to power in May 2000 and who
is now Lien's top campaign adviser, said Taiwan's national identity
plight will also not evaporate overnight with the end of the
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Since 1992 when the two sides of the Taiwan Strait reached a
verbal agreement that mainland China and Taiwan are both part of
"China" despite their contention over the definition of "China, "
Sisy Chen said, the biggest change in local society has been the
significant increase in the number of people who identify themselves
with Taiwan rather than with mainland China.</P>
      <P>"The results of many opinion polls show that only about 9 percent
of local people still identify themselves as Chinese, " Sisy Chen
said. "This is a far cry from the figures seen in the early 1990s."</P>
      <P>The outspoken lawmaker claimed that the upcoming presidential
election will offer a historic opportunity for local voters to choose
either an across-the-board conflict or an unpleasant compromise with
mainland China.</P>
      <P>In her view, Sisy Chen said, if the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" ticket of KMT Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party
Chairman James Soong wins, Taiwan and mainland China will still have
conflicts from time to time. But she added that those conflicts will
not be related to sovereignty issues.</P>
      <P>If the ruling DPP ticket of President Chen and Vice President
Annette Lu is re-elected, Sisy Chen claimed, the Taiwan-mainland
China conflicts will be about sovereignty in nature.</P>
      <P>Should that be the case, Sisy Chen said, the conflicts won't
originate in Taiwan, but rather from mainland China's internal
political pressure or Beijing's own interests.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Sisy Chen's analysis, DPP Legislator Chen
Chung-hsin, who also heads the DPP's China affairs department, said
it's an exaggeration to describe the upcoming election as a "historic
choice."</P>
      <P>"Even if the DPP is defeated in the race, it can still stage a
comeback in the future. If the DPP wins, it will be able to further
consolidate its power base in the future and will have to squarely
face up to the thorny 'one China' issue," Chen Chung-hsin added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ETHNIC EQUALITY ALLIANCE TO MONITOR 2-28 ACTIVITIES OF RIVAL CAMPS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group formed by cultural and literary
figures to promote ethnic equality said Saturday that it will send
observers to monitor the 2-28 Peace Memorial Day activities of the
two rival camps in the runup to the March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Ku Yi-ling, a liaison officer of the Ethnic Equality Alliance,
made the remarks after both the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) and the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomingtang (KMT)
and People First Party (PFP) scheduled large-scale activities for
Feb. 28.</P>
      <P>The DPP will hold a "one-million-hand-in-hand" campaign on that
day, with people around the island joining hands to form a giant
human chain. The "pan-blue alliance" will also stage large-scale
activities to drum up support for its March 20 presidential election
bid.</P>
      <P>Ku said the alliance held a meeting Friday during which the
participants focused discussions on the activities set for the 2-28
Peace Memorial Day which commemorates the tragedy that took place on
Feb. 28, 1947, and during the ensuing "white terror" period when
hundreds of local elites were killed.</P>
      <P>The participants decided to abort its planned 2-28 walk in
reminiscence of the event and replace it with other activities.
They also decided to form an observation team, with the team to be
divided into groups of two or three people to monitor the large-scale
rally scheduled by the "pan green" camp of the DPP and its allies, as
well as the "pan blue alliance's" rally, Ku said.</P>
      <P>"The observers will monitor the two camps to see if they mobilize
any one ethnic group against another ethnic group," she added.</P>
      <P>She also said that the alliance has defined itself as a "whistle
blower" and that it will from now on observe and evaluate the two
rival camps each week.</P>
      <P>The alliance wants to avoid giving scores to each of the two
camps as it wants to remain objective, but the members of the
alliance will list the personnel and practices of the two camps that
it deems as good or bad and give explanations as to why it thinks
the offense have violated decorum.</P>
      <P>She said that the alliance has chosen the approach of monitoring
the two camps mainly because they want them to "exercise
self-restraint" and avoid "using sensational or radical words to try
to appeal to the voters."</P>
      <P>"The alliance will not take sides, " she stressed, adding that
the alliance earlier sent letters to both camps urging them to give a
substantial explanation about their policies regarding ethnic groups.</P>
      <P>Participating in the alliance's Friday meeting were famous
director Hou Hsiao-hsien, writers Chu Tien-hsin and Lo Yi-chun, and
convener Chien Hsi-chieh of the "pan-purple alliance" which advocates
the rights of the minority and disadvantaged groups.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JUDICIAL YUAN ACCEPTS RESIGNATIONS OF 4 JUDGES OVER ADULTERY SCANDALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Judicial Yuan has accepted the
resignations of four judges who were involved in two separate
fiction-like adultery scandals, the Taipei District Court said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>A court spokesman said the approval of the four judges'
resignations is part of the Judicial Yuan's efforts to protect the
image of the judiciary.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, a married Taipei District Court judge
surnamed Chang fell in love with a married female judge surnamed Lei
from the Hsinchu District Court while they were taking part
in a short-term study program in the United States two years
ago. Both of their spouses are prosecutors.</P>
      <P>Lei gave birth to a daughter last year. Her husband secretly had
the girl undergo a DNA test after noticing that she hardly resembled
him in appearance. The test results revealed that the girl was not
related to him by blood. The husband reportedly became so distraught
that he planned to leave the judicial profession. He stated the
reason in his resignation letter. But he later accepted his
colleagues' advice and decided to stay in his post.</P>
      <P>With assistance from lawyers, the prosecutor and his wife are
negotiating how to resolve their marital and child custody issues,
judicial sources said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the sources said, Chang has kept a low profile since
his extramarital affair with Lei was exposed in the resignation
letter. He reportedly will respect his wife's wishes regarding the
fate of their marriage.</P>
      <P>In the other adultery case, a married Taipei District Court chief
judge surnamed Chen became involved in an affair with a junior female
judge under his guidance. The unmarried judge gave birth to a child
last September.</P>
      <P>As none of the spouses of those involved in the two adultery
cases have filed criminal suits against any party, the district court
spokesman said, the four judges should not be regarded as having
committed any crime.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the spokesman said, the district court's
disciplinary committee will hold a meeting next week to mete out
punishment to the three judges under its jurisdiction even though the
Judicial Yuan has already approved their resignations.</P>

they have really nothing; and pretend to be in affluence when they
are in actual want -- in such a state of society, it is difficult to
be even a scrupulous man."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN STOCKS UNDERPINNED DESPITE BIRD FLU OUTBREAK IN ASIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  8 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan stocks will be well underpinned by
the country's optimistic economic outlook, despite outbreaks of avian
flu in many Asian countries that have caused their stock markets to
plunge, according to an analysis by an investment and trust company.</P>
      <P>Amid this wave of stock market falls, the domestic bourse has
experienced the smallest drop of 3.3 percent, an analyst of
Hsbcggsset Management (Taiwan) Ltd. said.</P>
      <P>In addition to the main reason that the virulent H5N1 avian flu
virus has not been found in Taiwan, the analyst pointed to a string
of strong economic fundamentals as the underpinner for the stock
market, such as a lowered jobless rate of 4.58 percent for December
last year and a yellow-red light, indicating a booming economy
according to the government's five-color economic gauge -- the first
in four years.</P>
      <P>Amid a rebounding domestic economy, the middle- and long-term
prospects of Taiwan's stock market are positive, the analyst said,
advising investors to be cautiously optimistic about its development.</P>
      <P>The analyst suggested that investors should pay attention to
shares of stable commodities and stocks that will benefit from an
appreciating local currency at a time when international oil prices
are going up and the new Taiwan dollar is gaining in value against
the U.S. dollar.</P>
      <P>Since the recent outbreak of the H5N1 bird flu in about 10 Asian
countries and areas, including Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, South
Korea, Vietnam, Japan, Hong Kong and mainland China, the stock
markets in those countries have plummeted under strong profit-taking
pressure.</P>
      <P>Thai stocks suffered the largest fall of 19.1 percent, with its
benchmark SET index dropping from a high of 802 points Jan. 13 to its
lowest level of 649 points Feb. 3. The SET index rebounded 13.1
percentage points in the following two days, backed by a noticeably
improved economy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FEITSUI WATER SUPPLY MAY REMAIN NORMAL UNTIL MAY: RESERVOIR OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 8 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Water supplies from the Feitsui Reservoir --
Taipei's main source of water -- to normal and household users are
expected to remain normal until May if the present wet weather
continues this week, reservoir authority officials said Sunday.</P>
      <P>If rain continues in northern Taiwan Monday, the water level of
the Feitsui Reservoir is expected to rise to 160 meters -- an average
level for normal water supplies in previous years except for 2003 --
a development that will obviate the need to continue the second-phase
water conservation measures that have began Feb. 6, Feitsui Reservoir
Administration head Kang Shih-fang said.</P>
      <P>Rainfall in the catchment area of Feitsui, which is located in
Taipei's southern suburb of Hsintien, reached its highest level this
year Sunday, remarkably increasing Feitsui's water levels and
temporarily easing the grip of a water shortage in the Taipei area as
aresult of scarce rainfall over the past year, Kang said.</P>
      <P>Sunday's downpour, plus the intermittent rain in the catchment
area since Feb. 1 has led reservoir authorities to believe that the
water level, which stood at 157.3 meters as of 2 p.m. Sunday, will
return to the 160-meter level Monday.</P>
      <P>Reservoir authorities were optimistic that the Feitsui Reservoir
will offer normal water supplies for ordinary and household users
until May, Kang added.</P>
      <P>In accordance with an announcement made by the Water Resource
Agency under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, a second-phase water
conservation measuren has been imposed since Feb. 6 in five cities
and counties in northern Taiwan -- Taipei City, Taipei County,
Taoyuan County, Hsinchu City and Hsinchu County.</P>
      <P>The restrictions were aimed at large-volume water users such as
car washers, saunas, spas and swimming pools.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  8  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Top campaign aides from the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) decided in a second round of negotiations Sunday that the first
televised presidential election debate will be held Feb. 14.</P>
      <P>After ironing out differences between the rival sides, the top
campaign aides -- led by Taipei County Magistrate Su Tseng-chang of
the DPP camp and Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou on the KMT side --
decided that two televised presidential election debates will be held
during the run-up to the March 20 election, with the first being held
Feb. 14 and the second Feb. 21.</P>
      <P>The two sides decided that the candidates -- President Chen
Shui-bian and KMT Chairman Lien Chan -- will debate issues and
affairs related to the general state of the nation.</P>
      <P>They also decided that the two sides must respect and follow the
rules to be established by the debate organizers, who will be made up
of representatives from the Public Television Service Foundation, the
China Times daily, the United Daily News, the Liberty Times daily and
the Taiwan Daily News.</P>
      <P>The organizing body will choose a host to preside over the
debates and announce the rules of the debates, and several
questioners who will raise questions to the two candidates during the
debates based on the principles of "fairness, professionalism and
diversity."</P>
      <P>The second debate will be held in place of a televised
presidential campaign forum that has been arranged by the Central
Election Commission on that date to allow Chen and Lien to voice
their policy initiatives and campaign platforms.</P>
      <P>It will be the first time in Republic of China history that
presidential candidates will engage in televised election debates in
the run-up to a presidential election.</P>
      <P>Candidates of the 2002 Taipei city mayoral election took part in
a televised debate organized by the Public Television Service
Foundation, marking the first televised debate in Taiwan's election
history.</P>
      <P>Last week, a group of scholars called for the establishment of a
permanent organization to set up presidential election debates and
other election debates.</P>
      <P>Hu You-wei, director of the Graduate Institute of Mass
Communication of National Taiwan Normal University, claimed that
election debates, especially presidential election debates, are more
a source of valuable political and social education for the general
public than a chance for individual candidates to woo voters.</P>
      <P>"Public debate is vital for voters, since the people who put
questions to the candidates in the debates are not chosen from
campaign teams, so that the public might get some "real" information
rather than propaganda, and will get to know the candidates from
their political points of view, according to Hu.</P>
      <P>The voters can also compare the different candidates' ideas, he
went on.</P>
      <P>Ku Chung-hua, former president of the liberal Taipei Society and
a professor at National Chengchi University, said it is a duty rather
than a right for candidates to air their points of view in public
debate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROSPECTS FOR CROSS-STRAIT TOURISM OPTIMISTIC DESPITE CURRENT LOW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  8 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The prospects for cross-Taiwan Strait
tourist travel are bright despite the fact that a series of events
have had an adverse impact on the sector in recent years, business
sources said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan travelers paid a total of more than 2.73 million visits to
mainland China last year, down by over 930,000 visits compared with
the 2002 level, the sources reported. However, they pointed out that
about 50 percent of all outbound passengers were headed for mainland
China, an indication that the mainland has become the number one
destination for Taiwan travelers.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-based travel agencies, dedicated both to outbound and
inbound tourism, have been mired in sluggishness due to a spate of
incidents, ranging from the 2001 terrorist attacks on the United
States to last year's outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome
around the world, as well as the recent bird flu in Asia, they said.</P>
      <P>They said, however, that they are confident that the domestic
tourist industry will undoubtedly regain its vigor and continue to
grow in the near future after the present woes come to an end.</P>
      <P>The growth will be the result of various key advantages enjoyed
by Taiwan in regard to the mainland, such as cultural and linguistic
similarities, as well as low costs on the mainland, they explained.</P>
      <P>Despite the current low, the mainland's position as Taiwan's
leading outbound tourist destination has not changed, they added,
noting that more than 2,000 tourist agencies based in Taiwan operate
mainland-bound trips.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, tourists from the mainland are expected to
allow to visit Taiwan sooner or later if the government changes its
policy on tourist arrivals from the mainland, they said.</P>
      <P>An influx of mainland tourists would help inject a new lease on
life into the domestic tourism sector, which is gearing up to upgrade
service quality in line with the government's goal to double the
number of tourist arrivals by 2008.</P>
      <P>In a concerted effort along with the government, many large
business groups as well as small- and medium-sized enterprises have
invested in the domestic tourist and resort sectors in view of the
many business opportunities seen arising from a booming domestic
travel and an improved traffic network across the island, they said.</P>
      <P>They forecast optimistically that cross-strait tourist travel is
full of hope, with bilateral exchanges and cooperation set to
increase every day. A rebounding economy coupled with a better
political atmosphere will greatly benefit tourism exchanges between
the two sides, they said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT DEFENDS DECISION TO CALL REFERENDUM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles,  Feb.  7 (CNA)
(By Chu Lu-sheng &amp; Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian defended his decision to call a referendum in an interview
with the Los Angeles Times last Friday, describing it as a vital next
step for Taiwan's emerging democracy.</P>
      <P>The paper published the main content of Chen's hour-long
interview Saturday on its front page under the title "Taiwan Leader
Defends Vote."</P>
      <P>According to the paper, Chen rejected international concerns that
the proposed referendum is a provocation that endangers the uneasy
peace in the Taiwan Strait. He also characterized Beijing's
denunciation of the referendum as part of a broader attempt during
the last 17 years to intimidate Taiwan's 23 million people as they
move along the path of democracy.</P>
      <P>Chen is placing two questions in votes for the planned referendum
on March 20 to coincide with the presidential election that are as
follows:</P>
      <P>-- "The people of Taiwan demand that the Taiwan Strait issue be
resolved through peaceful means. Should mainland China refuse to
withdraw the missiles it has targeted at Taiwan and openly renounce
the use of force against us, would you agree that the government
should acquire more advanced anti-missile weapons to strengthen
Taiwan's self-defense capabilities?"</P>
      <P>-- "Would you agree that our government should engage in
negotiation with mainland China on the establishment of a peace and
stability framework for cross-strait interaction in order to build
consensus and for the welfare of the peoples of both sides?"</P>
      <P>Chen said that he appreciates the concerns from the international
community, particularly the U.S. government and President Bush, and
he gave his assurance that the Taiwan issue should not be a liability
or a burden to the United States.</P>
      <P>If re-elected March 20, Chen pledged to maintain the status quo
and a permanent peace across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Referring to his plan to draft a new constitution for Taiwan by
2006, Chen said that it will be conducted on the basis of the status
quo and will involve a series of internal issues aimed mainly at
improving government efficiency.</P>
      <P>The paper also published an interview with opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman Lien Chan, who will challenge Chen in the upcoming
presidential race, in which Lien criticized Chen for taking Taiwan
down a dangerous path by calling the referendum and thereby
antagonizing Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lien said that if he is elected, he will begin a dialogue with
Beijing "as soon as the atmosphere is right."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER HOLDS UP ROSY ECONOMIC PICTURE FOR 2004</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 8 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun held up a rosy economic
picture for the country Sunday and canvassed the people of Ilan --
his home county -- for support for President Chen Shui-bian's bid for
re-election.</P>
      <P>Speaking to a group of Ilan residents in Taipei City, Yu said
that the magpie, which is a symbol of good news in local tradition,
has appeared in terms of the economy.</P>
      <P>The country's economy is moving toward its 5 percent growth
target for this year and might reach 6 percent or even 7 percent,
according to some international economic institutes.</P>
      <P>However, the economic momentum might be interrupted if the people
do not choose the right person to lead the country in the March 20
elections, Yu said.</P>
      <P>He also played down the impact on the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) of the recent disclosure that the DPP has
received political donations from a fugitive business tycoon,
claiming that the party's image remains intact despite the
disclosure.</P>
      <P>The DPP has never profited from donations from businessmen and
does not let businessmen dictate policy, Yu claimed, adding that the
voters are well aware of this.</P>
      <P>The fugitive businessman in question -- Chen Yu-hao, who fled
Taiwan to mainland China leaving behind a debt-laden business group
-- revealed his political donations to DPP politicians in an attempt
to disrupt legal action taken by his local creditors, mainly banks,
to auction off his Taiwan concerns. This only underlines the DPP
government's determination to weed out corrupt businessmen who try to
buy the government's favors, according to Yu.</P>
      <P>The premier said that one of Chen's firms bought a large piece of
land in Taoyuan County four years before the land was earmarked by
the government for the construction of a thermal generation station.</P>
      <P>But the DPP government pulled the plug on Chen's scheme for
making huge illegal profits when it put the construction of the power
plant to public tender.</P>
      <P>The public bidding saved taxpayers NT$150 billion (US$4.52
billion) but left Chen's business group unable to repay its NT$60
billion (US$1.8 billion) debt to local banks, the premier explained,
adding that this is why Chen is trying to scuttle President Chen
Shui-bian's re-election bid by revealing his political donations to
the president and other DPP politicians.</P>
      <P>Ironically, Yu said, Chen has made it onto the list of the top
ten biggest tax-payers in mainland China, which he said reinforces
the suspicion that he illegally transferred funds from his Taiwan
concerns to his firms on the mainland.</P>
      <P>The fugitive's anger at the DPP government only highlights the
fact that the government has got it right in ridding the country of
dishonest businessmen, Yu claimed.</P>
      <P>Chen, who is hiding on the mainland after being listed by the
government as one of Taiwan's top-ten fugitives, claimed in an open
letter Feb. 2 that he was politically persecuted by the government
despite his lavish donations to DPP politicians, including the
president.</P>
      <P>The president's aides admitted afterward that the president got
NT$10 million in donations from Chen You-hao in the 2000 presidential
campaign but pointed out in the same breath that the business tycoon
also donated NT$100 million (US$301,431) to the opposition Kuomintang.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WRA TO DECIDE FEB. 17 WHETHER TO LIFT WATER RESTRICTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Water Resources Agency (WRA) said Monday
it will hold a drought-fighting meeting Feb. 17 to decide whether to
lift the second-phase water restrictions that have been in place in
five northern Taiwan cities and counties since Feb. 6.</P>
      <P>Thanks to heavy rainfall over the weekend, a WRA spokesman said,
water levels at all the major reservoirs in northern Taiwan have
risen significantly.</P>
      <P>As of Monday morning, the spokesman said, water storage in the
Feitsui Reservoir -- the primary source of water supply in the
greater Taipei area -- had reached 70 percent of capacity.</P>
      <P>On Sunday alone, the spokesman said, the reservoir's water level
rose 1.68 meters, marking an increase of 9.39 million cubic meters in
its water storage.</P>
      <P>"Given the situation, there is room for considering a lifting of
the second-phase water restrictions in Taipei City and Taipei
County," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The second-phase water restrictions mainly target large-volume
water consumers, such as car washes, saunas, spas, swimming pools and
manufacturing firms. The measures include cutting water supply to
them by 5 percent to 20 percent.</P>
      <P>As to water supply in the three other northern districts, the
spokesman said, the current water restrictions in Taoyuan County,
Hsinchu City and Hsinchu County will have to remain in place because
the amounts of water in the major reservoirs in the regions,
including the Shihmen Reservoir and the Paoshan Reservoir, still fall
below the minimum safety levels.</P>
      <P>Unless the three districts receive substantial rainfall in the
coming days, the spokesman said, the second-phase water restrictions
in Taoyuan County, Hsinchu City and Hsinchu County are not expected
to be lifted in the foreseeable future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SUNSHINE LAWS MAY CLEAR LEGISLATURE BEFORE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION</HEADLINE>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Sunshine laws designed to regulate political
donations to political parties might clear the Legislative Yuan
before the March 20 presidential election, Legislative Yuan President
Wang Jin-pyng said Monday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA, Wang said the sunshine laws have
been thrust into the limelight after allegations emerged recently
about donations made by controversial businessmen to political
parties, and a consensus among different parties coalesced about
regulations governing the raising of campaign funds.</P>
      <P>With the presidential election only 40 days away, Wang, who is
campaign manager for opposition Kuomintang chairman Lien Chan and his
running mate, People First Party Chairman James Soong, said the main
vote-getting strategy is to inform the public of the vision a
Lien-Soong victory will bring to the country.</P>
      <P>The campaign team for Lien and Soong are trying hard to convince
the people that they are the candidates who can fulfill their
promises.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of more unexpected incidents cropping up in the
lead-up to election day, Wang said his team is working hard to prevent
vote-buying and election-fixing and is well-prepared to control any
damage caused by unexpected crises.</P>
      <P>He welcome planned televised debates between Lien and President
Chen Shui-bian, saying they will help the public understand the
candidates' points of view on various issues. However, he said it is
not necessary for debates between their running mates, who are not
supposed to air any ideas other than those espoused by the
presidential candidates themselves.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT-PFP ISSUES FOREIGN POLICY WHITE PAPER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) said in a white
paper on foreign policy that they will promote diplomacy with a
pragmatic and professional approach, vowing that "we can do it
better."</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP Chairman James Soong unveiled the
white paper in a post-Chinese New Year tea party hosted for foreign
diplomatic officials stationed in Taiwan. Lien, with Soong as his
running mate, will run against President Chen Shui-bian and Vice
President Annette Lu in the March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lien said the "pan-blue alliance" foreign policy will be
"credible, stable and pragmatic, " while Soong said that the
presidential election will be a turning point in Taiwan's history and
expressed the hope that the diplomatic officials will convey to their
home countries the alliance's stance on cross-strait and
international relations.</P>
      <P>"The KMT and the PFP will bring Taiwan back onto the right path,
and the people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will need time
to resolve their differences," Soong said.</P>
      <P>"The KMT and the PFP will have no timetable" for changing
cross-strait relations and the stance of the KMT-PFP will be "say yes
to peace, say no to war."</P>
      <P>The white paper criticizes the incumbent government's foreign
policy as "unpragmatic" and "unprofessional."</P>
      <P>In comparison, it says that the KMT and the PFP have seven clear
goals -- to enhance security, cement sovereignty, promote peace,
revive the economy, establish mutually beneficial and reciprocal
relations, promote democracy and humanitarian concerns.</P>
      <P>The white paper states that if elected March 20, the new
government's top priorities will include strengthening the nation's
sovereignty, seeking active participation in international
organizations, promoting global security and establishing lasting
peace, participating in international affairs and making good use of
international assistance to raise the profile of Taiwan around the
world.</P>
      <P>The priorities will also include effective distribution of
foreign resources to strengthen regional cooperation, good
coordination of foreign affairs, and the grooming of talented people
to serve in foreign diplomatic areas, the white paper says.</P>
      <P>The white paper also says that with Taiwan's difficult diplomatic
situation, it has to make good use of the "second track" dialogue
channel, meaning that think tanks, academic figures, non-government
organizations, or government officials acting in their private
capacities, must take part in communication mechanisms that can
complement the government's contacts with countries with which Taiwan
does not maintain diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>KMT official Su Chi said that although the diplomatic goals of
the "pan-blue alliance" are similar to those of the ruling party, the
alliance's "pragmatic" and "professional" approach is far superior.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs
(CLA) announced Monday that Indonesian workers whose employment
contracts expire during the period between Feb. 2-May 1 can extend
their work permits until May 1.</P>
      <P>The measure is aimed at ensuring that the interests of both the

the CLA works with the Indonesian government to lift a freeze on the
introduction of new Indonesian workers, CLA officials said.</P>
      <P>Kuo Fang-yu, director-general of the CLA Employment and
Vocational Training Administration, said that employers who are
entitled to employ foreign workers can apply for extensions of
employment contracts for Indonesian workers whose permits expire
during the period and who want to remain in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He estimated that the measure will benefit some 6,000 Indonesian
workers.</P>
      <P>At the invitation of the Indonesian government, CLA Chairwoman
Chen Chu recently visited Jakarta and held talks with Indonesian
Minister of Manpower and Transmigration Jacob Nuwawea on Indonesian
expatriates working in Taiwan, on their high absconding rate and on
other relevant affairs.</P>
      <P>The CLA imposed the freeze in August 2002 in retaliation for the
high rate of absconding and working illegally by Indonesian workers
in Taiwan, as well as the excessively high brokerage fees charged by
Indonesian labor brokers.</P>
      <P>According to CLA tallies, some 73,000 Indonesian workers are

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 9 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Police sent by the Kaohsiung District Court
failed in their attempts to hand a Taiwanese-Brazilian boy at the
center of a custody dispute over to Brazil's representative to Taiwan
Monday evening.</P>
      <P>As of press time, the police were still trying to convince the
boy's Taiwanese uncle to hand over the boy voluntarily.</P>
      <P>Liao Cheng-hsiung, a Kaohsiung District Court judge who ordered
the police to take Iruan Wu Ergui away from his Taiwanese uncle Wu
Ho-yen and return him to his rightful and legal guardian, said Wu
called in a huge mob of relatives and sympathizers to prevent police
from taking the eight-year-old boy away.</P>
      <P>The mob surrounded the police station at Chieting, a rural
township in Kaohsiung County, to prevent police from carrying out
their duty.</P>
      <P>Liao, who was at the scene to see to it that the boy was returned
to his grandmother, the child's legal guardian, said he has asked for
police reinforcements to help implement the court's order, although
he was still hoping it could be done without resorting to force.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Brazilian representative to Taiwan Paulo A. Pereira
Pinto was waiting at the Kaohsiung District Court, having already
missed a 5 p.m. flight from Kaohsiung to Hong Kong on which he had
booked two seats to escort the boy home to Brazil.</P>
      <P>It was the third time Pereira had gone to the Kaohsiung District
Court to pick up the boy due to Wu's continued refusal to give up the
boy.</P>
      <P>Iruan Wu Ergui was born to Brazilian mother Marisa Tavares Ergui
and Taiwanese father Wu Teng-shu in 1995 in Brazil.</P>
      <P>The mother died in 1998, and the child's grandmother, Rosa
Leocadia Da Silva Ergui, was named as the boy's guardian with Wu
Teng-shu's approval in 2000.</P>
      <P>Wu Teng-shu took the boy from his grandmother's home at Porto
Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul to his hometown of Chieting on March 15,
2001, for a short visit, but he died unexpectedly March 29 in
Chieting.</P>
      <P>Wu Teng-shu's younger brother, Wu Ho-yen decided to take the law
into his own hands and refused to let the child leave, triggering a
desperate legal battle for Iruan's custody with the boy's distraught
grandmother.</P>
      <P>Wu lost and was ordered by the court to hand over the boy to
Pereira, who is looking after the interests of the child's
grandmother in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The court has threatened to detain Wu if he fails to hand in the
boy but Wu has refused to budge. Instead, he tried to seek public
sympathy for his efforts to keep the boy in Taiwan and even wrote a
letter to President Shui-bian for help in a desperate attempt to
reverse the court's order.</P>

      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Yi-fu said
Monday that if the water level of Shihmen Reservoir reaches 225
meters, or seven meters more than the current level, the ministry
will consider lifting a second phase of water restrictions.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks when he inspected the reservoir in Taoyuan

      <P>Lin said that if the water level reaches 225 meters, it will

water restrictions imposed in northern Taiwan since Feb. 6 could
be lifted, although related details will still have to be worked out
at a drought-fighting meeting scheduled for Feb. 17.</P>
      <P>Thanks to several consecutive days of rain, the rainfall received
by the reservoir has accumulated to 151.20 millimeters since Feb. 1,

      <P>Lee Tie-min, director of the Water Resource Agency of northern
Taiwan, briefed Lin about the condition of Shihmen reservoir, saying
that barring any unexpected circumstances, there will be an
additional 100 millimeters of rain in February, which will bring the
water in the reservoir to 100 million cubic meters. At present, the
reservoir holds 64.3 million cubic meters.</P>
      <P>The second-phase water restrictions have been in place in five
cities and counties in northern Taiwan since Feb. 6, mainly targeting
large-volume water consumers such as car washes, saunas, spas,
swimming pools and manufacturing firms. The restrictions include
cutting water supplies to these users by 5 percent to 20 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, with the rain of recent days, the Water Resource
Agency has authorized the Taipei Water Department to decide whether
to adjust the second-phase water restrictions depending on the
situation of the water level at Feitsui Reservoir -- the prime source
of water for the greater Taipei area.</P>
      <P>The rain has also brought plentiful water to Yungheshan and
Paoshan reservoirs, which supply water to the Hsinchu Science-based
Industrial Park and households in the Hsinchu area.</P>
      <P>Although the second-phase restrictions are still in place, Taiwan
Water Supply Corp. officials said that there will be no water supply
problems for industrial and household use until the end of May.</P>
      <P>Jenyitan and Lantan reservoirs, which supply water to Chiayi in
southern Taiwan, also reported daily water accumulation of between
50,000 and 60,000 tons of waters for three consecutive days, which
means there will be no supply problems from that source before the
end of May.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  9 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will respect whatever
decision is made by the Central Election Commission (CEC) on whether
there should be public debates about the questions to be asked in the
upcoming referendum, an Executive Yuan spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chia-lung said although the Referendum Law doesn't require
public debates proceeding the referendum initiated by the president,
as it does for a referendum initiated by others, the Executive Yuan
will not oppose such debates in light of the fact that they could
help raise public awareness about the referendum, which will be the
first national referendum in the country.</P>
      <P>However, Lin said, the referendum scheduled for March 20 to
coincide with the presidential election should not be postponed
because of public debates, the Executive Yuan will respect the CEC's
decision and hopes it will balance the president's power to call a
referendum against the public's right to understand the referendum
through debates.</P>
      <P>The Referendum Law obliges the CEC, which is charged with the
implementation of referendums, to stage at least five public debates
for nationwide referendums with the purpose of educating the public
on the pros and cons of the issues.</P>
      <P>Since the law is unclear whether the public debates rule applies
to a referendum called by the president, CEC members have been
divided over whether to hold debates because of the logistical
problems of organizing five debates around the country in the short
period before March 20.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES PLEDGE TO HOLD CLEAN ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The presidential and vice presidential
candidates from the two rival political camps signed promissory notes
Monday to signify their determination to hold a clean election and
keep political contributions transparent.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu signed
their promissory notes during a meeting with representatives of the
National Clean Election Promotion Association (NCEPA) at the
headquarters of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Chen said a clean election is not only a common wish but also an
integral part of the code of practice of a mature democracy. "Only a
clean election can thwart corrupt 'black gold' politics," he noted.</P>
      <P>In the past, Chen claimed, Taiwan's authoritarian rulers indulged
the involvement of gangsters and shady money in political elections
in order to maintain its political dominance.</P>
      <P>Even though authoritarian rule ended following the power
transition in May 2000, Chen said, the "black gold" political
mechanism did not collapse with the Kuomintang's (KMT's) defeat in
the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Against that backdrop, Chen said, his administration has spared
no effort in the past four years to promote financial, judicial,
legislative and political reform with an ultimate goal of
establishing clean politics and wiping out shady political links with
gangsters and moneyed interests.</P>
      <P>"Our efforts have achieved initial results on some fronts, but
there is still room for improvement in several other fields, " Chen
said, adding that a clean election is crucial to the campaign for
clean politics in the future.</P>
      <P>Chen said he fully supports the clean election promotion
association's cause and is more than willing to pledge support for
its goal.</P>
      <P>For his part, NCEPA President Chai Sung-lin said he hopes the
March 20 election will be a high-quality race in which the candidates
refrain from negative campaign tactics, from instigating ethnic
disharmony and from polluting the environment, as well as establish
transparency in their political contributions and refrain from
wasting money.</P>
      <P>In addition to signing the clean election promissory note, Chen
and Lu also signed a promissory note on the transparency of political
contributions.</P>
      <P>According to the note, Chen and Lu agreed to publicize political
donations received by themselves and their campaign headquarters in
the run-up to the election. They are required to publicize detailed
reports about the donations on Feb. 20 and March 13.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Chai and other NCEPA representatives also met
with the opposition "pan-blue alliance" presidential and vice
presidential candidates -- KMT Chairman Lien Chan and People First
Party Chairman James Soong.</P>
      <P>Lien and Soong also signed the clean election and political
donations transparency promissory notes, pledging to abide by the
clean election principles outlined by the association and keep their
political donations transparent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RELIEF FUND TO FARMERS TO INCREASE TO NT$100 BILLION NEXT YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) said Monday
that an additional NT$23.5 billion (US$707.83 million) budget will be
appropriated to a relief fund next year to compensate for the losses
of farmers incurred by imported agricultural products following the
nation's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>With the additional budget, the COA officials said that the total
will be NT$100 billion.</P>
      <P>The officials made the remarks in response to a three-point
proposal by opposition parties to step up care of farmers and
fishermen. The gist of the proposal is to increase the relief fund to
NT$100 billion within one year, with farmers and fishermen being able
to get loans at 2 percent interest rates from farmers and fishermen's
associations, as well as to raise the purchase price of rice to NT$23
per kilogram and to raise the subsidy for fuel for fishing vessels.</P>
      <P>Regarding the proposal to raise the price of rice, the COA said
that the government's purchases follow a specific formula.</P>
      <P>The officials said the current purchase price is enough to
safeguard farmers' incomes, adding that if the purchase price is
increased too dramatically, it will run against the WTO's principle
of diminished government subsidies and will be detrimental to the
adjustment of the nation's rice industry.</P>
      <P>On the opposition parties' proposal that the loan interest rate
be cut to 2 percent, they said that starting from Feb. 1, the rates
of loans from an agricultural industry development fund have already
dropped to 2 percent from 2.5 percent, while the interest rates of
loans from a special fund to stimulate the farmers' and fishermen's
associations has dropped to 1.5 percent from 2 percent.</P>

trade interests.</P>
      <P>Ten European countries, including Hungary, Poland, Slovenia,
Malta, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and

      <P>Facing the new trade situation and relevant issues after the EU's
enlargement, the countries attending the meeting also discussed
matters regarding how to obtain maximum trade interests from the EU
in the future, according to sources close to the mission.</P>
      <P>The sources said that the new EU member states are expected to
adjust the level of their import tariffs to that of the EU's and that
such an adjustment will impact export countries' interests.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP DEFENDS POLICY OF BANNING ENGLISH TEACHING IN KINDERGARTENS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on Monday defended the Ministry of
Education's (MOE's) decision to ban English teaching in kindergartens
and nursery schools from the start of the next school year.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Tsai Huang-lang said at a press conference held at
the Legislative Yuan that the MOE's decision is aimed at streamlining
and improving the learning environment for Taiwan's very young.</P>
      <P>The move received the approval of both DPP and opposition
lawmakers, Tsai said, adding that Taipei City has taken the lead in
implementing the measure Feb. 1.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks in the wake of an announcement by Minister
of Education Huang Jung-tsun a day earlier that all kindergartens and
nursery schools around Taiwan will be prohibited from offering
instruction in English.</P>
      <P>The MOE announcement has triggered a wave of protest from school
operators and parents.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu Tsai-shun, director-general of the MOE's Department
of Elementary Education, said that all forms of English teaching at
kindergartens or nursery schools, regardless of whether they are
legally registered, should be prohibited as the practice runs counter
to the basic educational principles for very young children.</P>
      <P>For normal and healthy development, very young children should
first be taught in their mother tongue, then Mandarin Chinese, and
then a foreign language, Wu said. He added that the purpose of the
MOE's ban on English teaching is for the healthy physical and mental
development of the preschool children.</P>
      <P>Wu said many illegal cram schools or after-school study centers
have solicited "customers" by offering bilingual or "full English"
instruction at excessively high prices.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Ministry of Education will first make the
English ban policy better known among kindergartens, nursery schools,
as well as children's cram schools and after-school study centers
before actually implementing the ban at the start of the next school
year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei City Government announced Monday that in
accordance with the Ministry of Education policy, all kindergartens,
nursery schools and children's cram schools, numbering over 1,000,
are now prohibited from offering any form of instruction in English.</P>
      <P>Violators could face fines or have their licenses revoked, city
government officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REFERENDUM RESULTS TO BE BINDING: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Tuesday that the
results of the nation's first-ever referendum, to be held March 20 in
conjunction with the presidential election, will be legally binding.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks during a general interpellation session at
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>At the session, opposition People First Party Legislator Feng
Ting-kuo asked Yu how the government will react if the results of the
referendum show that a majority of the voters disagree with the
proposal to negotiate with Beijing on the establishment of a
mechanism for peaceful interaction or that a majority of the voters
are opposed to the government purchasing more anti-missile weapons.</P>
      <P>In response, Yu said the Cabinet will definitely respect the
referendum results which have an undisputable binding force under the
Referendum Act.</P>
      <P>Expressing dissatisfaction with Yu's answer, Feng repeatedly
pushed Yu to give an unequivocal reply. However, the premier said he
couldn't answer hypothetical questions.</P>
      <P>Yu said he hopes all eligible voters will support the referendum
and express their opinions on the two referendum questions through
their ballots.</P>
      <P>He further said that after the referendum results come out, he
will gladly explain the government's stance on the results if
Legislator Feng asks him again.</P>
      <P>During the legislative session, Feng also asked Minister of
National Defense Tang Yiau-min how his ministry will respond if the
referendum results show that the majority of voters oppose missile
procurement.</P>
      <P>In reply, Tang said that while national defense is a common duty
of all his fellow countrymen, it is also a professional affair. "We
don't like to see political meddling with defense affairs," he added.</P>
      <P>Last Wednesday, the Cabinet approved the two questions
initiated by President Chen Shui-bian to be put to the people in the
upcoming referendum:</P>
      <P>-- "The people of Taiwan demand that the Taiwan Strait issue be
resolved through peaceful means. If mainland China refuses to
withdraw the missiles it has targeted at Taiwan and to openly
renounce the use of force against us, do you agree that the
government should acquire more advanced anti-missile weapons to
strengthen Taiwan's self-defense capabilities?"</P>
      <P>-- "Do you agree that our government should engage in
negotiations with mainland China on the establishment of a peace and
stability framework for cross-strait interactions to build consensus
and for the welfare of the people of both sides?"</P>
      <P>During the Tuesday legislative session, Yu also reiterated the
legality and constitutionality of the upcoming referendum, saying
that the Referendum Act endows President Chen the right to decide the
timing and content of a national referendum in terms of the nation's
diplomatic and defense situations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REPRESENTATIVE TO ESCORT TAIWANESE-BRAZILIAN BOY HOME FEB. 11</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Feb.  10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After a long and turbulent day, the
Kaohsiung family of the Taiwanese-Brazilian boy at the center of an
international custody battle finally handed the child over to
Brazil's representative to Taiwan midnight Monday, allowing the child
to be returned to his legal guardian in Brazil.</P>
      <P>Representative Paulo A.P. Pinto, who has been commissioned by
Iruan Wu Ergui's Brazilian grandmother Rosa Leocadia Silva Eugui to
bring him home, is scheduled to escort the 8-year-old back to Brazil
Wednesday. Iruan will also be accompanied by his Taiwanese aunt
during the journey back to Brazil.</P>
      <P>Iruan Wu Ergui, born to Brazilian mother Marisa Tavares Ergui and
Taiwanese father Wu Teng-shu in 1995 in Brazil, has been living in
Taiwan for the past three years.</P>
      <P>At the Kaohsiung District Court, Judge Liao Cheng-hsiung handed
the boy over to Pinto just before midnight Monday. Iruan's uncle and
aunt, their lawyer, and Kaohsiung County Legislator Lin Yi-shih were
all present. By that time, Iruan had fallen asleep after a long and
difficult ordeal the preceeding day.</P>
      <P>On Monday morning, the judge issued a warrant for the arrest of
Iruan's Taiwanese uncle Wu Huo-yen over Wu's failure to hand the boy
over before the deadline set by the court. A mob of relatives and
sympathizers then swamped the Wu residence in Chiehting township,
Kaohsiung County, to prevent the police from taking the boy away.
Iruan screamed and kicked when the police came and tried to separate
him from his relatives.</P>
      <P>Pinto, who arrived in Kaohsiung late Sunday evening and proceeded
to the Kaohsiung District Court Monday morning to pick up the boy,
was also at the scene.</P>
      <P>Judge Liao, who was also present to see to it that the boy was
handed over, said he asked for police reinforcements to help carry
out the court's order, although he added that he still hoped it could
be done without resorting to force.</P>
      <P>Finding no more room for maneuvering in light of the judge's
determination, the Wu family finally gave in and came to an agreement
with the judge and Pinto, allowing the Brazilian representative to
take Iruan Wu Ergui home to Brazil.</P>
      <P>Iruan's mother died in 1998, and the child's grandmother, Rosa
Ergui, was named as the boy's guardian with Wu Teng-shu's approval in
2000.</P>
      <P>Wu Teng-shu took the boy from his grandmother's home at Porto
Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, to his hometown of Chiehting on March 15,
2001, for a short visit, but he died unexpectedly March 29 in
Chiehting. Iruan's uncle refused to let the boy be taken back to
Brazil, so he has been living in Kaohsiung ever since.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Supreme Court last November rejected an appeal by the Wu
family to keep the boy in Taiwan and upheld a Kaohsiung District
Court ruling that the boy be handed over and taken back to Brazil to
live with his grandmother.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that
his administration will continue to promote the privatization of
state-run enterprises.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a gathering of owners of gas stations affiliated with
the state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) , Chen said that under a
privatization program initiated by his administration more than three
years ago, the overall performance of state-run enterprises has been
improving, with the loss-making ones becoming profitable and the
money-making ones earning even greater profits.</P>
      <P>For instance, he noted, China Shipbuilding Corp. recorded profits
of NT$520 million (US$15.4 million) for 2003 and NT$300 million for
2002 as opposed to the NT$4.5 billion it lost in 2000.</P>
      <P>Tang Eng Iron Works Corp., another state-run company, which

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIST FORECASTS TAIWAN ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE OF 6 PERCENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 10 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth rate for 2004 will
be between 5 percent and 6 percent, a well-known foreign economist
predicted Tuesday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>John Calverley, chief economist and strategist for American
Express Bank, London, made the forecast while releasing the results
of his latest research to the domestic press.</P>
      <P>Although Calverley said demand from Taiwan's domestic market will
remain sluggish this year, he forecast that Taiwan's economy will
still manage a growth rate from 5 percent to 6 percent, mainly as a
result of a mildly rebounding U.S. economy.</P>
      <P>That increase rate will be much better than the 2003 level of 3.1
percent, thanks to the robust information industry-related sectors,
Calverley said. However, he made it clear that enterprises based in
Taiwan still have an overwhelming need to restructure.</P>
      <P>At the same time, mainland China will achieve a growth rate of
8.4 precent, followed by India with 7 percent, Thailand with 6.8
percent, Singapore with 5.9 percent, Hong Kong with 5 percent, the
Philippines with 4.7 percent and Indonesia with 4.6 percent, he
predicted, adding that a booming export sector will be the major
engine behind the expansion.</P>
      <P>Calverley was also optimistic about the stock markets of Asian
countries, including Japan.</P>
      <P>He predicted that stock markets in the region will continue to
pick up, with Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore expected to post the
best performance on the grounds that the prices of their shares are
at a relatively low level.</P>
      <P>With its economy gradually regaining momentum, the United States
might move to lift its interest rates in June for the first time
following many years mired in recession, he said.</P>
      <P>He also said a weaker U.S. dollar will help the current economic
upward trend in that country to last longer, while mainland China
might allow the renminbi to appreciate this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND UNVEILS 2004 MILITARY TRAINING DRILL SCHEDULE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
unveiled a detailed schedule for its military training exercises for
2004 Tuesday, with large-scale live-fire training drills mostly
concentrated between April and November.</P>
      <P>Wang Kuo-chiang, an MND department chief in charge of military
training affairs, said the arrangement was mainly based on the demand
of combat units and had nothing to do with the upcoming presidential
election or the escalating tension across the Taiwan Strait over
Taiwan's referendum plan.</P>
      <P>"The exercise schedule has long been crafted in terms of the
requirements of strengthening combined services combat capabilities,"
Wang said, adding that the military training schedule has neither
been delayed for the sake of the March 20 presidential election nor
increased over Beijing's intimidation against Taiwan's plan to hold a
referendum in conjunction with the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Wang further said that training drills on the Taiwan-held
frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu, both of which lie closer to
mainland China than to Taiwan, will proceed as scheduled and will not
be affected by President Chen Shui-bian's recent proposal to set up
"demilitarized zones" between Taiwan and mainland China in order to
ensure permanent cross-strait peace.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Chen's "demilitarized zones" initiative remains on
the drawing board, Wang said the military's combat training and
preparedness will not be affected by the proposal.</P>
      <P>Noting that this year's training programs have been designed in
line with the principles of maintaining cross-strait stability,
preventing war, maintaining electronic warfare supremacy and beefing
up combined services combat capabilities, Wang said a total of 42
training drills in four major categories -- live-fire war games,
mobilization, nuclear and chemical warfare preparedness and general
combat skill training -- will be conducted during the year.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, many of the training drills will integrate
forces from various military regions, with the chief of the general
staff's headquarters commanding all maneuvers.</P>
      <P>With the aim of reinforcing the armed forces' ability to attack
maritime targets from frontline islands and their air defense
capabilities, Wang said the number of combined services training
exercises has been raised this year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang went on, the Hangkuang Exercise -- the largest
training drill of the year -- will be conducted in three stages. The
first stage, to be held in the second half of April, will focus on
tactical training; the second stage, to be held in mid-June, will
focus on computerized war games; and the third-stage, to be held from
late June through November, will focus on amphibious live-fire war
games in waters and air space surrounding Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition, Wang said, a total of 10 rounds of combined services
training drills will be held on the islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Penghu,
Tungyin and Wuchiu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT HOPES POLITICAL DONATION BILL WILL PASS LEGISLATURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that
he hopes a political donation bill will pass its third reading in the
legislature by the end of this month.</P>
      <P>Chen, who concurrently serves as chairman of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), made the remarks when he attended
a regular DPP Central Standing Committee meeting during which
participants discussed the three "sunshine bills" -- a political
donation bill, a political party bill, and a lobbying bill -- as well
as their progress in the Legislative Yuan and related matters.</P>
      <P>The president claimed that the three bills will clean up
politics, saying that they will regulate normal development and
competition among political parties and curb shady links between
political figures and rich business tycoons.</P>
      <P>"All political lobbying and maneuvering will be made thoroughly
transparent, open and normal under the sunshine bills, " according to
Chen.</P>
      <P>The president said that for over three years, the DPP government
has tried to promote financial, judicial and legislative reforms.</P>
      <P>"This has been aimed at achieving eventual political reforms so
that Taiwan politics will embrace the sunshine and there will be no
place left for corrupt `black gold' politics," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president stressed that the integrity of political figures
must come under the most rigorous scrutiny and that political
donations must be bound by the law.</P>
      <P>He said that he will ask the DPP legislators to promote the
"political donation bill" so that it can pass its third reading by
the end of this month.</P>
      <P>He also expressed hope that the political party bill and the
lobbying bill will cleared the legislature by the end of the current
session.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that he and Vice President Annette Lu, when meeting
with representatives of the National Clean Election Promotion
Association the previous day, signed promissory notes to ensure a
clean election and to make the political donations they receive
transparent.</P>
      <P>Last week, the president vowed to pull out all the stops to
promote the clearing of the political donation bill in the shortest
possible time.</P>
      <P>He also said that if the bill does not pass the third reading
before the March 20 presidential election, he and all DPP members
will follow the norms set up by the Cabinet's version of the
political donation bill and will accept outside monitoring.</P>
      <P>He expressed the desire to lead the way so that it will have a
positive effect to the future development of political parties and
transparency and positive competition between political parties, so
that the public will realize and support the sincerity of the reforms
promoted by the DPP.</P>
      <P>The sunshine bills were cast into the limelight recently when
fugitive business tycoon Chen You-hau, who is on the nation's top 10
most wanted list for embezzlement, accused the DPP of cutting the
ground from under his feet by taking his political donations before
the 2000 presidential election but indicting him after they won the
election.</P>
      <P>Chen's revelation took some by surprise, as the DPP has always
claimed to have integrity and has tried to distance itself from money
politics. Both the opposition Kuomintang and the DPP admitted that
they did receive donations from Chen, who fled to mainland China to
avoid his creditors after his business went bankrupt.</P>
      <P>However, the two parties claim they did nothing wrong because
there are no legal precedents for political donations.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  10 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will endeavor to make the
country's economic processing zones better equipped to lure both
traditional and hi-tech companies to set up shop in their compounds,
a spokesman for the Economic Processing Zone Administration (EPZA)
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In the face of rapid developments, Taiwan's economic processing
zones (EPZs) -- once the backbone of the country's economic lifeline
-- will be made into a diversified environment to attract various
sorts of industries, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>EPZs, which used to accommodate only labor-intensive and
manufacturing businesses, will also be able to court hi-tech and
capital-intensive groups in the future, shifting from compounds that
focus on production, processing and assembly to those that are also
attractive to the warehousing, distribution, trade and information
technology service-oriented and value-added industries, he said.</P>
      <P>In an effort to achieve that aim, the EPZA will set different
levels at which the various industries can operate in the EPZs,
including a lowered threshold for research and development spending
for hi-tech companies, he explained, pointing out that this will help
both high-technology and traditional businesses to retain their
capital and operations in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The EPZs may also be approved to operate as "free trade port
zones" to help domestic businesses based there to go international,
with assistance from the EPZA to help them with global marketing,
distribution and brand-building.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 10 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will help domestic poultry
farmers to erect five-meter fences around their farms in an attempt
to prevent migratory birds which might carry the lethal avian flu
virus from mingling with their stocks.</P>
      <P>Lee Ching-lung, chairman of the Council of Agriculture, pointed
out to the Legislative Yuan that Taiwan straddles a route used by
birds migrating from south to north and is therefore vulnerable to
any diseases they might carry.</P>
      <P>Since almost all of Taiwan's neighboring states have fallen under
the grip of the avian flu, the island has gone out of its way to
prevent an invasion of the H5N1 virus that causes avian flu.</P>
      <P>However, he assured the public that there have been no recorded
human cases of the less virulent H5N2 strain of avian flu that has
been found in some domestic poultry. This low pathogenic virus exists
only in the digestive tracts of poultry and can be easily destroyed
through cooking, so it safe for consumers to eat thoroughly-cooked
poultry.</P>
      <P>Lee denied reports that his council is importing 3 million avian
flu vaccines for chickens and ducks, saying that such a move would be
a drop in the ocean compared to the hundreds of millions of fowls
raised in Taiwan.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 10 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) has approved a set of draft revisions to the existing rules
regarding short-term stays by mainland Chinese spouses and their
families, an MAC official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The set of draft adjustments put forward by the Ministry of the
Interior were approved by the MAC during a Monday meeting, Vice
Chairman Johnnason Liu said, adding that the changes will provide a
more efficient mechanism by which the authorities can better handle
immigration, entry and departure by people from mainland China amid
growing exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, the major revisions approved by the MAC are as
follows:</P>
      <P>-- Mainland Chinese spouses are allowed to be reunited with their
Taiwan husbands or wives in Taiwan after being screened by Bureau of
Immigration officials;</P>
      <P>-- parents of mainland spouses who have already acquired
residence permits are permitted to visit Taiwan if their children
suffer a serious disease or major injury that threatens their lives
here;</P>
      <P>-- police must fully protect the interests of mainland spouses
who fall victim to domestic violence in Taiwan if they have already
receive a protection order issued by a domestic court;</P>
      <P>-- mainland spouses of foreign nationals who work in Taiwan will
be issued with multiple entry visas to facilitate their entry and
departure, but will still be required to interviewed by immigration
officials;</P>
      <P>-- mainland spouses with records of overstaying their visas in
Taiwan will not be allowed to re-enter Taiwan for a longer period of
time and will face heavier punishments; and</P>
      <P>-- crew members from mainland China working aboard foreign ships
will be permitted to stay in Taiwan with transit permission -- the
same treatment granted to their fellow countrymen employed by
aircraft of foreign nationalities.</P>

      <P>The Central Election Commission will
organize 10 public debates on the two issues to be put to a
referendum on March 20, according to a decision made by the
commission on Monday.</P>
      <P>The debates, five for each of the two issues, will pit the
Executive Yuan, which is charged with the implementation of the
referendum, against opposition groups in the Legislative Yuan, or
civil groups that oppose the ideas of the Executive Yuan. In case
there are no such groups, the debates will be changed into a
presentation of the opinions of the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan claimed earlier Monday that it will respect
whatever decision is made by the election commission on the debate as
long as it won't postpone the March 20 vote.</P>
      <P>The election commission also backed the Executive Yuan's decision
to distribute to voters the ballots for the referendum, with one for
each question, along with the ballots for the presidential election
on election day. Even if the ballots are dropped into the wrong box,
they will be counted as valid.</P>
      <P>The two questions to be asked in the referendum are:</P>
      <P>-- "The people of Taiwan demand that the Taiwan Strait issue be
resolved through peaceful means. Should mainland China refuse to
withdraw the missiles it has targeted at Taiwan and openly renounce
the use of force against us, would you agree that the government
should acquire more advanced anti-missile weapons to strengthen
Taiwan's self-defense capabilities?"</P>

negotiation with mainland China on the establishment of a peace and
stability framework for cross-strait interactions in order to build
consensus and for the welfare of the peoples of both sides?"</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXTRA POLICE TO BE DEPLOYED WHEN TAIWANESE-BRAZILIAN BOY LEAVES TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More police will be deployed to Kaohsiung's
international airport when a Taiwanese-Brazilian boy at the center of
an international custody battle embarks on his long journey back to
his legal guardian in Brazil Wednesday, Kaohsiung aviation police
said.</P>
      <P>Nine-year-old Iruan Wu Ergui will be accompanied by Brazil's
representative to Taiwan Paulo A. Pereira Pinto, who has been
appointed by the boy's grandmother, Rosa Leocadia da Silva Ergui, to
bring the boy home. They will board a China Airlines flight Wednesday
afternoon from Kaohsiung to Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Police said that they are expecting a lot of media reporters as
well as the boy's Taiwan family members and friends to show up at the
airport to see the boy off, so that they are deploying more police
force to maintain order.</P>
      <P>The boy and the Brazilian representative will take the 12:50 p.m.
China Airlines to fly to Hong Kong first, and transfer to a South
African Airlines flight to Johannesburg. They will then take a
Brazilian Airlines flight to San Paulo Friday morning Taiwan time,
and then take a domestic flight to the boy's grandmother's home at
Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul.</P>
      <P>China Airlines officials said that they have not received any
instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or requests from
the Brazilian side regarding giving the boy any special treatment.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the China Airlines flight is a regular
one, and there will be more than 200 passengers on board Wednesday,
most of whom are Taiwanese businessmen operating on mainland China.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung District Court had asked Wu Huo-yen, the uncle of Iruan
Wu Ergui, who is known in Taiwan by his Chinese name of Wu Yi-hua, to
turn over the boy Monday. But as the uncle refused to cooperate,
police were mobilized in the afternoon to carry out the task. In the
ensuing clashes between police and Wu's family members and friends,
the boy became intermittently distraught and confused.</P>
      <P>Only after long hours of negotiation did the boy's uncle finally
sign the document turning over the child to the Brazilian
representative, ending the boy's nearly three years of living in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Iruan Wu Ergui was born out of wedlock to a Brazilian mother and
a Taiwanese father, Wu Teng-shu, in 1995 in Brazil.</P>
      <P>The mother died in 1998 and the child's grandmother was named as
the boy's guardian with Wu Teng-shu's approval.</P>
      <P>Wu took the boy back to his hometown of Chieting in Kaohsiung
County on March 15, 2001, for a short visit, but he died unexpectedly
March 29.</P>
      <P>The boy's uncle then decided to take the boy and refused to let
him go, saying that his older brother had asked him to take care of
the boy, who is now a second-grader of Chieting Elementary School.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the boy's grandmother filed a lawsuit for the custody
of the boy, and Taiwan's supreme court ruled late last year to return
the boy to his rightful guardian.</P>

      <P>According to Chiang, public response to the special tourist
charter flights has been warm, as the number of applicants wishing to

      <P>The keen response is an indication that the airport will be
highly welcomed by residents living in central Taiwan, as it will

      <P>Support for the proposed referendum

cross-strait relations in a peaceful manner, Vice President Annette
Lu said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The vice president made the comments while attending an activity
in Taoyuan honoring Lu's ancestors.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progress Party (DPP) government has decided
to hold a referendum on the day of the presidential election set for
March 20.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that mainland China's missiles aimed at Taiwan will
increase from the current nearly 500 to 650 by 2005, Lu called for
the public to pay more attention to the issue by urging them to
support the March 20 referendum called by President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Chen announced Jan. 16 in a pre-taped TV broadcast to the nation
that he would ask the people to decide in the forthcoming referendum
whether Taiwan should further strengthen its missile defense
capabilities and whether it should try to work out a mechanism of

      <P>For Beijing to understand the feeling of the people of Taiwan and

support the referendum, the vice president said, adding that Beijing
might consider that the people of Taiwan do not support their nation
if the referendum fails, and such a failure would endanger Taiwan's
security and interests.</P>
      <P>Lu also said a peaceful cross-strait relationship can only be
achieved with a second term for herself and the president, as well as
the support of the people for the referendum.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lu warned that Taiwan business people in mainland

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Routine military exercises and drills on
the frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu this year will be held as
scheduled, Ministry of National Defense spokesman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Maj. Gen. Huang Shey-sheng said at a news conference that the
idea of establishing "demilitarized zones" across the Taiwan Strait
as recently advocated by President Chen Shui-bian is "only an idea"
that needs detailed planning and support before being put into
practice.</P>
      <P>Noting that such demilitarized zones do not yet exist, Huang said
scheduled war games on Kinmen and Matsu will not be affected by the
president's idea and will be held as scheduled.</P>
      <P>In his first news conference with members of the media from home
and abroad this year held Feb. 3, President Chen said that to avoid
military conflicts, demilitarized zones should be established across
the Taiwan Strait, including the removal of combat personnel,
equipment and deployed missiles, to create a "buffer zone in terms of
time and space."</P>
      <P>President Chen also called for the signing of a cross Taiwan
Strait "peaceful interaction" accord and appealed for a prohibition
on the use of military and economic blockades. He also advocated
having representatives from both sides stationed in each other's
capital cities to facilitate negotiations.</P>
      <P>Seconding Huang's remarks, Maj. Gen. Wang Kuo-chiang, a defense
ministry official in charge of combat training affairs, said that
there must be training drills so long as the nation maintains a
military and such exercises scheduled to be held on outlying islands
should not be scrapped.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Pakistani leader
suspected moves by atomic expert.

President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan acknowledged for the first
time on Monday that he had suspected for at least three years that
Pakistan's top nuclear scientist was sharing nuclear technology with
other countries, but argued that the United States had not given him
convincing proof.

In an hourlong interview conducted here in English, General
Musharraf shared blame for the delay with Washington, saying it was
not until October that American officials provided evidence of the
activities of the scientist, Abdul Qadeer Khan.

    <HEADLINE>U.S. NOT OPPOSED TO REFERENDUM: DPP LEGISLATOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States is not opposed to
Taiwan's planned referendum on March 20, although it will continue to
observe what Taiwan does after the nationwide vote, a legislator of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Tuesday upon
returning from a trip to the United States.</P>
      <P>Legislator Parris Chang held a press conference on the results of
his U.S. mission, undertaken with members of the Legislature's
Foreign Affairs Committee, to better understand the sentiments of
U.S. officials regarding the upcoming referendum in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang said that recent remarks by Republic of China
representative to the U.S. Chen Chien-jen to the Legislative Yuan had
been misreported by Taiwan media. Reports had said that Chen had said
that relations with the United States were in unprecedentedly bad
shape, when in fact what he only said that relations were
"unprecedented." Chang said that no U.S. officials he spoke with felt
that relations were in bad shape.</P>
      <P>'The U.S. did have some questions about Taiwan's referendum at
first, although the overall relationship is good," Chang said. "After
weeks of bilateral communications and the announcement of the
questions to be on the referendum, the U.S. response has been very
positive," he added.</P>
      <P>The U.S. feels that the referendum is an internal affair for
Taiwan, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the United States is concerned about the
referendum mainly because it will surely have to intervene if
mainland China uses forces against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also criticized the "pan-blue alliance" for claiming that the
United States will punish Taiwan for holding the referendum, asking
why the United States would oppose the referendum.</P>
      <P>He said that the U.S. is concerned about Taiwan's referendum, but
believes that it is a democratic country and will decide by itself
what to do.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. will continue to observe Taiwan, listen to what it says
and observe its deeds and will not oppose the referendum, " Chang
said.</P>
      <P>He said that what the United States cares about is not the two
questions on the referendum, but what President Chen will do after
winning re-election, including whether his inaugural speech will
continue to mention the "four noes plus one" -- which include no
referendum regarding the nation's future status as to whether to
declare independence or unification with mainland China -- and the
writing of a new constitution.</P>
      <P>After President Chen wins re-election, he will continue to
communicate with the United States, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, other legislators, including John Chang and Sun
Kuo-hua of the Kuomintang, who went with Chang to call on U.S. State
Department officials, congressmen and scholars in the United States,
said that the United States still is seriously concerned about
Taiwan's planned referendum, and has not accepted or endorsed the
referendum.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Thanks to abundant rainfall over the
weekend, the Taipei City Government suspended imposing second-phase
water restrictions in the greater Taipei area Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A city government spokesman said the second-phase water
restrictions in areas that rely on the Taipei Water Department for
water would be suspended immediately.</P>
      <P>"The decision was made on the fact that the water level at the
Feitsui Reservoir has rebounded to 160 meters, " the spokesman said,
adding that water supply for household consumption will not be a
problem until May when northern Taiwan will enter its "plum rains"
monsoon season.</P>
      <P>The second-phase water restrictions have been in place in five
northern Taiwan cities and counties since Feb. 6, mainly targeting
large-volume water consumers, such as car washes, saunas, spas,
swimming pools and manufacturing firms. The measures include cutting
water supply to these users by 5 percent to 20 percent.</P>
      <P>The suspension of second-phase water restrictions will be valid
for Taipei City and most parts of Taipei County, while the
restrictions will remain in place in Taoyuan County, Hsinchu City and
Hsinchu County as reservoirs in the three districts didn't receive as
much rainfall as the Feitsui Reservoir over the past week.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian decorated
Paraguayan Vice President Luis Alberto Castiglioni Tuesday with one
of the nation's highest commendations in recognition of Castiglioni's
contribution toward cementing bilateral ties between the Republic of
China and Paraguay.</P>
      <P>In a ceremony held at the Presidential Office, Chen conferred the
Order of Propitious Cloud with Grand Cordon on Castiglioni in
recognition of the Paraguayan vice president's efforts that have
helped accelerate friendly and reciprocal exchanges between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>On hand to witness the event were Vice President Annette Lu, as
well as Castiglioni's wife, Paraguayan Finance Minister Dinoisio
Borda, Paraguayan Ambassador to the ROC Ramon Antero Diaz Pereira and
ROC Foreign Affairs Minister Eugene Chien.</P>
      <P>During the ceremony, Chen offered his congratulations again to
Paraguayan President Oscar Nicanor Duarte and Castiglioni for winning
the 2003 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chen also asked Castiglioni to relay his appreciation to
President Duarte for boldly speaking out in support of the Republic
of China in the U.N. Assembly.</P>
      <P>For his part, Catiglioni said that since President Duarte took
office, he has mapped out useful and resourceful policies on domestic
affairs as well as foreign relations, including continued support for
Taiwan in its bid to join the United Nations and other international
organizations.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Paraguayan government and people, Castiglioni
expressed his support for Taiwan's holding of a referendum next month
on the issue of Beijing's deployment of missiles aimed at Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Referendums -- which are a basic right of the people and in line
with democratic values -- should by no means be restricted because of
external suppression or military intimidation," Castiglioni said.</P>
      <P>Castiglioni also expressed his gratitude to the ROC government
for its assistance to Paraguay in many areas, as well as his
admiration for Taiwan for its accelerated democratization and
economic prosperity.</P>
      <P>The Paraguayan vice president, at the head of a 10-member
entourage, arrived in Taipei Monday for a six-day official visit.
During the visit, Castiglioni and his party will meet with officials
from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Government Information
Office and the Central Election Commission. He will also tour a
high-technology industrial park in northern Taiwan and the Taroko
Gorge National Park in eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ROC government has donated funds to help Paraguay, the ROC's
only diplomatic ally in South America, to build a new barracks for
its national cavalry police corps and to upgrade its crime-fighting
equipment and facilities.</P>
      <P>Both Paraguayan President Duarte and Vice President Castiglioni
attended a ceremony last Thursday marking the inauguration of the new
police barracks located in the Paraguayan capital of Asuncion.</P>
      <P>In addition to financially supporting the construction of the new

    <TEXT>
      <P>No riots surrounding the March 20
referendum will take place unless someone incites them for their own
political reasons, Premier Yu Shyi-kun said in Hsinchu City, northern
Taiwan Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to allay public concerns about the referendum
called by President Chen Shui-bian, Yu said Taiwan people are used to
elections after having taken part in many of them over the last five
decades. It is impossible that the referendum, which would be the
first national one, might result in riots unless some people
instigate them deliberately.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in response to critics' claims that the
Referendum, which is to take place along with the presidential
election on March 20, has not been properly prepared and might lead
to chaos, even riots.</P>
      <P>In a Cabinet meeting earlier in the day, the premier warned
opposition parties that have questioned the legal basis for the
referendum not to try to disrupt the referendum by obstructing it.</P>
      <P>The premier said at the Cabinet meeting in Taipei that the
country has successfully carried out multiple elections at the same
time before, the last time in 1989 when residents went to the polls
to elect lawmakers, deputies to the Taiwan Provincial Council and to
their own county councils.</P>
      <P>In those elections, ballots for difference elections were given
to voters at the same time, and the results were tallied before
midnight after the election stations were closed, said the premier.</P>
      <P>If multiple elections could be held before, there is no reason
why the upcoming referendum can't be held simultaneously with the
presidential election, the premier said.</P>
      <P>The spokesman for the Executive Yuan, Lin Chia-lung, also
dismissed the possibility of rioting as "sensational claims"
concocted with the aim to scare the people.</P>
      <P>He reiterated his claim Tuesday that the results of the
presidential election as well as the referendum will be known before
9:30 p.m. on March 20.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a Kuomintang whip at the Legislative Yuan, Liao
Feng-teh, said Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers will make a motion to urge
the Executive Yuan to consider ballots cast in the wrong boxes
invalid.</P>
      <P>Liao said it will save time in counting the votes in the
presidential election and avoid the results of the presidential
election having to be reversed by ballots found in boxes not intended
for them, which might cast into doubt the results of the election.</P>
      <P>He blamed the Executive Yuan and the DPP for disregarding the
warnings of the KMT as absurd that riots might be prompted by the
ill-thought out voting procedures and by suggesting that the KMT has
a political axe to grind in raising the alarm.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has no plans to stop poultry imports
from the United States and it is holding talks with 14 countries and
areas in the hope of seeking their permission to allow in Taiwan
poultry again, Council of Agriculture (COA) Vice Chairman Hu
Fu-hsiung said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The COA has no plans to ban U.S. poultry imports at present
because the H7 bird flu virus discovered in that country is less
virulent, similar to the H5N2 virus found in Taiwan which causes no
danger to human lives, Hu said.</P>
      <P>Hu, however, pointed out that 14 countries and areas have banned
poultry shipments from Taiwan, despite the fact that the island
remains free from the virulent H5N1 virus bird flu.</P>
      <P>Hu added that COA officials have launched negotiations with those
countries and areas in an effort to persuade them to re-open their
markets for Taiwan's poultry products on the grounds that Taiwan
chicken raisers have received many orders from Hong Kong buyers and
other countries at a time when their countries are troubled by the
virulent H5N1 avian flu.</P>
      <P>According to the COA vice chairman, the 14 countries and areas
are Japan, Hong Kong, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Switzerland, Brazil, Paraguay, the Czech
Republic, Poland and Iran.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOME 100 CASES OF ABUSE OF ELDERLY REPORTED IN SINGAPORE EACH YEAR</HEADLINE>

(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>About 100 cases of abuse of the elderly
are reported to the Ministry of Community Development and Sports in
Singapore every year.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a conference on preventing abuse of the elderly
Tuesday, Minister of State for Community Development and Sports
Chan Soo Sen pointed out that the government thinks the actual figure
may be higher as many cases are probably not reported.</P>
      <P>He said abuse of the elderly is a sensitive issue that not many
people want to talk about, adding that many people perceive it as an
internal family matter.</P>
      <P>Many cases only come to light when social service workers conduct
unrelated checks, such as those concerning financial assistance for
the elderly, he noted.</P>
      <P>Most victims are over 80-years-old, and their abusers are often
relatives or caregivers.</P>
      <P>Sen urged parents to set a good example for their children by
treating their elders well, as "nothing escapes their watchful eyes".</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT COOPERATION ON DISEASE PREVENTION IS POSSIBLE: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 11 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cross-Taiwan Strait cooperation on disease
prevention can be done through international exchanges in the region,
an official of the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>COA Vice Chairman Hu Fu-hsiung made the remarks in response to an
appeal made by a mainland Chinese official for concerted efforts from
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to contain the spread of avian flu
that has affected 10 countries and areas in Asia.</P>
      <P>Zhang Mingqing, spokesman for Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office,
said at a regular news conference that at a time when virulent bird
flu has been found in both Taiwan and the mainland, the two sides
should step up cooperation to stop the spread of the disease.</P>
      <P>International cooperation is very important to disease prevention
and control, particularly in containing the spread of the virulent
H5N1 strain of bird flu virus which has affected many Asian nations,
including the mainland, Hu said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should not feel free from the threat of the virus even
though only the non-lethal strain -- H5N2 -- has been found in
Taiwan, he noted.</P>
      <P>The government has been trying to prevent the H5N1 strain from
spreading to Taiwan by increasing surveillance and cracking down on
smuggling from the mainland, in addition to other quarantine
measures, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HONG KONGERS BECOMING DISSATISFIED WITH BEIJING RULE: MAC REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's strong interference in Hong
Kong's political affairs has created resentment among Hong Kong
people against its rule, a report issued Wednesday by the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) showed.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of public opinion surveys conducted by two
universities based in Hong Kong, the MAC said in the report that
Beijing's hard-line position toward the political system and
development in the former British colony has provoked dissatisfaction
among Hong Kong residents. A small number of local people do,
however, express satisfaction with Beijing's policy in Hong Kong, it
added.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC, the core issue is Beijing's tough stance
with regard to Hong Kong people's desire for a direct vote to elect a
chief executive and members of the Legislative Council of the
special administrative region starting from 2007.</P>
      <P>In the face of increased public calls for greater political
reform and an enhanced democratic progress, incumbent Chief Executive
Tung Chee Hwa has replied that the Hong Kong government will first
set up a special panel to consult Beijing before making a move so as
to gain an understanding of Hong Kong people's views.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Beijing's high-profile response and moves aimed
at underscoring its sovereignty over the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) , such as turning a blind eye to grave
international concerns over Hong Kong's political development, have
pushed many Hong Kong people to air their discontentment.</P>
      <P>Results of the two recent surveys have demonstrated that the
number of Hong Kong people satisfied with Beijing's policy has
dropped, the MAC said.</P>
      <P>The MAC pointed out that this is an important development worth
more attention from the Taiwan authorities and the international
community, as it indicates that Beijing's strong meddling in Hong
Kong political affairs will have a negative impact on interactions
between the HKSAR and Beijing.</P>
      <P>The MAC is Taiwan's top government agency in charge of
policy-planning toward mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO STEP UP MOVES TO COMBAT AVIAN FLU: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun instructed relevant
government agencies Wednesday to step up preventive measures to avert
an invasion of the virulent H5N1 strain of avian flu into Taiwan from
neighboring countries.</P>
      <P>To achieve this aim, culls must be fully carried out at all
affected poultry farms and all preventive measures, such as
vaccinations, surveillance and care, must be further enhanced to keep
Taiwan free from the H5N1 virus, Yu said.</P>
      <P>The premier gave the instruction at a weekly Cabinet meeting in
which officials from the Council of Agriculture (COA) and the
Department of Health (DOH) reported on their mission to combat the
spread of bird flu caused by the less virulent H5N2 virus strain
among domestic poultry farms.</P>
      <P>According to COA officials, the H5N2 virus has been found on
poultry farms in southern Tainan and Chiayi counties and in central
Changhua, Nantou and Yunlin counties, as well as in northern Miaoli
and Taoyuan counties.</P>
      <P>All chickens and ducks on these poultry farms were culled and
those farms must undergo a four-month disinfection program and be
subject to testing to ensure that they are totally safe before they
will be given permission to resume operations, the COA officials
reported, adding that they have also strengthened monitoring,
checkups and quarantine control in cooperation with immigration and
customs authorities.</P>
      <P>According to DOH officials, exchanges of bird flu virus data with
the various agricultural authorities have already been started and
inoculations have begun on local poultry farms.</P>
      <P>About 10 countries and areas in Asia have reported H5N1 bird flu
cases, including Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia,
mainland China and Hong Kong. The H5N2 virus found in Taiwan causes
no immediate risk to human lives, as long as poultry and eggs are
well cooked.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWANESE-BRAZILIAN BOY GOES HOME AT LAST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  11  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Blessed by many well wishers, a
Taiwanese-Brazilian boy at the center of a bitter three-year
international custody battle left Taiwan Wednesday for the long
journey home to his legal guardian -- his grandmother in Brazil.</P>
      <P>Wu Huo-yen, the uncle of nine-year-old Iruan Wu Ergui -- who is
better known in Taiwan by his Chinese name Wu Yi-hua -- as well as
members of Wu's family, went to Kaohsiung's Hsiaokang International
Airport to bid the boy farewell after keeping him in Taiwan for
nearly three years.</P>
      <P>Despite extra aviation police deployed to maintain order, the Wu
family and friends, as well as a multitude of reporters, caused chaos
and pandemonium at the departure scene.</P>
      <P>Wu, who had kept Iruan at his home in Kaohsiung County's Chieting
township since Iruan's father -- Wu's older brother -- died
unexpectedly in March 2001, could not hide his sadness and sense of
loss when he gave his sincere blessing to the boy.</P>
      <P>Wu, who had refused to return the boy until the last moment, said
tearfully earlier that he felt sorry for the child as well as his
deceased brother, to whom he claimed to have promised on his deathbed
that he would take care of the boy.</P>
      <P>China Airlines (CAL) officials presented a model of one of their
planes to the boy to bid him godspeed at the boarding gate, but when
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials tried to present a
digital camera to the boy so that he could e-mail pictures back to
Taiwan, the Wus refused to allow Iruan to have it, to show their
displeasure at the MOFA for not being allowed to keep the boy.</P>
      <P>Iruan took a 12: 50 p.m. CAL flight to Hong Kong, where he
transferred to a South African Airlines flight to Johannesburg before
taking a Brazilian airline flight to Sao Paulo Friday morning Taipei
time. He will then take a Brazilian domestic flight to his
grandmother's home at Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul.</P>
      <P>Iruan left accompanied by his aunt, a lawyer, Brazil's
representative to Taiwan Paulo A. Pereira Pinto, an assistant to
Legislator Lin Yi-shih of the opposition Kuomintang, a Brazilian
Taiwanese, and an official of the Taiwan Catholic Mission Foundation.</P>
      <P>Liao Hsiu-shan, acting executive director of the Taiwan Catholic
Mission Foundation, said that the journey to Brazil will take about
44 hours, and that the foundation will sponsor all the travel
expenses of the people accompanying Iruan.</P>
      <P>The MOFA will assist at all transit stops along the way, Liao
said, adding that he hopes this will help mend fences over the bitter
custody battle between the boy's grandmother and uncle, as well as
promoting the friendship between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Pereira, on behalf of the Brazilian government, thanked the
Taiwan District Court for its efforts in implementing the boy's
return and said there are no complaints about the procedure.</P>
      <P>Wu was ordered by the Kaohsiung District Court to turn over the
boy Monday, but as he refused to cooperate, the court sent extra
police to carry out the task. Pictures of a distraught and crying
Iruan, jammed between policemen, reporters and Wu's family members to
obstruct the officials, touched hearts and sparked anger in Taiwan
when broadcast live on television.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the MOFA has promised that it will help the boy to
return to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The boy's aunt and a lawyer will discuss with Iruan's
grandmother, Rosa Leocadia da Silva Ergui, Iruan's future
communications with Taiwan, as well as the possibility of his
visiting the Wus, according to Wu.</P>
      <P>Iruan was born out of wedlock to a Brazilian mother and a
Taiwanese father, Wu Teng-shu, in 1995 in Brazil.</P>
      <P>The mother died in 1998 and the child's grandmother was named as
the boy's guardian with Wu Teng-shu's approval.</P>
      <P>Wu took the boy back for a short visit to his hometown of Chieting
on March 15, 2001, but he died unexpectedly March 29.</P>
      <P>The boy's uncle then decided to take the boy and refused to let
him go. Iruan went to the Chieting Primary School, where he reached
second grade.</P>
      <P>The boy's grandmother filed a lawsuit to regain custody of the
boy, and Taiwan's supreme court ruled late last year that Iruan
should return to his rightful guardian.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLARS URGE TAIWAN BUSINESSES NOT TO SPECULATE ON RENMINBI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite widespread market speculation that
mainland China's currency is set to appreciate soon in the face of an
increasingly weaker U.S. dollar, Taiwan businesses should be wary
over the possible impact of this rather than speculate on the
renminbi, local scholars warned Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Kao Chang, a professor at National Dong Hwa University, called on
Taiwan-based companies to refrain from speculating on the value of
the renminbi because the possibility of its appreciation remains
unclear in the short term.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the mainland currency has come under strong
market pressure to gain in value mainly due to a continued
depreciating greenback, Kao said it is hard to forecast at present
whether or not it actually will appreciate in the near future.</P>
      <P>The situation will become clearer in March or April, when the
mainland's central bank reassesses the renminbi's value at its
regular quarterly meeting, according to Kao.</P>
      <P>The only thing which seems clear for the time being is that the
renminbi will appreciate gradually in order to avoid a negative
impact on the mainland's economy, he added, pointing out that on the
other hand, businesses based in Taiwan should also pay greater heed
to the possible benefits or disadvantages brought about by an
appreciating renminbi.</P>
      <P>On the plus side, he went on, a stronger renminbi will promote
greater capital flight from the mainland, leading to more and more
economic, financial, investment and tourism exchanges with Taiwan,
Kao said.</P>
      <P>Although this might not benefit mainland-headquartered Taiwan
companies dedicated to the export business, he explained that they
will be in turn compensated if their production materials are
imported from other countries.</P>
      <P>On the negative side, the new Taiwan dollar will also face
mounting pressure to appreciate if renminbi gains in value, he added.
He warned Taiwan businesses not to hold excessive amounts of renminbi
for profiteering, as the mainland still heavily restricts exchanges
of foreign currencies and deals harshly with black market dealing and
speculation.</P>
      <P>Sun Ming-teh, an assistant researcher at the Taiwan Institute of
Economic Research cited mainland officials as saying that the
question of the renminbi's appreciation will depend on the mainland's
economic situation.</P>
      <P>Under the present circumstances, there is little reason to
believe that the renminbi will appreciate in the near term, as the
mainland's exports are expected to slow this year compared to its
performance last year, Sun explained.</P>
      <P>Should the mainland bow to pressure from the United States to
allow its currency to go up in value, this will also create an impact
on other Asian countries, including Taiwan, he claimed.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that industrial levels in Taiwan and mainland
China remain imbalanced, it is very likely that Taiwan industries
will also be adversely affected by an appreciating renminbi before
they realize any benefits, he forecast.</P>

    <DATELINE>Chiang Rai,  northern Thailand,  Feb. 11 (CNA)
(By Francis Kuo &amp; Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some residents in
northern Thailand areas bordering Burma have sought a "second spring"
in business by shifting from cultivating opium poppies to growing
Taiwan tea.</P>
      <P>The Golden Triangle, notorious as a stronghold of opium
production, is now also covered by labyrinth of tea plantations that
represent a new cash cow for the northern Thai residents, many of
whom are of Han Chinese descent.</P>
      <P>The locals are at present celebrating their tea harvest during
the World Tea Festival of Feb. 6-15 in Chiang Rai, which is sponsored
by Thailand's Ministry of Agricultural Cooperation.</P>
      <P>Native groups from neighboring mainland China, Laos and Burma, as
well as Thailand, have put their tea harvests and products up for
display and sale, backed by performances of folk dances and singing
each night of the festival.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of the World Tea Festival, Minister of
Agricultural Cooperation Somsak Thepsutin said that there are
approximately 38,400 acres of tea plantations around Thailand. Of
this total, about half, or 18,000 acres, are centered around Chiang
Rai Province.</P>
      <P>Of all the tea production in Chiang Rai, the best species and
production are oolong tea originating from Taiwan, Somsak said,
adding that the quality and flavor of Chiang Rai oolong is about to
catch up with that produced in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Currently, five villages in Chiang Rai are concentrating on tea
production and export, sending their produce to the United States,
Europe and Taiwan, Somsak said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Huan-tang, a tea grower and merchant from
Taipei who has been invited by the Chiang Rai authorities to be one
of the judges at a tea-tasting competition at the festival, the
oolong tea from Thailand is fast catching up with the oolong from
Taiwan. "Taiwan oolong will face cut-throat competition in world
markets before long, " Chen predicted.</P>
      <P>Lai Jen-fang, secretary-general of the Taiwan Tea Producers
Association, who is another judge at the festival, said that once tea
drinking becomes a major habit in Thailand, tea products from Taiwan
will find a good business niche in the Southeast Asian country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN WARNS BEIJING AGAINST INTERFERING WITH TAIWAN ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  11 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan
warned Beijing Wednesday against interfering with Taiwan's
presidential election slated for March 20.</P>
      <P>Lien called for the Beijing authorities to refrain from tampering
with the election, saying that previous such moves show that Beijing
gained nothing after mounting military threats toward Taiwan in the
run-up to major elections.</P>
      <P>Noting that the election is a time for the Taiwan people to
demonstrate their democratic power in a sovereign state, Lien said
the last thing he wants to see is tampering on the part of Beijing.</P>
      <P>Past experience shows that after Beijing launched military
threats toward Taiwan, including firing missiles and holding
live-ammunition war games in the Taiwan Strait in the run-up to
previous presidential elections, Taiwan voters were angered rather
than intimidated by Beijing's scheming to alter the election results,
Lien noted.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks during a ceremony to mark the establishment
of a national headquarters for supporters of the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" presidential ticket of Lien and People First Party Chairman
James Soong.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lien appealed to his rival, President Chen Shui-bian,
who is seeking re-election, not to bring in an ill harvest by
accusing the Lien-Soong ticket of benefiting from support by the
Chinese communists and Taiwanese businessmen operating in mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Lien called for Chen not to stigmatize the "pan-blue alliance"
people as either criminals or communists.</P>
      <P>Quoting what he said were recent analyses by several foreign
media bodies, Lien claimed that Taiwan's voters have already made
their choices and predicted that there will be a new leadership in
Taiwan after March 20.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BUDGET FOR MARCH 20 REFERENDUM WILL EXCEED NT$300 MILLION: CEC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC)
confirmed Wednesday that the budget for Taiwan's first-ever
referendum on March 20 will be NT$300.88 million (US$9.09 million).</P>
      <P>As some cities and counties have complained that they cannot
begin preparatory work for the referendum, the CEC said that it has
asked the Executive Yuan to appropriate the money to finance the
referendum scheduled to coincide with the presidential election.</P>
      <P>After the Executive Yuan appropriates the money, the CEC will
immediately distribute it to local election commissions that will
then have to act according to the law and prepare for the referendum
on two questions -- whether Taiwan should enhance its anti-missile
capability and whether it should open talks with Beijing for
establishing a mechanism for cross-strait interaction.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MISERY INDEX UP SLIGHTLY IN 2003</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei City's misery index in 2003 was
slightly higher than the previous year and unemployment set a new
five-year high, according to the latest tallies released Wednesday by
the city government's Department of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DBAS).</P>
      <P>The misery index is defined by a combination of price increase
rates and employment rates, and an increase in both figures means
that the lives of average citizens are getting more difficult,
although DBAS officials said that the increase is small and that the
public might not feel acute pain.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that Taipei's misery index was 4.46 percent
in 2003, with a price index of negative 0.14 percent and an
unemployment level of 4.6 percent.</P>
      <P>They noted that unemployment has remained unchanged over the past
two years, although the price increase rose to negative 0.14 percent
in 2003 from negative 0.28 percent in 2002. The slight increase of
the 2003 misery index is a result of this increase.</P>
      <P>However, they observed that, buoyed by the global economic
recovery and the government's job stimulus project, the unemployment
situation is getting better.</P>
      <P>An analysis of the reasons for the unemployment shows that the
unemployment ratio of first-time job seekers to the total jobless
population dropped slightly. In comparison, the ratio of
non-first-time job seekers rose.</P>
      <P>The number of people put out of work as a result of closures or
downsizing increased to 24,000 in 2003, setting a new high since
1998, according to the DBAS figures.</P>

    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Feb. 11 (CNA)
(By Tseng Chun-liang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Beijing authorities called Wednesday
for concerted efforts from Taiwan and mainland China to contain the
spread of avian flu, which has affected 10 countries and areas in
Asia and has killed at least 19 people in Vietnam and Thailand.</P>
      <P>At a regular press conference, Zhang Mingqing, spokesman for
Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office, claimed that at a time when
"virulent" bird flu has been found in both Taiwan and on the
mainland, both sides should step up bilateral cooperation in efforts
to ward off the communicable disease.</P>
      <P>In fact, the virulent H5N1 strain of the disease that has
affected much of Asia, including the mainland, has not been found in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Zhang called for the establishment of a disease-reporting channel
across the Taiwan Strait. He also urged that the two sides to speed
up exchanges on bird flu prevention. Efforts would include early
holding of academic seminars or teleconferences that would pave the
way for cross-strait exchanges on medication, medical knowledge and
related vaccination materials on bird flu prevention and control.</P>
      <P>Zhang said that during a special meeting called by the State
Council Feb. 1, Beijing's leaders issued "precise" directives that
the mainland should step up cooperation with Taiwan, Hong Kong and
Macau on efforts to prevent and control virulent avian flu viruses.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO NEED TO AMEND THE TRA: STATE DEPT. OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Feb. 10 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior U.S. State Department official
said Tuesday that he sees no need to amend the Taiwan Relations Act
(TRA) since the current act is efficient, sufficient and practical.</P>
      <P>Randall G. Schriver, deputy assistant secretary of state for East
Asia affairs, made the comments in response to media questions
regarding a suggestion Monday by an assistant of a U.S. congressman
that some improvements should be made in the act's contents.</P>
      <P>An assistant of Rep. Henry J. Hyde, chairman of the U.S. House of
Representatives' Committee on International Relations, said that the
TRA was enacted 25 years ago and that there is a need to make the act
more efficient for the coming 25 years by making certain amendments.
Hyde was one of the key members of the U.S. Congress in pushing the
introduction of the act.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an assistant of Tom Lantos, vice chairman of the
committee, said that although the United States is committed to
helping in Taiwan's self-defense since this is part of the
obligations stated in the TRA, this commitment is not an open check
for the island to do whatever it wants to do.</P>
      <P>He also said that some U.S. congressmen are dissatisfied with
President George W. Bush's criticism of President Chen Shui-bian's
planned referendum expressed during mainland Chinese Premier Wen
Jiabao's visit to Washington, D.C., last month.</P>
      <P>Well-placed sources in Washington have said that assistants of
U.S. congressmen who are responsible for East Asian affairs gathered
Monday to discuss the Congress's concerns for 2004 and that some of
them consider that this April, which marks the TRA's 25th
anniversary, is the right time to review the act.</P>
      <P>Saying that he will express his opinion after listening to suggestion
of the congressmen's assistants, Schriver pointed out that he considers
the current TRA to be sufficient and practical and not in need of
amendments.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will donate 2,500 tons of rice to
help victims of a magnitude-6.7 earthquake that rocked the historic
Iranian city of Bam late last December, the Council of Agriculture
(COA) announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>The rice will be delivered to Iran in mid-February for
distribution to earthquake victims in Bam through the Buddhist
Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation -- Taiwan's largest charity
which has sent volunteers to assist in post-disaster relief work in
the southeastern Iranian city since early January, COA officials
said.</P>
      <P>The aid program is expected to meet the rice needs of more than
80,000 quake victims in Bam for the coming three months, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>"We also hope that the donation of rice can help boost friendship
between the Iranian and Taiwanese people and upgrade Taiwan's image
in the international arena," a COA food administrator said.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of formal diplomatic relations between the
two countries, the Republic of China government has donated
US$100,000 in post-quake relief aid to Iran, in addition to sending a
61-member rescue team to assist in relief operations immediately
after the Dec. 26 earthquake.</P>
      <P>The ROC Red Cross Society also collected 30 tons of relief goods,
including jackets, blankets, wool socks and wool hats, as well as
various types of winter garments, for Iranian quake victims. The
goods were delivered by a China Airlines cargo plan in early January.</P>

      <P>The Singapore government is planning to

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian hosted visiting
Kiribati President Anote Tong to a banquet of delicious Hakka dishes
Thursday at a resort villa in northern Hsinchu County.</P>
      <P>The state banquet, featuring Hakka food ranging from steamed fish
to wild herbs, was prepared with rare and fine products originating
from the nearby mountains.</P>
      <P>Thanking Tong for his visit to the Republic of China, Chen voiced
his hope that Kiribati will support Taiwan's efforts to take part in
international activities, including its bid to enter the United
Nations and the World Health Organization.</P>
      <P>Hsinchu County Magistrate Cheng Yung-chin said it is a great
honor for local residents that a state banquet could be held for a
second time in Hsinchu County, where the Hakka people form a sizeable
portion of the county's population.</P>
      <P>Traveling at the head of a delegation composed of various Cabinet
members, Tong and his wife arrived in Taiwan Feb. 10 for a five-day
visit.</P>
      <P>Tong was accorded a 21-gun military salute at the Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall in Taipei following his arrival. The Kiribati president
also met Vice President Annette Lu and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, as
well as other high-ranking government officials, during the welcoming
ceremony.</P>
      <P>It is Tong's first visit to the ROC since he assumed the

capacity as a ministerial-level official.</P>
      <P>The ROC and the world's largest coral reef nation in the South

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park
(HSIP) in northern Taiwan registered an annual business revenue of
NT$857.8 billion (about US$27 billion) for 2003, the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park Administration reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>The figure represents a 22 percent increase over the 2002 level,
according to the report issued by the administration.</P>
      <P>As of the end of last year, a total of 101,832 workers were
employed by the 370 companies based in the park --- Taiwan's
high-technology stronghold, the report shows. The two numbers reflect
rises of 10.4 percent and 3.2 percent, respectively, over their
year-earlier levels.</P>
      <P>In terms of annual growth rate registered by the six leading
hi-tech industries that form the backbone of the HSIP, the
opto-electronic industry posted the largest increase rate of 57
percent year-on-year, with business turnover worth NT$94.3 billion.</P>
      <P>Biotechnology came second with a growth rate of 30 percent,
contributing business valued at NT$1.84 billion, followed by the IC
industry with a 24 percent increase rate representing business worth
NT$564.5 billion.</P>
      <P>The computer and peripherals industry recorded the fourth-largest
growth rate of 11 percent, with business worth NT$134.8 billion. The
precision machinery industry ranked fifth, with a 7 percent increase
rate, notching up business worth NT$5.8 million, ahead of the
telecommunications industry.</P>
      <P>The six major industries chalked up a combined business volume of
NT$857.8 billion for 2003, with the figure expected to top NT$1.3
trillion in 2004 amid strong signs of an improved economy,
administration officials said.</P>
      <P>Per-capita production value averaged NT$8.43 million last year,
up by 23 percent compared to the 2002 level, the report indicates.</P>
      <P>The computer and peripherals industry posted the highest

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>United States Secretary of State Colin
Powell's remarks on Taiwan's referendum show that the United States
does not support, nor it is opposed to, the "peace referendum"
scheduled for March 20 alongside the presidential election, a
government spokesman said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Lin Chia-lung, made the remarks in
response to Powell's testifying at the House International Relations
Committee a day earlier, during which he said that "we don't really
see a need" for the referendum, but Taiwan is a democratic place, and
if they choose to have a referendum, they can have a referendum.</P>
      <P>Powell also said that he had urged the European Union not to lift
an embargo on arms sale to mainland China at a sensitive time when
the mainland still has many missiles targeting Taiwan and Taiwan is
scheduled to put to a referendum vote the question of increasing its
anti-missile capability.</P>
      <P>"This means that the U.S. does not want to say anything that will
affect Taiwan's presidential election," Lin said, adding that this is
Washington's long-standing position.</P>
      <P>"The government thanks the U.S. for respecting Taiwan's
democratic development, and not opposing its first nationwide
referendum," Lin said.</P>
      <P>"The government will continue to communicate with international
friends on the motive and purpose of promoting the peace referendum,"
Lin said, explaining that "the referendum will not have anything to
do with the nation's status regarding independence versus unification
with mainland China and that it will not seek to change the status
quo across the Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>Lin said that the world might have differing views on the
referendum, but from Taiwan's point of view, its sovereignty and
security are in clear and immediate danger, which is why the
government has decided to hold the national referendum according to
the recently passed Referendum Law.</P>
      <P>Lin also said that the government appreciates Powell's words on
the mainland's missile threat to Taiwan and his opposition to the
E.U.'s lifting of the arms embargo, which he said shows that "the
U.S. understands that a lifting of the arms embargo on China will
have a possible effect on the security and stability in the
Asia-Pacific region."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The transfer of European technology to
mainland China could encourage Beijing to invade Taiwan, Vice
President Annette Lu warned Thursday.</P>
      <P>Receiving the mayor of the Austrian city of Innsbruck, Hilde
Zach, at the Presidential Office, Lu told her guest that Beijing has
not only tried to isolate Taiwan diplomatically but also has been
increasing its military buildup against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Beijing has deployed around 500 missiles targeting Taiwan and the
number of missiles deployed is expected to increase to 650 next year,
Lu said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the European Union adopted a resolution to ban arms
sales to mainland China after the Tiananmen massacre of 1989, the
vice president said it is worrisome that the leaders of France and
Germany are reportedly seeking to lift the ban following years of
seduction by Beijing with commercial interests.</P>
      <P>She expressed concern that European advanced technology will be
transferred to the mainland, adding that if this is the case, it will
be helpful for Beijing's military buildup and therefore will
encourage it to invade Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is not a part of the People's Republic of China and has
maintained substantive relations with almost all countries around the
world, although most of them do not have diplomatic relations with
Taiwan, she went on.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has never ceased its efforts to participate in
international activities and has made great contributions to global
development even though it is denied by many international
organizations, she added.</P>
      <P>She described Beijing as a "real international terrorist" by
imposing a missile threat against Taiwan and preparing to invade
Taiwan at any time, adding that this is why President Chen Shui-bian
called a "peace referendum" for March 20 alongside the presidential
election.</P>
      <P>European nations should not join Beijing in opposing Taiwan's
planned referendum, she said.</P>
      <P>Zach arrived in Taipei Tuesday for a six-day visit at the
invitation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. She hopes to gain a
better understanding of Taiwan's development in the political,
economic, cultural and tourism fields.</P>

      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui said Thursday
that if he is subpoenaed by judicial authorities to testify in a case
regarding alleged misappropriation of national security funds during
his term in office, he will definitely be willing to attend the court
hearing.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks after the Taipei District Court confirmed
earlier in the day that it has decided to summon 16 witnesses,
including the former president, for questioning about the alleged
embezzlement of money from secret accounts of the National Security
Bureau (NSB) -- Taiwan's top intelligence agency -- during Lee's
presidency.</P>
      <P>The case centers on the alleged misappropriation of NT$250
million (US$7.5 million) from secret NSB accounts. Prosecutors
indicted two former NSB officials in connection with the case last
November.</P>
      <P>"I didn't do anything wrong. Why should I dodge a court subpoena
to testify as a witness in the investigation of the case? " Lee said
in response to a press inquiry.</P>
      <P>Huang Chun-ming, a Taipei District Court chief judge, said the
list of witnesses also includes former Minister of Foreign Affairs
Jason Hu, who is now mayor of Taichung City, as well as former Lee
associates, business leaders and retired security officials.</P>
      <P>A date for the former president's court appearance has not been

chairman.</P>
      <P>One of the defendants in the NSB case -- the former NSB chief
accountant, Hsu Ping-chiang -- has been detained and prosecutors are
asking for a 15-year prison sentence for him.</P>
      <P>The other suspect, former NSB chief cashier Liu Kuan-chun, fled

    <HEADLINE>MERGING DOMESTIC AIR CARRIER TREMENDOUS TASK: CAA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  12 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although merging the four air carriers
currently plying domestic routes will be a tremendous task, the
government has decided not to play a leadership role in the matter
but will remain on the sidelines, a government official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) Director-General Chang
Kuo-cheng made the remarks after calling a meeting with
representatives from the four aviation companies to discuss and
exchange opinions on the issue.</P>
      <P>Claiming that it will be enormously difficult to merge the four
carriers, Chang said the CAA has decided not to get involved in the
matter. The main purpose of the meeting was to gain an understanding
of the opinions of the carriers and the CAA has no concrete plans on
the matter, he noted.</P>
      <P>Mandarin Airlines General Manager Lo Ta-hsin, who is also
chairman of the Taipei Transport Aircraft Association, noted that all
four carriers -- Mandarin Airlines, Trans Asia Airways, UNI Airways
Corp. and Far East Air Transport Corp. (FEAT) -- are operating in the
red.</P>
      <P>Although Lo disclosed that all four companies share a common view
that a merger might be better for them, he acknowledged that the task
will be very difficult because of their varied business and market
strategies, not to mention the fact that their respective fleets are
composed of different types of planes -- the biggest problem
affecting the much-discussed merger.</P>
      <P>Rumors of a possible merger were circulating as far back as three
or four years ago but very little progress has been seen, despite the
fact that no strong opposition has arisen from those involved.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the four airlines remain sharply divided over
the question of which company should be the acquirer, Lo suggested
inviting foreign experts to help settle the issue in conjunction with
government assistance and incentives.</P>
      <P>FEAT General Manager Chen Mei-wen contended that the issue is far
too complex for the CAA to deal with. He opined that the best way to
achieve the merger would be for Mandarin Airlines and UNI Airways to
pull out of the market and join their respective parent companies --
China Airlines and EVA Airways Corporation -- which operate
international routes.</P>
      <P>Such a move would leave just two carriers to ply the domestic
routes, he argued.</P>
      <P>Representatives of FEAT and UNI Airways expressed reservations
about the merger plan.</P>
      <P>However, a UNI Airways official stressed that his company has
succeeded in trimming its losses in recent years by launching special
tourism packages and he predicted that the carrier should be able to
operate profitably in the near future.</P>
      <P>All four carriers have been increasingly troubled over the past
few years due to various key factors, such as the high-speed railway
system under construction -- completion of which is slated for next
year -- flight ticket price hikes and an improved road traffic
network.</P>
      <P>Last year, the domestic air traffic market was dealt a heavy blow
when the potentially deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome broke
out in spring, reversing previous optimistic prospects that Trans
Asia would register profits and leaving all four carriers operating
at a loss.</P>
      <P>UNI Airways recorded losses of more than NT$800 million (about
US$25 million) , followed by Mandarin Airlines with over NT$300
million in losses, FEAT with losses of NT$200 million and Trans Asia
at NT$70 million in the red.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The amount of contraband drugs seized by
law enforcement authorities in 2003 surged 200 percent compared with
the year before, the National Police Administration (NPA) reported
Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to NPA tallies, 2,339.86 kilograms of drugs were seized
in 2003, marking an increase of 1,559.98 kilograms, or 200 percent,
from the 779.88 kilograms found in 2002.</P>
      <P>NPA officials attributed the sharp rise mainly to the increase in
seized second- and third-grade drugs.</P>
      <P>In comparison, the amount of confiscated first-grade drugs, such
as heroin, cocaine, opium and morphine, declined from 442.65
kilograms in 2002 to 262.37 kilograms in 2003. Heroin seizures alone
decreased 176.14 kilograms.</P>
      <P>Seizures of second-grade drugs, such as amphetamines and MDMA,
zoomed from 288.16 kilograms in 2002 to 1,647.9 kilograms last year,
while third-grade drug seizures also jumped from 75.98 kilograms to
429.59 kilograms because of a substantial rise in ketamine seizures.</P>
      <P>The NPA statistics also showed that 25,491 drug trafficking cases
were uncovered last year, down 121 cases from that registered in
2002.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China representative to
the Philippines has urged Taiwan's largest charity -- the Buddhist
Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation -- to encourage retired Taiwan
elementary and high school teachers to teach abroad.</P>
      <P>Wu Hsin-hsing, a scholar-turned-diplomat, made the appeal during
a courtesy call at the Tzu Chi's branch office in Manila Wednesday
afternoon.</P>
      <P>To the best of his understanding, Wu said, Taiwan has many
retired elementary and high school teachers who are concurrently Tzu
Chi members.</P>
      <P>"As many Chinese schools in Southeast Asian countries face
a shortage of teaching staff, I hope Tzu Chi can help recruit
retired schoolteachers to teach in overseas Chinese schools," Wu
said. "I believe it's an effective way to help disseminate Chinese
cultural legacies and values."</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the Chinese community in the Philippines has
traditionally attached great importance to Chinese-language education
and has offered much support to Chinese schools in various parts of
the country.</P>
      <P>"There are now more than 140 Chinese schools in the Philippines,
with over 100,000 teachers and students," Wu said, adding that most
of them, particularly those in rural areas, face difficulties due to
ashortage of qualified teachers.</P>
      <P>Perhaps, Wu said, Tzu Chi can help resolve the issue by
recruiting its retired teachers-turned-volunteers to teach at Chinese
schools in the Philippines.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun vowed Friday not to
allow local governments to hold the referendum and the presidential
election separately, saying any official who dares to do this will be
putting their jobs on the line.</P>
      <P>Answering questions from an opposition People First Party
lawmaker, the premier said his administration won't allow a
referendum separate from the presidential election to be held even if
they are held on March 20 simultaneously.</P>
      <P>The premier said the Central Election Committee (CEC) has
accepted the Executive Yuan's idea of holding the two votes together
at the same time and place, although the ballots are to be cast into
different boxes. Officials who failed to follow the CEC's guidelines
in carrying out the referendum and the presidential election will be
called to account.</P>
      <P>Three additional workers will be needed at each polling station
and an extra NT$84 million will be needed because voters must pick
up their ballots for the referendum only after they have cast
ballots for the presidential election, as suggested by the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT), the premier said.</P>
      <P>The premier made the comments in the Legislative Yuan in
answering questions about news reports that two local governments are
contemplating holding the two votes at separate locations in light of
their different nature and their different qualifications for voters.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure the success of the first national referendum,
the Executive Yuan has laid down every detail for the implementation
of the vote and has left nothing to chance the premier added.</P>
      <P>As a valid referendum would require a turnout of more than 50
percent, the Executive Yuan has gone out of its way to turn the
voters out for the referendum and has insisted to have it held
piggyback with the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition, mainly the KMT and People First Party,
claimed the referendum is not based on legal grounds. They have gone
out their way to stop the referendum, or prevent it from boosting
President Chen Shui-bian's chance of wining a second term.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN TO EXPOUND ON HIS VISION FOR THE FUTURE IN LIVE TV DEBATE: AIDE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will expound on
his vision for the nation's future development as well as initiatives
for major policy issues in Saturday's televised debate with his
challenger Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan, an aide said Friday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lo Wen-jia, who concurrently serves as convener of a
task force in charge of preparations for Chen's two live TV debates
with Lien on Feb. 14 and Feb. 21, said Chen will adopt a "business as
usual" attitude toward the upcoming televised debate.</P>
      <P>"Chen will explain his vision and policy initiatives in a natural
and sincere manner," Lo said.</P>
      <P>While the March 20 presidential election will be the third of its
kind in Taiwan, it will be the first time that presidential
candidates will have conducted a live TV debate.</P>
      <P>In the previous two direct presidential elections in 1996 and
2000, candidates only conducted televised campaign forums organized
by the Central Election Commission (CEC) , in which hopefuls only
outlined their own policy platforms.</P>
      <P>Back in 2000, Lo recalled that Chen, a lawyer-turned-politician,
did not rehearse before the CEC-organized televised campaign forums.</P>
      <P>"So this time around, Chen has also not rehearsed before this
weekend's live TV debate," Lo said.</P>
      <P>It will mark the first-ever face-to-face debate between Chen and
Lien.</P>
      <P>The debate, organized by Public Television Service (PTS) , will
start at 2 p.m. In addition to PTS, nearly all other major domestic
TV and radio stations will broadcast the debate live.</P>
      <P>PTS Chairman Wu Feng-shan will chair the debate, while five
people will pose questions to the two contenders. The five are Huang
Kun-yen, a microbiologist who is now chairman of the Ministry of
Education's Medical Education Commission; Chu Ching-yi, an Academia
Sinica academician; Lin Ching-ping, chief executive of the private
Judicial Reform Promotion Association; Wang Jung-chang, spokesman for
the "pan-purple alliance, " which is dedicated to promoting fairness
and social justice; and Wang Yeh-li, a Tung Hai University political
science professor.</P>

      <P>The first of two televised debates between
the two presidential candidates will be broadcast simultaneously
Saturday in the Hakka language and in Mandarin.</P>
      <P>Channel 17 will provide simultaneous translation of the two-hour
debate between President Chen Shui-bian and Chairman Lien Chan of the
opposition Kuomintang Saturday afternoon between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. to
serve the Hakka community, who account for 20 percent of Taiwan's 23
million people.</P>
      <P>Yeh Chu-lan, chairman of the Council for Hakka Affairs, said that
prior to the establishment in July last year of the Hakka-language TV
channel that will air Taiwan's first-ever debate between presidential
candidates, non-Mandarin-speaking Hakka people were shut out of the
world of TV communication.</P>
      <P>Yeh noted that because of the government's Mandarin-speaking
campaign of the past, the Hakka language is fast disappearing and
among Hakka people between the ages of 13 and 29, only 36.3 percent
can still speak fluent Hakka, while the figure is only 11.7 percent
among those under 13.</P>
      <P>At the same time, however, there are many elderly Hakka people
who are unable to understand Mandarin, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>The situation made some initial improvement after the council
began promoting Hakka-related activities and launched the Hakka TV
channel, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Council officials said that the launch of the channel has enabled
younger Hakka people to learn more about the language and its
culture, while older members of the community can now enjoy
television in their own tongue, which they had not been able to do
previously.</P>
      <P>The channel has also enhanced the understanding among non-Hakka
people of the beauty of Hakka culture and has provided an opportunity
to learn the language, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The first simultaneous Hakka broadcast of the presidential

      <P>Production value of the Central Taiwan
Science-based Industrial Park in Taichung is expected to hit around
NT$120 billion (about US$3.6 billion) in 2006, fueled by ongoing
expansion as a result of the rebounding economy, park authorities
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Yang Wen-ker, a deputy director of the preparatory committee for
the park's development, said that the 153 hectares of available land
in the park's first-phase compound has been allocated following
robust demand from companies based there and that an expansion has
been mulled to meet further demand.</P>
      <P>For the time being, an additional 86 hectares of land in the
second-phase compound will become available in June for plant
construction, while efforts to court investment for land development
at its compound in Huwei, in neighboring Yunlin County, will also
kick off in the near future, as an environmental impact assessment
has recently gained approval, Yang said.</P>

      <P>The Central Taiwan Science-based Industrial Park will eventually
occupy a total of 430 hectares of land. Since its inception more than
a year ago, 38 companies -- mainly in the hi-tech sector -- have been
approved to open shop in the compound, channeling more than NT$430
billion in investment into the park.</P>
      <P>The output value of the park is expected to reach NT$120 billion
by 2006 after companies operating there start mass production, Yang
predicted.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the production value of the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park (HSIP) in northern Taiwan has been
estimated to top NT$1.3 trillion for 2004, based on the fact that its
business revenue amounted to NT$857.8 billion for 2003, up by 22
percent over its 2002 level.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENTS SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN CROSS-STRAIT DISEASE CONTROL: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said
Friday that government authorities should be involved in cross-Taiwan
Strait efforts to prevent and control communicable diseases, if such
bilateral efforts are undertaken.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Huang Chieh-cheng welcomed Friday Beijing's
calls two days earlier for cross-strait cooperation in efforts to
contain the spread of avian flu, but said that private groups would
find it difficult to implement any such efforts without government
assistance.</P>
      <P>Huang said that the MAC welcomes all efforts that contribute to
enhancing the welfare of the people of both sides of the Taiwan
Strait and called for the Beijing authorities to come to the
negotiating table for talks over bird flu prevention and control, as
well as any other health issue.</P>
      <P>Zhang Mingqing, spokesman for Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office,
said at a regular press conference Wednesday that Taiwan and mainland
China should make concerted efforts to contain the spread of avian
flu that has affected 10 countries and areas in Asia.</P>
      <P>Zhang said that at a time when the "virulent" form of bird flu
has been found in both Taiwan and on the mainland, both sides should
step up bilateral cooperation in efforts to ward off the communicable
disease.</P>
      <P>In fact, while the H5N1 strain of avian flu has been found on the
mainland, it has not been found in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Zhang called for the establishment of a disease-reporting channel
across the Taiwan Strait. He also urged that the two sides to speed
up exchanges on bird flu prevention. Efforts would include the
holding of academic seminars or teleconferences that would pave the
way for cross-strait exchanges on medication, medical knowledge and
related vaccination materials for bird flu prevention and control.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Huang also called for the Beijing authorities to save
themselves the effort of trying to tamper with Taiwan's presidential
election by constantly releasing reports on Taiwanese citizens being
arrested on the mainland for spying.</P>
      <P>The spate of reports of Taiwanese being arrested on charges of
collecting intelligence for the Taiwan authorities has led the MAC to
believe that Beijing is using this as a scheme to alter the process
and results of Taiwan's presidential election slated for March 20,
Huang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KINMEN AUTHORITIES CONVENE DISEASE-PREVENTION MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Feb.  13 (CNA)
(By K.Y. Ni and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kinmen county government convened a
disease-prevention meeting Friday aimed at strengthening the outlying
island's ability to ward off communicable diseases that could
threaten the health of either humans or animals.</P>
      <P>Presiding over the meeting, Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng
said that in the face of an escalating number of reported infections
of the virulent H5N1 avian flu virus in 10 Asian countries, Kinmen,
which is located some 24 kilometers off mainland China's coast and
relies heavily on imports for its daily necessities, will have to
step up food safety and animal quarantine checks.</P>
      <P>Although Kinmen has not reported any cases of the severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) that wreaked havoc in Asia, particularly
in Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China, last year and no avian flu
so far this year, this does not mean that those diseases will never
take Kinmen hostage, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The meeting decided that officials from the Kinmen bureaus of
health, education and social affairs should take turns to report on
health controls, particularly temperature-taking among
schoolchildren, to the Kinmen county government once each week.</P>
      <P>The meeting also decided that Yang Chun-jen, director of the
Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ)
under the Council of Agriculture, Kinmen Office, should report to the
county government once per week on efforts as regards bird flu
prevention and control.</P>
      <P>Separated from mainland China's Fujian Province by only a narrow
channel, Kinmen suffered a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak among its
cattle some five years ago. The disease is believed to have been
brought into Kinmen via livestock smuggled from the mainland.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 9 last year, six live red-faced ducks were caught by
Kinmen authorities on a beach in Hsiyuan in northeastern Kinmen
during an anti-smuggling operation, BAPHIQ officials said.</P>
      <P>The ducks, also believed to have been smuggled from the mainland,
were destroyed after BAPHIQ officials took samples from the animals
and discovered that the deadly H5N1 virus was present in one of the
six ducks, prompting the county government to announce Feb. 6 that
all imports of live poultry, frozen poultry and related products will
be controlled and screened during a nearly 11-month period beginning
that day as part of the local government's efforts to ward off a
spread of avian flu.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and other members of the G-10 Group
are actively seeking cooperation with other groups within the World
Trade Organization (WTO) to consolidate their common positions when the
Doha Round trade talks resume.</P>
      <P>The G-10 Group members are Taiwan, Bulgaria, Israel, Iceland,
Japan, Mauritius, Norway, Switzerland, South Korea and Liechtenstein.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the Doha Round of trade negotiations will be
resumed next month with agriculture to be a key topic of the discussions.</P>
      <P>According to sources close to Taiwan's permanent mission to the
WTO, the G-10 Group met with a 42-country "Special Products Union"
for the first time at a meeting held Thursday to express its hope of
forming a common front to gain the maximum benefits for themselves in
the Doha trade negotiations.</P>
      <P>Yen Ching-chang, Taiwan's permanent representative to the WTO,
suggested at the meeting that agricultural experts from the two
groups study the feasibility of establishing cooperation between the
two sides.</P>
      <P>Explaining the current situation of Taiwan's agricultural sector
and the island's stance for the negotiations, Yen said the G-10 Group
should unite with the "Special Products Union" in order to form a
stronger group in the upcoming trade talks.</P>
      <P>Sources also revealed that the G-10 countries are also planning
to meet with their rivals in the agricultural negotiations -- namely
the United States and the European Union -- in the hopes that
Washington and Brussels can gain a better understanding of the G-10
Group's goals and concerns regarding future agricultural talks.</P>
      <P>Claiming that their "special products" should be given special
protection and treatment, the "Special Products Union" is an
organization of developing countries, while the G-10 Group is keen on
issues regarding market access and non-trade concerns. The group also
considers that sensitive products should be better protected.

    <HEADLINE>MIAOLI DECIDES TO SEPARATE ELECTION, REFERENDUM POLLING STATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The northern county of Miaoli has decided
to separate polling stations for the presidential election and the
referendum vote, both of which are scheduled to be held March 20,
local government sources reported Friday.</P>
      <P>Ku Chen-ching, chairman of the Miaoli County Election Commission,
said the commission decided to let Miaoli voters cast their ballots
for the presidential election and the referendum at different polling
stations based on the notion that different laws apply to the two
events.</P>
      <P>Ku said the move is aimed at reducing any risks, simplifying the
procedures for casting ballots, and allowing the voting to be carried
out smoothly.</P>
      <P>He said that his commission reached consensus with its
counterpart in the south-central county of Yunlin Thursday and that
the Yunlin commission will soon announce its decision to have
separate polling stations.</P>
      <P>Ku said that if the move to separate the polling stations is not
accepted by the Central Election Commission (CEC), he will take full
responsibility.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Wu-hsiung, chairman of the Yunlin County Election
Commission, said around noon that his commission has not yet decided
whether to adopt a policy different from the CEC regulations by
separating its polling stations for the presidential vote and the
referendum.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Miaoli county's plans to separate the polling
stations, CEC Chairman Huang Shih-cheng said Friday that all local
governments should follow the regulations put forth by the CEC with
regard to election and voting affairs.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun called for all relevant local government
authorities to observe the CEC regulations in the upcoming
presidential election and Taiwan's first-ever referendum.</P>
      <P>Any local governments or civil servants that violate the CEC
regulations will be dealt with squarely and will be legally
responsible for their actions, Yu added.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
urged the Miaoli County to immediately withdraw its plan for separate
polling stations, saying that the plan risks causing social and
political chaos and that it will increase election costs.</P>
      <P>The DPP legislative caucus members also called for the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" not to instigate local governments to oppose to
the central government and in turn harvest ill-gotten political gains
from the elections.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang Jin-pyng, president of the Legislative Yuan, said
separating the presidential election polling stations from the
referendum voting stations is a policy that is "absolutely correct."</P>
      <P>Wang, also a campaign manager for the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" ticket of Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and People First
Party Chairman James Soong, said the CEC should be enlightened by
Miaoli County's move and follow suit.</P>
      <P>"I believe that the policy will be supported and recognized by
the majority of the Taiwan voters," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, also a senior campaign aide of
the opposition "pan-blue alliance, " said that he fully understands
why the Miaoli election commission has opted for separate polling
stations. He said having separate polling stations can help to keep
disputes and controversy to the lowest possible level.</P>
      <P>Ma, however, declined to say whether Taipei City will follow
suit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN PROMOTES AT LEAST 50 YEARS OF CROSS-STRAIT PEACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan on
Saturday advocated the establishment of a peaceful cross-Taiwan
Strait relationship and the pursuit of peace across the strait
for at least 50 years.</P>
      <P>The sole challenger to President Chen Shui-bian's re-election bid
in the March 20 election made the remarks in the first of two
televised debates between presidential candidates in Taiwan' history.
The second debate will be next Saturday.</P>
      <P>"In this way both sides of the Taiwan Strait could base exchanges
on the principles of equality and cooperation to achieve a win-win
situation," Lien said.</P>
      <P>Lien also appealed to voters to give him a chance to return to
the helm of the nation.</P>
      <P>"For those who have obtained power but have shown that they are
incapable of ruling, or have even make the country corrupt - along
with the leaders - the voters need to give the ruling party a chance
to reflect on what they have done, " Lien said, indicating that the
way for this to happen would be for the people to vote out the
current administration.</P>
      <P>Lien also said that the people should "let the KMT that failed
[in the 2000 presidential race] again serve the people" since the
party had gone through " excruciating soul-searching and
self-examination."</P>
      <P>Lien also said that an ideal government leader should take
responsibility, and "not blame international factors because of poor
domestic economic performance, not to put the blame on the
legislature for internal political instability, and not to blame the
KMT and People First Party (PFP) for stalled cross-strait relations."
PFP Chairman James Soong is Lien's running mate.</P>
      <P>"If there is no difference whether you are present or not, why
should people select you as a president? " Lien asked, meaning that
the president's blame of others is as if he were not even present to
take responsibility.</P>
      <P>Lien promised to establish a government of integrity and
efficiency if elected to regain the faith and trust of the people,
saying that the Lien-Soong ticket will not be the resurrection of the
old guard, but "the beginning of a new era."</P>
      <P>Lien also urged both sides of the Taiwan Strait to put aside
disputes on sovereignty to seek development and prosperity on both
sides.</P>
      <P>Lien said that President Chen had said in his inaugural speech
that both sides of the Taiwan Strait should deal with the issue of a
future "one China, " but recently he had advocated "one country on
each side of the Taiwan Strait, " and the writing of a new
constitution as well as giving Taiwan its "correct name."</P>
      <P>Lien criticized Chen for being "inconsistent" and "foundering
along the way" in cross-strait policy.</P>
      <P>Lien stressed that his basic stance will be to put aside disputes
on sovereignty between the two sides and jointly enhance bilateral
exchanges to promote economic development.</P>
      <P>"If one has to talk about 'one China, ' then the 'one China' will
be the Republic of China, the country where we were born, and where
we grow and that which we love the most, not a sneaking 'one country
on each side of the Taiwan Strait.'"</P>
      <P>He also vowed to promote ethnic harmony, and language equality if
elected, so that all ethnic groups in Taiwan will be first-class
citizens and no ethnic groups will be superior or inferior to other
ones.</P>
      <P>"The government should also take good care of aboriginal people,
as they are the underprivileged, " and their jobs and health care
require the government's attention.</P>
      <P>In the earlier question-and-answer session, Lien vowed not to
interfere in the personnel arrangements in heading state-controlled
enterprises.</P>
      <P>He said that the heads of the state-owned enterprises will only
take professionalism into consideration, and he will likewise.</P>
      <P>Lien also expressed his views on the nation's Constitution, tax
policy, the rising national debt as well as education reform.</P>
      <P>Lien said that before the present Constitution is reconsidered,
one must respect it, as it is the basic law.</P>
      <P>But as to what kind of system the country should adopt, a
presidential system, or a cabinet one with the premier as its highest
national leader, or dual leadership system could be left for future
discussion.</P>
      <P>On the widening gap between the rich and the poor, Lien said that
the incumbent government should take the greatest responsibility.</P>
      <P>He said that the income of the top category used to be four
or five times that of the lowest category in the past, but after
the new administration took office, the ratio has jumped to six fold.</P>
      <P>Questioned about the rising debt of the nation, Lien said that he
was sure that tax revenues will grow dramatically if there is an
annual 5 percent economic growth rate. He would also advocate the
adjustment of the tax system, upgrade the efficiency in implementing
the budget, commission the private sector for government works, and
streamline government organizations.</P>
      <P>"After all these are done, I believe that the national budget
could be balanced in six years," Lien said,</P>
      <P>Lien also said that the premium 18 percent interest rate for the
deposits of military personnel, civil servants and teachers have
their historical background, but that laborers, fishermen and farmers
should also be taken care of.</P>
      <P>Lien denied that the KMT and PFP have obstructed judicial
reforms, saying that the two parties have worked together to promote
the revision of civil, criminal and administrative laws.</P>
      <P>He also said that the litigation period should be shortened to
180 days, and the correct verdict should be increased to 90 percent,
as well as the establishment of an independent prosecutor.</P>
      <P>He also described the controversial "education reform" as a
"fiasco, " because there are no comprehensive considerations and too
much rashness in promoting lofty ideals.</P>
      <P>He promised to increase education expenditures if elected to help
the poor and nurture more talented people.</P>
      <P>On the multiple options to enter universities, Lien advocated
that 30 percent of entries be selected through a screening and
recommendation system, while 70 percent be through a joint entrance
examination system.</P>

      <P>The first presidential debate held Saturday
between President Chen Shui-bian, who is seeking reelection in the
March 20 presidential election, and his challenger, chairman of the
Kuomintang, Lien Chan, was a victory for democracy, scholars said.</P>
      <P>Ku Chung-hua, a professor in sociology at National Chengchih

in the debate not only in the way they spoke but also in their body
language.</P>
      <P>The debate, which was the first of its kind ever held in Taiwan,
has set a milestone in the country's democratic development, he
noted.</P>
      <P>Echoing Ku's comment, Chu Yun-peng, a professor in economics at
National Central University, said that the two participants in the
debate did appropriately express the sentiments of their respective
supporters on national issues.</P>
      <P>Chen Yu-wen, president of the Taiwan Debate Society, said that
the televised debate set a good example for electoral campaigns in
Taiwan and had given the general public a good lesson on democracy.</P>
      <P>However, Chien Hsi-chieh, convener of the "pan-purple alliance, "
which is composed mainly of underprivileged and social, welfare
groups, criticized the two participants of the debate for avoiding
replying concretely to some questions, although he admitted that the
cross-fire of words was a success in terms of its smooth process.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 2,500 tons of rice donated by
the Republic of China government was delivered to Iran from the
Kaohsiung Harbor in southern Taiwan Saturday by an Iranian cargo
ship.</P>
      <P>The rice was donated by the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
to help victims of a magnitude-6.7 earthquake that rocked the
historic Iranian city of Bam late last December.</P>
      <P>The Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation -- Taiwan's
largest charity which has sent volunteers to assist in post-disaster
relief work in the southeastern Iranian city since early January,
arranged for the delivery of the rice. Fifteen Tzu Chi volunteers
assisted in loading the rice onto the Iranian freighter.</P>
      <P>A Tzu Chi spokesman said its volunteers in Bam will also assist
in distributing the rice to earthquake victims when the rice arrives
in Iran in early March.</P>
      <P>The aid program is expected to meet the rice needs of more than
80,000 quake victims in Bam for the coming three months, the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of formal diplomatic relations between the
two countries, the Republic of China government has donated
US$100,000 in post-quake relief aid to Iran, in addition to sending a
61-member rescue team to assist in relief operations immediately
after the Dec. 26 earthquake.</P>
      <P>The ROC Red Cross Society also collected 30 tons of relief goods,
including jackets, blankets, wool socks and wool hats, as well as
various types of winter garments, for Iranian quake victims. The
goods were delivered by a China Airlines cargo plan in early January.</P>
      <P>More than 26,000 Bam residents were killed and at least 30,000

      <P>U.S. President Bush moved on Friday night to try to stem
potentially damaging election-year questions about his military

before the Sept. 11 attacks.</P>

      <P>As the deadline for bids to buy AT&amp;T Wireless Services Inc. came

significantly higher than its original $30 billion offer, according
to people familiar with the situation. Cingular's bid was believed to
be roughly $34 billion.</P>
      <P>Also on Friday, NTT DoCoMo Inc.'s board ruled out a bid for the

AT&amp;T Wireless.</P>
      <P>Cingular has been seen as the early front-runner, already putting
in an informal $30 billion, all-cash bid for AT&amp;T Wireless. A

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN SAYS REFORMS MUST CONTINUE WITH HIS REELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Saturday urged
continued reforms and another four years of mandate for him in the
first televised presidential debate in Taiwan's history.</P>
      <P>Chen opened his allotted eight-minute speech in the more than
two-hour debate against his sole challenger, Lien Chan, chairman of
the Kuomintang, by wishing all couples around the world the best on
Valentine's Day.</P>
      <P>He also said that, "As a national leader, I have the
responsibility toward this land, the 23 million people on Taiwan and
their future offspring.</P>
      <P>"To better the nation's economy and its major reforms so that
Taiwan can become a normal, complete, great and beautiful country is
also my responsibility," the president said.</P>
      <P>He then shifted gears and began to lash out at the corruption of
the past regimes to contrast the difference between the new and old
administrations.</P>
      <P>"For the past five decades, it has been clear that the rampant
corruption of 'black gold' politics, the mixing together of the
nation and the party, and an unjust judicial system have gradually
undermined the nation's foundation," he said.</P>
      <P>He asked the voters to think back -- would it have been possible
if there had been no political changeover four years ago to have a
neutral military and uncover a secret slush fund under the National
Security Bureau?</P>
      <P>Chen also said that because of the political changeover, those
people who became embroiled in embezzlement scandals, instead of
fleeing the country, might still be surrounding Lien and his running
mate, James Soong, chairman of the People First Party.</P>
      <P>"We sincerely hope that people believe in Taiwan and insist on
reforms," the president stressed.</P>
      <P>"We take reforms as religion, but some have the habit of making
them something only to talk about and not to do -- this is something
that we cannot countenance, " the president said, adding that a
privileged few have made abnormal loans to hollow out banks to the
tune of NT$2.5 trillion (US$75.528 billion).</P>
      <P>The opposition parties are not helping; in fact, they are
actually obstructing the reforms, the president continued.</P>
      <P>He pointed to the financial reconstruction fund -- created to
help write off the bad debt -- which has until now been unable to
clear the legislature because of opposition resistance. He also
said that the opposition parties are opposed to reform
that would halve the number of seats in the Legislative Yuan from
the current 225, and are also against the regulation of ill-gotten
assets of political parties and sunshine bills.</P>
      <P>"We really can't understand why a person would be opposed to the
reforms, " he said. "How can we better the economy by opposing the
reforms?" he asked.</P>
      <P>He said that instead of people huddling together and cursing the
president if they are in a tough situation, they should encouraged
those who are without jobs to stand up for a fresh start, which he
said is the major difference between himself and Lien.</P>
      <P>Chen said that people born into adversity harbor the fairest
ideals, and that this is the spirit of Taiwan, knowing that "we can
have unlimited possibilities in limited conditions and the worst
environment."</P>
      <P>Chen reaffirmed his belief in Taiwan and his insistence on
reforms, and appealed to voters to give him and his running mate,
Annette Lu, another four years, saying, "We have conviction and
are also most resistant to pressure."</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION CANDIDATE LIEN URGES ELECTORATE TO VOTE FOR CHANGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan needs a change and needs a national
leader with a steady, reliable and sincere character to lead it to a
safe, secure and peaceful environment, the opposition "pan-blue
alliance's" presidential candidate said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan made the call in his opening
remarks in a televised debate with his sole contender in the March 20
presidential election -- President Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Lien, a former vice president, said the upcoming election is not
just aimed at choosing a president, a ruling party or a governing
team. "The most important thing is to choose an attitude," he noted.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Taiwan has lagged far behind many other Asian
countries in economic globalization and liberalization under Chen's
leadership over the past four years, Lien said it's high time for
Taiwan to change its leadership.</P>
      <P>In the face of a quickly changing international environment, Lien
said Taiwan needs a clean, effective, efficient and competent
governing team to survive fierce global competition.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People
First Party (PFP) has crafted many feasible and forward-looking
policy initiatives, Lien said he hopes people will vote for him and
his running mate, PFP Chairman James Soong, in the upcoming election
to usher in a second transition of political power and a new era in
Taiwan's development.</P>
      <P>"We must vote for a change. A leadership change will bring new
opportunities and new hopes. We should not miss the chance, " Lien
said in his opening remarks in the two-hour debate.</P>
      <P>Lien also criticized Chen for his frequent policy flips-flops,
citing as examples an abrupt suspension of the Fourth Nuclear Power
Plant and a later resumption of the project under pressure.</P>
      <P>"We need a steady and sincere national leader, not a president
who often changes his policies," Lien said.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Lien also ridiculed Chen for his inclination to
blame the "pan-blue alliance"-controlled Legislative Yuan for flawed
policy enforcement or delays in implementing his reform agenda.</P>
      <P>"A national leader should seek ways out in difficult situations.
You can't always pass the buck for your administration's failures, "
Lien said, adding that the legislature can never boycott a capable
administrative team's operations.</P>
      <P>The live TV debate was the first of its kind ever held in Taiwan.
The event was jointly organized by Public Television Service (PTS),
the Taipei Society, the China Times, the United Daily News, the
Liberty Times and the Taiwan Daily.</P>
      <P>In addition to the PTS, 11 other local TV stations and five radio
stations broadcast the debate live.</P>
      <P>The debate started with each candidate delivering an eight-minute
speech on their vision for the nation's future and major policy
initiatives.</P>
      <P>Their opening remarks were followed by a question-and-answer
session, with five representatives from various walks of life posing
questions to the two.</P>
      <P>The five were Huang Kun-yen of the Medical Education Committee
under the Ministry of Education, Chu Ching-yi of the nation's highest
research institute, Academia Sinica, Lin Ching-ping, executive
director of a private judicial reform committee, Wang Jung-chang,

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Republic of China press officer
stationed in Chicago recently sent a letter to the Chicago Herald to
explain the purpose of Taiwan's planned referendum, saying that the
referendum is to further promote the island's democracy.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian and his ruling Democratic Progressive
Party government have decided to hold a referendum in conjunction
with the presidential election set for this March 20.</P>
      <P>The president also announced Jan. 16 in a pre-taped TV broadcast
to the nation that he will ask the people of Taiwan to decide in the
proposed referendum whether the nation should further strengthen its
anti-missile defense capabilities in response to mainland China's
ever-increasing missile deployment and whether it should try to work
out a peace interaction mechanism with mainland China.</P>
      <P>In his letter published by the newspaper Thursday, Ben Shao,
director of the information division of the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office in Chicago, said that the 23 million people of
Taiwan, who are on the front line facing a potential cross-Taiwan
Strait conflict, prefer to maintain the current status quo as much as
anyone in the world.</P>
      <P>Shao also stated in the letter that to solicit other nations'
pressure against Taiwan's proposed referendum, Beijing is
deliberately misinterpreting its purpose.</P>
      <P>"The nature of Taiwan's coming referendum, the first in its
history, is not provocative, as China labels it, but reactive to
China's aggressive stance," the director explained, adding that, "The
world should urge China to back off terrorizing Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"After all, the purpose of the referendum is simply to expand and
deepen Taiwan's young democracy, " the official concluded in the
letter.</P>

    <TEXT>Today is Saturday, Feb. 14, or the 24th day

calendar. Following is a list of important events that have occurred
on this date in the past:

1766: Thomas R. Malthus, the British economist who wrote "An
Essay on the Principle of Population," is born. His 1798 work argues
that populations tend to increase faster than food supplies unless
the increase is checked by moral restraints or by war, famine, or
disease.

1779: Captain James Cook, the British navigator and explorer who

to woo aboriginal voters from around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Some 10,000 representatives of various aboriginal tribes from

      <P>Under the slogan of seeking unity among Taiwan's ethnic groups,

previously considered to be supporters of the opposition Kuomintang

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's epidemic prevention mobilization
level against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was downgraded
to Level "Zero" from "A" Monday, according to an official of the
Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of Health
(DOH).</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director-General Shih Wen-yi said that the SARS
Contingency Committee Task Force Group under the Executive Yuan
decided to lower the mobilization level at its 17th meeting as no new
SARS cases have been reported around the world since the world's most
recent SARS patient was discharged from hospital Jan. 30.</P>
      <P>The task force also decided to reduce the frequency of its
regular meetings on prevention and control of the potentially deadly
disease from twice per month to once per month, Shih went on.</P>
      <P>However, he added that passengers from mainland China, Hong Kong
and Macau should have their temperatures taken upon arrival and that
middle and elementary schools, kindergartens and nurseries around the
nation should continue to take their students' temperatures every
day.</P>
      <P>The DOH has classified four levels of SARS precaution -- Zero, A,
B and C -- with C as the most stringent grade.</P>
      <P>The task force raised the SARS precaution level from zero to "B"
Dec. 17 after a military medical researcher was confirmed to have
come down with the disease.</P>
      <P>It downgraded the level back to "A" Jan. 1 after the patient, a
44-year-old researcher with the Institute of Preventive Medicine
under the National Defense Medicine College, was released Dec. 30
from a Taipei hospital after receiving treatment for 13 days in an
isolation ward.</P>
      <P>The SARS response level was maintained at "A" because the status

      <P>Two Kaohsiung city councilors filed
complaints of vote-buying with prosecutors against KMT presidential
candidate Lien Chan Monday, only to be accused of filing false
charges by the chief of Lien's local campaign office.</P>
      <P>Councilors Chao Tien-lin and Kang Yu-cheng lodged their complaint
with the Prosecutor's Office at the Kaohsiung District Court,
claiming that Lien attempted to buy votes Saturday by offering roses,
chocolate and free meals to those who attended a campaign rally in
the southern port city.</P>
      <P>The value of the gifts issued to each of the attendees, estimated
at about NT$200, exceeds the NT$30 ceiling for election campaign
gifts and thereby constitutes vote-buying.</P>
      <P>Their complaint was greeted by a complaint of false charges
lodged by Lin Shiang-nung, chief of Lien's Kaohsiung campaign office.</P>
      <P>Lin said the two councilors were barking up the wrong tree
because the rally was neither a campaign activity nor a rally called
by the KMT.</P>
      <P>Rather, it was a activity organized by a private group to
celebrate Valentine's Day, although it was held at Lien's Kaohsiung
campaign office and tandem bicycle, as those ridden by attendees in
the activity, is the logo of Lien's presidential campaign.</P>
      <P>Lin's claims were supported by Wu Chang-sheng, the chief of a
little-known private group called the Middle Voters Alliance, which
organized the activity.</P>
      <P>Waving invoices for the roses and candies handed out, Wu said the
activity had nothing to do with the presidential campaign and claimed
that the gifts -- a NT$28 rose and a NT$10 candy -- offered to each
couple in the activity was worth less than NT$40.</P>
      <P>The activity featured 99 couples riding tandems to symbolize
their long-lasting love, as the Chinese pronunciation of 99 is
similar to that of the term "long-lasting," according to Wu.</P>

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan met Monday with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
(DPP's) former chairman, Lin I-hsiung, and the two agreed to
accelerate the pace of action to halve the number of lawmakers,
according to KMT sources.</P>
      <P>The KMT sources said that Lien told Lin at the meeting that he
fully supports a quicker move to downsize the Legislative Yuan.
However, the KMT chairman also pointed out that the important task
must be carried out in compliance with standard procedures. Lien was
quoted as stressing that common ground must first be built between
the opposition and ruling parties to clear the way.</P>
      <P>For his part, Lin gave his assurance that the DPP will give its
full backing to such legislation, as long as the KMT initiates the
much discussed proposal in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT sources, Lien immediately instructed Tseng
Yung-chuan, secretary-general of the KMT's Central Policy Committee,
to promote this mission at the Legislative Yuan and he asked Lin to
help coordinate DPP lawmakers over the issue.</P>
      <P>It was Lin's second visit to Lien in recent months to seek the
prime opposition party's cooperation in downsizing the legislature --
a major constitutional reform long sought by the DPP.</P>
      <P>Lin also talked with Lien about his dream of building Taiwan into
a nuclear-free homeland by halting the ongoing construction of the
Fourth Nuclear Power Plant at Kungliao township in northern Taipei
County.</P>
      <P>In response, Lien replied that the project was already approved
with budget allocated by the Legislative Yuan. He said that the KMT

the building of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant must be carried out in

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  16  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The value of holding the nation's
first-ever referendum supersedes the outcome of the upcoming
presidential election, a scholar claimed Monday.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Hsin-huang, an Academia Sinica research fellow and a
national policy adviser to President Chen Shui-bian, noted that
referendum is a "new thing" in Taiwan's political history.</P>
      <P>Saying that it is not the norm in a mature democracy to oppose a
new thing before learning of its true essence, Hsiao said he hopes
the major political parties will neither boycott nor manipulate the
referendum simply for electoral purposes.</P>
      <P>Hsiao made the appeal at a news conference where he unveiled a
list of 1,000 scholars who have shown explicit support for Chen's
decision to call a referendum alongside the March 20 presidential
election in line with Article 17 of the newly passed Referendum Act.</P>
      <P>Hsiao launched a campaign Feb. 6 to collect the signatures in
support of the upcoming referendum, which the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" has been threatening to boycott.</P>
      <P>"The signature campaign has so far received the support of more
than 4,000 people from various walks of life, " Hsiao said, adding
that the campaign will continue.</P>
      <P>He stressed that support for the upcoming referendum should not
be regarded as "unconditional support" for any particular political
party.</P>
      <P>The two questions to be put to referendum March 20 are: Should
the government buy new anti-missile systems to counter Beijing's
increasing build-up of missiles targeting Taiwan? And should the
government open talks with Beijing to establish a peaceful and stable
framework for cross-Taiwan Strait interaction?</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Monday that
President Chen Shui-bian's call for a referendum March 20 alongside
the presidential election is a strategy for dealing with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Speaking at rallies in southern Taiwan's Pingtung County of
supporters of the Chen-Lu ticket, who are seeking re-election in the
upcoming presidential race, Lu said that the referendum is aimed at
making the people aware of Beijing's missile threat against Taiwan
and thus increasing their anti-missile sentiment on the one hand,
while seeking to hold "peaceful talks" with Beijing on the other.</P>
      <P>Lu claimed that if Chen had not called the referendum, a majority
of Taiwan people might not have noticed that Beijing has deployed
nearly 500 missiles targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The referendum will also help obtain international support for
asking Beijing to dismantle the missiles, she continued.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is not a part of China," Lu stressed, adding that it is a
maritime country and that she will suggest that the Executive Yuan
establish a ministry of oceanic affairs.</P>
      <P>Beijing opposes Taiwan's planned referendum because it is afraid
Hong Kong and Tibet will follow in Taiwan's footsteps, according to
the vice president.</P>
      <P>Chen has placed two questions to be voted on in the referendum:
Should the government buy new anti-missile systems to counter
Beijing's increasing build-up of missiles targeting Taiwan? And
should the government open talks with Beijing to establish a peaceful

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A prosecutor began Monday to investigate
sexual attack allegations involving a former lawmaker and his
Filipino housemaid, but a Filipino official in Taipei said the
alleged victim would prefer not to sue her employer.</P>
      <P>Pai Chih-chung, a prosecutor with the Shilin District Court in
Taipei City, said he will summon former lawmaker Elmer Fung's
Filipino maid, even though she has already flown back to Manila.</P>
      <P>The prosecutor charged with the investigation into the case said
a transcript of questioning conducted by police with the
Filipino woman, the alleged victim in the case, is not clear enough
and that more information is needed.</P>
      <P>Although local media said Fung settled the case out of court by
paying the woman "hush money, " the prosecutor said sexual attack is
a type of crime that prosecutors are obliged to look into, regardless
of the victim's opinion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile the Manila Economic and Cultural Office (MECO) in
Taipei, which was accused by local human rights groups of trying to
hush up the case by hastily sending the woman home, defended its
handling of the case, arguing that the woman chose to fly home as
soon as possible rather than sue Fung.</P>
      <P>The MECO said in a statement that they received a phone call from
the alleged victim Jan. 23, in which she complained that she had been
sexually attacked by her Taiwanese employer. A worker from MECO
immediately took the woman to MacKay Memorial Hospital for treatment
before logging a complaint with the Chungshan Police Station in
Taipei City in preparation for legal action against the employer.</P>
      <P>The woman, whose name was withheld, was then lodged by MECO
pending the legal process. MECO also retained a lawyer specialized in
industrial disputes to tell the woman about her legal rights.</P>
      <P>However, the young woman changed her mind after talking with
Fung's wife on the phone. She insisted on withdrawing the complaint,
claiming that it resulted from "misunderstandings" and said she
wanted to return to the Philippines as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>MECO put her on a flight to Manila Jan. 29.</P>
      <P>A MECO official refused to confirm local news report that Fung
and his family paid the woman NT$800,000 (US$24,167) as hush money,
but he admitted that money probably changed hands in the settlement.</P>
      <P>He also said he did not know whether the young woman will come to
Taipei to answer prosecutor's questions. "It's up to the woman to
decide after taking account of Taiwan's laws," he said.</P>
      <P>Fung is presently in mainland China, where he denied the
allegations in an interview with a local television station, claiming
that it is a ploy concocted by his political rivals to ruin him.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWANESE AUNT LEAVES BRAZIL FOR HOME WITH REGRET, UNEASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Sao Paulo,  Feb. 15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With a bit of regret and sadness, the
Taiwanese aunt of an 8-year-old Taiwanese-Brazilian orphan left
Brazil for home Sunday without being able to say goodbye to the boy
before her departure.</P>
      <P>Lee Su-hua, who accompanied Iruan Ergui Wu on his return to his
legal guardian in Brazil last Thursday after losing a three-year-old
international custody battle, said she felt deep regret for having
been denied access to the boy during her stay in Canoas, a small town
on the outskirts of Port Alegre in southeastern Brazil where Iruan's
Brazilian maternal grandmother lives.</P>
      <P>"The boy's grandmother and guardian, Rosa Leocadia da Silva
Ergui, backed off an earlier promise and would not let me bid
farewell to Yi-hua (Iruan's Chinese name) before I left Canoas, " Lee
said after her arrival at Sao Paulo.</P>
      <P>Lee was accompanied by her lawyer Wu Chiu-li and Chou Kuo-rey,
Taiwan's representative to Brazil, on the flight from Canoas to Sao
Paulo for a transit stop on her way back to Taiwan via Johannesburg
and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Wu said she could not understand why Ergui would not allow them
to meet with Iruan before their departure.</P>
      <P>"We had no chance of seeing for ourselves the environment where
Iruan will live in the future because Ergui did not invite us to
visit her home. We have no way of understanding Iruan's interaction
with his Brazilian family or his grandmother's way of dealing with
him. We cannot say we were leaving for home with ease," Wu said.</P>
      <P>As to how Iruan's Taiwanese relatives will continue to be
concerned about the boy's life and education in Brazil, Wu said a
detailed plan will be unveiled later.</P>
      <P>Iruan was born to a Brazilian mother and a Taiwanese father, Wu
Teng-shu, in 1995 in Brazil. The mother died in 1998 and the child's
grandmother was named as the boy's guardian with Wu Teng-shu's
approval.</P>
      <P>Wu took the boy for a short visit to his hometown of Chiehting in
southern Taiwan March 15, 2001, but he died unexpectedly two weeks
later. The boy's uncle then decided to take the boy and refused to
let him go. The child attended the Chiehting Primary School, where he
reached second grade.</P>
      <P>The boy's grandmother filed a lawsuit to regain custody of the
boy, and Taiwan's Supreme Court ruled late last year that Iruan
should return to his rightful guardian.</P>
      <P>Iruan will from now on live in Brazil with his 48-year-old
grandmother, his 83-year-old great-grandmother, a 16-year-old aunt
and his 13-year-old half-brother.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Deep Sea Tuna Boatowners and
Exporters Association officials said Monday that they are adjusting
their strategy and will now promote tuna products to European,
American and domestic markets.</P>
      <P>In the past, tuna catches were mostly destined for Japan.</P>
      <P>The officials said Taiwan's current tuna fishing fleet is made up
of more than 600 vessels, and Chiencheng Fishing Harbor in Kaohsiung,
sothern Taiwan, is their major port.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's annual tuna catch is around 400,000 tons, ranking first
in the world, and bringing in more than NT$40 billion (US$1.2
billion) each year.</P>
      <P>To encourage local people to eat tuna and to diversify the
market, the association has begun to plan a series of promotional
activities, hoping to increase domestic consumption.</P>
      <P>They noted that tuna caught by deep sea tuna vessels are kept at
ultra low temperatures of 50 or 60 degree Celsius below zero, which

    <HEADLINE>GRADUATES MORE WORRIED ABOUT JOBS THAN FOLLOWING ELECTION: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Even though the presidential election is
just over a month away and campaigning is getting more frenzied, a
survey has shown that more than 60 percent of this year's graduates
are more concerned with finding a job.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a poll made public on Sunday by the
executive research Web site www.1111.com.tw, nearly half of this
year's 450,000 graduates from universities, colleges and senior high
schools do not pay attention to current political issues but 64.75
percent of them are concerned about whether they will be able to find
a job after leaving school this summer.</P>
      <P>Some 53 percent of the would-be graduates responding to the poll
said they will immediately enter the job market in June -- the
equivalent of at least 270,000 new job seekers.</P>
      <P>Around 60 percent of them said they have started to look for
work, while 60 percent said that they have taken language and
computer courses to sharpen their competitiveness, the poll
indicated.</P>
      <P>Sixty-seven percent said they would use the Internet to look for
work, followed by 48 percent who will use newspapers and 39 percent
who will use government-run agencies or Web sites.</P>
      <P>This year's graduates hope for an average monthly salary of
NT$25,194, higher than the average level of NT$22,763 that business
owners are willing to pay.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that more than 80 percent of employers attach
the most importance to new job seekers' communication abilities,
professional knowledge and ability to adapt. Computer skills and
language proficiency come second.</P>
      <P>The survey was carried out Feb. 6-14. It recovered 1,386 valid
questionnaires, and had a margin of error of 2.63 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET WARNS LOCAL CHIEFS NOT TO CHANGE VOTING FORMAT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet reiterated Monday that local
governments are prohibited from arbitrarily changing the voting
format for the March 20 presidential election and referendum.</P>
      <P>Cabinet spokesman Lin Chia-lung made the reaffirmation after
several city and county government chiefs said they planned to modify
the inside of polling stations in their constituencies for the
upcoming election and referendum to avoid confusion.</P>
      <P>"Such worries are not necessary and the central government cannot
tolerate any inconsistence in the handling of electoral affairs," Lin
said.</P>
      <P>According to the Election and Recall Law, Lin said, city and
county election commissions must abide by the Central Election
Commission's regulations and should not unilaterally change the
voting format inside polling stations.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Cabinet would not like to see the phenomenon of
"one country, multiple systems" in local governments' handling of
electoral affairs, Lin said local governments should refrain from
complicating the simple electoral process by making a fuss over
trivial technical issues.</P>
      <P>Lin also urged local government chiefs to have confidence in
grassroots election workers and voters.</P>
      <P>On the upcoming election day, each voter will cast three ballots
into three different boxes -- one for electing the president and two
for answering the two referendum questions.</P>
      <P>Lin said it won't be the first time for local voters to cast
multiple ballots in a single polling setting. Over the past more than
two decades, Lin said, Taiwan simultaneously held elections for three
different kinds of public functionaries in 1977, 1986, 1989 and 1998.</P>
      <P>"On those four occasions, each eligible voter received three
different ballots at the same time, marked them at the same place and
then cast them into different boxes. All of those elections were
conducted smoothly. I simply cannot understand why some local
government chiefs would doubt voters' wisdom this time around and
plan to set up separate polling stations for the presidential
election and the referendum," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan has come a long way in its democratic
development, Lin said election administrators and ordinary voters
have accumulated abundant experience in voting affairs. "Opposition
politicians should step up preparations for the nation's first-ever
referendum and stop any technical boycott against the event, " he
added.</P>
      <P>The two questions to be asked in the March 20 referendum are:</P>
      <P>-- "The people of Taiwan demand that the Taiwan Strait issue be
resolved through peaceful means. Should mainland China refuse to
withdraw the missiles it has targeted at Taiwan and openly renounce
the use of force against us, do you agree that the government should
acquire more advanced anti-missile weapons to strengthen Taiwan's
self-defense capabilities?"</P>
      <P>-- "Do you agree that our government should engage in negotiation
with mainland China on the establishment of a peace and a stability
framework for cross-strait interaction in order to build consensus
and for the welfare of the peoples of both sides."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BUSINESSMEN ACCUSE MAINLAND AUTHORITIES OF CONDONING CRIMES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  16  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several Taiwan businessmen condemned
mainland Chinese authorities Monday for apparently condoning crimes
against citizens of Taiwan who have invested and are doing business
on the mainland.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan businessmen spoke of their tribulations at a news
conference held at the Legislative Yuan called by Legislator Chang
Ching-fang of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>They alleged that mainland China is a country rife with obscure
laws and where many well-intended Taiwan business people have seen
their investments stolen or confiscated. They appealed to the
Communist Chinese government to address cases involving Taiwan
citizens with fairness and impartiality.</P>
      <P>At the news conference, Lin Chih-sheng said that he invested a
great deal of money in 1993 to build four schools in Chengdu, the
capital city of the southwest province of Sichuan. Before 2000, the
authorities in Chengdu declared the buildings illegal and confiscated
them all.</P>
      <P>Then, Lin said, one day in 2001 several gangsters came to his
home and tried to kidnap him. He escaped and reported the incident to
local public security authorities who decided that the way to protect
him was to detain him for 15 days.</P>
      <P>Lin said he then fled from Chengdu to Xiamen in the southern
province of Fujian in 2002 and from Xiamen he paid human traffickers
to have him smuggled to the Republic of China-held island of Kinmen,
where he then managed to return to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Pao Yang-bo said he invested some NT$200 million in
real estate development in the central Chinese municipality of
Chongqing in 1996. The investment was entirely stolen by a group of
locals. He filed a lawsuit against the group and won; however, the
court has until now not executed the judgment and his holding remain
out of reach.</P>
      <P>Kao Wei-pang said that he invested and operated a manufacturing
plant in Yenjiao of the northern Chinese province of Hebei. One of
his local employees forged Kao's signature on guarantee documents
that were used to fraudulently obtain a large loan.</P>
      <P>Kao said that the incident happened over five years ago but the
suspect is still at large while the bank continues to press him to
repay the money that was embezzled.</P>
      <P>Voicing support for the Taiwanese businessmen, Legislator Chang
said that more than 1,000 Taiwan citizens have filed appeals to the
Mainland Affairs Council for help over incidents of being conned,
kidnapped or arrested in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Noting that the actual number of Taiwan citizens who have been
taken advantage of in mainland China but did not speak out may exceed
3,000, Chang called for the mainland Chinese authorities to
demonstrate some respect for the law and help do justice to the
Taiwan business people who have made numerous contributions to
society on the mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN MINISTRY DENIES REPORT ABOUT HUGE AID OFFER TO KIRIBATI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
categorically denied a media report Monday that the Republic of China
promised huge cash aid in exchange for Kiribati's diplomatic
recognition.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Richard Shih made the denial after a U.S.
newspaper -- the Baltimore Sun -- reported a day earlier that the
establishment of ROC-Kiribati diplomatic ties last November was
probably a result of "checkbook diplomacy."</P>
      <P>The paper quoted the Kiribati president's brother as claiming
that Taiwan had attempted to offer financial assistance to candidates
during the Pacific island nation's presidential election last summer.
The brother was also quoted as having revealed that Taiwan might have
offered US$8 million in aid to Kiribati annually in exchange for the
establishment of bilateral diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>"The report is absolutely not true and totally unfounded, " Shih
said in response to questioning by local media. "We have forged
diplomatic ties with Kiribati in line with our consistent diplomatic
policy of fostering relations with all democratic countries around
the world and assisting diplomatic allies in their national
development within the scope of Taiwan's financial capability."</P>
      <P>Shih pointed out that Kiribati's decision to establish diplomatic
ties with Taiwan was not made solely by its president, Anote Tong.</P>
      <P>"It was instead a decision made by the Kiribati Cabinet after a
lengthy, comprehensive debate based on their national interest," Shih
said, adding that since the two countries have become diplomatic
allies, Taiwan is certainly willing to help Kiribati develop its
economy on the principle of reciprocity.</P>
      <P>Asked how much money Taiwan will donate in aid to Kiribati per
year, Shih said there is no agreement on a fixed aid amount. In the
memorandum of understanding signed by the two sides on the
establishment of diplomatic ties, Shih said, Taiwan promised to
provide Kiribati with assistance in agricultural, fishery, economic
and cultural development after a careful evaluation of Kiribati's
needs and the ROC's own budget resources.</P>
      <P>Kiribati became the 27th nation to recognize Taiwan last
November. The move angered mainland China, which promptly cut
relations with Kiribati and dismantled a satellite tracking station
it had maintained on the Pacific island nation's main island.</P>
      <P>Kiribati President Tong has said on many occasions that his
government recognized Taiwan because the Taiwanese can better help
his country develop its economy.</P>
      <P>Tong made his first state visit to Taiwan last week, where he
signed a joint communique with President Chen Shui-bian reaffirming
their commitment to further boosting bilateral exchanges and
cooperation for mutual benefits.</P>
      <P>Located on the equator in the Pacific Ocean, halfway between
Hawaii and Australia, Kiribati is the world's largest coral reef
nation, with a sprawling exclusive economic zone. It is heavily
dependent on revenue from fishing licenses. Over the years, Taiwan's
deep-sea fishing vessels have paid a huge amount in licensing fees to
Kiribati, thereby contributing to its economic development.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  17 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui urged the
public Tuesday to vote for President Chen Shui-bian and to vote "yes"
to both questions in the first national referendum scheduled for
March 20.</P>
      <P>At a news conference to launch the Chinese translation of his
Japanese-language book "Bushido, " the ex-president did not forget to
beat the drum for Chen's re-election bid and suggested that Chen's
rival in the 2004 race, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan, is a proxy of mainland China and unqualified to run for public
office in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee said that as a U.S.-educated economist with a doctorate he is
fully qualified to say that Chen has done marvelously in terms of the
economy, especially in forcing local banks to cut their bad loan
ratio from 8.04 percent three years ago to 4.5 percent this year.</P>
      <P>He said the country needs a young leader and that Chen is its
best choice, adding that he feels the country is blessed to have a
"brilliant" leader like Chen.</P>
      <P>In the preface to his book, Lee says he was not really surprised
when Chen defeated Lien to win the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>However, the KMT, which Lee led from 1988 to 2000, could not come
to terms with the fact that it had lost power. The party has gone out
its way in its attempts to oust Chen and poses a threat to the
country's burgeoning democracy, Lee said.</P>
      <P>This, he went on, is why he could not quit politics after
stepping down from the presidency. He said he would come out to unite
the country's pro-democracy forces to back Chen and his Democratic
Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>In "Bushido, " Lee blames the Japanese authorities for what he
calls "dishonesty and cowardice, " especially in its dealing with
Beijing, which flies in the face of bushido, or the tradition code of
the Japanese warrior, the samurai.</P>
      <P>Lee said Japan is afraid of mainland China and therefore its
government dares not dispute Beijing's criticism of the Japanese
prime minister's visits to a shrine honoring Japanese war dead,
including those executed by allies for war crimes.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Lee said, Japan caved in to Beijing's pressure to
speak out against Taiwan's referendum. "Japan should be ashamed of
its cowardice," Lee said at the news conference.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ENVOY TO FILE COMPLIANT TO BRAZIL OVER IRUAN WU ERGUI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 17(CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's representative to Brazil will file
a written compliant with the Brazil government over a recent ruling
by a Brazilian children's court over the fate of an orphaned
Taiwanese-Brazilian boy.</P>
      <P>Chou Kuo-juei said he will issue the complaint to the Brazilian
authorities to protest the court decision banning the Taiwan family
of Iruan Wu Ergui from saying goodbye to him, saying the ban damaged
their right to visit the eight-year-old boy.</P>
      <P>Breaking an earlier promise, Rosa Leocadia da Silva Ergui -- the
Brazilian grandmother and legal guardian of Iruan -- acceded to the
court's ruling and refused to allow Lee Su-hua -- the boy's Taiwanese
aunt -- to bid farewell to him before she left Brazil after
accompanying him from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA),
the two families reached an agreement Feb. 14 that the boy and his
aunt could meet the following day during a lunch gathering planned to
be held at a ranch owned by a Taiwan businessman at Canoas, a small
town near Porto Alegre in southern Brazil, where the boy was born and
his maternal grandmother lives.</P>
      <P>Although officials of the Taiwan Representative Office and child
experts tried hard to change da Silva Ergui's decision to abide by
the court ruling, Lee and other members of Iruan's Taiwanese family
failed to see the boy prior to their departure, the MOFA officials
said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan envoy also paid a visit to the Brazilian court
prosecutor, who was reluctant to change the court's decision as it
was based on the premise of protecting the boy's best interests, the
MOFA officials said.</P>
      <P>Iruan, who has been at the center of a bitter three-year custody
battle between his Taiwan and Brazilian families, returned to Brazil
last Thursday after his Taiwanese uncle yielded to a Taiwan court
ruling that the boy must be returned to his Brazilian grandmother.
His aunt and a Taiwanese lawyer accompanied him on his trip to
Brazil.</P>
      <P>The boy visited Taiwan at the age of five with his Taiwanese
father, who was captain of a Taiwanese fishing boat, but his father
died suddenly in his hometown in southern Kaohsiung County. His
Brazilian mother had passed away before he came back to Taiwan. The
boy's uncle then refused to allow Iruan to return to Brazil, despite
a desperate journey to Taiwan by his grandmother, who was recognized
by the Taiwan court, the Brazilian court and the boy's father himself
as Iruan's legal guardian.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu offered her
opinion recently in an interview with Cable Television of Hong Kong
that Taiwan's planned referendum will not bring disaster to the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lu said that the referendum called by President Chen Shui-bian to
coincide with the March 20 presidential election is aimed at seeking
to establish a stable and peaceful framework for cross-strait
interaction.</P>
      <P>Only "dancing blindly in tune with Beijing's opposition to the
referendum" will bring disaster to the Taiwan Strait, she claimed,
adding that Beijing opposes the referendum because it is afraid Hong
Kong, Macau, Xinjiang and Tibet will follow in Taiwan's footsteps.</P>
      <P>Chen has put two questions to be voted on in the referendum:
Should the government buy new anti-missile systems to counter
Beijing's increasing build-up of missiles targeting Taiwan? And
should the government open talks with Beijing to establish a peaceful
and stable framework for cross-Taiwan Strait interaction?</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The output value of Taiwan's publishing
industry in 2002 totaled about NT$43 billion (US$1.3 billion) , up
slightly by 1.48 percent over the 2000 level of NT$42.39 billion,
according to the results of an investigation released Tuesday by the
Government Information Office (GIO).</P>
      <P>Citing statistics provided by the International Standard Book
Numbering (ISBN) system, there were a total of 2,385 publishing
companies based in Taiwan as of the end of 2002, the poll found, more
than 80 percent of which were registered under the name of a private</P>
      <P>individual, while over 12 percent belonged to a business group.</P>
      <P>About 36,758 new books published in 2002 in Taiwan were
registered with the International ISBN Agency, with children's books
and motivational books forming the bulk, although reference books and
children's' books notched up the largest sales value.</P>
      <P>More than 77 percent of traditional bookstores and 57 percent of
chain bookstores acknowledged a drop in business of over 20 percent,
which they attributed to the economic recession in recent years and
an exodus of local residents, according to the investigation results.</P>
      <P>At the same time, complex bookstores and stores specialized in
computer books as well as those located near bus or train stations
performed better in business revenues.</P>
      <P>However, the results also found that Taiwan-based publishers are
not fully prepared for globalization, a situation that will hinder
their efforts to edge into the huge mainland Chinese market and other
Chinese-language book markets, despite the fact that books published
in Taiwan are of better quality than those published in other
Chinese-speaking countries and areas.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Cingular's $40.7 billion
offer wins bidding for AT&amp;T Wireless.

Cingular Wireless, the second-largest wireless telephone operator
in the United States, made a stunning last-minute bid to win an
auction for AT&amp;T Wireless, executives close to the talks said early
Tuesday.

It had appeared early on Monday night, that AT&amp;T Wireless, the
third-largest cellphone operator in the United States, appeared to be
leaning toward a buyout offer from the Vodafone Group of Britain.

The auction appeared to turn yesterday when Vodafone indicated
that it would be willing to raise its $38 billion cash bid, while
Cingular Wireless, which had been the favorite to win the auction,
refused to increase its offer. But early on Tuesday, it was announced
that Cingular has boosted its bid to $40.7 billion.

Wall Street Journal: Cingular wins AT&amp;T wireless, beating out
U.K.'s Vodafone.

Cingular Wireless won the bidding war for AT&amp;T Wireless Services
Inc. with a cash offer of $15 a share, or about $40.5 billion, for
the U.S.'s third-largest cellular operator, according to people
familiar with the matter.

Cingular's victory caps a long weekend of competitive bidding by
Vodafone Group PLC, Britain's largest mobile-phone operator, which
was also vying to buy Cingular by bidding at least $14 a share.</TEXT>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian presided Tuesday
over the opening of the Taiwan Design Center (TDC) , which coincided
with the inauguration of the second phase of the Nankang Software
Industrial Park in suburban Taipei.</P>
      <P>Praising the center's opening as a milestone in the history of
Taiwan's design industry, which is in full gear to establish a
greater international presence and standing with its value-added
services, Chen claimed that the center is a crystallization of
Taiwan's potential for creativity.</P>
      <P>He urged the public to seek new horizons to achieve sustainable
progress, as Taiwan is faced with robust competition from around the
world, and he expressed his strong belief that there is no turning
back from the road ahead.</P>
      <P>"A bright future will only wait for a Taiwan that is moving up
relentlessly, " Chen said, adding that "the center will play a
leadership role in helping turn Taiwan into a front-runner in the
current knowledge-based era featuring ideas, quality and speed in a

      <P>TDC Secretary-General Chang Kuang-min said the center will assist
Taiwan companies with their image building and professional talent,
ranging from product design to diversified design applications, to
help them better tap the world market with a finely tuned brand name.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the center will also help promote transnational

      <P>According to Chang, a joint venture between the center and the
Institute for Information Industry and the Industrial Technology

      <P>The alliance has a plan to create business for more than 4,000
product items that are newly designed and have been developed with a

      <P>On the other hand, they will also try to seek foreign companies
wishing to open design units in Taiwan for their goods, a development
which is expected to push the output value of such business in Taiwan
to NT$30 billion in 2007, a more than two-fold increase over last
year's level of NT$14.5 billion, he said.</P>

Lin Kuo-hua, the premier admitted that some people have suggested
that holding the election and the referendum simultaneously on March
20 might lead to riots, but he said that this won't happen unless
there are persons who deliberately instigate such events for their
own political gains.</P>
      <P>The premier urged all candidates in the presidential race to
ensure that their campaign workers do not create disturbances.</P>
      <P>If any candidate deliberately incites riots, this would be
something independent of whether the referendum was carried out
separately from the presidential election, he said.</P>
      <P>Lin warned the premier that someone was behind the complaints of
some election officials to hold the referendum and the presidential
election together.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT VOWS TO FORM SPECIAL TASK FORCE ON BEIJING TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed his
commitment Tuesday to forming a special task force to promote peace
with mainland China if he is successful in the March 20 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>"The task force will begin operations immediately after the
presidential poll to promote the establishment of a framework for
peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, " Chen said at a weekly
meeting of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) Central
Standing Committee in his capacity as party chairman.</P>
      <P>Chen, who is seeking re-election, further said that Academia
Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh has agreed to serve as a co-convener
of the task force.</P>
      <P>More than half of the team members would come from the private
sector, including representatives from the business, cultural and
academic fields, Chen said, adding that the roster will not be
unveiled until after the presidential poll to prevent opposition
parties from "distorting" his goodwill in fostering cross-strait
rapprochement into an election campaign ploy.</P>
      <P>Noting that the DPP has consistently called for resolving
cross-strait disputes through negotiations on an equal footing, Chen
said his administration has also put the question: "Should the
government start negotiations with mainland China on the
establishment of a peaceful and stable framework for cross-strait
interaction" on the nation's first-ever national referendum, to be
held alongside the upcoming presidential election.</P>
      <P>If he is re-elected, Chen said, he will address four major
categories of cross-strait issues under the principle of "maintaining
permanent peace."</P>
      <P>The four categories will include establishing a consultative
mechanism for peaceful and stable interaction, promoting exchanges on
the principles of parity and reciprocity, forging cross-strait
political ties and preventing cross-strait military conflict.</P>
      <P>Chen described the referendum as important, claiming that if the
results show that a majority of local people want to beef up Taiwan's
anti-missile defense capability and forge a cross-strait interactive
framework, his administration will have a mandate to negotiate with
Beijing and the mainland Chinese leadership will have to "seriously
consider" Taiwan's call for negotiations on an equal footing.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Chen went on, the referendum will not only
be a step toward consolidating and strengthening Taiwan's young
democracy but will also be a strategy to realize the goals of
"cross-strait reconciliation, active cooperation and permanent
peace."</P>
      <P>Saying that the referendum will allow the people of Taiwan to
decide on major policy issues, Chen said every eligible voter should
cast his or her ballot in the referendum to write a new chapter in
Taiwan's political history.</P>
      <P>Addressing a campaign rally in downtown Taipei earlier in the
day, Chen claimed that if voter turnout in the referendum is below 50
percent, it will be a loss for Taiwan and a boon for the mainland.</P>
      <P>"We should not let such a grim scenario or nightmare happen.
Every voter should answer the two referendum questions to express to
the world and to the mainland our desire for peace and our
commitment to safeguarding our present status quo," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RECENT FOREIGN INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS FOR 23 PERCENT OF TAIEX VALUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  17 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of NT$447.8 billion (US$13.53
billion) worth of foreign capital has been channeled into the
domestic stock market since the start of this year until Feb. 13,
according to statistics compiled by the Taiwan Stock Exchange
(TAIEX).</P>
      <P>That makes the total value of Taiwan stocks held by foreign
investors at NT$3.24 trillion, accounting for 22.64 percent of the
overall value of the domestic bourse and representing a growth of
NT$93.2 billion from the level recorded on Jan. 30, according to
TAIEX tallies.</P>
      <P>During the period between Jan. 1 and Feb. 13, a total of about
NT$339 billion worth of Taiwan stocks held by foreign investors were
sold, resulting in a net buy of NT$108.76 billion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the results of a public opinion survey carried out by
the Focus Survey Research Corporation shows that more than 60 percent
of stock investors are optimistic that the domestic bourse will
continue to rise this year, with its benchmark weighted index
standing around 7,000 points, while some 52 percent of the general
public are confident of this year's business conditions.</P>
      <P>In terms of the respondents' political affiliation, nearly 78
percent of the backers of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party are
looking forward to a better business climate this year, while 52.7
percent and 56.8 percent of the supporters of the New Party and the
People First Party hold the same view, respectively.</P>
      <P>But only 42.5 percent of the prime opposition Kuomintang's
supporters are positive about this year's business climate, a stark
contrast to a high 85.3 percent posted by backers of the Taiwan
Solidarity Union, the survey discovers.</P>
      <P>In terms of educational background, more than 70 percent of
university and college graduates believe that business conditions
will turn for the better in the months ahead, while only 44 percent
of people with a junior high school diploma do not think so.</P>

      <P>Fighting in Haiti has been confined to only

Affairs said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Richard Shih said that the latest reports from the ROC's

      <P>Rebels attacked the police headquarters in the central Haitian

The rebels have been joined in their 11-day insurrection by exiled

    <HEADLINE>MASTERMINDS OF CROSS-BORDER CAR THEFT RING BUSTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) on
Tuesday arrested two men in northern Taiwan believed to be the
masterminds behind a cross-border car theft ring that used rigorous
techniques to steal, ship and then sell the vehicles in Southeast
Asia.</P>
      <P>After months of investigations, CIB investigators, backed up by
local police from Taoyuan County and Taipei City, raided the homes of
Chou Cheng-hsu in Taoyuan and Cheng Fu-hsiang in Taipei late Monday
night and arrested the pair on charges of fraud and theft.</P>
      <P>CIB investigators say they possess evidence showing that Chou,
26, and Cheng, 42, have operated a ring that steals new
Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Toyota Camry cars in Taiwan and then ships the
stolen vehicles to southeast Asia for sale.</P>
      <P>The arrest of the pair should help police stem the trade in
cross-border car theft and sales, officials said.</P>
      <P>CIB officials discovered that members of the group have
incorporated a tight network where division of labor is key. For
example, the individuals responsible for stealing, loading
containers, shipping and overseas sales do not know each other,
investigators said.</P>
      <P>CIB officials said they will investigate further to gain a better
understanding of the ring's operations and bring all of those
involved to justice.</P>
      <P>The investigators also said that Chou was involved in a series of
fraudulent withdrawals from automatic teller machines islandwide
during the Oct. 10 National Day holiday last year.</P>
      <P>In August 2003, the CIB successfully had 12 stolen new Toyota
Camry cars shipped back to Taiwan from Singapore through the joint
efforts of police, customs and immigration authorities from the two
countries.</P>
      <P>The CIB was tipped off in early July 2003 that a car theft ring
was planning to ship stolen cars to Thailand and Cambodia via
Singapore for sale.</P>
      <P>After scrutinizing a large stack of container loading documents,
shipping firms' data and customs clearance reports, investigators
uncovered two containers holding eight new Camrys at a container
terminal at Keelung Harbor in late July last year.</P>
      <P>Through a further analysis of relevant documents, they concluded
that three other containers holding 12 stolen cars had been shipped
to Singapore's Keepel Port.</P>
      <P>The CIB asked Singaporean customs to assist in intercepting the
containers. CIB and local customs officers then traveled to Singapore
to arrange for shipment of the cars back to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to CIB investigations, the 20 new Camrys were stolen in
Tainan, Taichung, Hsinchu and Taoyuan between July 4 and July 9 last
year.</P>
      <P>Reports also said that many Mercedes-Benz were stolen from the
roads of Taiwan and then packed into containers heading to mainland
China.</P>
      <P>One report recalled the ordeal of a man in Taiwan who had a bit
too much drink one night. Instead of driving home, he parked his
black Mercedes S320 to sleep it off. He later awoke to find himself
inside his car, which was inside a container headed to the mainland's
Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>Another report told of a wealthy Taiwan businessman going to
Chengdu, the capital city of the southwestern province of Sichuan,
where he spotted a Mercedes that looked exactly like the one that was
stolen from him in Taiwan. He was shocked to find that, in fact, the
car thieves had not even bothered to remove the licence plate - it
was the man's car.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAMES SOONG ANNOUNCES BOYCOTT OF PLANNED REFERENDUM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  17  (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong said Tuesday that he will not vote in the
upcoming referendum even though his party and the Kuomintang (KMT)
have not reached a consensus on the issue.</P>
      <P>The PFP leader made the remarks while responding to media
questions raised regarding the referendum during a campaign tour in
Ilan County.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) has decided to hold a referendum in conjunction with the
presidential election set for March 20.</P>
      <P>The president also announced Jan. 16 in a pre-taped TV broadcast
to the nation that he will ask the people of Taiwan to decide in the
planned referendum whether the nation should further strengthen its
defensive capabilities in response to mainland Chinese
ever-increasing missiles deployment and whether it should try to work
out an interaction mechanism to establish peace and stability with
the mainland.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the proposed referendum is illegal, Soong, also
the vice president candidate for the 2004 presidential campaign, said
that since it is an unlawful referendum, his personal position is not
to cast a vote.</P>
      <P>Saying that it is not only illegal but inappropriate to hold a
referendum on the same day as the presidential election, Soong
reiterated that his party and the KMT have never been opposed to the
referendum and that the two parties pushed for passage of the
Referendum Law at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The so-called "defensive" referendum was designated as a last
resort of the people of Taiwan to prevent the island's status quo
from being changed unilaterally, he said; therefore, since there is
no obvious danger that the island might face, the KMT and PFP are
worried about the DPP's decision to hold such referendum.</P>
      <P>Admitting that the KMT and PFP may reach a consensus in dealing
with the upcoming referendum, Soong said that he personally will not
vote in the referendum since rejecting to cast a vote is also a kind
of vote to express one's choice and opinion.</P>
      <P>Daniel Y.J. Hwang, spokesman for the PFP, also said that
according to the law, the referendum will be invalid if more than
half of the voters do not vote in the referendum, demonstrating that
refusing to vote is also an option for the people.</P>
      <P>While calling for the public to support KMT Chairman Lien Chan
and Soong in the presidential campaign, Hwang said that the KMT and
PFP will respect the voters' choices on issues regarding whether they
vote in the referendum or not.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tsai Cheng-yuan, spokesman of the KMT-PFP headquarters
for the presidential campaign, said Tuesday that considering the
nation's stability, the KMT and PFP will not take any radical action
on election day. He also said that he did not want to reveal what the
two parties will do on that day.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of National Defense confirmed
Tuesday that two United States Navy ships will visit Shanghai and
Hong Kong between late February and early March, but would not
comment on the military activities.</P>
      <P>Defense ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Huang Suey-sheng was
responding to reports that the USS Blue Ridge, the flagship of the
U.S. Seventh Fleet, will arrive in Shanghai next week for a five-day
visit, while the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk will visit Hong Kong in
early March for five days.</P>
      <P>The mass-circulated United Daily News quoted observers as saying
that the aircraft carrier's visit to Hong Kong will come at a
sensitive time in the run-up to Taiwan's March 20 presidential
election and is expected to help stabilize the situation.</P>
      <P>Huang confirmed that the USS Blue Ridge will visit Shanghai Feb.
24, but said that this will only be a routine military exchange
between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Huang would not comment on whether the presence of the two U.S.
Navy ships have anything to do with tensions between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait because of a referendum called by
President Chen Shui-bian to be held alongside the March 20
presidential election in Taiwan. Chen is seeking re-election.</P>
      <P>"The defense ministry will not comment on the U.S. military
activities and there are no unusual military maneuvers in mainland
China," Huang said.</P>
      <P>During the two previous presidential elections in Taiwan, the
United States also sent aircraft carriers to monitor waters near the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In late February 2000, or one month before Taiwan's presidential
election, the Kitty Hawk left its home port in Japan for the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>During the Taiwan Strait crisis in 1996, when mainland China
lobbed missiles in the waters north of Taiwan, the United States also
sent the aircraft carriers Nimitz and Independence to waters near the
Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Influential media personality Jaw Shao-kang
has decided to lead a group of "private individuals" to challenge the
administration in the 10 scheduled debates on the referendum to be
held on the same day as the March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Jaw, a noted television talk show host and chairman of UFO Radio,
asked for the public to sign a document of endorsement for himself,
independent Legislator Sisy Chen and writer Li Ao to become
representatives of the "opposition" side in the 10
government-sponsored debates.</P>
      <P>Formerly Jaw was a Kuomintang legislator and a head of the
Environmental Protection Administration,</P>
      <P>Once 1,547 legitimate voters endorse the trio, the three can be
considered legal representatives of the private sector in the
debates, although Chen is actually a legislator. The group's
participation in the debates is allowed only in the event that none
of the opposition parties in the Legislative Yuan step forward to
take part in the debates, according to regulations of the Central
Election Commission (CEC), the sponsor of the debates.</P>
      <P>As of noon Tuesday, all four legislative caucuses of the
opposition parties had turned down the CEC's invitation to assign
debaters to represent the opposition; in effect, to prosecute the
referendum in the debates.</P>
      <P>According to CEC regulations, if the Legislative Yuan fails to
put forward a list of names to represent the prosecution side by
Monday and no other private group applies before Feb. 20 to take part
in the debates, or to take the "con" side, the 10 debates will
instead be presentations of the Executive Yuan's views regarding the
referendum and its two questions.</P>
      <P>Appealing for people to come forward and endorse his efforts to
organize a private sector opposition debate team, Jaw said some
people must step forward to challenge the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) in the debates to prevent Taiwan's first-ever
referendum from becoming a one-sided story.</P>
      <P>Jaw said he is not an anti-referendum extremist, but said that
he, Chen and Li share the thoughts of U.S. Secretary of State Colin
Powell and consider the questions to be asked on the March 20
referendum, proposed by President Chen Shui-bian, to be "odd."</P>
      <P>"We think the referendum questions are peculiar, prompting us to
decide to step forward," Jaw noted.</P>
      <P>The two referendum questions are whether Taiwan should strengthen
its anti-missile defense capability if mainland China refuses to
remove its deployed missiles aimed at the island, and whether the
government should engage in negotiations with Beijing for the
establishment of a mechanism for peace and stability across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, military spokesman Maj. Gen. Huang Suey-sheng said
Friday that the Ministry of National Defense will follow the
decisions that are made by the Executive Yuan pertaining to the
referendum debates.</P>
      <P>Huang said the defense ministry has no opinions on who will be
appointed by the Executive Yuan from the ministry as debaters
representing the defense side of the vote.</P>
      <P>Referring to reports that Vice Minister of National Defense Lin
Chong-pin and several other officials from the Ministry of National
Defense have been appointed by the Executive Yuan to represent the
DPP in the referendum debates, Huang said that to the best of his
knowledge, Lin had not been contacted by Executive Yuan officials
about the debates as of noon Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Reports said that other administration officials who have been
appointed include Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen
and Straits Exchange Foundation Vice Chairman Shi Hwei-yow.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Lin Chia-lung said Tuesday that it is a
pity that all the opposition parties in the Legislative Yuan have
rejected the administration's invitation to take part in the
referendum debates, prompting the CEC to invite people from the
private sector to take part.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEC CONTINUES TO COMMUNICATE WITH MIAOLI OVER REFERENDUM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) will
continue to communicate with Miaoli County election officials over
the national referendum scheduled to be held on the day of the
presidential election March 20, CEC Chairman Huang Shih-cheng said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Huang declined to comment on the decision reportedly made by the
Miaoli County Election Commission Monday that the Miaoli officials
will submit a proposal to the Executive Yuan requiring the CEC to
either allow for the separation of polling stations for the
presidential election and the referendum vote, or cancel the
referendum altogether.</P>
      <P>Huang said the CEC has not been informed by the Miaoli County
Election Commission yet about its opinions on the referendum, adding
that the CEC will continue to communicate with the local government
on the issue.</P>
      <P>Members of the Miaoli County Election Commission passed a
resolution unanimously Monday requiring the Executive Yuan to either
separate the presidential election polling stations from the
referendum voting stations or cancel the referendum outright to avoid
confusion or trouble from occurring on election day.</P>
      <P>Miaoli County Election Commission Chairman Ku Chen-ching said
that he does not exclude the possibility of stepping down from his
post if the Executive Yuan refuses to adopt Miaoli County's
suggestion while his commission insists on sticking to its
resolution.</P>
      <P>Ku said last Friday that the Miaoli County Election Commission
has decided to let Miaoli voters cast their ballots for the
presidential election and the referendum at different polling
stations based on the notion that different laws apply to the two
events.</P>
      <P>Ku said the move is aimed at reducing any risks, simplifying the
procedures for casting ballots, and allowing the voting to be carried
out smoothly.</P>
      <P>Ku said that if the move to separate the polling stations is not
accepted by the central government, he will take full responsibility.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Miaoli County's plans to separate the polling
stations, Huang said last Friday that all local governments should
follow the regulations put forth by the CEC with regard to election
and voting affairs.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-Kun also called for all relevant local government
authorities last Friday to observe the CEC regulations in the
upcoming presidential election and Taiwan's first-ever referendum.</P>
      <P>"Any local governments or civil servants that violate the CEC
regulations will be dealt with squarely and will be legally
responsible for their actions," Yu added.</P>

      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui was summoned
to appear before a court on April 14 as a witness in the trial of the
former accounting director of the National Security Bureau (NSB),
according to the Taipei District Court.</P>
      <P>Lee will be the last in a series of witnesses to be questioned in
the case. Fifteen other high-profile witnesses will be questioned in
the trial before April 14, including the president's former personal
secretary Su Chih-cheng, former Foreign Minister Jason Hu, former NSB
Director Ting Yu-chou, former chairman of the China Development
Industrial Bank Liu Tai-ying and businessman Ying Yen-liang.</P>
      <P>The case stems from the country's US$10.5 million financial aid
to South Africa's ruling party, the African National Congress, in
1994.</P>
      <P>As president of the country at the time, Lee ordered the NSB to
pay the aid in advance with money from a slush fund kept by it and
asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to repay the money to the NSB
in 1999.</P>
      <P>However, for still unknown reasons, the repayment was routed to
the Taiwan Research Institute, a private think tank led by Liu
Tai-ying. Liu also took some US$150,000 from the repayment to line
his own pockets.</P>
      <P>Lee became chairman of the Taiwan Research Institute after his

      <P>Liu Kuan-chun fled the country on Sept. 3, 2000 before the case
came to light, making away with NT$190 million from the slush fund.

      <P>The government plans to transform Taoyuan
County, northern Taiwan, into an air transportation hub, President
Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a meeting with some 400 representatives of businesses

one-fourth of the proposed budget of NT$500 billion (US$15.1 billion)

construction of the county's transportation facilities, including a
rapid transit system linking the Chiang Kai-shek International

      <P>In addition, he continued, the construction projects for an air
cargo park and a passenger transportation center have been
contracted.</P>
      <P>Once these projects are finished, Chen said, Taoyuan will become
an air transportation city.</P>
      <P>Together with the high-speed railway, which will be inaugurated

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Government Information Office (GIO) is
reviewing the current rules to provide greater financial backing to
domestic film-makers to underpin the ailing domestic industry, a
spokesman for the GIO said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The new measures, worked out as six sub-plans contained in
"Challenge 2008" -- a six-year, national development plan initiated
by the Executive Yuan early last year -- were put forward at a weekly
Cabinet meeting held earlier the same day.</P>
      <P>The set of incentives is expected to inject a new lease on life
to the domestic industry, allowing Taiwan-based film-makers who have
made a mark in leading international film festivals or have received
awards to receive government financial assistance to help their work,
the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>In essence, a Taiwan-made film, no matter whether it is purely a
domestic production or a transnational joint venture that has gained
prominent awards at international film festivals, will get government
subsidies of up to a total of NT$100 million (US$3 million) with
their new work. The concept for the film, however, must be submitted
for approval from the GIO within two years.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun highly praised the new plan, saying that it
will effectively encourage domestic film-makers to create new works.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REFERENDUM DEBATES GET FIRST GROUP OF CHALLENGERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 18 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group ready to challenge the government's
referendum obtained the required signatures Wednesday to take part in
a series of debates on the issue, independent legislator and talk
show host Sisy Chen said.</P>
      <P>As an outspoken critic of President Chen Shui-bian, she
challenged him to defend his call for a referendum in person in the
public debates.</P>
      <P>One day after Sisy Chen and another well-known television talk
show host, Jaw Shau-kong, announced that they and three others will
team up to challenge the legality of the referendum in 10 debates
organized by the Central Election Commission (CEC) over the two
referendum questions, they collected the signatures of more than
2,400 individuals, nearly twice the 1,500 sponsors needed to
participate in the debates.</P>
      <P>Sisy Chen, who has denounced the referendum as illegal,
unnecessary and flirting with conflict from neighboring states,
volunteered to serve as a member on the opposition side in the
debates after the CEC failed to find any team to debate against the
affirmative side, which is made up of government officials and
pro-referendum scholars.</P>
      <P>At a news conference announcing having secured the requisite
number of signatures to form an opposition debate team, Sisy Chen
named specific people she said her team would most like to face off
with: President Chen, Vice President Annette Lu, Minister of National
Defense Tang Yiau-min, Chairperson of the Mainland Affairs Council
Tsai Ing-wen and Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Tang and Tsai were named to the government team because the two
questions to be asked in the referendum fall within the scope of
their offices. Hsieh was probably named because he is considered one
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's big guns and is known
for his debating skills.</P>
      <P>Sisy Chen also named several people that she said had no place in
the debates since they are in charge of implementing the referendum:
Premier Yu Shyi-kun, Minister of the Interior Yu Cheng-hsien and
spokesman for the Executive Yuan Lin Chia-lung.</P>
      <P>Jaw, a former lawmaker and the host of a popular television talk
show, also appeared at the news conference and said that he jumped at
the chance to be on the opposition debate team. "I can't stand
democracy without dissenting opinions," he said.</P>
      <P>Jaw, who was defeated by Chen for mayor of Taipei City in 1994,
has been considered a sympathizer for Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan,
Chen's only rival in the presidential race.</P>
      <P>Lien's strategy has been to keep a lid on the controversy
surrounding the referendum as much as possible out of concerns that
if the questions are to be publicly debated, this would have the
unfortunate effect of drawing attention away from the presidential
race and focus attention on the referendum, which has been a rallying
point for the president's campaign.</P>
      <P>Until Sisy Chen and Jaw got the needed signatures to be in the
debate, no opposing political party had come forward to take part and
the debates were to have been transformed into one-sided information
sessions conducted by the Executive Yuan. Sisy Chen and Jaw's move
put the referendum back on the front burner of public debate.</P>
      <P>Jaw, however, brushed aside journalists' questions that his
participation in the debates might be harmful to Lien's campaign.
"Why should I concern myself about Lien's campaign? Am I my brother's

      <P>"I just want to debunk the president's claims surrounding this
ill- conceived referendum. It has nothing to do with Lien. Lien's

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Feb.  18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A 25-member delegation from Okinawa
visited Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The delegates were warmly greeted by Yang, who gave a briefing
about his county's industrial development and investment climate on
various key fronts to the Japanese visitors without forgetting to
mention that the county is also rich in farm produce.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung County has been actively promoting high technologies
and working to boost environmental protection awareness, Yang said,
adding that the county has solid infrastructure for the movement of
goods and people, pointing to the fact that it takes only about 30
minutes by car to get from various key points in the county to
Kaohsiung International Airport or Kaohsiung Port.</P>
      <P>There are two American schools and one Japanese school in the
greater Kaohsiung area, which give Kaohsiung County a sound
environment for school-age children of hi-tech experts willing to
work in the county, Yang said.</P>
      <P>At the same time, construction of the research building at the
county's environmental technology industrial park is slated for June
next year, Yang announced. Investors setting up shop in the compound
will be provided with handsome incentives and preferential loans, he
said.</P>
      <P>According to Yang, Kaohsiung County has courted capital worth
more than NT$130 billion (US$3.93 billion) in investment projects.
What the county needs now is technology and manpower, he noted,
expressing his hope for a trade and investment partnership between
Okinawa and his county.</P>
      <P>In response to Yang's invitation, the chief delegate of the
Okinawa mission said that his group members are very interested in
two-way cooperative ventures and that they welcome the Kaohsiung
County magistrate to visit Okinawa in April. Noting that Okinawa has
a free trade zone, he said tourism, health care and environmentally
friendly sectors are its key income sources.</P>
      <P>Members of the delegation included officials of the Okinawa
Prefecture Government, university professors and environmental
protection specialists.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Kerry holds off push by
Edwards in primary vote in Wisconsin.

The U.S. Democratic presidential nomination battle turned into a
two-man contest on Tuesday as Senator John Kerry narrowly defeated
Senator John Edwards in the Wisconsin primary. Howard Dean suffered a
dismal third-place showing that Democrats said would effectively end
his campaign.

The finish by Edwards startled Democrats here, as well as those
in the Kerry and Edwards camps, who had been looking for Kerry to
post another decisive victory in Wisconsin, based on his performance
so far this year.

Wall Street Journal: Cingular deal will reshape industry.

The huge acquisition deal that the U.S. wireless industry had
been anticipating for more than two years has reshaped the industry.

If regulators approve the deal without forcing Cingular to shed
substantial assets, it would create the largest U.S. wireless
company, with more than 46 million customers. Cingular's coverage
will extend to 97 out of the nation's top 100 markets. With AT&amp;T
Wireless, Cingular will have enough spectrum -- the invisible
airwaves used to carry wireless calls -- to bring the masses anything
from basic cellphone calls to Web surfing.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>MAC FORMS MECHANISM TO COPE WITH CEPA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said
Wednesday it has forged a special consultative mechanism with Taiwan
business people operating in Hong Kong and Macau to cope with
challenges from th Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA).</P>
      <P>Chang Yung-shan, director of the MAC's Hong Kong and Macau
Affairs Department, said since mainland China implemented the CEPA
to strengthen its economic partnerships with Hong Kong and Macau at
the beginning of this year, trade and investment between Taiwan
and Hong Kong have been affected slightly.</P>
      <P>To address the new challenges, Chang said, his department has
forged a new mechanism to facilitate contacts with Hong Kong- and
Macau-based Taiwanese business people.</P>
      <P>"We'll continue monitoring the CEPA development and
working out feasible measures to cope with any impact that may arise
from the new economic partnerships between mainland China and the two
former Western colonies," Chang said.</P>
      <P>In addition to the CEPA development, Chang said preventing
transmission of avian flu and severe acute respiratory syndromes
(SARS) viruses is also on the MAC's priority work agenda.</P>
      <P>Chang said trade and investment between Taiwan and Hong Kong
declined in 2003 as compared with the year-earlier level mainly
because some Taiwanese businessmen adopted a wait-and-see attitude
ahead of the implementation of the CEPA.</P>
      <P>In 2003, Taiwan-Hong Kong trade amounted to US$30.1 billion, down
7.79 percent from 2002. Taiwan exports to Hong Kong declined 8.19
percent while its imports from the former British colony dropped 0.75
percent.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Chang said, indirect trade between Taiwan and
mainland China via Hong Kong increased last year. In the first 11
months, cross-Taiwan Strait trade via Hong Kong totaled US$12.72
billion, up 15.95 percent from the same period of 2002. Of the
amount, Taiwan exports to the mainland via Hong Kong reached US$10.77
billion, up 14.32 percent; while Taiwan imports from the mainland via
Hong Kong increased US$25.85 percent to US$1.95 billion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said, Taiwan businessmen invested US$640 million
in Hong Kong in 2003, down 283.86 percent from 2002; while Hong Kong
investment in Taiwan also declined 32.33 percent to US$44 million.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's investment in Hong Kong focused on banking and insurance
and electronics, while Hong Kong's investment in Taiwan centered on
wholesaling and retailing business.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A man who made a hoax bomb call to the
Hsinchu Railway Station Feb. 8 was nabbed late Tuesday at his home in
Miaoli, northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lo Wei-wen admitted to police that he made the hoax call warning
that there was a bomb on a train from Hsinchu to Taichung Feb. 8. He
made the call while waiting in vain at the Hsinchu railway station
for his estranged girl friend.</P>
      <P>Since suspicious devices had already been found twice on the
train this year -- once Jan. 5 and again Feb. 2 -- rail officials
took the warning seriously and stopped five Hsinchu-Taichung trains
for inspection. Although nothing was found, the inspection snarled
rail traffic all over northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Police traced the hoax call to Lo's cellphone and arrested him,
but to their disappointment, found he is not the bomber who has left
explosive devices in eight places in Taipei City since last November.
That bomber has been nicknamed the "rice bomber" because of his habit
of leaving statements on his devices protesting the country's rice
imports.</P>
      <P>None of the devices, which lack fuses, pose any real danger to
the public but police are alarmed nevertheless, as the devices are
quite sophisticated and show that their maker has the skills to made
a real bomb.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the Miaoli Election Commission
announced his resignation Wednesday after days of rows over his
proposal to separate polling stations for the March 20 presidential
election and referendum.</P>
      <P>Miaoli County Election Commission Chairman Ku Cheng-ching said
that based on his experience in dealing with local elections, he had
proposed to the Central Election Commission (CEC) that the ballots
for the referendum and the presidential election be cast at different
stations to avoid confusion, adding that the proposal was based on
the notion that different laws apply to the two events.</P>
      <P>He said the move was aimed at "reducing any risks, simplifying
the procedures for casting ballots and allowing the voting to be
carried out smoothly."</P>
      <P>But he said that his proposal was ignored and that he was
repeatedly bullied and intimidated by people protesting his proposal,
adding that some even came to his office to call him names.</P>
      <P>Ku became choked with emotion several times while delivering his
resignation statement and at one point appeared to be on the point of
collapse.</P>
      <P>After he recovered, he expressed the hope that the government
will respect the basic rights of everyone and that every voter will
face the election in a rational manner.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Executive Yuan spokesman Lin Chia-lung said that the
Executive Yuan will "respect the wishes of individual election
officials" and that the CEC is monitoring the local election
commissions and will handle related matters.</P>
      <P>The CEC said that it is dealing with the matter according to the
law, and that the vacancy left by Ku will be filled by a suitable
person.</P>
      <P>Voters will get three ballots on election day -- one for the
presidential election and the other two for the referendum questions
concerning strengthening Taiwan's anti-missile capability and the
re-opening of cross-Taiwan Strait talks. The government wants the
three ballots to be cast at the same station and has said that even
votes placed in the wrong ballot boxes will be counted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun instructed relevant
government agencies Wednesday to continue monitoring the water
resources situation across Taiwan to secure sufficient water use for
the general public and industry.</P>
      <P>Yu issued the instruction during a weekly Cabinet meeting after
hearing a briefing by officials from the Water Resources Agency (WRA)
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>The MOEA formally announced a day earlier that the second-phase
water restrictions imposed from Feb. 6 in five cities and counties in
northern Taiwan -- Taipei City, Taipei County, Taoyuan City, Hsinchu
City and Hsinchu County -- had been lifted, thanks to recent rainfall
brought by several cold fronts since the Chinese New Year holiday
season in late January.</P>
      <P>The second-phase water restrictions comprised a 20-percent
cutback in water supplies to heavy users such as car washes, swimming
pools and saunas.</P>
      <P>The water level at the Feitsui Reservoir in Taipei County has
rebounded to about 160 meters -- a normal level for this time of
year.</P>
      <P>Yu, however, called on the public to continue conserving water,
even though adequate water use has been secured through late May,
because the possibility of a dry spell has not yet been totally ruled
out.</P>
      <P>As it was decided that about 65,000 hectares of farmland and rice
paddies in northern regions will lie fallow in the coming months in
line with the central government's water conservation program, the
premier also demanded that the MOEA, the Council of Agriculture and
regional irrigation associations take charge of the issue to fully
protect farmers' interests.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, especially the northern region, has been hit hard by a
water shortage over the past two years due to an extreme scarcity of
rainfall.</P>

      <P>Temperature-taking measures that had been
in place at agencies under the jurisdiction of the Taipei city
government and Taipei municipal hospitals were formally lifted
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Taipei city government's decision was made after the
Cabinet-level Department of Health announced on Monday that Taiwan's
epidemic prevention mobilization level against severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) had been downgraded to level "Zero" from
level "A."</P>
      <P>The DOH has classified four levels of SARS precautions -- Zero,
A, B and C -- with C as the most stringent grade. The level was
lowered because no new SARS cases have been reported around the world
since the world's most recent SARS patient was discharged from
a hospital in the southern mainland Chinese city of Guangzhou Jan. 30.</P>
      <P>The city government's Department of Health said that because of
the DOH's announcement, people entering city government agencies and
municipal hospitals are no longer required to have their temperature
taken and are not required to wear surgical masks when entering
hospitals, although it advised those with fever to wear a mask.</P>
      <P>However, health officials said that although the vigilance level
against SARS is lower, the public must remain on guard against avian
influenza.</P>
      <P>The officials said that they were happy that a wave of flu
expected after Chinese New Year failed to occur, but added that under
the threat of reported avian flu cases in Asia, they will continue to

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said
Wednesday that Taiwan will become a medical education and research
hub in Asia and a major medical technology and services exporting
country with the inauguration of a new biomedical industry park.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a ceremony marking the start of
preparations for construction of the biomedical industry park in the
northern Taiwan county of Hsinchu, which hosts Taiwan's high-tech
center -- the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park.</P>
      <P>The new Hsinchu biomedical industry park will pool the resources
of the public and private sectors to boost development in biomedicine
and relevant medical technologies, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"With concerted efforts of the government, academia and the
business community, I'm convinced that Taiwan will emerge as a
regional medical education and research center, as well as a major
exporter of medical technology and services, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that biomedical industry as become a new focus of
development in many advanced countries in recent years, Chen said
Taiwan cannot afford to lag behind in this field.</P>
      <P>He added that his administration has listed the new biomedical
industry park as one of the "Ten New Major Construction Projects"
aimed at upgrading Taiwan's overall national competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The new park will be located on 38.3-hectares of land near the
high-speed railway's Chupei station, currently under construction.</P>
      <P>At Wednesday's ceremony, the Bureau of Taiwan High Speed Rail
under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications handed over
control of the land to National Taiwan University (NTU) , which will
be responsible for planning and management of the new biomedical
park.</P>
      <P>NTU President Chen Wei-chao said Japan's Nomura Research
Institute has been commissioned to draw up a construction blueprint
for the NT$20 billion project.</P>
      <P>"Construction of infrastructure and other public facilities
inside the park is scheduled to get underway in the second half of
2005 and the park will begin operations in 2008," Chen Wei-chao said.</P>
      <P>He said the new park will house a research-oriented medical
center to serve as the park's research and development driving force.</P>
      <P>When the park is inaugurated in 2008, Chen said, Taiwan's
biomedical industry production will increase by 20 percent annually
in the first five years and will create more than 10,000 jobs for
well-trained professionals, particularly those with tertiary academic
degrees.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SECOND CIVIC GROUP TO OPPOSE REFERENDUM QUESTIONS IN TV DEBATES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Another civic group has expressed the
desire to represent those who are opposed to the March 20 referendum
in 10 scheduled television debates on the two referendum questions
concerning the nation's anti-missile capability and the reopening of
cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>Lo Chi-chiang, president of the Chinese Speech and Debate
Association, said that his "Citizen Right View Alliance" is
soliciting signatures and is expected to collect enough names before
Friday to gain approval from the Central Election Commission (CEC) to
take part in the debates.</P>
      <P>Lo's announcement came on the heels of announcements by several
TV personalities, including independent Legislator Sisy Chen, former
legislator and TV and radio station host Jaw Shau-kong and writer Li
Ao, that they also wish to challenge the "yea" team formed by the
Executive Yuan, which is in charge of implementing the referendum.</P>
      <P>The CEC invited the private sector to form a team to represent
referendum opponents after no opposition political parties in the
Legislative Yuan expressed any desire to represent the opposition
side before the dateline expired Monday.</P>
      <P>Lo said "referendum is a right of the people, although they
should cast their ballots only after careful consideration."</P>
      <P>According to Lo, the three TV celebrities' desire to take part in
the debate seems likely to end up as rivalry between the "pan green
camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and its ally, the
Taiwan Solidarity Union, and the "pan blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang and the People First Party.</P>
      <P>"I don't want to see the debate turning into rivalry between
political camps rather than discussion of the issues, " Lo said,
adding that his aim is to call to public attention whether Taiwan
actually needs to purchase anti-missile systems.</P>
      <P>According to the rules of the CEC, the "yea" and "nay" sides must
each recommend one to five people to take part in the debate. If both
civic groups intend to take part in the debate, they will have to
coordinate between themselves on which ones will take part in which
debate.</P>
      <P>If the coordination falls through, then the representatives will
be decided through the drawing of lots.</P>
      <P>Lo stressed that as his pitch is different from that of the TV
celebrities, who want to highlight the absurdity of what they call
the "illegal" referendum called by President Chen Shui-bian, his
alliance will not merge with Jaw's team, although it is possible that
they will have to coordinate on procedural arrangements.</P>
      <P>The debates will be held between Feb. 20 and March 19, according
to the CEC plan.</P>
      <P>The two questions to be asked in the March 20 referendum
alongside the presidential election are:</P>
      <P>-- Should mainland China refuse to withdraw the missile it has
targeted at Taiwan and openly renounce the use of force against us,
do you agree that the government should acquire more advanced
anti-missile weapons to strengthen Taiwan's self-defense
capabilities?</P>
      <P>-- Do you agree that our government should engage in negotiation
with mainland China over the establishment of a peace and stability
framework for cross-strait interaction in order to build a consensus
and for the welfare of the people of both sides?</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND ISSUES POSITION PAPER ON REFERENDUM QUESTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of National Defense Tang Yiau-min
confirmed Wednesday that the Ministry of National Defense (MND) has
issued a position paper on its anti-missile forces build-up plan in
preparation for Taiwan's first-ever referendum.</P>
      <P>Tang made the confirmation at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's
National Defense Committee where opposition People First Party
Legislator Ku Chung-lien unveiled an MND position paper saying the
ministry has been working on an anti-missile battery deployment plan
since 1997 and will begin to implement a Patriot anti-missile battery
procurement project in 2005.</P>
      <P>The MND position paper makes it clear, Ku pointed out, that no
matter what the results of the March 20 referendum will be, the
ministry's plan to purchase advanced anti-missile weaponry systems
will not be affected.</P>
      <P>"Against this backdrop, do we really need to hold a referendum
alongside the March 20 presidential election?" Ku asked.</P>
      <P>Tang did not answer Ku's question directly, saying only that the
MND has explained its stance "based on professionalism." Tang also
refrained from revealing to whom copies of the position paper have
been distributed.</P>
      <P>In the upcoming referendum, the electorate will be asked whether
Taiwan should acquire more missiles to defend itself against military
threats from mainland China and whether the island should enter talks
with Beijing for the establishment of a framework for peaceful
interaction.</P>
      <P>The MND position paper points out that mainland China's missile
threats have existed for a long time and that the mainland has so far
refused to renounce the option of using force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the position paper, the mainland now has more than
100 strategic ballistic missiles armed with nuclear warheads that can
strike any country in the world. In the future, the position paper
says, the mainland's strategic missiles, which are of various
configurations and types, including Dongfeng 3, 4, 5, 5A, 21, 21A and
31, will be able to be fired from any waters around the globe.</P>
      <P>In addition, the position paper says, the mainland has deployed
about 500 tactical ballistic missiles of four types -- Dongfeng 11,
11A, 15 and 15A -- along its southeastern coast opposite Taiwan. Each
mainland tactical missile is armed with multiple highly explosive
warheads. These tactical missiles can not only strike any area of
Taiwan but can also hit major U.S. military bases in South Korea,
Okinawa and elsewhere in Japan.</P>
      <P>Noting that the mainland's annual tactical missile output ranges
between 50 and 75 units, the position paper predicts that the number
of tactical missiles deployed in coastal mainland provinces will
exceed 600 by 2005.</P>
      <P>The position paper further says that the mainland's tactical
missiles are mobile and tightly guarded and require only a short
preparatory time prior to launch. Their accuracy rate has been
largely increased with the installation of satellite positioning
systems.</P>
      <P>In the face of the intensified missile build-up, the position
paper says, Taiwan must beef up its anti-missile defense
capabilities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE MINISTER DENIES REPORT ABOUT ARMS PROCUREMENT BUDGET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
denied a media report Wednesday that the ministry will put forward a
NT$500 billion (US$15.11 billion) arms procurement budget plan for
deliberation by the Cabinet before the March 20 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Defense Minister Tang Yiau-min made the denial at a meeting of
the Legislative Yuan's National Defense Committee.</P>
      <P>During the session, opposition Kuomintang Legislator Chiang
Chi-wen asked Tang whether the MND really will finalize the special
arms purchase budget plan ahead of the election as a local newspaper
has reported.</P>
      <P>In reply, Tang said the report is absolutely not true. "You can
wait and see whether we present the reported budget proposal to the
Cabinet before the election," he added.</P>
      <P>The China Times quoted unidentified sources as reporting
Wednesday that the MND has ordered the Navy and the Army to finalize
their budget plans for purchasing eight submarines, 12 P3-C
anti-submarine aircraft and three Patriot anti-missile batteries as
soon as possible so that the ministry can refer a comprehensive
budget plan to the Cabinet on March 18.</P>
      <P>Tang dismissed the report as sheer speculation, stressing that
arms procurement must follow institutionalized procedures.</P>
      <P>"The MND has established standard operational rules, and arms
procurement budget planning must follow the rules without any
exceptions, " Tang said, adding that he himself is unlikely to abuse
his power to interfere with arms procurement budget planning
procedures.</P>
      <P>To the best of his understanding, Tang said, preparations for
purchasing the stated weaponry systems have not yet reached the
budget evaluation stage.</P>
      <P>According to the unconfirmed newspaper report, procurement of the
submarines, anti-submarine aircraft and Patriot anti-missile systems
will cost about NT$520 billion.</P>
      <P>The Bush administration already agreed to sell eight conventional
submarines, 12 P3-C anti-submarine aircraft and three advanced
Patriot anti-missile batteries to Taiwan in 2001. However, none of
the deals have been completed partly because of the huge amount of
funds needed for the procurement.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan's first-ever nationwide referendum to be held alongside
the upcoming presidential poll, the electorate will be asked whether
Taiwan should acquire more missiles to defend itself against military
threats from mainland China and whether the island should enter
talks with Beijing for the establishment of a framework for peaceful

    <TEXT>
      <P>Scottish movie star Sean Connery is
reportedly coming to Taiwan later this month to take part in an
islandwide human-chain activity symbolizing determination and esprit
de corps in protecting Taiwan through peace.</P>
      <P>Academy Award-winning actor Connery will come to Taiwan to join
the "one million hand-in-hand" campaign that will kick off in front
of the Presidential Office at 2:28 p.m. on Feb. 28, according to Wang
Hsien-chi, a deputy executive director of the campaign.</P>
      <P>Connery will be one of the foreign guests of President Chen
Shui-bian during the rally, marking the second meeting between them
since last November when they met in Panama City for Panama's
centennial celebrations, Wang said.</P>
      <P>During that celebration, Connery, who represented Great Britain
at the centennial, took the initiative in asking a Central American
country's ambassador to Panama to arrange for a meeting with
President Chen.</P>
      <P>During their meeting, Connery was quoted as having said he is a
fan of President Chen.</P>
      <P>For his part, President Chen said he is a loyal Sean Connery fan.
"You have numerous fans in Taiwan and are welcome to visit any time,"
Chen told Connery, who starred as the charismatic spy "007" in
several James Bond films, including "Dr. No" (1962) , "Goldfinger"
(1964) and "Diamonds Are Forever" (1971).</P>
      <P>Connery is expected to announce his Taiwan itinerary at a press
conference in Tokyo Feb. 26, according to a report by the China Times
daily in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The "one million hand-in-hand" activity will take place on 2-28
Memorial Day, with people from around the island joining hands to
form a colossal human chain and shouting "Taiwan yes, China no! " at
2:28 p.m.</P>
      <P>The campaign is widely believed to be aimed at drumming up
support for President Chen Shui-bian in his bid for re-election.
Taiwan's presidential election is set for March 20.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu Nai-jen, President Chen and Vice President Annette
Lu's campaign manager, said that the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) has no clear ideas about Connery's visit to Taiwan, which
is believed being sponsored by the opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union, a DPP ally.</P>

market of 1.2 billion people.</P>
      <P>As to public concerns about national security should direct air
links be opened with the mainland, Chen said this could be addressed
with proper planning.</P>
      <P>By the same token, he said he favors the idea of allowing
Taiwanese firms doing business on the mainland to list their stocks
on the Taipei Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>Instead of draining off capital, allowing these firms to float
their stocks in Taiwan would encourage them to funnel their profits
back to Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>This would also give the government a valuable tool in
controlling these firms by obliging them to made public their
financial status as is required for any public company.</P>
      <P>Direct transportation links would also contribute to the
government's efforts to develop the island into a research and
development center, because these centers cannot work alone but rely
on close interaction with their companies' manufacturing bases on the
mainland. Such interaction, he said, would only be possible with the
presence of direct links.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has decided to join the 2006 PISA
test, an international program for student assessment, Ministry of
Education officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the government has assigned the
Cabinet-level National Science Council as the only window for foreign
communications on the test and will send a representative to
participate in the first meeting of national project managers for the
2006 PISA test to be held March 1-5 in Athens.</P>
      <P>The PISA test was first set up by the Organization of Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2000 with the participation of
28 countries, 24 of which were OECD member nations.</P>
      <P>The 2000 PISA test focused on assessing the reading ability of
15-year-old students who had completed basic compulsory education
courses in that same year.</P>
      <P>The second PISA test was held in 2003, with 45 countries
participating. That test was designed to assess the mathematic
ability of the students of the participating nations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WILLING TO SHARE E-CUSTOMS EXPERIENCE: WTO ENVOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Feb.  19 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's permanent representative to the
World Trade Organization (WTO) vowed Thursday to share with other
member states its rich experience in cross-boarder transport, a key
issue that will be discussed in a new round of the Doha talks.</P>
      <P>Yen Ching-chang made the remarks during an informal meeting at
the WTO headquarters that brought together representatives of WTO
member countries that also are members of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum to exchange views and opinions on issues
related to a resumption of the Doha talks slated for late March.</P>
      <P>Yen reiterated that Taiwan fully backs multilateral trade talk
mechanisms under the framework of the WTO and a re-opening of the
2001 WTO conference in Doha, Qatar. The so-called Singapore issue --
market opening, regulatory affairs, improvement in transparency in
government procurement and simplified procedures for cross-border
transportation -- were touched upon at one of its follow-up meetings.</P>
      <P>As cross-broader transportation has been the only one of the four
topics in the Singapore issue accepted by the APEC members at the WTO
for discussion, Yen said Taiwan is very willing to share its
experience in paperless customs clearance with other WTO members in
the coming Doha round of talks, to help forge consensus among the WTO
to achieve free transportation across borders.</P>
      <P>According to Yen, Taiwan and Australia have made noticeable
progress in reducing import and export costs and in boosting economic
activity since their implementation of a system of e-customs.</P>
      <P>Chile's WTO envoy, who chaired the meeting, gave a positive
response to Yen's proposal and said he will push for discussions on
the issue at WTO expert-level meetings. He contended that future APEC
ministerial-level meetings should include WTO envoys in order to
bolster bilateral exchanges between the two organizations.</P>
      <P>Chile will be the host country of this year's APEC annual
conference, with a trade ministers' meeting planned for June.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Restrictions on people who wish to visit
mainland China via the frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu will be
relaxed slightly from March 1, a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Chen Ming-tong said the council has decided to
allow Taiwan businessmen working on the mainland to use the direct
shipping links between the Taiwan-controlled islands of Kinmen and
Matsu, and the mainland ports of Xiamen and Mawei.</P>
      <P>Usually, these links are reserved for Taiwanese businessmen
working only in the mainland's Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the mainland spouses of Taiwan people living in
Penghu County, as well as veterans born in Fujian, will also be
allowed to go to the mainland via Kinmen or Matsu.</P>
      <P>Allowing more people to use the links will help boost the
economy of the two frontline islands, said Chen.</P>
      <P>Kinmen and Matsu, which are only a few kilometers from the
mainland coastline, used to be heavily armed garrisons and their
economies depended heavily on the troops posted there. But the two
islands have lost their strategic importance because of the
mainland's rapid buildup of missiles, and the Taiwan authorities have
reduced the number of military personnel assigned there, which has
taken a heavy toll on the economies of the two islands.</P>
      <P>In order to address this, the MAC three years ago began allowing
the two islands to operate direct shipping links with the mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING MORE RESTRAINED BUT CONTINUES TIRADE AGAINST PRESIDENT: SEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although mainland China has adopted a more
restrained manner in the run-up to Taiwan's March 20 presidential
election than it had prior to the country's previous two direct
elections, it has continued its tirade against President Chen
Shui-bian and the referendum to be held in tandem with the election,
an official of the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>SEF Deputy Secretary-General Yen Wan-chin made the comments when
he attended a seminar on the mainland China factor in Taiwan's
presidential election sponsored by the Institute for National Policy
Research, a private think tank.</P>
      <P>"Beijing has learned from its experience in the past two
presidential elections in Taiwan, " Yen said, referring to its
test-firing of missiles near Taiwan waters in 1996 and then-Premier
Zhu Rongji's intimidating talk in 2000, both of which whipped up
antagonism in Taiwan and boosted support for former President Lee
Teng-hui and later, Chen.</P>
      <P>To avoid repeating the same mistakes and turning resentment of
Beijing into a booster for Chen, Yen said, the mainland has been
keeping a low profile.</P>
      <P>High-ranking officials from the Taiwan Affairs Office under
Beijing's State Council have refrained from giving their views, and
even limited talks have been kept low-profile.</P>
      <P>But Yen pointed out Beijing has been unable to suppress the urge
to criticize, estimating that between Jan. 1 and Feb. 15, there were
53 media reports opposing Taiwan's referendum, and 47 criticisms of
Chen.</P>
      <P>He said that if the Beijing leadership cannot directly interfere
with the election, it will use indirect pressure to sway voters,
citing the recent arrests of alleged Taiwan spies on the mainland as
an example.</P>
      <P>Yen said that a greater majority of the estimated 1 million
Taiwan businessmen operating on the mainland support the "pan-blue
alliance" of the opposition Kuomintang and the People First Party,
but added that "the number should not exceed more than 70 percent."</P>
      <P>However, several scholars said in the seminar that the election
will hinge on the mainstream views of the people and that the effect
of Taiwan businessmen operating on the mainland will be very limited.</P>
      <P>With the election campaign moving into high gear, reports about
Taiwan businessmen operating on the mainland could play a role in the
race surface.</P>
      <P>The scholars said they do not believe that Taiwan businessmen
working on the mainland will give priority to returning to Taiwan to
vote over their own economic interests.</P>

      <P>Vice Premier Lin Hsin-i paid a visit
Thursday to the Honda Taiwan Co., a business wholly owned by the
Japanese carmaker Honda Motor Co., in southern Taiwan's Pingtung
County, and suggested to the management that they buy more
Taiwan-made spare parts.</P>
      <P>Lin, accompanied by Pingtung County Magistrate Su Chia-chuan and
officials of the Executive Yuan's Southern Coordination Office, was
warmly welcomed by the plant workers and the Japanese management led
by Honda Taiwan President Teruo Fujisaki.</P>
      <P>Wishing the Honda Taiwan great success, Lin called on the
management to purchase more Taiwan-produced parts and components to
help it bring down production costs and raise the annual output from
the current level of 12,000 units to its designated target of 30,000.</P>
      <P>Lin also expressed hope that Honda will set up a research and
development (R&amp;D) center in Taiwan to provide customers with the best
service.</P>
      <P>According to the vice premier, Taiwan's exports of automobile
parts and components are worth more than NT$100 billion (about US$3
billion) every year.</P>
      <P>In response to Lin's remarks, Fujisaki said Honda Taiwan plans to
sponsor an investment seminar in April in cooperation with the
Pingtung county government and the Economic Processing Zone
Administration under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in order to
meet Taiwan-based parts and components makers.</P>
      <P>Fujisaki claimed that the mother company in Japan will consider
opening a R&amp;D center in Taiwan and promised to step up on-the-job
training for the Pingtung plant workers.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Seven Taiwanese women who were forced into
sexual slavery for the Japanese Imperial Army during World War Two
appealed against a Japanese court ruling in Tokyo Wednesday. The
court upheld a lower court decision to throw out their claims for
damages from the Japanese government, according to a private group in
Taipei that advocates the rights of such women.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation said a Japanese lawyer has
appealed, on behalf ofthe seven Taiwanese women, to the Japanese
Supreme Court against the Feb. 9ruling by the Tokyo High Court.</P>
      <P>The foundation said in a news release Thursday that two of the
nine former so-called "comfort women" who filed the suit with the
Tokyo District Court July 14, 1999, have since died. The rest are all
in their 70's and 80's and are hoping they will see the Japanese
government apologize and admit its cruelty to them.</P>
      <P>The Japanese forced more than 200,000 Asian women to serve as sex
slaves for their soldiers between 1938 and 1945, including at least
1,200 from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation began to locate these women
in 1992 and has found 43, most of whom are now in fragile health.</P>
      <P>Although the Japanese government has steadfastly refused to admit
any responsibility for the women, it set up a private foundation in
1995 to compensate them with 2 million yen per person. However, some
of the Taiwanese comfort women have refused to take the compensation
as it does not come directly from the government and demand an
apology from the government.</P>
      <P>Aided by human rights groups in Taiwan and Japan, they went to
Tokyo to file their claim for damages with the Tokyo District Court
on July 14, 1999.</P>
      <P>The period for applying for compensation from the private group
expired May 1, 2002.</P>

Nine months after Congress voted to slash the tax rate on

The tax law approved in May cut the top tax rate on many
dividends to 15% from as high as 38.6%, a move designed to bolster
the stock market and stimulate the economy. But the tax break,
retroactive to January 2003, doesn't apply across the board to all
the dividends that investors receive.

As a result, brokerage firms and mutual-fund companies are having

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Thursday it welcomes the passage of a resolution by the European
Parliament last week demanding that the European Union (E.U.)
maintain its arms embargo against mainland China.</P>
      <P>The European Parliament, the E.U.'s legislative arm, unanimously
passed the resolution Feb. 10 asking the European Commission -- the
E.U. executive body -- not to lift the ban on arms exports to
mainland China without its prior approval.</P>
      <P>"We welcome the European Parliament's move, " said Wang Yu-yuan,
director of MOFA's European Affairs Department.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the European Parliament already passed a
similar resolution last December. As some E.U. member states,
including France and Germany, have been advocating lifting of the
arms ban imposed in 1989, the European Parliament voted against such
a proposal again last week.</P>
      <P>Given this development, Wang said, the E. U. is not expected to
bring up the topic again in the near future. Nevertheless, Wang said,
MOFA will continue to monitor developments on this issue.</P>
      <P>The European Union imposed the arms export ban against mainland
China after Beijing conducted an armed crackdown on pro-democracy
students at Tiananmen Square in 1989. While Germany and France have
been pushed for the lifting of the ban with a view to facilitating
their acquisition of lucrative business contracts in mainland China,
Wang said the European Parliament doesn't support such a move because
it is still dissatisfied with Beijing's human rights record.</P>

      <P>The marijuana was packed into 45 parcels and mailed to Cheng's
two accomplices -- two female college students surnamed Chen and
Hsiung. The two accomplices were nabbed in Taipei City shortly after
Cheng's arrest.</P>
      <P>Cheng told investigators that he and his accomplices met some
foreigners at pubs in Taipei last year. "They asked us to help
transport marijuana and ecstasy pills by offering us free trips to
Canada and other foreign destinations," he said, adding that he then
traveled to Canada early this month to help deliver the drugs for
his foreign friends.</P>
      <P>MJIB agents reminded local college students that marijuana is a
second-grade contraband drug. Those transporting or selling marijuana
may be given a minimum seven-year prison term or life imprisonment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VAC DENIES EXERTING INFLUENCE ON VETERANS OVER REFERENDUM ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 19 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the Veterans Affairs Commission
(VAC) denied Thursday that his commission has told retired servicemen
to participate in the upcoming referendum on orders from the
Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>VAC Chairman Teng Tsu-lin said at a meeting at the Legislative
Yuan Defense Committee that the Veterans Affairs Commission is
completely neutral and the Executive Yuan has not asked the VAC to
promote participation in the referendum among the country's retired
servicemen.</P>
      <P>Teng also denied that the VAC has used administrative resources
to drum up support for President Chen Shui-bian to facilitate his
re-election.</P>
      <P>Teng made the remarks in response to questions raised by
opposition People First Party (PFP) legislators Chin Hui-chu and Ku
Chung-lien about rumors of the VAC's intention of tampering with the
retired servicemen's voting decisions ahead of the March 20
presidential election and referendum.</P>
      <P>The PFP lawmakers also expressed concern that the aged retired
servicemen -- most of them having come to Taiwan before 1950 after
the Republic of China government moved its seat from the mainland to
Taiwan -- would have trouble casting three ballots without some
confusion.</P>
      <P>In this regard, Teng said that he is confident that the retired
servicemen, despite being elderly, will have no problems and will
choose wisely.</P>
      <P>"Our veterans have a great deal of common sense and they are well
informed from watching TV and reading newspapers," Teng added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Teng said, the government is not suspending monthly
retirement pensions to those retired soldiers who have traveled to
the mainland and settled there.</P>
      <P>He said the government is continuing paying retirement pensions
to the 5,514 retired ROC soldiers who are now living on the mainland
but have not applied for resident status or a passport from the
People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The Examination Yuan passed a new regulation recently stipulating
that retired military servicemen, civil servants and school teachers
will have to receive their retirement pensions in one lump sum rather
than by monthly payments if they reside on the mainland.</P>
      <P>If they don't apply for a lump-sum payment, they may risk having
their retirement pensions withheld, according to the Examination Yuan
regulation.</P>
      <P>The VAC has assigned personnel to the mainland on a yearly basis
to check whether the 5,000-odd retired soldiers now residing on the
mainland have received Beijing-issued ID cards, Teng said, adding
that the VAC was relieved to find that none of them had accepted the
PRC papers of identification.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of narcotics seized totaled more
than 8,500 kilograms last year, up 2.7 fold from the previous year,
statistics compiled by the Department of Health (DOH) showed
Thursday.</P>
      <P>DOH officials said that not only the size of the narcotics haul
had increased sharply, but the types had become more varied, and the
use of marijuana grew by nearly 10 fold, DOH officials said.</P>
      <P>Among the drugs seized last year, amphetamines accounted for
half, followed by ketamine, heroin, ecstasy and marijuana.</P>
      <P>Li Jih-heng, director-general of the DOH's National Bureau of
Controlled Drugs, said that both ketamine and marijuana are popular
substances in parties and clubs, adding that ketamine seized last
year surpassed that of heroin, and marijuana seized totaled 121
kilograms, or 9.9 fold or 11 kilograms in 2002.</P>
      <P>"The changes of the two drugs [ketamine and marijuana] will

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Thursday said
that the most difficult and worst days are over for the country and
that Taiwan's economy is improving.</P>
      <P>The president made the comments in an interview with local radio
station UFO.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he is confident he will win a second term in the
upcoming presidential election on March 20 and that his presidential
campaign will pick up steam in the last 30 days of the campaign.</P>
      <P>While indicating that this year's presidential election is not an
election of "two rotten apples, " Chen said that his position on
issues regarding the nation's status, reforms, and the elimination of
corruption are different from that of Lien Chan, the presidential
candidate of the opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>He further said that Taiwan will be in danger if its leader does
not know what the sovereignty of the nation is or does not insist on
the maintenance of national sovereignty to avoid it from being
changed.</P>
      <P>Noting that reform is his belief, the president said that he has
long insisted on eliminating corruption and crime as well as
respecting the will of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although confident of victory, the president said that he is not
being careless with his campaign. He said that the contest may be
decided by a razor-thin margin of only 3 to 5 percent of the vote.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INDEPENDENCE A MOOT POINT AS TAIWAN ALREADY HAS SOVEREIGNTY: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reiterated
Thursday that Taiwan need not declare independence because it is
already an independent, sovereign country no matter whether it is
called "Taiwan" or the "Republic of China."</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in a radio interview with Chou Yu-ko, a
noted talk show host. The one-hour interview was broadcast live on
UFO Network from 8 a.m. to 9 a.m.</P>
      <P>During the talk show known as "UFO Breakfast," Chou asked Chen if
he is re-elected in the March 20 presidential election, will he
declare Taiwan independence?</P>
      <P>In response, Chen said those who have asked him this question do
not seem to have full confidence in Taiwan's sovereign status.</P>
      <P>"Only those who lack confidence in our national sovereignty will
feel a need to declare Taiwan independence," Chen said. "For me, such
an issue is non-existent."</P>
      <P>Chen said his Democratic Progressive Party administration has
insisted that Taiwan is an independent, sovereign state regardless of
its official designation.</P>
      <P>"No matter whether we are called 'Taiwan' or the 'Republic of
China, ' we are a country and I'm the top leader of this country. I'm
now the ROC's 10th-term president and I'm now running for re-election
to become our country's 11th-term president," Chen explained.</P>
      <P>If he is re-elected in the March 20 presidential election, Chen
said he will continue to honor the "four noes plus one" pledge
outlined in his 2000 inaugural address.</P>
      <P>"For me, a promise is timeless. I won't retreat from the 'four
noes plus one' pledge in my 2004 inaugural speech, " Chen said
firmly. The now famous pledge includes no change of Taiwan's national
title and flag as well as no holding of a referendum on the
"independence vs. referendum" issue.</P>
      <P>As to his earlier advocacy of writing a new constitution for
Taiwan in 2006, Chen said he will definitely carry out Taiwan's
constitutional reform with no change in the status quo as the
guiding principle.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Chen also defended his decision to hold the
nation's first-ever referendum alongside the upcoming presidential
election, stressing that the two referendum questions will offer the
electorate an opportunity to express their opinions about major
policy issues.</P>
      <P>In the March 20 referendum, the voters will be asked whether
Taiwan should acquire more anti-missile defense capabilities to
defend itself against military threats from mainland China and
whether the island should enter into talks with Beijing for the
establishment of a framework for peaceful interaction.</P>
      <P>Even though the results of the referendum may be self-evident,
Chen said the referendum will serve to reaffirm Taiwan's commitment
to pursuing permanent peace with mainland China and to remind Beijing
that it must negotiate a viable interactive framework with Taiwan
because its "one China" principle is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Chen also said he sees no fault in Minister of National Defense
Tang Yiau-min's remarks a day earlier that even if less than half of
the electorate vote against purchasing more missiles in the upcoming
referendum, the Ministry of National Defense will go ahead with its
arms procurement plans.</P>
      <P>"What we need to buy to beef up our defense capabilities includes
many kinds of weapons, not just missiles, " Chen argued, adding that
he had extensive discussions with Tang and other government officials
before deciding on the referendum questions.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People
First Party (PFP) could announce their decision on Thursday regarding
whether to vote in the historic referendum set for the day of the
presidential election March 20, a well-placed source said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The source said that the two parties have held consultations
since PFP Chairman James Soong stated Feb. 17 that even though his
party and the KMT had not reached a consensus on the issue, he
personally would not vote in the referendum because he said it is
"illegal."</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has called for the people of Taiwan to
support the referendum.</P>
      <P>The two questions to be put to the people in the referendum are
whether Taiwan should further strengthen its defense capabilities if
mainland China refuses to remove its missiles aimed at Taiwan, and
whether the government should negotiate with Beijing for the
establishment of an interaction mechanism for peace and stability
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Sources close to the KMT and PFP said that the two parties still
consider the March 20 referendum illegal and think they should
explain the legal reasons why voters have the right to refuse to vote
in the referendum.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the sources said that it is impossible that the KMT
and PFP will openly call for the people to refuse to cast their
ballots in the referendum because some influential members in the two
parties still view the issue differently, and because the two parties
are concerned about incurring criticism if they urge the public not
to vote.</P>
      <P>Soong has confirmed that only a few differences remain between
leading members of the KMT and the PFP on the referendum issue,
expressing the hope that the two parties can reach a consensus on the
issue as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Noting that according to the law, the referendum results will be
invalid if more than half of Taiwan's voters don't vote, Soong said
that not casting a ballot is also a form of voting.</P>
      <P>However, Wang Ching-ping, president of the Legislative Yuan and a
leading figure at the KMT-PFP campaign headquarters, has said that he
will vote in the referendum.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) will
continue in its efforts to persuade Provincial Election Commission
Chairman Chen Lung-chi not to resign, CEC Chairman Huang Shih-cheng
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen announced his decision to step down from the chairmanship
Thursday out of "concerns about not being able to accomplish the
challenging tasks regarding ballot procedures and other voting
affairs related to the referendum" to be held in tandem with the
presidential election on March 20.</P>
      <P>Chen is the highest-ranking government official in charge of
election affairs to submit a resignation notice since the Executive
Yuan began carrying out relevant measures pertaining to the
referendum earlier this month.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Huang said he and
other CEC officials are communicating further with Chen, as well as
with Miaoli County Election Commission Chairman Ku Cheng-ching, who
offered to resign two days before, in an attempt to retain the two
election officials.</P>
      <P>Ku announced his resignation Wednesday after days of wrangling
over his proposal to separate referendum polling stations and those
for the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Ku made the proposal to the CEC for separate stations as a means
of avoiding confusion, based on the notion that different laws apply
to the two events. He said the move was aimed at "reducing any risks,

voting to be carried out smoothly."</P>
      <P>However, Ku said, his proposal was ignored, and he was repeatedly
bullied and intimidated by people opposed to his proposal, adding
that some even came to his office to call him names.</P>
      <P>At the Legislative Yuan Friday, CEC head Huang also noted that
the CEC has its set policy and is dealing with the matter according
to the law. He said that vacancies created by those who resign will
be filled by suitable individuals.</P>
      <P>According to the CEC policy, voters will get three ballots on
election day -- one for the presidential election and another two for
the referendum questions. The two referendum questions concern
whether Taiwan should strengthen its anti-missile defenses if
mainland China refuses to remove its missiles aimed at the island,
and whether the government should negotiate with Beijing for the
establishment of an interaction mechanism for peace across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>The administration wants the three ballots to be cast at the same
polling stations, and it has said that even votes placed in the wrong
ballot boxes will be counted.</P>

      <P>The chain will start from Hopintao, or peace island, in Keelung,
northern Taiwan, and wind through the island to a small village
called Changlung, meaning prosperity, in Pingtung the southern-most
county of Taiwan, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of thousands of people around the island have already

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two prominent personalities issued a joint
statement Friday urging the two presidential tickets to push
lawmakers to pass a constitutional reform bill ahead of the March 20
election to pave the way for halving the number of legislative seats.</P>
      <P>Lin Yi-hsiung, a former chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), and Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh,
also urged the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan in their joint
statement not to close its current session before passing the reform
bill.</P>
      <P>The two widely respected celebrities further called on the
general public to endorse their joint appeal. Lee, a co-winner of the
1986 Nobel Prize in chemistry, is scheduled to unveil progress in
their signature campaign at the end of this month.</P>
      <P>Lin said at a news conference that reform should not be just a
political slogan, but rather require concrete actions. Since the two
presidential tickets -- President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President
Annette Lu of the DPP and the opposition "pan-blue alliance" ticket
of Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party
Chairman James Soong -- have recently reaffirmed their commitments to
promoting political reforms, Lin said he and Lee want to remind them
to deliver on their solemn promises with concrete actions.</P>
      <P>Three years ago, Lin recalled, all major domestic political
parties already vowed to pass a constitutional reform bill to pave
the way for cutting the number of seats in the legislature during
this session. Such a promise has received wide recognition in local
society, he added.</P>
      <P>"Although the legislative caucuses of various political parties,
including the dominating KMT, presented various constitutional reform
bills regarding downsizing the legislature last December, they have
so far not taken any action to deal with those bills, " Lin lamented.
"The delay has made me wonder whether the presentation of those bills
was just a political ploy."</P>
      <P>Lin further said he will seek endorsements of ordinary citizens
to push local politicians to honor their promise and substantiate
legislative reform.</P>
      <P>According to the nation's Constitution, the Legislative Yuan
should have 225 seats. To halve the number requires revision to this
provision.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DGBAS FORECASTS 2004 ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE AT 4.74 PERCENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 20 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will post an economic growth rate of
4.74 percent for the whole of 2004, while its first-quarter economic
growth rate will hit 5.16 percent, the Cabinet-level Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS made the forecast on the grounds that the domestic
economy expanded by 5.17 percent for the fourth quarter of last year,
an encouraging quarterly performance in recent years.</P>
      <P>According to the DGBAS statistics, Taiwan's economy grew
substantially by 3.24 percent for 2003, with its gross domestic
product reaching US$295.9 billion and the per-capita income standing
at US$13,157.</P>
      <P>If the budgets for the 10 new public construction projects
submitted by the Cabinet are approved by the Legislative Yuan in the
second half of this year, the country's economy will further expand
by at least 0.5 percent for 2004, brining the annual economic growth
rate to top 5 percent, DGBAS officials said.</P>
      <P>But the officials pointed out that an annual economic growth rate
above 5 percent can be obtained only when the possibilities of
various uncertainties are fully ruled out, such as a reappearance of
severe acute respiratory syndrome, a deterioration of the situation
with bird flu, a strong appreciation of mainland Chinese currency and
high interest rates.</P>
      <P>Private-sector consumption and demand will be the major driving
forces to account for 4.2 percent in this year's economic expansion
of 4.74 percent, the officials explained, adding that consumption
from the private sector will rise by 3.71 percent for 2004, up from
last year's 0.85 percent.</P>
      <P>Private-sector investment is also estimated to post a growth rate
of 14.5 percent, a jump from a negative growth rate of 0.7 percent
recorded in the previous year, they elaborated.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Starting salaries for first-time job
seekers in the industrial and service sectors average about NT$23,700
(US$715) this year, the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) reported
Friday.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of a recent investigation conducted early this
year, CLA officials said that starting salaries for new job seekers
in the industrial sector hit around NT$23,800, while new workers in
the service sector receive an average monthly salary of some
NT$23,600.</P>
      <P>Although companies, fueled by stronger demand for manpower as a
result of a recovering economy, have released a larger number of jobs
in recent months, the officials noted that monthly salaries for job
seekers remain at similar levels compared to those posted in July
last year.</P>
      <P>For instance, service-related medical-care professions provide an
average starting salary of NT$25,000, while beverage and food
companies and restaurants offer a starting salary at around
NT$20,000. Beginners in the financial, stocks and futures companies
are better salaried with an average monthly pay of around NT$29,000.</P>
      <P>The survey, discovers, however, that new workers in public
utilities such as power and water plants, as well as railway, postal,
tobacco-related and energy businesses get starting pay of more than
NT$30,000 per month, with those working at air and sea ports leading
others by enjoying a salary of up to NT$50,000.</P>
      <P>The survey also finds that a higher educational background is a
guarantee of a better salary. Monthly incomes of graduate school
students average at nearly NT$28,000, while those of four-year
university graduates average more than NT$26,000, ahead of the
monthly average of NT$23,000 for two-year college students and
NT$20,000 for senior high school students.</P>
      <P>The gap in men's and women's monthly incomes is slight at 3
percent, an improvement from a difference of 5.91 percent recorded in
2000, it points out.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei, Feb. 20 (CAN) Three TV personalities -- the head of a
local radio station, a legislator and a university professor --
applied to the Central Election Commission (CEC) Friday for
permission to represent the opposition side in a series of 10
televised debates with the government on the March 20 referendum.</P>
      <P>Jaw Shau-kong, chairman of the UFO Network, independent
Legislator Sisy Chen and National Taiwan University Professor Tim
T.Y. Ting submitted the signatures of more than 100,000 people who
support their bid to debate the two referendum questions -- whether
Taiwan should strengthen its defenses and whether it should open
cross-strait talks on a peace and stability framework -- to be voted
on in the referendum that will be held alongside the presidential
election.</P>
      <P>The number of signatures far exceeded the minimum threshold of
1,547 names set by the CEC for each question.</P>
      <P>As more than one team has expressed an interest in serving as the
"nay" side to the government's "aye" team, the final debating teams
will be decided by a drawing of lots if the various hopefuls cannot
coordinate among themselves.</P>
      <P>To get around this, Jaw said, his team has artificially bulked up
the size of the teams from the maximum five to 20 people to ensure
that his teams have the best chance of success in a draw situation.</P>
      <P>The list includes many UFO Network hosts, as well as writer Li
Ao, lawyer and former CEC member Wang Ching-feng, Former Chairman of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party Hsu Hsin-liang and former
Control Yuan Member Yeh Yao-peng.</P>
      <P>But Sisy Chen said that in view of the fact that the government
has changed its recommended debate team list, the opposition should
have the same opportunity. "In other words, the final list of our
team is yet to be finalized," she added.</P>
      <P>The 10 live TV debates must all be held by March 19.</P>
      <P>Under the referendum rules, the CEC must hold five debates for
each of the two questions. Each debating team can have between one
and five members, with an equal number on each side.</P>
      <P>The CEC first invited opposition political parties to serve as
the "nay" side but neither the Kuomintang nor its ally, the People
First Party, were interested, pointing out that they agree with the
content of the referendum and are only opposed to the referendum on
the grounds that they believe it has been illegally called by
President Chen Shui-bian. They also fear that continued talk on the
referendum will shift the focus of their election campaign theme of
improving the economy.</P>
      <P>The CEC therefore had to open the debate to civic groups.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The controversy in Taiwan surrounding the
upcoming referendum proves the necessity to sort out differences
among the people through just such a nation-wide vote, Tamkang
University professor Juan Ming said Friday.</P>
      <P>In a forum held by CNA to discuss issues regarding the 2004
presidential election and Taiwan's ties with mainland China, Juan
played down public concerns that the forthcoming referendum has
strained the country's ties with both the United States and mainland
China, claiming that the three parties enjoy the stablest relations
since 1979.</P>
      <P>Juan said the ties between the United States and mainland China
have never been as good as they are now because both sides have make
clear their bottom lines in dealing with each other.</P>
      <P>Similarly, Taiwan's ties with both the United States and mainland
China are better and this stability serves the interests of Beijing,
which needs peace while it is concentrating on economic development.</P>
      <P>However, Juan also said that Beijing is obviously trying to stop
Taiwan from holding the referendum by making its concerns known to
the United States. Taiwan can easily allay Washington's concerns over
the referendum by convincing the United States that the island is not
flirting with the idea of Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>In addition to Juan, the forum, chaired by CNA Editor in Chief

    <TEXT>
      <P>A framework for cross-Taiwan Strait talks
and economic cooperation should be established, a scholar specialized
in mainland Chinese studies said Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar organized by CNA on the 2004 presidential
election in Taiwan and cross-strait ties, Chang Wu-ueh, a professor
at the Graduate Institute of China Studies of Tamkang University,
said that cross-strait trade and exchanges of personnel are
increasing, although there still exist disputes over the sovereignty
between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Regardless of who is elected as the next-term president of the
Republic of China, Chang suggested the governments of the two sides
shelve their political differences and take a pragmatic attitude
toward seeking a framework for bilateral trade and exchanges for the
sake of their own interests and that of the international community.</P>
      <P>Beijing's concerns over Taiwan's planned March 20 referendum,
which will be held alongside the presidential election, are centered
on the impact that it could bring to the new leadership of Chinese
President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao, who are seeking to
gradually consolidate power with stability, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>The Beijing leadership is also concerned that Taiwan's democratic
development could bear on the situations in Hong Kong and the
mainland as well, he added.</P>
      <P>Beijing hopes to spend the first two decades of this century
developing its own economy and seeking an opportunity for unification
with Taiwan in the process of building the strength of the country,
Chang stressed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's democratic development would interrupt Beijing's
long-term strategy for dealing with the island, he went on.</P>

also attended by Professor Byron Weng of National Chi Nan University,

      <P>New York Times: Pending avote, some
Iraqis press for a larger governing council.</P>
      <P>As prospects for early elections faded, several ral Iraqi leaders
said Thursday that they wanted the American-appointed Iraqi Governing
Council to remain in place after the United States transferred power
back to the people on June 30. Plans are already under way to expand
the council, they added.</P>
      <P>The leaders, including representatives from the major ethnic and
religious groups and members of the council, said a consensus had
emerged to increase the current council of 25 people to as many as
125, and to keep it in power until United Nations-assisted elections
could be held in early 2005.</P>
      <P>The move to extend the council's rule represented another
complication in the Bush administration's vision for a quick transfer
of power. As late as this week, American officials were still
clinging to an agreement, signed with Iraqi leaders in November, that
called for the council to be replaced on June 30 and for a new Iraqi
government to be selected by nationwide caucuses.</P>
      <P>Wall Street Journal: Searching for Hussein's billions, U.S. finds
little outside Iraq.</P>
      <P>Last March, at the start of the military invasion of Iraq, the
Bush Administration announced a parallel "financial offensive"
against Saddam Hussein. Treasury Secretary John Snow declared, "We
are directing a world-wide hunt for the blood money that Hussein and
his cronies have stolen from the Iraqi people."</P>
      <P>But after nearly a year, the hunt for money to be used for Iraqi
reconstruction appears to have largely stalled. The U.S. has
recovered almost nothing of the billions Mr. Hussein and his family
supposedly squirreled away.</P>
      <P>The U.S. military scored an early success last year by seizing
nearly a billion dollars in cash inside Iraq. But Mr. Hussein's
alleged assets outside the country have proven far more elusive.</P>

      <P>The new wharves will greatly benefit Anping Port -- once an
important business hub in southern Taiwan -- the spokesman said. In
addition to Chi Mei, other Tainan-based business groups such as
President Enterprise and Great Wall Enterprise are also interested in
using the port facilities, he pointed out.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT PRESIDES OVER GROUNDBREAKING FOR ORCHID PARK IN TAINAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian presided Friday
over the groundbreaking of an orchid biotechnology park in southern
Tainan County, praising locally cultivated fine orchids as a symbol
of Taiwan's refined agriculture.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Taiwan orchids will become the world's top class
flower due to its high quality and production volume, Chen said the
government fully supports the industry, which has been included by
the Executive Yuan in its "Challenge 2008" six-year national
development plan.</P>
      <P>The president also talked about the government's financial reform
efforts, stressing that it has helped write off bad loans worth more
than NT$1.2 trillion (about US$37 billion) for the credit divisions
of farmers's and fishermen's associations all over the country.</P>
      <P>Scores of representatives of the horticultural sectors from
Japan, Holland and New Zealand also took part in the ceremony.</P>
      <P>According to Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-chih, globalization
is one of the critical strategies for Taiwan's agriculture in the
face of strong competition from mainland China. Success for the
orchid biotechnology park will set an example for other sectors, he
said.</P>
      <P>The 200-hectare park will be one of the world's leading orchid
cultivation facilities and will provide a major fillip for Taiwan's
production, marketing, research and sales of the popular flower in
the international market, Su said.</P>
      <P>Construction of the park's first-phase 23-hectare compound will
be completed in early March to serve as the venue for an Asia-Pacific
exhibition slated to open March 6. The building of a 34-hectare
second-phase compound will also start shortly, he added.</P>
      <P>The biggest difference between an orchid biotechnology park and
an agricultural special zone, Su explained, is that the former is a
specially designed complex devoted to the whole process of orchid
cultivation, ranging from cultivation to overseas sales, while an
agricultural special zone focuses only on production.</P>
      <P>Currently, some 67 hectares of farmland in southern Tainan County
are devoted to orchid planting, producing 30 percent of Taiwan's
orchids.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan plans to earmark more than NT$2 billion (about
US$61 million) in subsidies for the five-phase development plan of
the park to help promote the business.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than half of the people surveyed in a
recent poll believe mainland China is trying to sway Taiwan's March
20 presidential election, a ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-lan, DPP whip at the Legislative Yuan, revealed the
survey results Friday at a press conference. The poll was conducted
Feb. 12-13 by Focus Survey Research at the commission of the private
Taiwan Thinktank, with 1,042 effective samples collected and a margin
of error of 3.04 percent.</P>
      <P>The survey results show that 51.4 percent of those polled said
that Beijing is trying to sway the presidential election, compared
with 21.1 percent who disagreed.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that if foreign forces intervene in the election, it
will affect Taiwan's competition edge.</P>
      <P>The results also show that 57.8 percent of the respondents
believe that business tycoons who flock to invest in the mainland
leaving huge debts in Taiwan will have a "very serious" impact on
Taiwan's economy, and 18.6 percent said they will have a "serious"
impact.</P>
      <P>On who, as a national leader, will be more capable of improving
the situation, 27.4 percent named President Chen Shui-bian, compared
with 22.8 percent who named his election rival, opposition Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>"This shows that President Chen is more capable of solving the
problem," Tsai claimed.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 20.2 percent of the respondents
believe that former Tuntex Group Chairman Chen You-hau, one of the
country's 10 most-wanted fugitives, who fled Taiwan after embezzling
the group's money, will be removed from the wanted list if Lien is
elected president, compared with 58.4 percent who said they do not

      <P>Special budget plans for Taiwan's
additional procurement of advanced weapons systems, including
submarines, are not expected to be finalized before May 20, Minister

      <P>Tang said a final revision of the analysis of weapons systems on

to be submitted by the MND to the Legislative Yuan in early March,
while the investment guidelines are expected to take another two

May 20, the day the next president is sworn into office.</P>
      <P>Tang made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan to discount media

budget plans to clear the legislative floor before March 20 in an
attempt to get a nod from Washington to Taiwan's holding a referendum

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, NEW ZEALAND INK WORKING HOLIDAY SCHEME AGREEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and New Zealand signed an agreement
Friday to allow young people from both countries to take temporary
work while on holiday in each other's country.</P>
      <P>Shih Ting, director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in
New Zealand, and Charles Finny, director of the New Zealand Commerce
and Industry Office in Taipei, signed the arrangement on behalf of
their respective governments.</P>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien noted during the signing
ceremony that the substantive bilateral trade exchanges between
Taiwan and New Zealand grew by 22 percent last year, a year in which
New Zealanders made 54,000 visits to Taiwan, while Taiwanese made
around 25,000 visits to New Zealand. Both countries also hold regular
bilateral trade and economic meetings.</P>
      <P>Shih pointed out that New Zealand broached the idea during a
Taiwan-New Zealand trade consultation conference in May 2001. New
Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clarke also agreed that the two
countries should increase economic and cultural exchanges when she
was interviewed by a Taipei monthly magazine.</P>
      <P>Shih noted that related government agencies reached consensus
after lengthy discussions on various aspects of the project. The two
governments then worked out and finalized the scheme after two years
of coordination.</P>
      <P>Shih said the scheme has become a major channel of bilateral
youth exchanges around the world and he cited similar schemes in the
neighboring countries of Japan and South Korea as an example.</P>
      <P>He noted that Japan signed agreements on a similar scheme with
Australia, New Zealand, Canada, France and South Korea, while South
Korea also operate similar schemes with Australia, New Zealand,
Canada and Japan, with initial good results.</P>
      <P>Statistics in Japan and South Korea show that Japanese and South
Korean young people going to New Zealand have so far outnumbered New
Zealanders going to Japan and South Korea for working holidays, and
that most Japanese and South Korean youths who have participated in
the scheme have come away with positive views of the program.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said that according to the
terms of the agreement, the representative offices in each country
can issue visas to 400 young people each year who meet the
qualifications for enrollment in the program.</P>
      <P>Applicants must be aged between 18 and 30, and their main purpose
of travel must be for vacation. The work they undertake will only be
to allow them to earn some spending money during their stays and
working will not be the main purpose of their entry.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials said that New Zealand is the first country that
Taiwan had signed such an agreement with, while Taiwan is the 18th
country with which New Zealand has signed similar agreements.</P>
      <P>The scheme will based on the principle of reciprocity, so that
youths from both countries can have a chance to understand first-hand
the society, culture and people of other country, establish lasting
friendships and strengthen long-term substantive bilateral relations
through private contacts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN TO FORMALLY KICK OFF SATURDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC)
issued a gazette Friday announcing that the campaign period for the
March 20 presidential and vice presidential election will officially
kick off Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to the gazette, the official campaign period will last
until March 19 and the daily campaign hours will be from 7 a.m. to 10
p.m.</P>
      <P>The CEC also formally announced that there will be two
presidential and vice presidential tickets for the electorate to
choose between.</P>
      <P>In the two-way race, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan will team up with People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong
to challenge the re-election bid of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice
President Annette Lu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>In fact, the two rival camps have been carrying out election
campaign activities for a long time and according to the results of
various public opinion polls, the two tickets are running neck and
neck.</P>
      <P>According to a survey of 2,535 eligible voters conducted by the
China Times between Feb. 16 and Feb. 19, Lien would win 43 percent of
the vote against 40 percent for Chen if the election were to take
place the following day.</P>
      <P>The Chinese-language paper claimed that although Lien has
maintained a roughly 3 percentage point lead over Chen in recent
surveys, this was the first time support for the president had risen
to above 40 percent, which indicates that the race is too close to
call.</P>
      <P>With just 30 days to go before the vote, about 17 percent of
those interviewed were still undecided. The poll allowed for a 2
percent margin of error.</P>
      <P>Despite trailing in most opinion polls, Chen said in a radio
interview broadcast live Thursday that he is confident he will win
the election by between 300,000 and 500,000 votes, which would be a
majority of roughly 3 percent to 5 percent.</P>
      <P>Chen predicted that the outcome will be similar to the race four
years ago, when he defeated Lien and Soong, a former KMT
secretary-general who mounted a maverick presidential bid, in a tight
three-way election, ending more than five decades of KMT rule in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This time around, however, Lien and Soong have formed a joint
presidential ticket to challenge Chen's re-election bid.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A mainland Chinese sampan sank in Republic
of China waters near Kinmen after ramming a Penghu-based fishing boat
in thick fog Friday morning.</P>
      <P>The motor-driven sampan, named the Minlongyu 4052 from Fujian
Province, collided with the Penghu-registered 99-ton fishing boat
"Sheng-Hung-Chuan" in waters near Kinmen's Peiting Isle and capsized
shortly before it sank. The only two crew members of the vessel --
father and son Kang Ahquan, 54 and Kang Ahzhi, 26 -- were rescued by
the crew of the vessel they hit, the Sheng-Hung-Chuan.</P>
      <P>According to the skipper of the Sheng-Hung-Chuan, Chang
Tsai-ling, he did not see the sampan on his radar and the fog was so
thick that his crew members did not see the sampan.</P>
      <P>Chang said they were totally unaware of the presence of the
mainland sampan until they heard a huge "bang" as the two vessels
collided. He added that as soon as he saw the two mainlanders fall
into the water, he instructed three of his crew to jump overboard to
their rescue.</P>
      <P>Chang said that he radioed the Kinmen fishing broadcasting
station for help after discovering that the senior Kang had suffered
injuries to his chest. Both the Kangs were transported to a Kinmen
hospital soon afterward, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Authorities from the Kinmen Coast Guard have begun investigating

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that he
is confident he and Vice President Annette Lu will win a second term
in the March 20 presidential election, although he admitted that the
campaign is very tough.</P>
      <P>The president made the comments in an interview with the Japanese
Asahi TV Station. The content of the interview was broadcast by the
station's "News Station" program Friday night.</P>
      <P>Describing the election campaign as very tough and saying that
the contest may be decided by a razor-thin margin of only 3 percent
to 5 percent of the vote, Chen said that nevertheless, he and Lu will
certainly win the campaign.</P>
      <P>Mainland China wants to use force to change Taiwan's status quo,
the president said in the interview, adding that the island should
have the right and opportunity to say "no" to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chen also hopes that the people of Taiwan will be able to decide
the definitive version of the Constitution by holding another
referendum by 2006.
Saying that Taiwan's first referendum, to be held concurrently
with the presidential election March 20, is aimed at maintaining the
country's status quo as well as protecting
the nation's sovereignty, democratic development and economic
prosperity, the president said that it is also designed to maintain
the cross-Taiwan Strait status quo.</P>
      <P>Saying that Taiwan has the same goals as those of Japan, the
United States and France, the president said that all Taiwan wants is
to maintain the status quo.</P>
      <P>Before televising the interview, the program also introduced Chen
as the leader of the 23 million people of Taiwan and the person who
makes the mainland the most nervous.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the reasons for Beijing's nervousness, the program said
the mainland is worried that Chen's actions will lead Taiwan to
independence if he wins a second term.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN WILL NOT VOTE IN REFERENDUM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  21  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Chairman and
presidential candidate Lien Chan said Saturday that he will not vote
in Taiwan's first-ever referendum, to be held alongside the March 20
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lien, in the second and last live televised debate between him
and President Chen Shui-bian, said that he respects the people's
right to take part in the referendum but will not himself cast his
ballots on the questions concerning the strengthening of the nation's
defenses and the opening of cross-strait dialogue because the
referendum is "illegal" and "controversial."</P>
      <P>Lien was responding to questions by Chen as to why the KMT is
boycotting the referendum when the KMT-led camp passed its version of
the Referendum Law -- the brainchild of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party -- when he acted according to the law in calling
for the referendum.</P>
      <P>Lien said that the Article 17 of the Referendum Law only empowers
the president to call for such a referendum when the nation is
threatened by outside forces so that its sovereignty is at risk of
being changed and claimed that neither of these conditions exist at
present.</P>
      <P>Lien pointed out that mainland China's missiles were deployed
against Taiwan when Chen pledged his "four noes plus one, " promises
-- which included no referendum on the nation's status -- in his 2000
inaugural speech.</P>
      <P>The referendum is also "controversial, " Lien said, claiming that
with only 30 days to go to the presidential election, the public is
not capable to make such major decisions in such a short time. He
also questioned the legality of the referendum and claimed that it is
no more than a ploy to boost Chen's election campaign.</P>
      <P>He said that this is a gross violation of the law by the
president, which is "very discouraging for all those who have
promoted the referendum system."</P>
      <P>Lien told Chen that the spirit of the Referendum Law is clear
and that except for Article 17, the referendum is the right of the
people and not that of the president. He urged the president "to
rein himself in before the brink of the precipice."</P>

The network led by the Pakistani nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer
Khan shipped partly enriched uranium directly to Libya aboard a
Pakistani airplane in 2001, providing the fuel stock in addition to
the designs and technology to make a nuclear bomb, according to a
report by Malaysian investigators released Friday.

The report provides a wealth of evidence that businessmen and
engineers from Turkey, Germany, Switzerland and Britain, as well as
Dubai and Malaysia, were closely involved in recent years in Libya's
clandestine nuclear program. It is based primarily on the Malaysian
authorities' interrogation of B.S.A. Tahir, 44, a key middleman in
Dr. Khan's global nuclear trading network.

But whether the jury will hear from Ms. Stewart, or even

until next week.

U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum said she would rule
Monday on a motion by Ms. Stewart's attorney Robert Morvillo to

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHOULD JOIN INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY: KMT CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  21  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang chairman and
presidential candidate Lien Chan said Saturday that both sides of the
Taiwan Strait should think seriously about letting Taiwan join the
international community and take part in related activities.</P>
      <P>Lien, the sole challenger to President Chen Shui-bian in the
March 20 election, made the remarks during the second and the last of
two live televised debates with Chen prior to the election.</P>
      <P>During a question-and-answer session, Lien was asked by Cheng
Duan-yao, a researcher of the Institute of International Relations
of National Chengchi University, how to make a breakthrough in the
diplomatic plight faced by the nation with the emergence of mainland
China and the gradual erosion of Taiwan's economic edge, which has
resulted in the stalled or even dwindling number of diplomatic
allies.</P>
      <P>Lien was asked how, if his interpretation of "one China" is the
Republic of China, can break the common perception among the
international community of "one China" as meaning the People's
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Lien stressed that under the concept of "one China means the
Republic of China, " both sides engaged in seven or eight years of
dialogue -- although the dialogue stalled after former President Lee
Teng-hui's "special state-to-state" rhetoric of 1999 -- and that a
lot of substantive results were produced during the period.</P>
      <P>He criticized Chen's administration for losses on the diplomatic
front over the years, saying that even the United States, which
Taiwan has relied upon heavily, has had misgivings about the
referendum called by Chen alongside the presidential election.</P>
      <P>He said that if elected, he would cement ties with countries with
which Taiwan has diplomatic relations, and enhance substantive
relations with those countries which are close to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also said that friendly relations between nations should be
based on mutual trust, not on a series of "surprises" -- a dig at the
frequent flip-flops of the current government.</P>
      <P>He said that "Taiwan can contribute a lot to the international
community, " adding that "its performance in every way should be
respected by the world."</P>
      <P>He said that both sides of the Taiwan Strait should think
seriously about a mechanism that would allow Taiwan to join the
international community, and added that both sides should
simultaneously join international organizations and take part in
related activities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS STRAIT TALKS SHOULD BE HELD ON BASIS OF MUTUAL RESPECT: LIEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Presidential candidate Lien Chan urged the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait Saturday to establish a dialogue
mechanism based on mutual respect.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the opposition Kuomintang made the appeal during
the second and final of two live televised debates between him and
President Chen Shui-bian prior to the March 20 election.</P>
      <P>Lien was asked by Chen why he still insists on the so-called "one
China, " when the international community sees "China" as meaning the
People's Republic of China, of which Taiwan is a part, while the
previous KMT administration's long advocation of "one China" has led
Taiwan to become an international pariah.</P>
      <P>However, Lien countered by saying that according to the Republic
of China Constitution, "China" means the Republic of China, which is
what Chen pledged his allegiance to during his inauguration May 20,
2000.</P>
      <P>Lien said the so-called "1992 consensus, " which the KMT believes
was reached between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in 1992, was
based on the concept of "one China, different interpretations" and
not as "one country, two systems" as construed by Chen.</P>
      <P>Lien said that cross-strait relations should start from a
position of mutual respect and that both sides should put aside their
political differences and start dialogue, leaving a solution to the
"one China" issue for the future. Between now and that time, both
sides still need to establish a dialogue mechanism, he said.</P>
      <P>In a question-and-answer session earlier, Lien also spoke about
the three-stage National Unification Guidelines set out by the former
KMT administration.</P>
      <P>He noted that nearly 13 years has passed since the unveiling of
the guidelines, a period in which the nation's environment has
undergone tremendous changes, which leaves a lot of room for
discussion.</P>
      <P>He promised that if elected, he will "invite all political
parties to promote a supra-party national development conference to
forge a new consensus."</P>
      <P>He stressed that both sides of the strait should treat each other
based on the principles of "equality and mutual respect."</P>
      <P>He also defended the mainland China policy of the old KMT
administration, saying that between 1988 and 1995, the two sides
conducted two meetings between Ku Chen-Fu and Wang Daohan, the top
negotiators for the two sides, and nearly 30 cross-strait
consultations, which he said resulted in many substantive agreements.</P>
      <P>"During the same period, Taiwan continued to develop and make
diplomatic breakthroughs, while its society was orderly and
prosperous, " Lien claimed, adding that "this shows that cross-strait
development and Taiwan's development had no conflicts with what we
advocated."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO MAKING PEACE WITH BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that
if he is re-elected in the upcoming presidential election, he hopes to
shake hands and make peace with mainland Chinese President Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>"Ah Bian's biggest hope is that one day in the next four years, I
can shake hands with President Hu Jintao and reconcile," Chen said in
a televised debate with opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, who
is the sole challenger to Chen's re-election bid.</P>
      <P>Chen also said in his concluding speech of a two-hour debate with
Lien that he wants to post a permanent representative to Beijing
before May 20, when the next presidential term begins.</P>
      <P>Although his plan to hold a referendum alongside the March 20
presidential election has drawn broadsides from Beijing, Chen claimed
that his referendum will lend the authority of public opinion to
negotiations with the mainland.</P>
      <P>"That is why we are confident we can begin positive talks and
sign agreements with the mainland if I'm re-elected," Chen said.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan's first-ever referendum, voters will be asked whether
Taiwan should acquire more anti-missile defense capabilities to
defend itself against military threats from mainland China and
whether the island should enter into talks with Beijing for the
establishment of a framework for peaceful interaction.</P>
      <P>In the two-hour debate, Chen portrayed himself as the defender of
Taiwan's sovereignty against the mainland, which sees the island as a
breakaway province that must be brought to heel, by force if
necessary. He attacked Lien's stance on the mainland, saying that
Taiwan is an independent country and not a mere "appendage" to the
mainland.</P>
      <P>"The problem is that during the KMT's long rule, they insisted on
'one China'. This is why Taiwan is an international outcast today, "
Chen said.</P>
      <P>He also accused Lien of having a wishy-washy policy with regard
to the mainland. "Lien doesn't believe in himself. He doesn't believe
in Taiwan," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen also criticized a position backed by Lien's running mate,
People First Party Chairman James Soong, who has said Taiwan and the
mainland can exist under the same "one-China roof."</P>
      <P>"If we're all under a one-China roof, is Taiwan the carpet or the
tile?" Chen asked.</P>
      <P>The wide-ranging debate also touched on women's issues, the
economy, defense, ethnic harmony and equality. But Taiwan's
relationship with the mainland was a major point.</P>
      <P>In the debate, Chen argued that Lien's economic development
initiatives would allow the mainland to swallow Taiwan, which is just
160 kilometers off the mainland coast, while claiming that his own
policies would protect the island from becoming marginalized.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan isn't a springboard to China. It's the center of Asia, "
Chen claimed.</P>
      <P>He also repeated his now famous "four noes plus one" pledge that
he will not make any changes to the status quo of cross-Taiwan Strait
relations as long as the mainland does not attack.</P>
      <P>"Our push for democratic reforms isn't a push for an independence
timetable," he said.</P>
      <P>In his eight-minute conclusion at the end of the debate, Chen
said that if he is re-elected, he will make every possible effort to
have Taiwan admitted into the World Health Organization within two
years.</P>
      <P>He also reaffirmed his commitment to safeguarding Taiwan's
sovereign status, expanding its diplomatic frontiers and continuing
sweeping reforms, including government restructuring, legislative
reform, judicial reform, financial reform and social reform.</P>
      <P>Most important is to prevent a revival of corrupt "black gold"
politics, Chen said, adding that during his second term, he will push
for the passage of major "sunshine bills" to facilitate clean
politics and push the KMT to return its ill-gotten party assets to
the national coffers.</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks delivered prior to the question-and-answer
session, Chen said his administration has had to deal with many "old
ills" left unresolved by the previous KMT administration.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, he claimed that if the Lien-Soong ticket
wins the upcoming poll, it would usher in a return of "black gold"
politics. "It would be like buying a new television set that has an
old 'black gold' image tube installed. That would be a nightmare for
our country," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen also took advantage of the debate to urge the electorate to
vote on the referendum to demonstrate to the world Taiwan's
determination to safeguard its security with peace, rather than war
with mainland China. The referendum results will also push Beijing to
respect Taiwan people's desire for forging a viable mechanism for
peaceful cross-strait interaction.</P>
      <P>The debate was the second and final one of its kind before the
presidnetial poll. The first live TV debate between the two
contenders was held a week ago.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WILL PURSUE VALUE-ADDED INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT: KMT CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan
said Saturday that the nation must follow the path of developing
industry through value-added products.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks in the second and final TV television
debate between himself and President Chen Shui-bian prior to the
March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Asked about Taiwan's industry, which is undergoing a tremendous
transformation because the traditional sectors are flocking out of
the country while the hi-tech sector is facing a bottleneck, Lien
said the direction is clear-cut. He noted that the manufacturing
sector used to be the prime mover of the nation's development, but
with the changing environment, the country has to move from "made in
Taiwan" to "value added in Taiwan or value added by Taiwan."</P>
      <P>He said that the previous KMT administration promoted the idea of
an Asia-Pacific operations center project, but the project was
derailed because of the "go slow, no haste" policy advocated by
former President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>He said the idea of Taiwan as a gateway must be maintained and
added that from this idea, Taiwan could become an assets management,
logistics, investment, design, and research and development center in
Asia and the world.</P>
      <P>Lien also said that in addition to the industrial and
manufacturing sectors, the service sector also has rich potential,
adding that a service sector based on knowledge must be promoted,
while assistance should be given to small- and medium-sized
enterprises, as well as to conventional industries, to help them
create their own brands.</P>
      <P>Agricultural policy, he said, must be based on technology to
create superior agriculture. The government should also take care of
farmers and promote tourism agriculture, Lien said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CAMPAIGNING KICKS OFF WITH LIVE TV DEBATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  21  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The presidential election campaign
officially kicked off Saturday, 28 days before the March 20
presidential poll.</P>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) had issued a gazette Friday
introducing the profiles of the two contending presidential tickets
-- opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan teaming up with
People First Party Chairman James Soong to challenge the re-election
bid of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>According to the CEC gazette, candidates may hold campaign
rallies from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Anyone running over the limit will
face fines of NT$50,000 to NT$500,000 (US$1,500-US$15,000) .
Candidates in major local elections are often willing to pay the
fines in order to stage raucous late-night rallies with blaring
airhorns and laser light shows.</P>
      <P>The CEC is scheduled to finalize the compilation of the
electorate roster at the end of this month and will publish the
roster between March 2 and March 4. Eligible voters can ask for
corrections of the roster within a specified period of time.
The CEC will formally announce March 16 the exact number of voters
eligible to cast ballots in the 11th-term presidential poll.</P>
      <P>According to the CEC schedule, a bulletin detailing the locations
of all polling stations will be issued before March 4. The CEC is
also scheduled to complete ballot printing and distribution of
election bulletins and voting notices by March 17.</P>
      <P>Although the official campaign period began Saturday, the two
rival camps -- the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and
the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP -- have
been mobilizing for months.</P>
      <P>With just four weeks to go before the election, most opinion
polls show that about a fifth of eligible voters remain undecided.
The two candidates are now fighting very hard to win over the swing
voters in what seems certain to be a tight race.</P>
      <P>Government data shows that some 16.4 million people are eligible
to vote, an increase of about 1 million from the 2000 election.</P>
      <P>In addition to electing the president and vice president, voters
will also cast two additional ballots for two questions put forth in
the nation's first-ever referendum to be held alongside the
presidential poll. The questions are whether Taiwan should buy more
anti-missile batteries in the face of mainland China's intensified
military threat and whether Taiwan should negotate a mechanism with
Beijing for peaceful interaction.</P>
      <P>The DPP launched an "Action 100" campaign program Saturday in
connection with the opening of the official campaign period. The
program is aimed at helping the electorate become familiar with the
voting procedure, as voters might not know how to cast their
referendum votes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT DRIFTS FURTHER AWAY FROM PEOPLE: KMT CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan,
the sole challenger of President Chen Shui-bian in the March 20
election, accused Chen Saturday of drifting away from the people,
claiming that even his close allies have turned away from him.</P>
      <P>Lien made his claims while delivering his opening statement in
the second and final of two live television debates between the two
candidates.</P>
      <P>After offering a greeting in mandarin Chinese, Taiwanese, Hakka
and aboriginal languages, Lien wasted no time in claiming that since
the beginning of the presidential campaign, Chen has engaged in a
series of smear strategies.</P>
      <P>"Why all this mudslinging? " Lien asked. "This is because the
election is drawing near, but (Chen's) performance sheet over the
past four years is so lackluster that he simply cannot face the
voters and has to shift the focus from his poor performance."</P>
      <P>According to Lien, this is not his feeling alone, and he cited
blistering attacks from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
by Chang Chun-hung, a DPP heavyweight, the previous day, as well as
passages in a recently published book by former National Security
Bureau Ting Yu-chou, to bolster his claim that Chen is an
inexperienced national leader and that his administration lacks
talented people.</P>
      <P>He then pointed out what he claimed are four major flaws of Chen.</P>
      <P>"Mr. Chen is constrained by his ideology, so that he cannot
rationally analyse many major issues, " Lien claimed, citing the
suspension of construction work on the partially finished Fourth
Nuclear Power Plant in late October 2000 as an example. Chen only
budged and agreed to resume construction in early 2001 under
tremendous pressure from the dominant opposition parties in the
legislature.</P>
      <P>"The temporary suspension cost the government an additional NT$93
billion (US$2.8 billion), domestic investment has shed NT$450 billion
every year and the plummeting stock market has caused incalculable
losses," according to Lien, who added that this proves "a wrong
policy is even worse than corruption."</P>
      <P>Lien further claimed that Chen "is ignorant of the international
situation" so that he has insisted on holding his referendum on
enhancing anti-missile capability and resuming cross-Taiwan strait
talks despite misgivings by Taiwan's closest friends, including the
United States, Japan, France and even the Vatican. l</P>
      <P>Lien quoted U.S. President George W. Bush, who said that "the
comments and actions made by the leader of Taiwan indicate that he
may be willing to make decisions unilaterally to change the status
quo, which we oppose." According to Lien, Taiwan has never before
been in this plight in its dealings with foreign relations.</P>
      <P>Chen is "helpless" in dealing with cross-strait relations, so
that four years after he advocated the promotion of direct trade,
postal and transportation between the two sides, the links still have
not gone anywhere, Lien went on.</P>
      <P>"Chen has also drifted further away from the people, " Lien
continued, claiming that social division has become more acute during
his rule and adding that recently, a mother took her own life as well
as those of her three young daughters because she could not repay a
NT$200,000 debt.</P>
      <P>"Under Chen's rule, Taiwan set a record high 3,053 suicides
annually, " Lien said, adding that the tragic number is even higher
than the number of victims of the devastating earthquake of Sept. 21,
1999.</P>
      <P>He also claimed that social order has worsened, saying that media
reports have said that 1 million households were burglarized last
year, resulting in estimated losses of more than NT$100 billion.</P>
      <P>He concluded by saying with emotion that his ancestors have lived
in Taiwan for 10 generations and that he wants to work for a better
Taiwan with hope if elected.</P>
      <P>He painted his vision of Taiwan as a place of "ethnic harmony."
He said that if elected, he will also work to mend fences with foreign
friends and allies based on the credibility lost under Chen.</P>
      <P>Lien also promised to develop the nation's economy and address
the jobless question, rising debts and the widening gap between rich
and poor.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT EXPOUNDS VISION FOR TAIWAN IN LIVE TV DEBATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian outlined his
vision for Taiwan's future Saturday in a second live TV debate with
his sole challenger in the March 20 presidential election, opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>In his eight-minute conclusion at the end of the debate, Chen
said that if he is re-elected, he will make every possible effort to
have Taiwan admitted into the World Health Organization within two
years.</P>
      <P>He also reaffirmed his commitment to safeguarding Taiwan's
sovereign status and expanding its diplomatic frontiers.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan is an independent sovereign country, Chen
said any change to the present status quo must be approved by the
people of Taiwan through referendum.</P>
      <P>He further pledged to do whatever he can to normalize
relations across the Taiwan Strait, including establishing a viable
mechanism for peaceful bilateral interaction.</P>
      <P>"If I'm re-elected, we'll have an envoy stationed in Beijing
shortly after the May 20 presidential inauguration, " Chen claimed
confidently, adding that he will make all-out efforts to promote
cross-strait reconciliation and rapprochement during his second term.</P>
      <P>The president also said he will promote Taiwan's constitutional
reforms on the "four noes plus one" pledge outlined in his 2000
inaugural speech. The "four noes plus one" pledge refers to no change
to Taiwan's official title or flag, as well as no holding of a
referendum on the independence versus unification issue.</P>
      <P>His remarks were seen as a response to opposition accusations
that his plan for constitutional reform, such as formulating a new
constitution for Taiwan in 2006, is a timetable for pursuing de jure
Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>"The ultimate goal of our constitutional reform plan is to make
Taiwan a normal, complete and great country," Chen asserted.</P>
      <P>Key points of his constitutional reform plan include modifying
Taiwan's current five-branch central government system to a
three-branch one, halving the number of legislative seats and
implementing a new "single seat, two ballots" system for legislative
elections.</P>
      <P>The two-hour debate was the second and final of the two live TV
debates between the two presidential candidates to be held before the
March 20 presidential poll. The first debate was held last Saturday.</P>
      <P>The wide-ranging debate also touched on women's issues, the
economy and defense. But Taiwan's relationship with mainland China
was a major point.</P>
      <P>The debate followed the same format adopted in the first
one a week ago. At the beginning, each candidate delivered an
eight-minute opening speech, followed by a question-and-answer
session in which five questioners took turn asked the two
candidates various issues. Each questioner asked two questions. After
a 15-minute intermission, the candidates asked each other
five questions before ending with an eight-minute conclusion.</P>
      <P>The five questioners were Chang Wu-euh, director of the
Graduate Institute of China Studies, Tamkang University; Cheng
Duan-yau, a researcher at the Institute of International Relations,
National Chengchi University; Huang Chang-ling, an associate
professor of policial science at the National Taiwan University; Sun
Ta-chuan, a former vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council of
Indigenous Peoples's Affairs; and Chen Tain-jy, president of the
Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research.</P>
      <P>The debate was co-sponsored by Public Television Service (PTS) and
several other news organizations. In addition to PTS, nearly all
major local TV and radio stations broadcast the debate live. PTS also
cooperated with Chunghwa Telecom to provide a live Web feed.</P>

two-hour debate shortly after 2 p.m.</P>
      <P>PBS Chairman Wu Feng-shan, who moderated the debate, urged the

opinion, meaning that they should "focus more on stating their own
views instead of engaging in debates and should not dodge questions

      <P>The two-hour debate was divided into two parts. In the first
part, each candidate gave an eight-minute opening statement, followed

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER YU EXPLAINS ADVANTAGES OF HI-TECH IN TAIWAN TO MEETING IN U.S.</HEADLINE>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun on Sunday encouraged
individuals from around the world who are talented in high-technology
to work in Taiwan and spoke of the advantages of investment in the
island by hi-tech companies.</P>
      <P>Yu spoke via a teleconference Sunday to participants at a meeting
in Silicon Valley, California, organized to inform them of the
Republic of China government's efforts to facilitate the upgrading of
Taiwan's industry and its emphasis on technology in the economy.</P>
      <P>Yu quoted a 2003 World Economic Forum (WEF) report as indicating
that Taiwan's competitiveness in the scientific-technology sector
ranked third worldwide and topped all Asian countries.</P>
      <P>The ranking illustrates that despite diplomatic shortcomings,
Taiwan has secured sustainable growth and has sharpened its
international competitiveness, thanks to concerted efforts by both
the government and the private sector, Yu said.</P>
      <P>Yu said that facing increasing globalization and competitiveness
from industrially advanced countries, Taiwan must first free itself
from contract-manufacturing constraints and then secure positions in
industries of creativity, cross-border business operations and
marketing- and service-oriented businesses.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan authorities have picked electronics,
telecommunications, information services, bio-technology and
nanotechnology as the five core industries to be developed in a new
nationwide industrial development plan.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, many new "star" industries are expected to become
established in Taiwan, with leading foreign companies investing in
Taiwan and making the island their research and development hub, Yu
said.</P>
      <P>Yu also said that production from the Hsinchu Science-based
Industrial Park, Taiwan's "Silicon Valley, " is expected to top NT$1
trillion (US$30 billion) this year, while the island's semiconductor
manufacturing industry is also estimated to churn out products worth
another NT$1 trillion.</P>
      <P>Production from Taiwan's TFT LCD manufacturing companies as a
whole is also estimated to exceed that of South Korea's output this
year to make Taiwan the largest maker of TFT LCDs in the world, Yu
noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The third phase of an ongoing operation to
crack down on people smuggling netted 68 illegal mainland Chinese, an
Executive Yuan task force reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>Fifteen Taiwan citizens who were helping the people traffickers,
commonly referred to as "snakeheads," were also apprehended.</P>
      <P>The latest "Snakehead Hungting" operation was conducted in a
five-hour islandwide sweep that began at 10 p.m. Saturday by a joint
force headed by the Executive Yuan to hunt down people smugglers and
manned by agents from the Coast Guard Administration and the Criminal
Investigation Bureau.</P>
      <P>Since the operation began on Nov. 1, 2003, 873 illegal mainland
Chinese and 236 Taiwan accomplices have been taken into custody, said
a spokesman for the task force.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that in accordance with Article 79 of the
Statute Governing Relations Between People from the Taiwan Area and
the Mainland Area passed by the Legislative Yuan last year, the
masterminds of cross-strait human trafficking operations face jail
terms of up to five years and fines of up to NT$10 million if
convicted.</P>
      <P>Owners of boats used for human trafficking could have their
shipping rights suspended, licenses revoked or their vessels
confiscated, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan people involved in human trafficking will be
arrested and held according to relevant statutes.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan task force officials urged the general public to
help law enforcement authorities thwart cross-strait human
trafficking by informing police at 110 or by calling the Coast Guard
Administration at 118 if they see any suspicious individuals.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLARS FAVOR APPRECIATION OF NEW TAIWAN DOLLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In the face of continued price hikes in
staple commodities in the international market, Taiwan's central bank
should consider allowing the local currency to appreciate rather than
just interfering in its value, scholars said over the weekend.</P>
      <P>Schive Chi and Yeh Wang-an, both well-known economists who also
serve as advisory members to the Cabinet-level Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics, opined that the Central Bank of
China (CBC) should allow the new Taiwan dollar to gain in value
adequately against the U. S. dollar to help local companies better
run their businesses.</P>
      <P>If the price of major import products, such as oil and steel,
continues to rise, it will result in a greater difficulty for many
Taiwan-based enterprises in their operations, as the pressure from
the domestic market pushing up the price of imported goods has
reduced while export prices of domestic products also have begun to
fall, they said.</P>
      <P>Under such circumstances, the CBC should permit the local
currency to appreciate at an adequate time in order to help ease
operation pressure on domestic business, they contended, adding that
it is a better strategy than interfering in the market trying to stop
its appreciation.</P>
      <P>Rising import product prices and falling prices for locally-made
goods is an indication that the domestic economy has not
substantially improved, they explained, pointing to the fact that the
local currency has effectively devalued compared to other currencies.
A weak new Taiwan dollar has put many domestic companies in a very
difficult business condition, they argued.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, sources of the domestic banking industry forecast that
the new Taiwan dollar will drop to 33.3 against the U. S. dollar this
week, mainly because of a devaluated Japanese yen. The Japanese yen
lost in value against the U. S. dollar to stand at 109 by the end of
last week, a level lower than the much anticipated range between 105
and 108.</P>
      <P>The local currency ended at 33.22 against the greenback last
Friday, a fall of NT$0.09 compared to its week-earlier level.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NOT VOTING IN REFERENDUM IS A WIN FOR MAINLAND CHINA: PRESIDENT CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  22  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged his
countrymen Sunday to be sure to vote in the country's first national
referendum on March 20, saying that not doing so would be tantamount
to handing a victory to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Speaking to a group of his supporters in Taipei City, the
president called on the people to show their resentment towards
Beijing's military threat against Taiwan, claiming that the number of
Beijing's missiles targeting Taiwan increases at the rate of one
every six days.</P>
      <P>He criticize his only rival in the presidential race, Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman Lien Chan, as "selfish" by branding the referendum
illegal and vowing in Saturday's presidential debate that he would
not participate in the referendum voting.</P>
      <P>Chen said Lien has set a bad example for the country by taking
the law into his own hands and determining on his own that the
referendum is illegal.</P>
      <P>The power to declare the referendum legal or not is held by the
Council of Grand Justices, Chen said, adding that Lien is usurping
the power of the Grand Justices by declaring the referendum illegal.</P>
      <P>He also criticized Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou for trying to carry
out the referendum in a way different from that stipulated by the
Executive Yuan, saying the mayor is trying to create chaos within the
government.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has ordered that voters be given three ballots
at polling stations: one for the presidential election and two for
each of the referendum questions. Voters are to then mark the ballots
and place them in each of the three boxes marked accordingly.</P>
      <P>Mayor Ma has decided that in Taipei, voters will only be given a
ballot to vote for president upon entering polling stations. After
voters have marked this ballot and deposited it in the box for
presidential election ballots, the voters will then be able to pick
up the other two ballots for the referendum.</P>
      <P>"If the mayor can refuse to abide by the central government's
decree on the excuse that it is not legal, the city's residents can
follow suit and refuse to comply with the decisions of the mayor, "
the president said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a campaign worker for Lien explained Sunday that the
KMT presidential candidate was speaking of his personal view rather
than the party's line when he said the previous day that he would not
vote in the March 20 referendum, which he said is not based on law.</P>
      <P>Huang Teh-fu, who is in charge of public opinion surveys for
Lien's presidential campaign, said the official policy of the KMT and
People First Party (PFP) , the KMT's ally in the presidential race,
remains, " Vote for Lien in the presidential election, but decide for
yourself whether to vote in the referendum."</P>
      <P>"That means we respect the voters' decisions on the referendum
rather than calling for them to follow Lien's example," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Both Lien and his running mate, PFP Chairman James Soong, have
said they would not vote in the referendum, saying that it is
illegal.</P>
      <P>However, their chief campaign manager, Legislative Yuan President
Wang Jin-pyng, said he will vote in the referendum but Mayor Ma was
unwilling to commit, saying that as the vote is supposed to be
secret, he prefers to keep his cards close to his chest.</P>
      <P>In Hsinchuang, Taipei County, Ma also said that his camp will not
try to influence followers of the party to take a position on the
referendum.</P>
      <P>But he defended the way Taipei is to implement the referendum,
saying that the method for voting was reached by a non-partisan
subcommittee of the city's election commission, which is simpler and
less likely to cause confusion than the way worked out by the
Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The election commission's greatest concern is that the referendum
vote goes smoothly, not to have a referendum that produces an
outcome favorable to any political party.</P>

    <DATELINE>Chiayi County,  Feb. 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Jen Lien Bridge across a steep
valley of Mt. Tuli in the southern county of Chiayi was inaugurated
and officially opened to public traffic Sunday, marking the 306th
bridge that the renowned Chiayi Philanthropy Group has built around
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Volunteers of the Chiayi Philanthropy Group (CPG) -- founded by
philanthropist and Ramon Magsaysay Award winner Ho Ming-teh -- spent
three months and only about NT$1.8 million (US$55,900) to built the
35-meter steel wire bridge connecting the Chuchi rural township
and Mt. Tuli, a scenic attraction but hard to reach without a
bridge.</P>
      <P>According to Liu Ning-ching, an abbot of a temple in Chuchi, the
bridge was built in three months and is 2.5 meters wide. The single
arch cable bridge has been overwhelmingly welcomed by mountain
climbers who would otherwise walk nearly 10 hours to reach Mt. Dooli.</P>
      <P>Tons of cable and cement were transported to the building site
little by little by a makeshift mini cable car suspended on ropes and
as were the bridge building volunteers, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Huang Yi-rong, one of the construction supervisors, tripped and
slipped down the valley one day and was critically injured. It took
several hours for other volunteers to carry him to a Chuchi hospital,
where he underwent a six-hour operation.</P>
      <P>Huang, however, recovered in a miraculously speedy period,
allowing him to return to the building location to work a week later,
according to Liu.</P>
      <P>CPG founder Ho Ming-teh, winner of the 1995 Ramon Magsaysay Award
for community leadership, died at the age of 77 in early 1998 shortly
after the Chinese New Year.</P>
      <P>Ho received the Ramon Magsaysay Award for his selfless dedication
to "improving rural Taiwan through good deeds and sturdy bridges, "
making him the ninth Republic of China citizen to receive the
prestigious award, named after a popular Philippine president who
died in a plane crash in 1957.</P>
      <P>Ho, a devout Buddhist, and his followers built their first bridge
in June 1971 after a flood took the lives of two young brothers on
their way to school. Since then, more than 200,000 supporters have
contributed to the Ho-founded CPG, either financially or in the form
of volunteer labor in the construction of the bridges.</P>
      <P>Over the past 32 years, the group has built a total of 305
bridges in remote rural areas of central and southern Taiwan, with
the just-completed Jen Lien Bridge being the 306th.</P>
      <P>The bridges built by the group, ranging from six meters to 160
meters in length, have all stood firm since their completion, strong
enough to brave the typhoons that sweep over Taiwan each year.</P>

      <P>Believing that Taiwan's business climate is
picking up, some 60 percent of the companies in Taiwan will expand
their operations this year, according to an opinion poll released
Sunday.</P>
      <P>A total of 60.93 percent of Taiwan's companies responding to the
survey conducted by the 1111 Human Resource Bank said they will
continue expanding their business operations and enlarging the number
of people on the payroll.</P>
      <P>Only about 10 percent of the companies surveyed said they will
reduce the number of their personnel, the poll conducted between Jan.
30 and Feb. 15 found.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a total 52.69 percent of the companies that responded
said pay raises for every staff member is expected this year on the
premise that the business environment is gaining momentum.</P>
      <P>Of the companies surveyed, supermarket chain Carrefour, for
example, has announced that it will need 450 more people this year to
work at its stores islandwide, while hardware chain B&amp;Q is planning
to enlarge its staff by 5 percent to 10 percent this year.</P>
      <P>Of the different areas in the business sector, computer and
electronics companies and stocks and securities firms continue to top
Taiwan companies seeking new employees, although many Taiwan computer
and electronics companies have relocated part of their manufacturing
operations to mainland China in recent years, according to Wu

Resource Bank found that 37 percent of Taiwan's salaried workers
succeeded in finding a new job and had began to work at a new company
after the Chinese New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>The poll, with 1,777 valid responses, found that job seekers
spent an average of 1.6 months to successfully find new employment.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that the number of job seekers was about
twice that before Chinese New Year, while the number of vacancies
that were made available by different companies also increased

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The trend of the new Taiwan dollar toward
appreciation against the U. S. dollar may suffer a short-term setback
this week, prompted mainly by a depreciating Japanese yen, sources in
the banking industry said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The sources forecast that the new Taiwan dollar may continue to
drop to 33.3 against the U.S dollar this week as a result of the
Japanese yen's recent depreciation against the greenback. The
Japanese yen lost in value against the U. S. dollar and stood at 109
as of last Friday, a level lower than the much-anticipated range
between 105 and 108.</P>
      <P>Fueled by pressure from a devalued Japanese yen, the local
currency closed at 33.22 against the U. S. dollar last Friday, down
by NT$0.09 from its week-earlier level of 33.13.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the sources pointed out that the new Taiwan dollar will
continue a depreciating trend this week because of a weaker Japanese
yen and a sluggish market demand for the U. S. dollar.</P>
      <P>Due to a huge influx of foreign capital and a robust anticipation
that Asian currencies will pick up in value against the U. S. dollar,
the new Taiwan dollar had experienced two rounds of noticeable
appreciation against the U. S. currency following the Chinese New
Year holiday season in late January.</P>
      <P>Many local businesses have sold large amounts of U. S. dollars
over the past few weeks in exchange for a rising new Taiwan dollar,
with the daily trading volume amounting to over US$1 billion in the
Taipei foreign exchange market.</P>

      <P>One day before a bill comes before the
Legislative Yuan limiting when individuals running for office can
receive donations, President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President
Annette Lu released information Sunday on the amount and nature of
the money so far donated to them for their re-election bid,</P>
      <P>The campaign headquarters of the incumbent president and vice
president announced that it has received 68,829 donations totaling
NT$279.90 million (US$8.42 million) thus far.</P>
      <P>Wu Nei-jen, the campaign manager for Chen and Lu said at a news
conference that 105, or NT$15.25 million, has come from for-profit
institutions; seven, or NT$1.71 million, from non-profit
institutions; and NT$7.19 million from an unspecified political
party.</P>
      <P>The president and vice president had promised a private group
pushing for a clean and fair campaign that they would make public the
details of the donations they have received.</P>
      <P>This information will be provided on the Web site of the campaign
headquarters as agreed to by Chen and Lu to the private group.</P>
      <P>Chen's rival in the presidential race, Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Lien Chan, didn't followed suit Sunday, although Lien and his running
mate, People First Party Chairman James Soong, had made a similar
promise.</P>
      <P>However, Chang Che-sheng, a KMT official in charge of raising
funds for the campaign, told journalists that his party had raised
about NT$200 million from some 30,000 donors by the end of last year.</P>
      <P>The donations that the party received this year have yet to be
determined, he said, but all of them have been recorded clearly and
were made in accordance with regulations that no more than NT$3
million come from a single company and no more than NT$200,000 from a
single person.</P>
      <P>Chang said his party will not make public the list of its donors
on its Web site out of concerns that the individuals could be
harassed by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, which is in a
tight race with the KMT for the presidency.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the political parties at the Legislative Yuan are
expected to endorse a political donations bill Monday. After
negotiations, the parties all agreed that people campaigning for
public office can receive donations only during the officially
designated campaign period, according to a lawmaker from the People
First Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>At the insistence of the PFP, an article in the bill that would
have allowed those running for public office to take in limited
donations outside of the official campaigning period was tossed out,
PFP Legislator Lee Yung-ping said.</P>
      <P>With this thorny issue sorted out, Lee said, the bill might be
enacted before the March 20 presidential election, unless other
controversies crop up.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NOBEL LAUREATE REAFFIRMS PROMISE TO WORK FOR CROSS-STRAIT PEACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh
said Monday he would still be willing to head a panel to promote
peaceful cross-Taiwan Strait interaction even if the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" won the presidency in the upcoming election.</P>
      <P>Lee, a co-winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize in chemistry, made the
remarks at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Science, Technology
and Information Committee.</P>
      <P>During the session, Legislator Chiu Yung-jen of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) asked Lee whether he has accepted
President Chen Shui-bian's invitation to serve as a co-convener of a
special panel to push for the establishment of a viable mechanism for
cross-strait peaceful interaction.</P>
      <P>"Yes, I have accepted the president's invitation, " Lee said.
"Nevertheless, I have also expressed my hope that this will not be
used as a presidential campaign tool to be played up and that the
special panel will not begin operations until after the March 20
presidential election. Otherwise, I think it might trigger extremely
complicated effects."</P>
      <P>At the same session, opposition People First Party (PFP)
Legislator Pang Chien-kuo asked Lee whether he will still be willing
to head a similar task force to boost cross-strait peaceful
interaction if the "pan-blue alliance" ticket of Kuomintang Chairman
Lien Chan and PFP Chairman James Soong wins the election.</P>
      <P>"I'll be willing to take up such a post if Lien invites me, " Lee
said.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he would come forward to endorse either of the two
presidential tickets, Lee said he would be willing to reveal his
choice if he is asked.</P>
      <P>"But I have not yet made up my mind. I'm still studying the
platforms and visions outlined by the two rival camps. When I come to
a conclusion, I would be willing to express my opinion," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Many observers said they believed that Lee's public support for
Chen on the eve of the 2000 preisential election had contributed
to Chen's upset win in that race with a narrow margin.</P>
      <P>Last Thursday, President Chen said in a radio interview that if
he is re-elected, he will immediately form a special panel to work
for the establishment of a cross-strait interactive mechanism.</P>
      <P>"And both Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh and a respected
business executive have agreed to jointly head the special panel, "
Chen said, adding that he would withhold the tycoon's name to save
the tycoon any unnecessary trouble ahead of the hotly contested
presidential election.</P>

deliver at the Penghu Cross-Sea Bridge at 12: 30 p.m. to appeal to
Penghu voters to take part in the "one million hand-in-hand" activity
slated to be held Feb. 28 islandwide. The activity is meant to
symbolize determination and esprit de corps in protecting Taiwan
through peace, according to Chen Kuang-fu, head of Chen's campaign
headquarters in Penghu.</P>
      <P>The "one million hand-in-hand" activity, seen by many as aimed at
drumming up support for Chen in his bid for re-election, will take
place on 2-28 Peace Memorial Day, with people from around the country
joining hands to form a colossal human chain and shouting "Taiwan
yes, China no! " at 2:28 p.m.</P>

his respects to the gods and goddesses at two local temples and ask
for their blessing in his re-election bid.</P>

      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien
denied Monday that his ministry tried to lure Scottish actor Sir Sean
Connery to attend a local political activity organized to mark Feb.
28 Peace Day with a large appearance fee.</P>

his ministry did approach the actor, well-known for his on-screen
role as James Bond, over the possibility of him visiting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting the actor has expressed personal sympathy for President
Chen Shui-bian, Chien said his ministry contacted Sir Sean through
its offices in Los Angeles and London before the end of last year, in
the hope that his appearance in Taiwan would boost the country's
diplomacy. The ministry did not receive a reply.</P>
      <P>He denied that his ministry offered Sir Sean a high appearance

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will repeat its attempts to enter
the World Health Organization (WHO) as an observer, an official from
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Tung Kuo-you, director of the International Organizations
Department under the MOFA told the Legislative Yuan that Taiwan will
apply for WHO observer status as a health entity rather than a
country, given the fact that only a few WHO members recognize the
island as a country.</P>
      <P>MOFA will enlist the help of the country's legislature and
private sector in its efforts, Tung said.</P>
      <P>Tung said the MOFA's overseas offices are trying hard to win
support from their host countries for Taiwan's WHO bid, on the
grounds that it is unfair to exclude Taiwan from the world health
body and is detrimental to the WHO's efforts to control disease
around the world.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has tried to secure access to the WHO since 1997 and made
a strong case for its bid during the WHO's last annual meeting in
May, 2003, thanks to the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory
syndrome in Asia that drove home the fact that no country can be
excluded in the world's fight against epidemics.</P>
      <P>Many prominent WHO members expressed sympathy for Taiwan's bids
at the time, but the World Health Assembly -- the WHO governing body
-- turned down Taiwan's request because of Beijing's vociferous
protests.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FIRST LADY INSISTS NO LAW-BREAKING IN STOCK TRADING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>First lady Wu Shu-chen said Monday that
President Chen Shui-bian's public apology for her stock trading
activities does not imply that she has broken any rules in conducting
her transactions.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference to introduce a newly published
picture book of her high-profile European tour last July that took
her to Germany and the Holy See, Wu said she has honestly reported
her stock trading records in accordance with regulations set by the
watchdog Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>"Anybody who scrutinizes my reports will see that I have never
been involved in any insider trading, nor have I committed any
irregularities in my stock trading activities," Wu said.</P>
      <P>The wheelchair-bound first lady reportedly has taken up stock
trading as a hobby. However, her trading has come under fire in
recent weeks as the presidential race has hotted up.</P>
      <P>During last Saturday's televised debate between Chen and
opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan -- the sole challenger to
his re-election bid -- Lien claimed that in the United States, the
first lady's stock trading activities would be tantamount to
political suicide. Lien said he had promised to put his family assets
into a blind trust if he wins the presidency and that he wanted to
know Chen's opinion about his wife's stock trading.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen pointed out that he had already made a public
pledge to put his family assets into trust after the March 20
presidential election and that his wife will take a break in her
stock trading activities prior to the poll.</P>
      <P>Chen further said that even though his wife has not committed any
wrongdoing or insider trading, he agreed that such activities are
inappropriate for her at this time. "And for this, I'm willing to
apologize," Chen said in the live TV debate.</P>
      <P>At Monday's news conference, Wu said Chen's apology was mainly
aimed at stopping the controversy surrounding the issue.</P>
      <P>"The president's apology should not be interpreted as implying
that I have done anything illegal. And if I really had broken any
rule, I would be willing to receive punishment in accordance with the
law, " Wu said, adding that she would respect her husband's decision
and stop trading in the run-up to the poll.</P>
      <P>During the news conference, Wu also called Oscar-winning movie
star Sean Connery her idol and said she felt sorry that the Scottish
megastar will not be joining a human-chain rally in Taiwan this
weekend in protest against mainland China's missile threat. Wu said
she had been watching Sean Connery as James Bond since she was in
elementary school.</P>
      <P>Organizers of the peace protest claimed last week that Connery
planned to attend the Feb. 28 event, but Connery's agent later said
the actor had never planned to be part of the human-chain
demonstration that's supposed to stretch the length of Taiwan -- more
than 300 kilometers.</P>
      <P>The Feb. 28 "one-million-persons-hand-in-hand" rally is supposed
to urge mainland China to redeploy nearly 500 ballistic missiles
pointed at Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu said she would be willing to visit the mainland in
her capacity as the Republic of China first lady, "but only if
Beijing were to recognize my capacity as the ROC's first lady, " Wu
said.</P>
      <P>Wu, who has been confined to a wheelchair since being run over by
a truck in 1985, has conducted several high-profile overseas
tours over the past four years, including visits to the United
States, France, Germany, the Czech Republic and the Holy See.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese who do not live in
mainland China will be allowed to tour Taiwan individually after a
panel under the Executive Yuan decided Monday to abolish the
requirement that such people arrive in and leave Taiwan in groups.</P>
      <P>The panel made the decision after setting a goal of attracting
3.2 million foreign visitors -- including 200,000 mainlanders -- this
year.</P>
      <P>At present, only mainlanders living outside the mainland are
allowed to tour Taiwan and only as part of a tour group. They are
forbidden from moving around alone during their stay in the country.</P>
      <P>About 170,000 overseas mainlanders visited Taiwan in 2002 for
sightseeing, but the number plunged to 130,000 in 2003 mainly because
of the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The panel set up to boost local tourism decided to ease the
requirements in the hope that the move will help boost the number of
mainland visitors to the level of 200,000 this year.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that
he will continue to promote talks on the resumption of Taiwan-South
Korea airlinks based on the principles of reciprocity and mutual
benefit.</P>
      <P>Receiving visiting Kyungnam University President Pak Chae Gyu of
South Korea at the Presidential Office, Chen noted that Taiwan and
South Korea maintain close trade and economic relations.</P>
      <P>Two-way trade between the two countries amounted to US$13 billion
last year, with a surplus of US$4 billion in favor of South Korea,
Chen said, adding that South Korea is Taiwan's fifth-largest trading
partner.</P>
      <P>Given that commercial and tourist travel between Taiwan and South
Korea is increasing, the present system of charter flights between
the two countries is not the normal way to meet increasing flight
service demands, Chen told his guest.</P>
      <P>Air transport links between Taiwan and South Korea have been
suspended since 1992, when Seoul switched its diplomatic ties from
Taipei to Beijing.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Chen and Pak also exchanged views on the
situation in the Taiwan Strait and the Korean peninsula. Pak is a
former South Korean minister of unification.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he has presented a proposal for establishing a
framework for cross-strait peaceful and stable interaction after the
March 20 presidential election, and he expressed hope that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait can hold talks based on the principle of
peace on four major issues -- the establishment of a negotiation
mechanism, exchanges based on equality and reciprocity, the
establishment of a political relationship and the prevention of
military conflicts.</P>
      <P>Pak should have a great deal of practical experience in dealing
with North Korea, which is worthy of note by Taiwan, Chen added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEC TO COUNT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION BALLOTS BEFORE REFERENDUM VOTES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) said
Monday it will not begin to count the referendum ballots until after
the outcome of the March 20 presidential election has been announced.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's
Interior Affairs Committee, CEC Chairman Huang Shih-cheng said the
CEC has decided to complete vote-counting for the election before
calculating the ballots cast for the two referendum questions.</P>
      <P>Huang said the arrangement is designed to avoid unnecessary
confusion and to speed up the presidential ballot-counting.</P>
      <P>"We'll first focus on counting the election ballots. In the
process, we'll sort out any presidential ballots mistakenly placed
into referendum ballot boxes. By so doing, we believe we will be able
to announce the election results by 8 p.m. on election day, " Huang
told lawmakers.</P>
      <P>In the 2000 presidential election, the CEC managed to announce
the final result at 7:26 p.m. on election day.</P>
      <P>This time around, voters will not only elect the president but
will also cast two additional ballots on two referendum questions.</P>
      <P>Huang said election workers at polling stations around the
country will not begin to count referendum ballots until after the
election outcome has been announced.</P>
      <P>The two referendum questions are whether Taiwan should purchase
more anti-missile batteries in the face of mainland China's
intensified missile build-up against Taiwan and whether Taiwan should
negotiate with Beijing a viable mechanism for peaceful interaction.
The questions will be printed on two separate ballots.</P>

two-and-a-half-year low of 4.53 percent in January, according to
statistics compiled by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting
and Statistics (DGBAS) under the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The rate is expected to decline to between 4.7 percent and 4.8

for 2004 is estimated at 4.74 percent, a DGBAS official said Monday.</P>
      <P>If the Executive Yuan's ongoing program to create temporary
jobs can be extended for another six months, the rate will be cut by
another 0.1 percent to between 4.6 percent and 4.7 percent, or even
4.5 percent if economic growth is better than expected, the official
said.</P>
      <P>The NT$20 billion (US$601.59 million) job-creation program will
expire at the end of the June and the Council of Labor Affairs is
seeking an extra NT$7 billion or NT$8 billion to extend the program.</P>
      <P>With an unemployment rate of 4.53 percent, the official said,
Taiwan fares better than Hong Kong, the United States and Japan which
have jobless rates of 7.3 percent, 4.5 percent and 4.9 percent,
respectively, but fares worse than South Korea and Britain, whose
unemployment rates stand at 3.1 percent.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>First lady Wu Shu-chen said Monday that if
Beijing were to recognize her position as the Republic of China's
first lady, she would consider visiting mainland China.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks at the Presidential Office during the launch
of an illustrated book that chronicles her high-profile European
visit which took her to Germany and the Holy See last July.</P>
      <P>Joseph Wu, vice secretary-general to President Chen Shui-bian,
Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Kao Ying-mau and National Palace Museum
Director Tu Cheng-sheng also attended the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Asked by the media if she is willing to help Chen to visit the
mainland, she said that if the mainland recognizes her as the first
lady, then that could be a possibility.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan is denigrated into the position of a local government
under Beijing, I would not accept the situation," she said.</P>
      <P>Wu noted Taiwan's difficult diplomatic plight and said that in
her first lady position, her job is to serve the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Wu said that during her several overseas visits, she realized
that Taiwan's diplomatic work could be better.</P>
      <P>"One must have confidence in oneself, " Wu said, adding that
Taiwan should not be described as small since compared with some
other countries, Taiwan is not so small.</P>
      <P>"Both the education level of the people and the nation's per

must respect oneself if one wants respect from others.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan must stand up for itself, otherwise no-one else will
help, even if they want to," she said.</P>
      <P>Wu, who has been confined to a wheelchair since being run over by

    <HEADLINE>JOB-CREATION PROJECT MAY BE EXTENDED UNTIL END OF YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is considering extending its
job-creation program for another six months to the end of the year,
Liu San-chi, director-general of the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics, said Monday.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks while fielding questions at the Legislative
Yuan concerning unemployment.</P>
      <P>Liu said that the jobless rate was 4.99 percent last year, and it
is estimated that it will drop to 4.5 percent at best this year. With
the changing industrial structure and businesses becoming larger, he
said that it may be impossible to cut the employment rate to below
4.5 percent.</P>
      <P>As the job-creation project is only scheduled to run until June,
legislators also expressed concern that the jobless rate could rise
again after the project stops.</P>
      <P>Liu said that the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) is planning to
extend the project to the end of the year, saying that this will
incur an additional cost of NT$7 billion to NT$8 billion (US$211.48
million to US$241.69 million) to the government, which he said could
be financed from the employment stabilization fund, and that
financing will not be a problem.</P>
      <P>CLA officials also said that the council is now mapping out
related measures to help those who are jobless for an extended
period.</P>
      <P>They said that they will initially use NT$400 million to help the
long-term jobless by subsidizing employers so that they can learn
some working skills during a specific period of time.</P>
      <P>They stressed that the measure aims to provide substantive
assistance to the jobless for their future employment, and not as a
subsidy " for a post," or to reduce the labor cost of the employers.</P>
      <P>They also said that when providing subsidies to employers, it
will take into consideration the "training and substantive assistance
extended to the hired laborers."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A center for the prevention of domestic
violence and sexual abuse in Taipei said Monday that it received nine
reports of sexual abuse concerning foreign laborers last year, but
admitted that many cases may have gone unreported.</P>
      <P>Center officials made the remarks after a private women's group
claimed that 16 percent of all Taipei's foreign laborers had been
sexually abused.</P>
      <P>The officials said that among the nine reported cases concerning
foreign laborers, three were forced molestations and six were forced
intercourse. All of the cases have been handled according to the law,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>The claim of 16 percent made by the Taipei Association for the
Promotion of Women's Rights would need to be supported with proof
before such a figure could be taken as fact, officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials said, "There is indeed a high percentage of sexual
abuse cases that go unreported, " and that if a private group learns
of a foreign labor who has been sexually abused, it must encourage
the victim to get assistance from the center or report the incident
to the police.</P>
      <P>They said that aid services for foreigners are the same as those
for local woman and provide help based on the needs of the
individuals. Victims will receive 24-hour companionship for the
physical examination, questioning and appearance in court, legal
assistance, physiological counseling, emotional support, economic
assistance and shelter.</P>
      <P>The official spoke amid a recent controversy over a former
legislator who allegedly sexually abused his Filipina maid. The case
is still unresolved as the former lawmaker has denied the
allegation while the maid has returned to the Philippines.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ELECTION COMMISSION MAY HAVE TO DRAW LOTS FOR DEBATE PARTICIPANTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There are far too many civic groups wishing
to debate against the upcoming referendum in a series of public,
government-sponsored meetings, and unless the groups can decide among
themselves who will attend the debates, participants will have to be
selected by drawing lots, the Central Election Commission (CEC) said
Monday.</P>
      <P>CEC officials said that they will invite the representatives of
all civic groups to meet Tuesday to try and work out a solution. If a
compromise cannot be reached, then a drawing of lots will be
necessary to decide who will be able to face off with government
representatives.</P>
      <P>The officials said, "We are racing against time to screen the
signatures of the civic groups who wish to participate in the
upcoming debates." At least 1,547 signatures are needed for a
non-political group to qualify to take part in the debates. Officials
are faced with the daunting task of trying to verify the endorsement
signatures of 48 groups.</P>
      <P>Among the 48 groups, 25 groups have registered to challenge the
government's views on the first question concerning the enhancing of
the nation's anti-missile defense capability in the face of the
missile threat of mainland China, and 23 groups have registered to
debate on the second question concerning the reopening of
cross-strait talks to establish a peace and stability framework
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>All 23 groups for the second question have also registered to
debate the first question.</P>
      <P>As there will be only 10 public debates, five for each of the two
questions, with one representative from the "affirmative" and
"negative" sides attending each debate, coordination is necessary
before drawing lots to decide who will participate in the debates.</P>
      <P>Those who qualify will be announced Wednesday, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>The public debates on the March 20 referendum, held in tandem
with the presidential election, will start Feb. 29 and run for three
consecutive Sundays.</P>
      <P>There will be four debates on Feb. 29 and March 7 and two debates
March 14.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, one of the civic groups demanded Monday that the CEC
protect those who have different viewpoints and give them a chance to
take part in the debate.</P>
      <P>Kao Cheng-yen, acting convener of the small Green Party and one
of the representatives who passed the screening to be eligible,
said, "If the CEC insists on drawing lots to decide who can debate,
then the Green Party will not rule out the possibility of mobilizing
people to protest."</P>
      <P>Kao was most discontent that TV talk show personality Jaw
Shau-kong, chairman of the radio station UFO Network; independent
Legislator Sisy Chen; and writer Li Ao, have submitted 21 groups
so that they could have a better chance in the draw if it comes to
that. Jaw's group was the first to express the desire to serve on the
"nay" side. He has said that his group wants to show that the two
questions are absurd and that President Chen Shui-bian has illegally
called the referendum.</P>
      <P>"Jaw has dominated the media, does he also want to dominate the
speech forum?" Kao asked.</P>
      <P>Kao said that he has asked the CEC to give priority to those
groups who have different views.</P>
      <P>He also disputed Jaw's allegation that "proxy" negative side
representatives may come forward to reduce the chances of his group
being selected, saying, "We are the genuine nay side."</P>
      <P>Kao said that those who are against the referendum have no right
to serve as the "opposition" side, saying that his group will only
question the content and reasons of the referendum questions, and
will not question "the legality of the referendum."</P>

    <HEADLINE>HIGH-SPEED RAIL TO REDUCE AIR, NORMAL RAIL PASSENGERS BY 60,000 DAILY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After the high-speed railway begins
operations in October 2005, the number of passengers traveling by air
or normal rail may drop by more than 60,000 per day, Minister of
Transportation and Communications Lin Ling-san said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks at the Transportation Committee at the
Legislative Yuan on the impact of the first high-speed railway
connecting Taipei and Kaohsiung in 90 minutes on regular railway
and air transportation services.</P>
      <P>Lin said that it is expected that around 149,000 people daily
will make use of the 345-kilometer high-speed railway and that 17,000
of these will be passengers who now travel by air between southern
and northern Taiwan and 50,000 passengers who now travel by regular
rail.</P>
      <P>"The government and the operators have to cooperate with each
other, " he said, adding that, "Air carriers and the Taiwan Railway
Administration must engage in growth management on the one hand and
transformation on the other to face the new competition."</P>
      <P>He said that rail transportation in major stops in western Taiwan
will suffer most from competition from the high-speed rail. It is
estimated that major rail stops will lose between 70 percent and 80
percent of their current passengers, while minor rail stops will lose
between 5 percent and 40 percent of regular passengers.</P>
      <P>As to how to handle the situation, he said that rail
transportation in western Taiwan could make adjustments and focus on
mid- and short-distance travel and make long-haul transportation
secondary. While in eastern Taiwan, rail transport could focus on
mid- and long-distance transportation and make short-haul
transportation secondary.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the Taiwan Rail Administration could add commuter
stations and electric cars along the rail lines of major cities, so
that Taiwan Rail could double as a rapid transport operator in
metropolises.</P>
      <P>Lin also said that air transportation in western Taiwan could be
cut by between 50 percent and 70 percent, and his ministry will
suggest that air carriers adjust their flight routes to shit focus to
eastern Taiwan or outlying islands.</P>
      <P>The ministry will also suggest that air carriers promote
international charter services and cooperate with other international
carriers so that the remaining fleet can be rented overseas and their
operations ensured.</P>
      <P>The ministry will also coordinate with air carriers to share
limited air resources and reduce operating costs in the hope that air
carriers can expand through mergers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislator Lee Hung-chun of the opposition People First
Party questioned the future operations of the high-speed rail amid
the higher-than-estimated expenditure.</P>
      <P>To this, N. H. Ho, director-general of the Bureau of Taiwan High
Speed Rail under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications,
said that it is estimated that the construction of the high-speed
rail will be NT$50 billion (US$1.61 billion) more than originally
estimated, which he said was reasonable considering the fact that it
is a long-term, major construction project.</P>
      <P>Ho noted that the construction work of the high-speed rail is 98
percent complete, and the cost is NT$22.5 billion more than the
original calculation.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that after electrical engineering and other works
are completed, the total cost will be NT$513.3 billion. The overruns
will be financed by the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp.</P>
      <P>Lee questioned the increased budget, which he said increased
operational risks because of insufficient government management.</P>
      <P>Ho explained that the increase is mainly due to the new Taiwan
dollar exchange rate. When the construction contract was signed, the
exchange rates between the new Taiwan dollar and the U.S. dollar was
28: 1; now it has risen to over 33: 1. A station that was constructed
above ground instead of underground as originally planned also added
costs.</P>
      <P>"As the high-speed rail system is a long-term, major construction
project, the increase of its budget by 10 percent is quite
reasonable," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO DRUG TRAFFICKERS NABBED AT KAOHSIUNG AIRPORT</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two men were arrested at Kaohsiung
International Airport in southern Taiwan Tuesday for attempting to
smuggle heroin into the country from Cambodia.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) said the two men,
identified as Cheng Chi-shuan, 54, and Kang Yo-chih, 41, concealed
the 700 grams of heroin in locally produced Long Life cigarette
cartons.</P>
      <P>This marked the first time that the CIB has ever uncovered
contraband drugs hidden in Long Life cigarette packs, an investigator
said.</P>
      <P>According to initial investigations, the two traffickers bought
the Long Life cigarettes at the airport's duty-free shop when they
left for Cambodia Feb. 16. Before their return, they concealed the
high-grade heroin in four Long Life cigarette cartons.</P>
      <P>The CIB official said they believe there is a drug ring involved
behind the scenes. "We are carrying out investigations to find the
ringleader and other members," he added.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the CIB has been tipped off that some
drug traffickers are trying to take advantage of the current
presidential campaign period to intensify their smuggling operations
as police are busy with maintaining domestic law and order and
preventing entry of illegal mainland Chinese immigrants ahead of the
March 20 election.</P>
      <P>"In fact, the CIB will not relax its vigilance against drug
trafficking despite its heavy pre-election work load, " the official
said.</P>

      <P>Ho also said that Haiti's riots are not expected to affect its
relations with Taiwan and that the MOFA's contingency plan has taken

unveiled Tuesday a hybrid car powered by an internal combustion
engine and an electric motor.</P>
      <P>Tsai Hsin-yuan, director of the Mechanical Engineering Department
of the ITRI, said the vehicle thrusts the country to the forefront of
worldwide efforts to come up with more fuel-efficient and cleaner
vehicles.</P>
      <P>The vehicle, which runs on an energy-efficient mini-engine
developed by the ITRI Mechanical Engineering Department, can reach a
maximum speed of 100 kilometers per hour despite its relative small
torque, and can run for 25 kilometers on one liter of gasoline,
making it much more efficient than most motorcycles on the streets,
said Tsai.</P>
      <P>Although the car still depends heavily on fuel, especially when
running at high speed, it turns waste energy produced by the internal
combustion engine into electricity that is stored in a battery, which
powers the vehicle when it is moving at low speed.</P>
      <P>The battery can power the vehicle for 80,000 kilometers on a
single charge, said Tsai.</P>
      <P>The advantages of the vehicle are its low emission and fuel
economy. It consumes only about 60 percent of the fuel of a
conventional car of the same size.</P>
      <P>Since the battery is recharged automatically when the car is
running at high speed, the range of the car is greater than other
electric vehicles, he said.</P>
      <P>Tsai predicted that hybrid vehicles will play a major role in
short-distance travel within and between cities and that Taiwan will
eventually need some 400,000 such cars a year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Japanese lawmaker accused Beijing Tuesday
of intending to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait through
military intimidation.</P>
      <P>Questioning the Japanese government's expression of concern over
Taiwan's March 20 referendum, Hirosato Nakatsugawa, a member of the
Japanese Diet, noted at the parliament's budget committee that it is
Beijing that has deployed missiles targeting Taiwan with the
intention of changing the cross-strait status quo.</P>
      <P>Katsuhisa Uchida, director of the Taipei Office of Japan's
Interchange Association -- Japan's de facto ambassador to Taiwan in
the absence of diplomatic relations between the two countries --
expressed Japan's concern over Taiwan's referendum in a Dec. 29
meeting with Chiou I-jen, secretary-general of the Presidential

      <P>Nakatsugawa urged the Japanese government to let the people of
Taiwan decide their own internal affairs.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions raised by Nakatsugawa, Japanese Minister of

    <HEADLINE>JANUARY EXPORT ORDER VALUE HITS HISTORIC MONTHLY HIGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  24 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The value of export orders received by
Taiwan companies in January hit an all-time monthly high of US$13.94
billion, up by US$910 million, or an annual 7.05 percent growth rate,
compared to the year-earlier level, according to statistics released
by the government Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The tallies, announced by the Statistics Department under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) , show that the order value for
electronic products grew by US$680 million year-on-year last month,
representing an annual increase rate of 28.72 percent.</P>
      <P>The combined value of orders for precision instruments, fueled by
robust demand for digital cameras and LCDs (liquid crystal displays),
rose by US$230 million, reflecting a remarkable 80.14 percent growth
rate, while foreign orders placed with Taiwan-based makers of
telecommunications devices and notebook computers picked up by US$210
million in value, or an annual growth rate of 7.98 percent.</P>
      <P>In terms of the origin of the foreign orders, the United States,
Hong Kong, Japan and European countries were the prime buyers of
Taiwan-made hi-tech goods in January, the statistics indicate.</P>
      <P>However, purchase value by the United States posted an annual
growth rate of 0.24 percent, or some US$9 million. At the same time,
orders from Hong Kong increased by US$250 million in value, up by
9.23 percent from the previous-year level, while Japanese buyers also
bought more US$90 million-worth of locally manufactured electronics
goods.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, orders from countries in Europe rose by US$240 million
in value, marking an 11.91 percent annual increase rate.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's industrial production index stood at 126.64 points in
January, down a slight 1.06 percent from the level recorded in the
same month of a year ago, mainly because of fewer work days last
month due to the Chinese New Year holiday season, according to the
statistics.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials forecast that the index will register a higher
growth rate for February thanks to continued strong demand both at
home and abroad.</P>

      <P>New York Times: C.I.A was given data on
hijacker long before 9/11.</P>
      <P>American investigators were given the first name and telephone
number of one of the Sept. 11 hijackers two and a half years before
the attacks on New York and Washington, but the United States appears
to have failed to pursue the lead aggressively, American and German
officials say.</P>
      <P>The information -- the earliest known signal that the United States
received about any of the hijackers -- has now become an important
element of an independent commission's investigation into the events
of Sept. 11, 2001, officials said Monday. It is considered
particularly significant because it may have represented a missed
opportunity for American officials to penetrate the Qaeda terror cell
in Germany that was at the heart of the plot. And it came roughly 16
months before the hijacker showed up at flight schools in the United
States.</P>
      <P>Wall Street Journal: Drug industry's big push into technology
falls short.</P>
      <P>Some leading chemists are calling the effort of pharmaceutical
companies an expensive fiasco by applying machines in creasing
chemical combinations at once and tested them out with robots.</P>
      <P>They said that machines churned out chemical after chemical that
didn't produce useful results. And chemicals that seemed promising
often turned out to have big flaws that traditional testing might
have caught earlier on. Some drugs couldn't dissolve in water or be
turned into pills, for example.</P>
      <P>Critics believe these problems help explain the pharmaceutical
industry's drought of new products. Last year, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approved only 21 new drugs, marking a steady decline
since a peak of 53 in 1996. Many of the world's largest drug
companies failed to win U.S. approval for a single new drug in 2003.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEGOTIATIONS CALLED FOR TO HELP TAIWAN CHICKEN EXPORTS TO U.S.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 22 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In the face of required market opening for
foreign chicken imports next year in compliance with World Trade
Organization (WTO) rules, Taiwan should step up the pace of its
negotiations with other countries to help boost domestic chicken
exports, business sources said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>To achieve this aim, the government should move to complete such
talks by the end of this year, especially with the United States, to
help bolster outbound shipments of chicken starting from next year,
said Chen Tuan-fang, chairman of the Taiwan Electric Slaughterhouse
Association.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan should try to sell chicken to the United States
now, as the domestic price of chicken has dropped. Taiwan could also
consider barter trade -- exchanging chicken legs with U.S. chicken
breasts -- he suggested, to seek to reduce the gap resulting from the
current unilateral imports of U.S. chicken to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Prices of Taiwan-produced chicken used to be more expensive due
to higher production costs, making it difficult for Taiwan to sell
its chicken to the United States.</P>
      <P>Cho Pai-hung, secretary-general of the Taiwan Slaughterhouse
Association, said that Taiwan and the United States have agreed to
hold six rounds of consultations to discuss shipments of Taiwan
chicken to the United States.</P>
      <P>With three rounds of the talks already having been held, the two
sides have another three meetings to go, Cho said, pointing out that
the fourth meeting was originally slated to open following the
Chinese Lunar New Year holiday in late January but was postponed as a
result of the recent outbreaks of avian flu in Asia.</P>
      <P>Cho said the previous three meetings represent initial marked
progress in Taiwan's efforts to edge into the U.S. chicken market, in
contradiction to a wide assumption that it is impossible for
Taiwan-produced chicken to break into the U.S. market, whose annual
output scale amounts to about 18 million tons, much higher than
Taiwan's 400,000 tons.</P>
      <P>In order to abide with WTO rules, Taiwan must fully open its
chicken market in 2005 without enjoying a quota treatment prior to
its market opening. In the 1998-2003 period, Taiwan allowed entry of
90,000 tons of chicken, and plans to import 45,000 tons this year
alone.</P>
      <P>Affected by the outbreaks of the virulent H5N1 strain of bird flu
in about 10 Asian countries, the domestic price of chicken has
fallen, domestic chicken raisers said, adding that the planned market
opening in 2005 has provoked even greater concern from related
businesses.</P>
      <P>They contend that the government should speed up negotiations
with other countries to help push for chicken exports to other
countries and areas, such as Hong Kong, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia,
which have also been hit by the H5N1 avian flu, in addition to the
United States.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has also been affected by avian flu, it has been
the much less virulent H5N2 strain, with no H5N1 cases having been
reported.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan expressed
concern that bookies taking bets on the March 20 presidential
election could affect the outcome of the race.</P>
      <P>Chen made remarks when he visited Kaohsiung Tuesday to step up
investigations into allegations of vote-buying with less than one
month to go before the election.</P>
      <P>Chen, accompanied by Lu Ren-fa, state public prosecutor-general,
held a meeting with the chiefs of branch police stations in Kaohsiung
to declare his determination to eradicate bribery in the closely
contested presidential race.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that he has heard from grapevine reports that bookies
have taken in a lot of money from gamblers in central, southern and
northern Taiwan, with the longest odds for both candidates being 10

      <P>Reports even said that some bookies, in order to evade law
environment authorities, have fled to Hong Kong, Macau and mainland
China, and have been calling the shots from there.</P>
      <P>Though Chen said he has yet to secure hard evidence against the
bookies, he expressed concern about the possible impact on the
outcome of the presidential election because of the large amount of
money involved.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  24 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun led members of his
Cabinet to withdraw en masse from the Legislature Tuesday in protest
against opposition lawmakers' "invective and verbal personal
attacks."</P>
      <P>Angered and dismayed at opposition People First Party (PFP)
legislators Chung Shao-ho and Cheng Chin-ling's calling him "a
shameless politician," on a placard placed on the podium, Yu stepped
down from the rostrum where he was answering questions at the
Legislative Yuan assembly hall around 11:20 a.m.</P>
      <P>Yu then asked interpellation chairman, Vice Legislative Yuan
President Chiang Ping-kun, to uphold justice after he and Cabinet
officials were "verbally attacked" by the legislators in an
"irrational and vicious manner."</P>
      <P>Yu led members of his Cabinet to retreat en masse from the
Legislative Yuan around 1 p.m. before remarking that the Legislative
Yuan authorities had not given him or the ministers justice.</P>
      <P>He added that he and his ministers would like to return to the
Legislative Yuan for another interpellation session after the
Legislative Yuan authorities deal with the two PFP legislators
"properly."</P>
      <P>Commenting on the premier and his team's action, Liao Feng-teh, a
party whip of the opposition Kuomintang legislative caucus, said Yu
was "making much of a trifle" in an attempt to distract the focus of
attention.</P>
      <P>For their part, lawmakers from the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) and its political ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) , criticized their colleagues in opposition for the verbal
attacks.</P>
      <P>They also asked the PFP to apologize to Yu for Chung's and
Cheng's move and urged the Legislative Yuan's authorities to refer
them to the Disciplinary Committee for punishment.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, convener of the DPP legislative caucus, said that
"both Chung and Cheng owe Premier Yu an apology."</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-ping said that he will
convene a meeting of caucus leaders across the political spectrum to
seek a "satisfactory" resolution to the problem.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that a premier has led members of his
Cabinet to withdraw en masse from an interpellation session of the
Legislative Yuan since 1991.</P>
      <P>Former Premier Hao Pei-tsun withdrew from an all-Legislative Yuan
interpellation on Feb. 26, 1991 after being boycotted by the
then-opposition Democratic Progressive Party legislators from

    <HEADLINE>IF ELECTED, LIEN HOPES TO VISIT JAPAN BEFORE INAUGURATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan said Tuesday that if he wins the March 20 presidential election,
he hopes to visit Japan before the May 20 inauguration.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks in an interview with a group of Japanese
journalists.</P>
      <P>"Japan is one of our most important trading partners and friends.
If elected, I would like to visit Japan before my inauguration to
exchange views with Japanese politicians, scholars and opinion
leaders in various fields on regional issues," Lien said.</P>
      <P>Lien, who has teamed up with People First Party Chairman James
Soong to challenge President Chen Shui-bian's re-election bid, said
Taiwan has traditionally attached great importance to relations with
Japan.</P>
      <P>"Our two countries have maintained close ties in economic, trade,
cultural and education fields for a long time. We should further
strengthen our cooperation in various aspects," he added.</P>
      <P>Lien, a former vice president who lost to Chen in the 2000
presidential election, said former President Lee Teng-hui had not
consulted him before Lee unveiled the controversial "two states" or
"special state-to-state relationship" model in 1999.</P>
      <P>"It came as a surprise to me. I have never agreed with such a
theory, " said Lien, who has a doctoral degree in political science
from Chicago University.</P>
      <P>Lien said he dislikes to use empty political slogans to "blur"
the national identity issue. "According to our Constitution, the
Republic of China is an independent sovereign country. It's an
undisputable reality."</P>
      <P>In July 1999, former President Lee described Taiwan-mainland
China ties as a "special state-to-state relationship." Mainland China
regarded Lee's description as a veiled move to promote Taiwan
independence and has since suspended regular cross-strait dialogue on
non-political affairs.</P>
      <P>Asked about his views on Lee's political legacies, Lien said
Taiwan made progress in political democratization during Lee's
12-year presidency.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, Taiwan's political arena was tainted by shady
links with business interests and gangsters during that period
probably because of hasty political democratization," Lien said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lien took advantage of the interview to clarify
President Chen's accusation that Lien advocates putting aside the
ROC's sovereignty to facilitate cross-Taiwan Strait rapprochement and
reconciliation.</P>
      <P>"In my first live TV debate with Chen Feb. 14, I proposed that
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait shelve their disputes over
Taiwan's sovereign status and forge cooperative ties in other fields.
Chen quoted me out of context. I have never suggested that Taiwan's
'sovereign status' be shelved. I feel regret that Chen has
deliberately misquoted my statement," Lien said.</P>
      <P>He cited the longstanding international sovereignty dispute over
the Spratlys in the South China Sea as an example to back up his
views.</P>
      <P>"Many countries, including Taiwan and mainland China, have
claimed sovereignty to the Spratlys. But they must shelve their
sovereignty dispute if they want to explore rich oil and other
natural resources in the region," Lien said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 229 HIV cases were reported
in Hong Kong last year, compared with 260 in 2002, a doctor from the
Health Department said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, the doctor said that sexual
transmission continued to be the most important mode in the spread of
HIV.</P>
      <P>Seventy percent of the newly reported HIV cases contracted the
virus through having sex. Heterosexual transmission predominated in
113 cases while 48 occurred between men having sex with men.</P>
      <P>In 2003, 56 AIDS cases were reported to the department. The
number of AIDS reports has remained stable since 1997.</P>
      <P>"It is estimated that over 3,000 people are living with HIV/AIDS
in Hong Kong. The high HIV rates in neighboring cities, extensive
human mobility across borders and high-risk behavior are some of the
factors that may predispose Hong Kong to an upsurge of the epidemic,"
said the doctor.

    <HEADLINE>PARTIAL VOLUNTEER MILITARY TO BE GRADUALLY IMPLEMENTED: MND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense will
adjust the nation's military service system in a gradual manner, with
a goal of enlisting 60 percent of volunteers for military service by
2012, a senior official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of National Defense Chen Ti-tuan made the remarks
in a report to the legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) on the feasibility of implementing an
all-volunteer military service system in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that the military now has 385,000 regular service members,
Chen said a new troop reduction plan will be implemented from this
year to cut the number of troops by 15,000 annually.</P>
      <P>Under this plan, Chen said, the number of regular military
servicemen and women will be lowered to 270,000 by 2012.</P>
      <P>"By then, our weaponry systems will also have been renovated and
upgraded. Against this backdrop, we can consider adjusting our
military service system from conscription to a volunteer-dominated
one," Chen explained.</P>
      <P>According to the defense ministry's plan, Chen said, the
volunteers-conscripts ratio in the military will be adjusted to 60
percent versus 40 percent by 2012.</P>
      <P>In addition to weapons upgrades, Chen said several other factors
must also be evaluated before a volunteer-dominated service system
can be put into practice, including whether retired service men and
women have been properly settled, whether the military has groomed an
elite deterrent force and whether relations across the Taiwan Strait
are stable.</P>
      <P>The nation's military service system became a hot topic after the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" presidential candidate, Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman Lien Chan, said in a televised debate with President
Chen Shui-bian last weekend that if he is elected, he will replace
the current conscription-dominated service system to an enlistment
one. According to Lien's idea, the compulsory military service period
for conscripts at peacetime should last for three months instead of
the current one year and eight months.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regular news conference, defense ministry spokesman
Maj. Gen. Huang Suey-sheng said the ministry has traditionally
refrained from making comments on candidates' visions or policy
initiatives.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Huang said four critical elements must be gauged in
formulating a nation's military service system, namely, the threat
from the enemy, financial resources, supply of regular forces at
peacetime and the supply of reservists at wartime, and young people's
interest in pursuing a military career.</P>
      <P>Huang said the defense ministry has conducted an extensive study
on the pros and cons of conscription and enlistment systems.</P>
      <P>In the future, Huang said the military will adopt a two-pronged
approach in recruiting service members, under which regular forces
will adopt an enlistment-dominated system and reservists will
implement a conscription-dominated one.</P>
      <P>While both the defense ministry and the ruling DPP don't think
introduction of an all-volunteer enlistment service system is
feasible for now, the "pan-blue alliance" -- the KMT and the People
First Party (PFP) -- said it will come up with a draft bill in two
weeks to pave the way for implementing an all-volunteer enlistment
system.</P>
      <P>PFP legislators Lin Yu-fang and Chou Hsi-wei said an all-volunteer
enlistment system is a prevailing world trend. "We must tread down
this road which can help us meet the demand of a possible asymmetric,
high-tech war across the Taiwan Strait," Lin said.</P>
      <P>He said implementing an all-volunteer enlistment system doesn't
require constitutional amendments. "We need only to enact a new law
for the voluntary military system and retain conscription for
wartime."</P>
      <P>According to the "pan-blue alliance's" estimate, it will require
an additional budget of NT$60 billion annually to implement the
voluntary military service system. Under its plan, a private will be
given a monthly salary of NT$30,000 to NT$40,000 and a
non-commissioned officer will be offered a monthly salary of
NT$40,000 to NT$60,000.</P>

      <P>Maj. Gen. Huang Suey-sheng confirmed that the Ministry of
National Defense has designated the March 20 presidential election
day as a period for special combat preparedness.</P>
      <P>The military will be at their positions of "heightened levels of
alert" in the 39 hours beginning from 5 p.m. March 19 and ending at 8
a.m. March 21 to ensure that the presidential election and the
nation's first-ever referendum will be held smoothly, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the armed forces will be well prepared against
"surprise attack from outside" and "accidental crisis from within, "
Huang said that the military will be on guard against any
emergencies, including electoral affairs disputes, protests,
terrorist attacks, threats to candidates' personal safety, and a
mainland attack or efforts by Beijing to intimidate the island.</P>
      <P>The military intelligence units, which have maintained constant
vigilance against any suspicious or abnormal activities in the
Taiwan Strait, have also heightened their surveillance to "uncover
situations early and make quick responses" to protect Taiwan's
security, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, combat forces have also mapped out response options
and have conducted training exercises to cope with possible
"abnormal" mainland military actions, he said.</P>
      <P>He added that as of noon Tuesday, the defense ministry has seen
no abnormal mainland Chinese military activities, including movements
of its missile and submarine forces.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Huang noted that the just-begun joint military
exercise between the United States and the Philippines conducted in
the western part of the Philippines has nothing to do with Taiwan's
upcoming presidential election.</P>
      <P>Huang said the U.S. and Philippine armed forces conduct joint
military drills regularly on an annual basis as the two countries
maintain a mutual defense pact.</P>
      <P>The annual military exercise has usually been conducted on
Palawan Island to the west of the Philippines between Feb. 23 and
March 7 each year, Huang added.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A spokesman for the Ministry of National
Defense explained Tuesday the factors involved in charting the
nation's military service system in response to presidential
candidate Lien Chan's call to make significant changes.</P>
      <P>Maj. Gen. Huang Suey-sheng said that while he was a spokesman for
the defense ministry, he could not make comments on behalf of the
ministry on the particular stances of the candidates running for
president; however, he did say that he could respond as an
individual.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang candidate Lien Chan said in a debate last weekend with
President Chen Shui-bian that he advocated a system of recruitment or
draft for the armed forces to encourage more career soldiers and said
that compulsory military service should be shortened to three months
instead of the current 22 months.</P>
      <P>Huang said that the ROC military uses four considerations when
making its policy on calling and maintaining a standing army.</P>
      <P>These are: the size of the enemy threat, the defense budget, the
replacement of soldiers at peacetime and reservists that can be
mobilized at wartime, and the commitment of the nation's youth to
serve.</P>
      <P>Huang said the defense ministry has recently studied the
conscription and recruitment systems, and that the ministry is
already planning to shift the bulk of its forces to recruits, while
reservists will mainly be composed of conscripts.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A number of women's rights groups appealed
to the presidential candidates Tuesday to clearly articulate their
policies for providing better protection to the island's female
population.</P>
      <P>At a press conference held at the Legislative Yuan, the women's
rights activists called for the incumbent president and the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" candidate to stop exchanging
mudslinging and making empty promises.</P>
      <P>The activists urged the candidates to articulate the "beef" and
their vision regarding providing better protection for Taiwan's
female citizens.</P>
      <P>According to Chang Chin-li, executive director of the Modern
Women Foundation, women and girls in Taiwan have been facing "three
major forms of violence," namely assault and battery, sexual assault,
and domestic violence.</P>
      <P>Chang pointed out that the number of women or girls killed or
physically attacked in Taiwan rose to 11,035 for 2002 from 6,057 in
1999, indicating that Taiwan's female citizens are increasingly
threatened by physical violence.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said that the number of Taiwan women or girls
sexually assaulted, attacked or abused totaled 2,400 for 2002,
compared with 1,600 in 1999.</P>
      <P>The number of women or girls who were the victims of domestic
violence totaled over 17,000 for 2002, up noticeably from the 1999
figure of 11,000, Chang added.</P>
      <P>Wang Chuei, a researcher with the National Taiwan University
Office of Women Studies, pointed out that as females make up half of
Taiwan's population, the country's stability hinges largely on
whether they are well protected.</P>
      <P>She called for the presidential candidates to clearly articulate
their policies for better protecting females' personal safety crafted
based on the concept of "gender equality."</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEC DECIDES TO SEPARATE REFERENDUM FROM PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  25 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC)
decided Wednesday evening to issue ballots for the presidential
election separately from ballots for the referendum when the two
votes are held on March 20.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan, which insisted on having the two ballots
given to voters together at the same time, backed down, saying it
will respect the CEC's decision.</P>
      <P>Lin Chia-lung, a spokesman for the Executive Yuan, said the
Executive Yuan hoped to settle the disputes over how the ballots will
be distributed so the public attention will be focused on the two
questions put to the referendum.</P>
      <P>Under the CEC's latest plan, voters at polling stations should be
given the ballots for the presidential election, and cast them in
boxes reserved for that purpose, before getting the two referendum
ballots, each for one of the two questions in the referendum, and
dropping them in boxes for the referendum.</P>
      <P>The CEC initially preferred this method on the grounds that it
minimizes the possibility of ballots ending up in the wrong boxes,
which will delay the vote-counting in the presidential election.</P>
      <P>But the CEC caved in to the Executive Yuan and chose to issue the
three ballots to voters at the same time in hopes it will boost the
turnout in the referendum which requires a minimum 50 percent turnout
to be valid.</P>
      <P>Under this plan, presidential election ballots put in the wrong
boxes will be picked out first and tallied along with ballots in
boxes for presidential votes. The ballots for the referendum will be
counted after the vote-counting for the presidential election is
finished.</P>
      <P>This decision caused an uproar among the opposition parties of
the Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) which control 11
out of 23 counties and cities in addition to Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Claiming it could lead to vote-fixing and might prompt chaos,
they united their party members in various city halls to oppose the
plan imposed on the CEC by the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Bowing to the opposition's pressure, the CEC reversed its
previous decision Wednesday evening and decided to distribute the
election and referendum ballots separately.</P>
      <P>A KMT spokeswoman, Kuo Su-chun, said her party welcomes the CEC's
about-face on the issue, saying that the new method is much safer

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE EXPOUNDS VISION IN NEW BOOK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition presidential candidate Lien Chan
published a new book Wednesday, outlining his vision for Taiwan and
his views on personal traits needed to be Taiwan's top leader.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien said at a news conference
introducing his new book, titled "Change, Then There Will Be a Hope,"
that if he wins the March 20 presidential election, he wants to
become a respectable president, not a despotic leader.</P>
      <P>Lien, a former vice president who has teamed up with People First
Party Chairman James Soong to challenge President Chen Shui-bian's
re-election bid, said he thinks that a national leader must exercise
self-restraint to avoid abusing power and must demonstrate esprit
d'corps and respect mainstream values.</P>
      <P>In his view, Lien said, Taiwan has changed significantly over the
past four years under the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration.</P>
      <P>"Some of the changes are worrisome. Among others, the wealth gap
has further widened and social confrontation has become more
serious, " Lien noted, adding that he hopes President Chen will read
his new book.</P>
      <P>Lien, who has a doctoral degree in political science from Chicago
University, said democratic development requires a humanistic spirit
that is characterized by respect, equality and tolerance.</P>
      <P>"Without these basic values, a democratic society is very likely
to decline into social disorder and lose competitiveness," Lien said,
adding that he has written the new book after extensive contacts with
grassroots constituents around the island.</P>
      <P>Lien said the new book explores problems faced by Taiwan in its
democratic development and presents many policy initiatives for
improving the nation. "The book explains my central policies, " he
added.</P>
      <P>The new book, which has eight chapters, advocates a more
conciliatory policy towards mainland China than President Chen's, and
suggests that Taiwan sign a peace treaty with the mainland and
promising not to declare independence if Beijing renounces its threat
of war.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan should not seek independence for the sake of
independence. The mainland should not push for unification for the
sake of unification, " Lien said in the book. "The issue should be
left for future generations to decide."</P>
      <P>Locked in a tight race with Chen for the presidency, Lien has
played down the KMT's longstanding policy of seeking eventual
unification with a democratic mainland China to avoid hurting his
chances with voters who fear Taiwan could be swallowed up by the
communist country.</P>
      <P>Chen says Taiwan is already an independent country that does not
need to declare independence unless mainland China attacks. But
Beijing has said his proposed referendum on boosting Taiwan's
defenses is a step towards independence that could lead to war.</P>
      <P>"Mr. Chen Shui-bian plays the Communist China card with the
so-called 'defensive referendum, ' risking the country for his
personal political gamble. He is a leader walking on a tightrope
without a safety net," Lien claimed at the news conference.</P>
      <P>In his new book, Lien wrote that Taipei and Beijing should resume
fence-mending talks and eventually sign a comprehensive agreement
including a peace accord. In the pact, Lien continued, mainland China
would agree to renounce the use of force against the island and
Taiwan would agree not to declare independence. "The two would also
agree to treat each other as equals and maintain the political status
quo."</P>
      <P>At Wednesday's news conference, Lien also said if he wins next
month's election, he will follow through with existing deals to buy
weapons from the United States to defend against a possible attack
from mainalnd China.</P>
      <P>Lien's commitment was seen a response to criticism from Chen, wh
Sho has argued that Lien would be too soft on mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lien said he would be committed to Taiwan's defense if he wins
the March 20 vote. Many opinion polls have said that neither candidate
has a commanding lead in the presidential race.</P>
      <P>"We will continue our arms procurement program," he said. "It
is important for Taiwan's security. We need to continue this
program in the coming years."</P>
      <P>Taiwan buys most of its arms from the United States. In 2001,
U.S. President George W. Bush agreed to a robust arms sales package
to Taiwan, inclduing submarine-hunting aircraft, submarines and
Patriot PAC-3 anti-missile batteries. The two sides are still
negotiating prices and specifications.</P>

      <P>The ban on short-term visits to Taiwan by
foreign HIV-carriers will be lifted once a draft package of revisions
to the current AIDS Prevention and Control Statute is approved by the
Legislative Yuan, the Cabinet said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet approved the draft package proposed by the Department
of Health (DOH) at its weekly meeting. The draft bill will soon be
referred to the legislature for approval, a Cabinet spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Under the current regulations, foreign HIV-carriers cannot enter
Taiwan. In the past, NBA star Magic Johnson was denied a visa to
visit Taiwan simply because he had been tested positive for HIV --
the virus that causes AIDS.</P>
      <P>The DOH said it manages to detect an average of 50 foreign
HIV-carriers each year when foreign citizens, including foreign
spouses and migrant workers, apply for long-term resident visas.
Those people are asked to leave Taiwan within a specified period of

      <P>The representatives were Chen Shei-saint for the Kuomintang, Lee

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  25 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian told a group of
local businessmen Wednesday that while he was not adverse to them
investing in mainland China, their homeland of Taiwan should be given
top priority when considering where to base their operations or
invest.</P>
      <P>Speaking in Nantou County, southern Taiwan, President Chen said
that Taiwan is the center of Asia, not an offshore district of
mainland China, and that Taiwan's economy is not a part of mainland
China's economy. He encouraged businessmen to expand their businesses
globally, but reminded them that wherever they are, "Be sure to make
Taiwan your top concern and make the island your top priority when
choosing a place to invest."</P>
      <P>Chen said that relocating a company's manufacturing operations to
the mainland while keeping its management in Taiwan is a dangerous
strategy. Doing this, the president said, will jeopardize the jobs of
some three million workers employed by the island's manufacturing
sector.</P>
      <P>Instead of separating the location of manufacturing operations
from management, the president urged local companies to set up their
research and development centers in Taiwan. This, he said, would
boost the added value of products turned out by Taiwan's industry.</P>
      <P>Saying that this year the country's economy is expected to grow
at 5 percent, while the unemployment rate will be kept under 4.5
percent, the president said the economy is now healthy and that
Taiwan is an ideal place for future investments.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One of the most loved and cherished
historical sites in suburban Taipei will be closed next month for an
18-month renovation, it was announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hung Mao Cheng, also known as Fort San Domingo, in Tamshui, a
grade one historical site designated by the government, will be
closed to address problems with water damage, termites and general
age damage.</P>
      <P>Repair workers at the fort, which includes a fortress and a
spacious consulate building, have invited the public to make good use
of the few remaining days in February to visit and savor the beauty
of the fortress and elegant red-tile British consulate building,
which has attracted between 400,000 and 500,000 visitors each year.</P>
      <P>Hung Mao Cheng was originally called Fort San Domingo and was
built by the Spanish in 1629. The fort fell to the Dutch in 1661 and
then again in 1681 when 35,000 Ming dynasty troops led by Cheng
Cheng-kung (Koxinga) fleeing the mainland from Ching dynasty troops
ousted the Dutch from Tamshui. It was around this time that the fort
was given its present name. In Chinese, Hung Mao Cheng literally
means "fortress of the red-haired ones."</P>
      <P>In 1867, the British leased the building and the consulate moved
in the following year. The British withdrew from the consulate in
1972, entrusting it to Australia and later to the United States.
Hung Mao Cheng was returned to the Republic of China in June 1980 and
opened to the public in Dec. 25, 1984 after being renovated.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HIGH-PROFILE DEBATES TO KICK OFF SUNDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the high-profile public debates on the
two referendum questions kicking off this Sunday, the names of the
representatives from the affirmative and opposition sides to the
10 debates were unveiled Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The affirmative camp will be represented by five government
officials and five legislators of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), while the opposition side will include eight people from
an anti-March 20 referendum action alliance formed mainly by TV and
radio personality Jaw Shau-kong, and two others recommended by the
Green Party.</P>
      <P>The two sides submitted the names of 10 representatives each to
the Central Election Commission (CEC) earlier in the day and they were
later revealed after a draw to decide which one will face which in
the debate.</P>
      <P>Independent Legislator Sisy Chen, who will represent the "nay"
side, said earlier that she has no intention of debating another
woman, but was drawn to face Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and the only woman
representative on the "yea" side.</P>
      <P>Jaw, chairman of the UFO Network and a TV host, said that this
must be "god's will" for the two women, both known for their sharp
wits, analytical power and ability to remain calm in the heat of the
most raucous argument, to face each other in the debate.</P>
      <P>Another surprise is Juan Ming, a scholar from mainland China and
now a professor at Tamkang University, who was originally on the
recommended list of the Executive Yuan's "yea" side, but ended up on
the "nay" side in the final list.</P>
      <P>Kao Cheng-yen, Green Party acting convener, said that because
Juan had advocated casting invalid ballots, the party had decided to
recommend him as a "nay" side representative.</P>
      <P>The 10 debates, five each for the two questions in the referendum
-- one on enhancing national defenses in the face of the missile
threat from mainland China and the other on cross-strait talks on a
peace and stability interaction mechanism -- will start Feb. 29 for
three consecutive Sundays.</P>
      <P>On the first question on strengthening national defenses,
Executive Yuan Spokesman Lin Chia-lung will face aboriginal
Legislator Chin May; Joseph Wu, deputy secretary general of the
Presidential Office will challenge Chan Chao-li, a poet who is
concerned with the rights of the grassroots and was one of the
leaders of a 120,000-strong group of farmers and fishermen who
protested in Taipei in Nov. 23, 2002 -- the largest protest rally ever
by farmers and fishermen in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lo Chih-ming will face former Control Yuan member
Yeh Yao-peng, Legislator Yu Ching will face Kao Cheng-yen and
Legislator Julian Kuo will face Jaw Shau-kong.</P>
      <P>On the second question, Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh will face off
against writer Li Ao; Minister without Portfolio Yeh Chun-jung will
challenge former DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang; DPP Legislator Chiu
Tai-san will face National Taiwan University professor Tim T.Y. Ting;
DPP Legislator Cho Jung-tai will debate Juan Ming and Tsai Ing-wen
will face Sisy Chen.</P>
      <P>After the unveiling of the list, Jaw said that the list of his
action alliance covers most ethnic groups, including aboriginee,
Hakka, Minnan (Taiwanese) and mainlanders, as well as several former
DPP heavyweights such as Sisy Chen and Hsu Hsin-liang.</P>
      <P>He lashed out at the Executive Yuan's list comprising five
legislators, saying that Taiwan is not a Cabinet system and that the
legislators have not participated in the decision-making on the
referendum. He also complained that President Chen Shui-bian, who has
the decision making power in calling the referendum, had decided to
stay out of the debates.</P>
      <P>Jaw reaffirmed that he supports the idea of referendum, but is
opposed to the two questions in the March 20 one. He pointed out that
the public can refuse to vote and that if they decide to vote, they
can say no to the questions. Voters will receive three ballots on
March 20 -- one for presidential election and one each for the two
referendum questions.</P>
      <P>Kao said that he also supports the referendum but will vote no to
the questions.</P>
      <P>Public interest in the referendum is building day by day after
many twists and turns in the process. The government even had to
change its original list of debaters after learning that it will face
strong rivals and debaters known for their sharp tongues.</P>
      <P>The CEC has to conduct the live TV debates for the two camps
under the terms of the Referendum Law. It first invited the
legislative caucuses of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and its
ally, the People First Party (PFP) to serve as the "nay" side.</P>
      <P>Neither party was interested in debating a referendum they see as
illegal, so the CEC was forced to seek debaters from among many civic
groups that were keen to challenge the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>A total of 48 groups applied to debate on the "nay" side, forcing
the CEC to draw lots as to who should take part in the debates after
a coordination meeting failed to reach a satisfactory settlement
among them.</P>
      <P>Jaw's group collected enough signatures to form 21 groups for the
debates, giving it a much better chance than the other hopefuls in
the draw.</P>

      <P>The Bureau of Immigration (BOI) under the
Ministry of the Interior (MOI) denied allegations Wednesday that it
has prepared a list of questions to ask incoming mainland Chinese
visitors during airport interviews that have been branded by some as
an invasion of privacy.</P>
      <P>BOI Director Tseng Wen-chang made the denial at a Legislative
Yuan committee meeting.</P>
      <P>During the session, several opposition lawmakers, including Lee
Ching-hua and Feng Ting-kuo of the People First Party, quoted a
private cross-Taiwan Strait marriage promotion association as
claiming that some questions posed by BOI officials during interviews
with incoming mainland visitors at airports have infringed upon the
travelers' personal privacy.</P>
      <P>The opposition lawmakers demanded the BOI's superior agency --
the MOI -- come up with an investigative report on the allegations
within one week.</P>
      <P>In response, Tseng said the BOI didn't begin to conduct
face-to-face interviews with incoming mainland visitors until Sept.
1, 2003.</P>
      <P>"As this is a new measure, some of our staff members might not be
skillful or efficient enough in handling the interviews. There may be
room for improvements. But I assure you that the so-called
embarrassing 'privacy-infringing' list of questions is non-existent.
I don't believe that any of our immigration officers had ever put
forth insensitive questions to mainland arrivals, " Tseng told
lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, MOI Minister Yu Cheng-hsien said
he has directed the immigration bureau to look into the reported
cases.</P>
      <P>"If any BOI staff member has ever infringed upon personal privacy
during interviews with mainland arrivals, he or she will be punished
in accordance with the civil service law," Yu said.</P>
      <P>According to Tseng, 14,717 mainland visitors have so far been
interviewed since the new system was implemented last September as
part of government efforts to prevent entry of mainland citizens
through marriages of convenience.</P>
      <P>"Through those interviews, we have successfully prevented entry
of 1,179 mainland citizens who intended to enter Taiwan and work
using fake marriages as an excuse," Tseng said.</P>

      <P>More than half of the domestic
manufacturers polled recently are optimistic about Taiwan's economic
outlook for the coming six months, with the business condition index
rising to a record high of 117.48 points, according to a report made
public Wednesday by an economic research institute.</P>
      <P>The monthly report on the domestic economic climate and trends
carried out by the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER) shows
that 53 percent of the companies in the manufacturing sector polled
in January held a positive view of the country's economic prospects
for the coming six months, up from the December level of 51.9
percent.</P>
      <P>Some 43.2 percent of the respondents contended that their
business conditions will remain stable in the coming six-month
period, up from the month-earlier level of 36.2 percent. However,
about 3.8 percent, down from December's 11.9 percent, are pessimistic
about their prospects, according to the report.</P>
      <P>TIER President Wu Rong-i said that Taiwan's economy, prompted by
strong demand at home and abroad, will post good performance this
year if there are no major incidents that could affect economic
development.</P>
      <P>Wu, however, pointed out that the central bank could raise
interest rates should international prices of major staple
commodities, such as steel, continue to rise.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MANY OVERSEAS CHINESE TO RETURN TO VOTE IN ELECTION: OCAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 10,000 overseas Chinese are
expected to return to Taiwan to cast ballots in the March 20
presidential election, the nation's top overseas Chinese affairs
administrator said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting, Chang
Fu-mei, chairwoman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (OCAC),
told lawmakers that 10,601 overseas Chinese had registered to vote
for the Republic of China's 11th-term president and vice president as
of the Feb. 9 deadline.</P>
      <P>Chang said 1,323 of them still have legal residence in Taiwan.
"According to government regulations, they do not need to
register with our representative offices abroad for the election.
Excluding this group of people, 9,028 overseas Chinese who do not
have their legal abode in Taiwan have registered to vote," she
explained.</P>
      <P>In comparison, Chang said, only 2,800 overseas Chinese registered
for the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>This time around, Chang said, the number has more than tripled
the 2000 figure, indicating that overseas Chinese people are very
interested in the hotly contested election.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chang went on, the figure does not include Taiwanese
businessmen operating in mainland China who have their legal abode in
Taiwan and thus do not need to register for the election in advance.</P>
      <P>Chang said the OCAC has consistently adopted a neutral and
impartial attitude in encouraging overseas Chinese to return to
Taiwan to elect the nation's president.</P>
      <P>"The commission has used many channels, including leaflets, print
media, electronic media, e-mail and the Internet, to help would-be
overseas Chinese voters better understand the technical details
regarding the presidential poll and the referendum, " Chang said,
adding that the OCAC has also cooperated with ROC overseas
representative offices and overseas Chinese cultural centers in
sponsoring seminars on related topics.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said, mainland China has distorted Taiwan's
first-ever referendum as a move to promote Taiwan independence and
has launched a publicity drive to sway overseas Chinese people's
loyalty to Taiwan and foreign countries' support for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Despite this pressure from the mainland, Chang said the OCAC will
continue to strengthen its services to overseas Chinese people under
the principles of "reform, innovation, foresight and pragmatism."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Zen Master Sheng Yen, founder of the Taiwan
Buddhist group Dharma Drum Mountain (DDM) Social Welfare and Charity
Foundation, has led a Taiwan delegation to Thailand to take part in
the World Youth Peace Summit (WYPS), Asia-Pacific, slated to be held
in Bangkok Feb. 25-29.</P>
      <P>Five of the seven-member group are followers of Taiwan Buddhist
organizations, including DDM, the sixth is a young man selected from
Taiwan's business sector and the seventh, a graduate school student
from National Taiwan University, according to a DDM public relations
official.</P>
      <P>Over 1,000 young leaders from around the world have arrived in
Bangkok for the five-day peace summit, which is the first regional
preparatory conference prior to a Global Summit in Nairobi scheduled
to be held in October, the DDM spokeswoman said.</P>
      <P>The objective of the Asia-Pacific summit is to identify
outstanding youth leaders and youth organizations in the region and
to develop a framework for a Youth Action Plan for World Peace for
Asia-Pacific Youth by identifying the key issues effecting young
people in the region and how regional youth leaders can contribute to
the global efforts for peace and development.</P>
      <P>The summit will also develop the structure for WYPS Councils of
Youth Leaders in each county in the region for the continuation of
WYPS programs and the implementation of the Youth Action Plan for
World Peace following the summit.</P>
      <P>During the summit, organizers will also present the WYPS-Asia
Pacific Youth Awards to outstanding youth leaders for their
contributions to peace-building and development in the Asia-Pacific
region.</P>
      <P>Master Sheng Yen's DDM made a donation of US$100,000 in
post-quake relief aid to Iran immediately after a devastating
earthquake struck the historic city of Bam last Dec. 26.</P>
      <P>Days later, after dispatching a four-member mission to Bam for a
fact-finding trip, the DDM launched a fund-raising drive to channel
another US$100,000 into Iran to foster children who were orphaned and
deprived of schooling by the deadly earthquake.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAICHUNG INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT TO ALLOW 3 INAUGURAL FLIGHTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.   25  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An international airport will be
inaugurated March 5 in Taichung, central Taiwan, but the Civil
Aeronautics Administration (CAA) will only allow three approved
international charter flights for the time being, CAA Director
General Billy K.C. Chang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chang said that "until the facilities of the newly converted
airport meet international standards, the CAA will not agree to more
applications for international charter flights."</P>
      <P>The airport in Chinchuankang, Taichung County, is being converted
from a military only airport to a joint civilian-military airport.
Its inauguration is supposed to mark the delivery of President Chen
Shui-bian's campaign promise during his 2000 election campaign to
give Taichung an international airport.</P>
      <P>Chang said, however, that in the first stage of the international
airport, only domestic flights will be allowed. There are no
international airport facilities and domestic and international
flights cannot run simultaneously, he said. There is also no
equipment to allow night landings and takeoffs, he added.</P>
      <P>However, he said, the international charter flights scheduled for
the March 5 inauguration day will have no problems, as domestic
flights will still take off and land at the original Shuinan domestic
airport in Taichung City, which will be closed for good that same
day.</P>
      <P>Starting from March 6, domestic flights will use the
Chinchuankang facility, while the return trips of the international
charter flights will have to land at CKS International Airport in
Taoyuan, northern Taiwan, Chang said.</P>
      <P>He explained that the three international charters will use the
military runway. To make it a standard international airport, it
would not only have to have terminal facilities, but the military has
requested that the government help improve 37 other runway
facilities, which the CAA is incapable of doing at present.</P>
      <P>He added that not until domestic flights have been in operation
for some time will the CAA even assess the possibility of operating
international services.</P>
      <P>The two domestic air carriers that have been approved to use the
facility for international charters are China Airlines, with one
flight from Taichung to Tokyo, and Far East Air Transport Corp., with
one flight each to Phuket and Palau.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA PLANNING AGRICULTURAL EXPORT SPECIAL ZONES FOR TAIWAN FRUIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  25 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA) is planning to earmark NT$300 million (about US$9 million) in
the coming three years to set up three agricultural export special
zones, a COA official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang Ming-lai, director-general of the COA's International
Cooperation Department, said the plan has been worked out in line
with a global promotion package aimed at boosting Taiwan's exports of
agricultural produce in the hope of injecting a new lease on life
into the industry.</P>
      <P>The COA has initially decided to establish zones for locally
grown bananas, papayas and green soybeans, Wang said, adding that the
first such zone for bananas is expected to be opened within this year
on a 1,500-hectare land lot belonging to the state-run Taiwan Sugar
Corporation in southern Pingtung County.</P>
      <P>The creation of the zones is meant to secure a strict production
process for outbound shipments of locally grown agricultural produce
to satisfy international standard quarantine and quality
requirements, he noted.</P>
      <P>Bananas used to be Taiwan's most popular fruit for export,
especially in Japan, but its sales in foreign markets have met strong
competition from the Philippines and other countries in Southeast
Asia because of Taiwan's higher prices.</P>
      <P>According to COA officials, Taiwan's export value of green
soybeans grew by an annual rate of 6.4 percent in 2003, while that of
papayas increased 1.9-fold year-on-year.</P>
      <P>The COA plans to allocate a budget of about NT$60 million this
year, with NT$100 million and NT$140 million allocated for 2005 and
2006, respectively.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO INDICATION BEIJING WANTS TO INFLUENCE TAIWAN ELECTION: U.S.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  24 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is closely monitoring
the situation in Taiwan prior to its March 20 presidential election,
but there is no indication that it is prepared to influence Taiwan
voters through military activities, a high-ranking U.S. Defense
Department official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lowell Jacoby, Defense Intelligence Agency director, made the
remarks when he reported at a hearing at the Senate Select
Intelligence Committee on worldwide threats to the United States.</P>
      <P>"Domestic political events in Taipei are the principal
determinant of short-term stability in the Taiwan Strait, " Jacoby
said.</P>
      <P>"Beijing is monitoring developments in advance of next month's
presidential elections and referendum, ever concerned about a Taiwan
declaration of independence," he continued.</P>
      <P>He said that "Beijing will not tolerate the island's independence
and will use military force regardless of the costs or risks."</P>
      <P>However, he went on, "we see no indication of preparations for
large-scale military exercises or other military activity to
influence Taiwan voters at this stage," he added.</P>
      <P>He also noted that the mainland has continued to develop or
import weapons. The People's Liberation Army acquisition priorities
include surface combatants and submarines, air defenses, modern
fighter aircraft, ballistic and anti-ship cruise missiles, space and
counter-space systems, and modern ground equipment, he said.</P>
      <P>During Taiwan's first popular presidential election in 1996, the
mainland lobbed missiles into the Taiwan Strait near Taiwan and in
the next election in 2000, then-Premier Zhu Rongji launched a
blistering verbal attack on the eve of the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, George Tenet, U.S. Central Intelligence Agency
director, said on the same occasion that the mainland has continued
to pursue a missile modernization program.</P>
      <P>"China continues an aggressive missile modernization program that
will improve its ability to conduct a wide range of military actions
against Taiwan, supported by both cruise and ballistic missiles, " he
said.</P>
      <P>He also said that the greatest concern of the United States
remains the mainland's military buildup, which continues to
accelerate.</P>
      <P>"Last year, Beijing reached new benchmarks in its production or
acquisition from Russia of missiles, submarines and other naval
combatants and advanced fighter aircraft," he said.</P>
      <P>He added: "China is also downsizing and restructuring its
military forces with an eye toward enhancing its capability for the
modern battlefield."</P>
      <P>"Expected technical improvements will give Beijing a more
accurate and lethal force. China is also moving ahead with its first
generation of ballistic missiles," he added.</P>
      <P>In addition to giving an oral report and answering questions,
Tenet also said in a written report that the United States is
"closely monitoring the situation across the Taiwan Strait in the
period surrounding Taiwan's presidential election next month. "</P>
      <P>Mainland leadership politics -- especially the incomplete
leadership transition -- will influence how Beijing deals with the
Taiwan issue this year and beyond, Tenet said.</P>
      <P>President Hu Jintao, who is also the Chinese Communist Party
leader, still shares power with his predecessor in those positions,
Jiang Zemin, who retains the powerful chairmanship of the party's
Central Military Commission, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT CURRENCY CLEARING MECHANISM TO BE FORGED: CBC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Central Bank of China (CBC) Governor Perng
Fai-nan said Wednesday he believes that the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait will eventually forge a currency clearing and settlement
mechanism.</P>
      <P>Perng made the remarks at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's
Finance Affairs Committee.</P>
      <P>During the session, opposition Kuomintang Legislator Lo Ming-tsai
said that with Hong Kong banks formally opening mainland Chinese
currency exchange services, the mainland currency can now more easily
circulate in international markets and could even become a settlement
unit in future Asian trading deals.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Lo said he is afraid that Taiwan might be
marginalized in the global economy if the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait fail to open currency exchange services soon.</P>
      <P>In response, Perng said that the Ministry of Finance has allowed
passengers to bring a limited amount of renminbi -- the mainland
Chinese currency -- into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As to whether domestic banks will ba allowed to open mainland
currency exchange services, Perng said this will involve technical
issues that will have to be addressed. The most important
prerequisite is the establishment of a cross-strait currency clearing
and settlement mechanism, he added.</P>
      <P>Perng said the central bank has tried several channels to explore
the feasibility of forging such a mechanism with the mainland,
including discussing the issue with high-level mainland officials
during their visits to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"All those contacts have so far not yielded concrete results, "
Perng said, adding that the CBC has asked the Mainland Affairs
Council, which deals with all mainland-related affairs, to negotiate
relevant issues with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Perng said he is optimistic about the issue. "I'm convinced that
a cross-strait currency clearing and settlement mechanism can be
carved out in the not-too-distant future," he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  25 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Panamanian First Vice President Arturo
Vallarino urged Taiwan investors Wednesday to invest in Panama,
saying that Taiwan businesses are welcome to use Panama as a gateway
to the vast American market.</P>
      <P>Vallarino, who arrived in Taipei Sunday at the head of a large
Panamanian commerce and industry delegation for a six-day official
visit, was speaking at the Taiwan-Panama economic and trade summit
forum, titled "Redefining Global Business, " at the World Trade
Center.</P>
      <P>Republic of China Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Yi-fu led a
Taiwan delegation at the summit forum.</P>
      <P>Vallarino said that the ROC-Panama free trade agreement --
jointly ratified by President Chen Shui-bian and President Mireya
Moscoso last November -- has now been put into effect, marking a new
starting point of closer economic and trade ties between the two
countries. "The accord will also serve as the bedrock of efforts to
further bolster bilateral relations between Panama and Taiwan, " he
added.</P>
      <P>He noted that Panama is a small country, but is very interested
in engaging in global trade. With its excellent geographic position
-- strategically connecting the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean
with the Panama Canal -- and its free-trade harbor facilities, Panama
offers a convenient bridgehead for Taiwan traders and investors
interested in exploring the vast markets throughout the American
Continent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he pointed out that Taiwan, despite being a small
country as well, is an economic powerhouse. He said that Panama
should emulate Taiwan's economic and international trade achievements
and should also use Taiwan as a gateway to other markets around Asia.</P>
      <P>For his part, Lin said that Taiwanese and Panamanian industries
and businesses complement one another. The two countries maintain
bilateral investment guarantee accords that were signed in 1992, he
added.</P>
      <P>Lin said that in accordance with Ministry of Economic Affairs
regulations, Taiwanese industries and businesses are entitled to
enjoy investment incentives from the government if they decide to
invest in or relocate their manufacturing or economic operations to
Panama.</P>
      <P>Panamanian Minister of Commerce and Industry Joaquin Jacome, one
of the key officials in Vallarino's 55-member entourage, said at the
forum that if Taiwan businesses are interested in making inroads into
Panama, they will find better niches if they invest in the
telecommunications industry, shipping, operations centers or export
processing zones.</P>
      <P>Jacome said that Taiwan investors will find Panama a great place
in which to invest because of Panama's membership of the System of
Central American Integration and the fact that Panama's free trade
agreement with the United States will take effect in 2005.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC), an
independent service organization, will remain neutral and impartial
in the upcoming presidential election and referendum vote, CEC
Chairman Huang Shih-cheng said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan Judicial
Affairs Committee, Huang said the CEC -- the top official agency in

the issue of the layout of polling stations. The issue has been at
the core of disputes over ballot and voting procedures surrounding
the March 20 presidential election and referendum.</P>
      <P>Huang said the CEC is expected to make a final decision on the
layout of polling stations later Wednesday after CEC members hold an
afternoon meeting to discuss two proposed versions of the polling
stations' design. One of the versions was mapped out by the CEC,
while the other has been proposed by a number of legislators,
scholars and officials from the election commissions of several local
governments.</P>
      <P>According to the CEC, on the day of the March 20 presidential

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian claimed Thursday
that Beijing will "definitely" hold talks with Taiwan if he is
re-elected in the March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Addressing an annual dinner party hosted by the American Chamber
of Commerce in Taipei, Chen predicted that the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait will talk about the establishment of a peace and
stability framework for cross-strait interaction, an agreement on
guarantee and protection of investment, opening of direct
cross-strait trade, transport and postal links and other topics in a
pragmatic manner.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he is confident of winning re-election and gave an
assurance that there will be no violence in the election.</P>
      <P>With regard to the "peace referendum" to be held March 20
alongside the election, Chen said it has nothing to do with Taiwan
independence or unification with mainland China and that it is aimed
at showing the world the Taiwan people's desire for peace and their
unity.</P>
      <P>Chen reiterated that his "four noes plus one" pledge -- no
declaration of Taiwan independence, no changing of the national
title, no pushing for the inclusion of the so-called "state-to-state"
description in the constitution, no promotion of a referendum to
change the status quo in regards to the question of independence or
unification and no abolishing of the National Reunification Council
-- remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>Referring to the outlook for Taiwan's economy, Chen said that the
country's economic growth will reach the originally targeted 5
percent this year and will even top 5.5 percent should the "10 New
Major Construction Projects" program worth a total of NT$500 billion
(US$15.1 billion) be carried out smoothly.</P>
      <P>The country's recent economic performance shows that policies
adopted by the government over the past four years have been

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien
expressed satisfaction Thursday with a U.S. government report on
Taiwan's human rights situation.</P>
      <P>Chien said that the annual report released Wednesday by the U.S.
State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, which
gave Taiwan good grades, represents U.S. affirmation of Taiwan's
democratic development.</P>
      <P>It also serves as evidence that Taiwan's democracy and human
rights are as mature as those of advanced nations, according to
Chien.</P>
      <P>According to the U.S. State Department's "Country Reports on

island's authorities generally respect the human rights of the
citizens.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Constitution provides for freedom of speech and the
authorities also generally respect these rights in practice, it
states.</P>
      <P>Although some political influence still exists over the island's

    <TEXT>New York Times: Rapes reported by
servicewomen in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere.

The United States military is facing the gravest accusations of
sexual misconduct in years, with dozens of servicewomen in the
Persian Gulf area and elsewhere saying they were sexually assaulted
or raped by fellow troops, lawmakers and victims advocates said on
Wednesday.

There have been 112 reports of sexual misconduct over roughly the
past 18 months in the Central Command area of operations, which
includes Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan, military officials said on
Wednesday.

Military officials said that the bulk of the charges were being
investigated and that some had already resulted in disciplinary
actions, but they could not provide specifics. They said a small
number of the reports had turned out to be unfounded.

Wall Street Journal: Prosecutors could seek charges against chip
makers.

Newly disclosed e-mail and testimony from the chip industry
executives show what prosecutors believe was a global conspiracy
among some of the world's largest memory-chip makers to cut
production and raise prices before a sharp price spike two years ago.

The evidence -- and new activity before a federal grand jury in
San Francisco -- suggests a long- running antitrust investigation may
be coming to an end. Prosecutors are expected to seek criminal
price-fixing charges against some chip makers, while others are
weighing whether to enter plea deals and risk heavy fines, lawyers
close to the case said.

Companies that have disclosed they are under investigation
include the market leader, Samsung Electronics Co., and Hynix
Semiconductor Inc., both of South Korea; Micron Technology Inc.,
based in Boise, Idaho; and Infineon Technologies AG of Germany, among
others.</TEXT>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian presided over the
ground-breaking ceremony for the second world trade center and
exhibition hall in Nankang, suburban Taipei Thursday.</P>
      <P>The president, accompanied by Vice Premier Lin Hsin-i and
Presidential Office Vice Secretary-General Chen Che-nan, turned over
a symbolic shovel of soil at the ceremony, which was also witnessed by
members of the foreign diplomatic corps stationed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>President Chen said that after the recent opening of the Taiwan
Design Center, he was happy to attend the ground-breaking ceremony of
the second world trade center and exhibition hall, believing it is
another milestone for the Nankang area since the opening of the
Nankang software industrial park.</P>
      <P>The president said that the Nankang exhibition hall is the
government's response to urgent needs of Taiwan businesses seeking
exhibition space, saying that the cooperation of the Ministry of
Economic Affairs and the Ministry of the Interior has ensured that
the construction began today.</P>
      <P>"This again attests to the efficiency and the power to carry out
programs of the administration," the president said.</P>
      <P>He also said that the establishment of the Nankang exhibition
hall is part of the government's vision to turn Taiwan into a "green
silicon island and my commitment to build up Taiwan."</P>
      <P>With the outstanding economic performance and the national
competitiveness of Taiwan last year, he said the government has
actually turned its economic vision into a prosperous reality.</P>
      <P>He said that to upgrade national competitiveness, sponsoring
international exhibitions will help Taiwan's industries obtain the
most information and trade opportunities in the shortest possible
time, and will also help promote the development of peripheral
sectors.</P>
      <P>The exhibition hall, coupled with the Nankang software industrial
park, will make Nankang and the neighboring Neihu district even more
prosperous, the president said.</P>
      <P>The president said, "Looking ahead, we have no reason lack
confidence in ourselves, " since the government has already improved
the economic structure and upgraded national competitiveness over the
past years.</P>
      <P>"The development I envisioned four years ago has now turned into
the prosperity we are so proud of today," he said.</P>
      <P>The exhibition hall, which will cover six hectares, is scheduled
to be inaugurated in October 2005 after the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEDP) , the nation's top economic planning
agency, approved a proposal to appropriate NT$3.8 billion (US$114.8
million) for the construction last year.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) started to draft the plan
for a second world trade center in 1994 and targeted Nankang as the
proposed site. The project was approved by the Executive Yuan in 1996
and the CEPD began promoting the case in 1998 on the
build-operate-transfer model in cooperation with the private sector.</P>
      <P>However, because of the sluggish economy, the private sector bids
failed and the MOEA then proposed to the CEPD that the central
government fund the project.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's first international exhibition hall -- the World Trade
Center -- is located in the Hsinyi district of downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's ambition to transform itself into an Asia-Pacific
business operations center has encountered stiff competition from
Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong and Singapore in recent years due to the
country's increasingly inadequate exhibition space, which has limited
its ability to hold international trade fairs and exhibitions.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's first-ever nationwide referendum
will prompt mainland China to adopt a more pragmatic attitude in
dealing with cross-Taiwan Strait relations, Mainland Affairs Council
Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks while delivering a report to the
Legislative Yuan's Interior Affairs Committee on the possible impact
of the upcoming referendum on cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>In the referendum to be held alongside the presidential election
on March 20, voters will be asked two questions -- whether Taiwan
should buy more anti-missile batteries in the face of mainland
China's intensified military threat and whether Taiwan should
negotiate a viable cross-strait interactive mechanism on an equal
footing.</P>
      <P>As the nation's top mainland policy planner, Tsai will represent
the government in a televised debate with independent Legislator Sisy
Chen on the second question regarding cross-strait negotiations for
establishing an interactive mechanism on March 14. Chen will
represent the "nay" side in the debate.</P>
      <P>Noting that the upcoming "negotiation" referendum supersedes the
"independence vs. unification" ideological disputes among major
domestic political parties, Tsai said the referendum results will
help assuage domestic inter-party confrontation.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Tsai said, the "negotiation" referendum will help forge
a national consensus on future government policy toward mainland
China. "If a majority of voters give a positive answer to the
question, the referendum result will become an important element to
maintain long-term stable cross-strait ties."</P>
      <P>The referendum will also help narrow the distance between the
government and the electorate, Tsai said, adding that no matter which
party is in power in the future, the referendum results can serve as
a mandate for the government to negotiate an interactive mechanism
with the mainland under the principle of parity.</P>
      <P>Since mainland Chinese leaders have on many occasions said they
pin their hopes on the people of Taiwan for cross-strait
reconciliation, Tsai said the referendum results will force mainland
authorities to more realistically address cross-strait affairs.</P>
      <P>Tsai further said that even if fewer than half of the voters cast
a "yes" vote in the "negotiation" referendum, the result might mainly
reflect procedural, rather than substantive, disputes. But she didn't
elaborate on how she reached such a conclusion. Instead, she said
that should that be the case, the government will continue to promote
the establishment of a cross-strait interactive mechanism based on the
principles of "peace, dignity and parity."</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS DEMAND NEW AIRPORT MEET SAFETY REQUIREMENTS PRIOR TO OPENING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators across the party spectrum on
Thursday demanded that the new international airport in Taichung,
central Taiwan, meet all safety requirements before it is scheduled
to open March 5.</P>
      <P>The 13 legislators were accompanied by Minister of Transportation
and Communications Lin Ling-san; Billy K.C. Chang, director-general
of the Civil Aeronautics Administration; Fei Houng-po, vice chief of
the general staff under the Ministry of National Defense and other
officials to inspect the airport.</P>
      <P>The airport in Chingchuankang, Taichung County, is being
converted from a military only airport to a joint civilian-military
airport. Its inauguration is supposed to mark the delivery of
President Chen Shui-bian's campaign promise in last presidential
election in 2000 to give central Taiwan an international airport.</P>
      <P>The construction of the terminal started on September 4, 2003,
and the work is expected to be completed this month.</P>
      <P>Legislator Shen Chi-huei of the opposition People First Party
pointed out several drawbacks to the project, including that the
facility has yet to past fire safety tests, a tarmac sheltered
corridor for passengers has yet to be completed, there are no
refueling facilities at the airport, the outbound traffic network has
yet to be comprehensively planned and what civilian aircraft must do
in the event of a military exercise has not been properly addressed.</P>
      <P>"People in central Taiwan have been waiting for an international
airport for a long time, " the legislators said, but they said that
security still should be a prime concern.</P>
      <P>Minister Lin said that his ministry attaches great importance to
airport security, stressing that it is a top priority. The airport
will only open when it passes fire safety tests and "after the new
runway is completed, it will be a new international airport, " he
added.</P>
      <P>The new airport will replace the original domestic airport in
Taichung City, which will be closed for good on March 5, to fly
domestic routes as well as international routes in the future.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>To cope with a larger number of Taiwan
businessmen planning to return home to vote in the March 20
presidential election, some airlines are considering offering reduced
ticket prices or adding flights.</P>
      <P>A Dragon Airlines Taiwan manager said the aviation company has
decided to add one flight each day on March 17, March 18 and March 19
on the route from Shanghai to Taipei via Hong Kong to serve
homecoming Taiwan businessmen. Passengers who fly on these three
flights will not have to change airlines, he added.</P>
      <P>The Dragon Airlines executive also said that some Taiwan
businessmen's groups based in mainland China are negotiating with the
company trying to obtain cheaper tickets for their members who fly
back to Taiwan to vote.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, China Airlines and EVA Airways Corporation -- Taiwan's
two largest carriers -- said that they have no plans to increase
flights prior to March 20 because bookings for flights before that
day are far from full. However, both the airlines have agreed to
provide cheaper group tickets for those who book seats through a
Taiwan businessmen's association.</P>
      <P>According to an EVA Airways executive, bookings for flights on
the route from Hong Kong to Taipei in the run-up to the presidential
election day remain normal, but demand on the routes from
destinations in the United States to Taiwan has increased 5 percent
to 10 percent compared to the year-earlier level.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Thursday
that she is confident that she and the president will be re-elected
on March 20.</P>
      <P>Speaking in an interview with the Central News Agency, Lu said
that since Taiwan made a final decision on holding its first-ever
nationwide referendum alongside its March 20 presidential election,
major countries around the world no longer express dissenting views
on the event.</P>
      <P>"This indicates that they expect the re-election of President
Chen Shui-bian and me in the upcoming poll and are now concerned
about what Chen will announce in his May 20 inaugural speech, " Lu
said in the interview.</P>
      <P>With regard to the sensitive cross-Taiwan Strait relations, Lu
said President Chen has on many occasions reaffirmed his commitment
to the "four noes plus one" pledge outlined in his 2000 inaugural
address.</P>
      <P>Noting that policy continuity is the norm, Lu said Chen's
reaffirmation is aimed at letting Beijing leaders and foreign
governments understand that if the Chen-Lu ticket is re-elected, Lu
said, there will be no dramatic policy about-face, including the
policy on cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>The "four noes plus one" pledge refers to no change to Taiwan's
official national title and flag, no holding of an "independence vs.
unification" referendum and no inclusion of the "two states" dictum
into the nation's Constitution during Chen's presidential term.</P>
      <P>In Thursday's interview, Lu said she supports Chen's promise to
form a nine-member special task force to promote the establishment of
a viable mechanism for cross-strait peaceful interaction soon after
he is re-elected.</P>
      <P>Lu said she hopes that the proposed special task force will be a

    <HEADLINE>NEXT LEGISLATURE COULD REVISE REFERENDUM LAW TO STRENGTHEN DEMOCRACY: LU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Thursday
that the next legislature to be elected at the end of this year will
be more apt to revise the Referendum Law to further strengthen
Taiwan's democracy.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks in an exclusive interview with the Central
News Agency at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that when the Legislative Yuan passed the Referendum Law
in late November, it was done so in a rush, and there are
imperfections that require revision.</P>
      <P>Lu said it will be difficult for the current legislature to
revise the law because of the political make-up of the lawmaking
body, saying that after the March 20 presidential election there
will be a reshuffle of the political landscape.</P>
      <P>She predicted that after the year-end legislative election, the
structure of the Legislative Yuan will be healthier, saying, "The new
legislature can revise the Referendum Law to make Taiwan move toward
solid democracy."</P>
      <P>Lu was referring to the power structure of the current
Legislative Yuan where the opposition alliance of the Kuomintang
(KMT) and the People First Party is still the dominant force of the
225-seat body, despite the fact that the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party took over the helm of the country in 2000 from the
KMT who had ruled Taiwan for more than five decades.</P>
      <P>She stressed that as a sovereign country, people have to be
responsible for their deeds, and the people who will vote in the
upcoming referendum understand this because of their knowledge of
world events and the accomplishments of democracy.</P>
      <P>Lu said that the knowledge and world view of the people of Taiwan
has been unprecedented over the past four centuries and their
abilities should not be underestimated. Taiwan people fully
understand the importance of contact with the world, Lu said.</P>
      <P>"The people of Taiwan are well aware of the impact that they have
on the world and the impact of the world on them," she said.</P>
      <P>Turning to international reaction to President Chen Shui-bian's
announcement late last year that a referendum would be held on issues
of national concern, Lu said that repercussions were expected.</P>
      <P>"We finally made the international community pay attention to
us," she said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is rarely in the international spotlight, and from this
perspective, we got what we wanted, although we had to pay a small
price, too," Lu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN IS A DEMOCRAT: WEEKLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong Kong,  Feb.  26 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Far Eastern Economic Review has
praised President Chen Shui-bian as being a democrat and
understanding the dynamics of representative government.</P>
      <P>In its latest issue, the magazine said in an editorial that when
the United States chastises President Chen for his plan to hold a
referendum on the same day as Taiwan's presidential election, it may
also be giving the unfortunate impression that it sees Taiwan as a
special case among democratic societies -- one that curiously has no
right to hold referendums.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan needed to be cautioned on the need for prudence, but this
should not have sent a message to Communist China that threats
towards a democratic society are acceptable," the editorial said.</P>
      <P>It said that however one views Chen's referendum, there is no
doubt that he understands the dynamics of representative government.
"He is a democrat, and it is impossible to disagree with him in a
democratic context," it added.</P>
      <P>"More troubling than Mr. Chen's gambit is why China's reaction
has received far less than its fair share of condemnation," it said.</P>
      <P>The editorial further said that while Chen is chided, mainland
China's threats are seen as expected and normal.</P>
      <P>"This only encourages Beijing's belief of its right to act in a
bellicose manner, and that it is the responsibility of everyone else
to avoid angering China," it said.</P>
      <P>"We'd do well to remind ourselves who the democrats are in the
region, despite their shortcomings," the editorial concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS URGE SPECIAL PACKAGE FOR HOMECOMING VOTERS VIA MINI LINKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  27  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of lawmakers called on the
Cabinet-level Council of Mainland Affairs (MAC) Friday to devise a
special package for homecoming Taiwan people to vote in the coming
presidential race and a referendum via the "mini three links."</P>
      <P>The group of lawmakers from the opposition Kuomintang, the People
First Party and the New Party made the call at a news conference held
on the frontline island of Kinmen after paying an inspection tour to
its facilities involving the so-called "mini three links" -- direct
trade and transport services maintained between Kinmen and Matsu
islands and the Fujian ports of Xiamen and Fuzhou in mainland China.</P>
      <P>In response to the proposal, MAC Vice Chairman Johnnason Liu
promised that he will put forward the issue for the MAC to study and
he made it clear that the MAC will come out with a decision before
the March 20 presidential election day.</P>
      <P>About a dozen representatives of Taiwan businessmen's
associations based in Xiamen, Quanzhou and Zhangzhou in Fujian
province also took part in the news conference to echo their demand
for such a special package in order to make their homecoming easier
to vote in the presidential election and the historic referendum held
on the same day.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers suggested the MAC allow all Republic of China
passport holders returning from abroad to Taiwan for the vote via the
Kinmen and Matsu islands 10 days before and after March 20.</P>
      <P>Out of concern over the capacities of the security, immigration
and quarantine facilities on the two offshore islands, they proposed
that the daily entry be limited to 10,000 people and they asked the
MAC to answer before March 5.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Transportation and Communications Yu Fang-lai
opined that it is necessary to settle all relevant technical issues
in advance if the measure is to be adopted. He offered his viewpoint
that Taiwan businessmen from mainland China travel in and travel out
in groups during that period.</P>
      <P>For the time being, only Taiwan businessmen and their families
based in Fujian as well as Kinmen and Matsu residents are permitted
to travel between the two sides under the framework of the "mini
three links," initiated by Taiwan in Jan. 2001.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian announced recently that starting from
March 1, mainland-based Taiwan businessmen operating outside Fujian
will be allowed to use the links to return to Taiwan.</P>

(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>New York Times: Two studies cite child
sex abuse by 4 percent of priests.

Two long-awaited studies have found that the Roman Catholic
Church suffered an epidemic of child sexual abuse that involved at
least 4 percent of priests over 52 years and peaked with the
ordination class of 1970, in which one of every 10 priests was
eventually accused of abuse.

The human toll amounted to 10,667 children allegedly victimized
by 4,392 priests from 1950 to 2002, but the studies caution that even
these numbers represent an undercount. The totals depend on
self-reporting by American bishops, the studies note, and many
victims have never come forward out of fear or shame.

The studies were commissioned by the American Catholic bishops in
2002 in response to accusations of a massive episcopal cover-up of
sexual abuse by priests. They will undoubtedly provide fodder for
controversies between left and right in the church about issues like
homosexuality in the priesthood and whether the celibacy requirement
for priests should be revoked.

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian presided over a
groundbreaking ceremony of a national agricultural and biotechnology
park in southern Pingtung County Friday.</P>
      <P>Describing the move as laying a solid foundation for building
Taiwan into a value-added innovation and development center, Chen
voiced the hope that the park will upgrade the country's agriculture
and make it into a knowledge-based and a technology-oriented sector
capable of putting out high quality products to make Taiwan more
competitive after it entered the World Trade Organization in 2001.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that the government will fully support the park to
assist the domestic agricultural industry, which is facing robust
foreign competition, including that from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Pointing to Holland's tulips and New Zealand's kiwis as an
example, the president encouraged Taiwan farmers to develop new types
of fine-quality produce by applying their advanced know-how.</P>
      <P>Chen said about 30 companies are planning to open shop in the
park this year, creating some 8,000 job opportunities in the initial
stage and another 25,000 following its completion.</P>
      <P>Vowing to build Taiwan into a value-added R&amp;D center in Asia and
the rest of the world, he said that Taiwan has already developed from
a labor-intensive manufacturer into a technology-based society. Chen
added that the country's economy is expected to grow by more than 5
percent this year and that its budgets for R&amp;D programs will increase
to account for 3 precent of gross domestic product in 2006.</P>
      <P>According to Vice Premier Lin Hsin-i, the government has
allocated NT$20 billion (about US$600 million )to establish five such
parks across Taiwan in the coming six years, including this one in
Pingtung, which will cost NT$12.6 billion, or 60 percent of the total
budget.</P>
      <P>For the time being, 12 companies have been approved to set up
operations in the Pingtung park, which Lin called a milestone in
Taiwan's agricultural development.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense has
approached the United States to obtain financial assistance to buy
weapons from America, but so far no progress has been made, Minister
of National Defense Tang Yiau-min said Friday.</P>
      <P>Answering questions from lawmakers at the Legislative Yuan, Tang
said his ministry, with the approval of the Executive Yuan, has been
trying to get U.S. loans since last year but since a special budget
for arms purchases from the United States has not yet been approved
by the Legislative Yuan, the ministry has no idea how much money it
will need, and negotiations with the United States are still at the
preliminary stage.</P>
      <P>As a U.S. ally of the same importance as NATO members, Taiwan is
qualified to borrow money from the United States to finance its U.S.
arm purchases, a vice minister of national defense from Taiwan has
approached his U.S. contacts about this, but has gotten nowhere thus
far, according to Tang.</P>
      <P>The idea was brought up last year by Legislator Lin Nan-sheng, a
lawmaker from the opposition Kuomintang. He claimed that buying U.S.
arms with U.S. loans will bring Taiwan closer to the United States,
which would not support an attack by Beijing against Taiwan while the
island owes money to the United States.
U.S. President George W, Bush approved the sale of a package of
weapons systems to Taiwan in 2000, but the island has had problems
coming up with the money at one time. The Ministry of National
Defense is seeking a budget of NT$500 billion (US$14.92 billion)
next year as part of the payment.</P>

      <P>Acting on a tip, officers from the Coast Guard Administration
(CGA) Putai operations boarded the Kaohsing-based container freighter
"Tongshuen" at around 2 a.m. and discovered more than 2,000 cartons
of smuggled foreign cigarettes concealed in six containers.</P>
      <P>The coast guard officers first spotted the freighter being
approached by several motorized sampans and then saw cartons of goods
being unloaded from the ship onto the sampans. The officers then
ordered the ship as well as the sampans to stop for inspection.</P>
      <P>The "Tongshuen," an 800-ton freighter, regularly plies the route
between the southern county of Chiayi and the outlying island of
Kinmen.</P>
      <P>This marked the largest seizure of untaxed foreign cigarettes by
the CGA Putai operations in years. Previous seizures of smuggled
foreign cigarettes were usually made off fishing boats or motorized
sampans, the Putai coast guard said.</P>
      <P>Following Friday morning's bust, the nine crew members and
fishermen were taken back to Putai for further questioning.</P>
      <P>The smugglers were later turned over to the Chiayi District Court
on charges of violating Taiwan's tobacco and wine regulations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLICE BUST HUMAN SMUGGLING  RING IN EASTERN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Police busted a human smuggling ring in
eastern Taiwan Friday, arresting 10 ring members as well as 12
illegal mainland Chinese women who were smuggled in to work as
prostitutes.</P>
      <P>Police said that after more than six months of surveillance, they
arrested the ringleader, surnamed Chang, in January. Further
investigation showed that other ring members controlled the mainland
women, moving them around eastern Taiwan, including Hualien, Ilan and
Taitung.</P>
      <P>A 19-year-old woman surnamed Zhou told the police that she was
brought into Taiwan last July. The ringleader told her that she had
to work as a prostitute to repay the smuggling fee of NT$200,000
(US$6,042).</P>
      <P>Zhou said that she was under the complete control of the ring and
had no freedom of movement, adding that the ring also controlled
several underage mainland girls.</P>
      <P>She said that she was forced to work day and night, but the ring
would not let her go and would only give her a NT$100 a day for
meals.</P>
      <P>To protect coastal security and crack down on illegal smuggling
rings, police have targeted several other suspicious groups for
investigation and they also urged the public to alert them of any
suspected illegal activity.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE IN BANGLADESH TO BE INAUGURATED MARCH 1</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  27  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China will open a
representative office in Bangladesh March 1 as part of its efforts to
expand trade and investment in South Asia, Minister of Foreign
Affairs Eugene Chien said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chien told a news conference that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
sent staff members to the Bangladesh capital of Dhaka Feb. 15 in
preparation for the inauguration of the new office.</P>
      <P>"All preparatory work has been completed and the new
representative office will become operational March 1, " Chien said,
adding that Chen Wen-yen, a former deputy director of the MOFA's
General Affairs Department, will be the ROC's first representative to
Bangladesh.</P>
      <P>The Bangladesh office will be Taiwan's second foothold in South
Asia following the establishment of a representative office in India
in 1995, Chien said.</P>
      <P>"From the perspective of developing contacts in South Asia, the
opening of a representative office in Bangladesh is of historic
significance, " Chien said. "And substantive benefits will include
expanding Taiwan's commercial exchanges and cooperation with South
Asia, exploring new markets in the region, enhancing 'pro-Taiwan
forces' in the international community, increasing sources for labor
imports and extending the 'go south' investment policy to South
Asia."</P>
      <P>For the development of bilateral ties, Chien said, the opening of
the new office will help Taiwan businessmen who invest in Bangladesh
and wish to tap markets in the entire region. Moreover, he went on,
Bangladesh can assist Taiwan in expanding its deep-sea fishing
operations in the Indian Ocean.</P>
      <P>Through the establishment of the new office, Chien said, Taiwan
can share its economic development experience and democratic ideas
with Bangladesh.</P>
      <P>Describing Bangladesh as an integral factor for economic
globalization, Chien said the country has a vast market and abundant
human resources. Bangladesh workers are cheap yet well-trained, he
said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he continued, the European Union and other advanced
countries have offered special export quotas and other privileges for
Bangladeshi products. "It's really a destination worthy of
consideration by would-be investors," he added.</P>
      <P>At present, Chien said, Bangladesh has more than 10
Taiwanese-funded textile and electronics manufacturing firms. Even
though Bangladesh's present foreign trade remains limited, Chien
said, large business groups from South Korea and other countries have
been actively tapping the Bangladesh market.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan cannot afford to lag behind," Chien said, adding that the
establishment of a representative office in Dhaka can also help
Taiwanese businessmen resolve visa and residence permit problems.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the Indian government was involved in Taiwan's
negotiations with Bangladesh for opening the office,
Chien said India did not play any such role.</P>
      <P>"We have spent a lot of time negotiating the representative
office issue with Bangladesh. Both sides finally reached an agreement
last year. The agreement was reached mainly because both sides want
to increase economic, cultural and technological exchanges, " Chien
said.</P>
      <P>As for labor imports, Chien said, the issue was also touched upon
during the negotiation process. "Technical details will be further
discussed after our representative office is inaugurated in
Bangladesh," he added.</P>
      <P>Chien said the two sides did not talk about exchanges of aviation
rights. "If any local air carrier is interested in opening direct
flight services between Taiwan and Bangladesh, the government will be
willing to study the feasibility," he said.</P>
      <P>Bangladesh, located between India and Myanmar, has an area of
144,000 square kilometers and a population of more than 138 million.
Eighty-seven percent of its people are Muslims. The official language
is Bangladeshi, but English is also commonly used. Its annual gross
national product is about US$38.3 billion, with a per capita national
income of about US$300.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLICE BUST MAJOR CAR THEFT RING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Police have busted the largest car theft
operation of recent years, arresting more than 10 suspects, police
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Police were alerted of the existence of the car theft ring that
was shipping stolen cars to mainland China after intercepting a car
bearing false plates on the Yuanlin-Changhua section of the Chungshan
Freeway last December.</P>
      <P>Two suspects in the stolen car were arrested as they were about
to drive the car to Kaohsiung Harbor, southern Taiwan, where it was
to be shipped to the outlying island of Kinmen and later to the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Further investigation led police to find out that Huang
Ming-chun, 42, with previous convictions for racketeering, burglary
and fraud, together with several accomplices, had since early 2003
targeted an area in Taichung, central Taiwan, for stealing cars.</P>
      <P>Police said that after the cars were shipped to Kinmen, their
engine and chassis numbers were altered and they were smuggled over
to the mainland port of Xiamen. The cars would then get new plates
and registration in Hainan Island and be resold all over the
mainland.</P>
      <P>The ring had pocketed an estimated NT$30 million (US$906,344),
police said.</P>
      <P>Huang, who is now in hiding on the mainland, would target Toyota
Camry cars less than two years old and had stolen more than 200 of
them, as well as more than 100 imported cars such as Mercedes-Benz
and BMW.</P>
      <P>Police said that Huang would lure Kinmen residents with a small
amount of money to serve as proxies to buy the stolen cars, which
could be easily shipped to Kinmen as the customs authorities there
usually do not inspect cars less than three years old.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Police have nabbed five members of a
Kaohsiung-based illegal bookmaking ring suspected of offering wagers
on the results of the March 20 presidential election, the Criminal
Investigation Bureau (CIB) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>Under the "Leiting 29" campaign, a crackdown on underground
gambling groups, particularly those applying the Hong Kong horse
racing lottery mechanism to offer bets, the CIB investigators teamed
up with officers from the Kaohsiung City Police Department to make
the arrests in several locations in downtown Kaohsiung late Thursday
night.</P>
      <P>The investigators discovered that the five men had been operating
the Hong Kong horse racing lottery since 1999, with wager operations
scattering around the island and stake money topping billions of new
Taiwan dollars.</P>
      <P>The investigators also unearthed several passbooks and nine
banking accounts containing more than NT$100 million.</P>
      <P>The CIB authorities were tipped off that wagers on the outcome of
the presidential election have been rampant islandwide, particularly
in central and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Betting, like other forms of gambling, is illegal in Taiwan and
betting on elections is especially rare. The "Leiting 29" campaign
was launched to avoid underground gambling rings from manipulating
the presidential election by offering big stake wagers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng led
the citizens of the outlying island Friday in a blood donation drive,
on the eve of 2-28 Peace Memorial Day.</P>
      <P>Lee, who was the first in a long line of people willing to roll
up their sleeves and donate blood at the Kinmen County Stadium, said
that the move will make the people of the island linked to those in
Taiwan proper by blood, as well as by love and compassion, which he
said would help heal "historic wounds."</P>
      <P>"This will have positive significance to the ethnic integration
of the ethnic groups," he added.</P>
      <P>Yok Mu-ming, chairman of the tiny opposition New Party, who
earlier initiated the 2-28 blood donation drive, "advocating blood
donation to replace bloodshed," was accompanied by NP Legislator Wu
Cheng-tian when he gave blood.</P>
      <P>He said that the party worked with civic groups to launch the
drive, hoping to use the blood donation to replace bloodshed and
erase the stigma that stays in the memories of the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Yok said that since the drive started in Taipei Feb. 7, similar
activities have been held in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan and in
Taichung, central Taiwan, and has collected more than 1.6 million
bags, or 40 million c.c. of blood.</P>
      <P>Yok expressed the hope that the blood drive will become a
permanent mark of Peace Memorial Day.</P>
      <P>The day remembers the tragic events that began Feb. 28, 1947,
when a Taiwanese woman selling contraband cigarettes was beaten by
police. The incident sparked riots followed by a brutal crackdown by
the authorities throughout Taiwan in which tens of thousands were
reportedly killed or imprisoned and which led to the ensuing "white
terror" period.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party and its ally, the Taiwan
Solidarity Union, will stage a "one million people holding hands"
event to form a giant human chain along the length of Taiwan, while
the major opposition parties, led by the Kuomintang, will stage an
islandwide run to mark 2-28 Day.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER RETURNS TO LEGISLATIVE FLOOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shui-kun returned to the
often rowdy Legislative Yuan Friday, three days after he led his
Cabinet ministers to walk off the legislative floor to protest
insults made by two opposition lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Before his return to the Legislature, Yu read a prepared
statement outside the assembly hall that urged lawmakers to
focus on policy issues and stop ridiculing administration
officials.</P>
      <P>Yu said in his eight-minute statement that the Cabinet has
consistently respected the Legislature.</P>
      <P>"I hope all lawmakers can exercise self-restraint and reason in
questioning government officials as the first step to realizing the
much-anticipated legislative reform," Yu said.</P>
      <P>Yu became angry Tuesday during a question-and-answer session with
lawmakers discussing the budget. Two lawmakers from the opposition
People First Party (PFP) began ridiculing the premier by giving him a
mock Oscar Award for "the best thug politician."</P>
      <P>When Yu walked out of the Legislature, it marked the first time in
13 years that a premier has made such a move. The premier, appointed
by the president, is responsible for defending the government's
policies in the Legislature.</P>
      <P>Yu said he feels regret that some legislators have mistaken the
Cabinet's forbearance as a 'matter of course' and have habitually
used abusive language and made personal attacks against
administration officials.</P>
      <P>"To attract media attention, several lawmakers have used bad
language against officials at random and turned the legislative floor
into a show ground," lamented Yu.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Legislature is a venue for rational discussion
and debate on major public issues, Yu said those lawmakers'
distasteful behavior has seriously hurt Taiwan's constitutional
democracy and made people lose confidence in the Legislature.</P>
      <P>During Tuesday's question-and-answer session, Yu said, two
PFP legislators made irrational verbal attacks on him and members of
his administrative team.</P>
      <P>"I sincerely asked them to exercise reason in their questioning
and raised my hand to show my protest to the chairman of the session
on five occasions. However, the two lawmakers didn't cease uttering
abusive language nor did they offer any apology, " Yu recalled.</P>
      <P>Yu said he maintained his respect for the Legislature despite
facing such an insulting situation.</P>
      <P>"I didn't leave the Legislative Yuan. I just led my
administrative team to take a break from the legislative floor in a
show of protest. I stayed at the Legislature, waiting for the
chairman of the session to handle the issue," Yu said.</P>
      <P>The premier stressed that his protest was necessary to protect
the dignity of Cabinet ministers and to arouse the public's attention
to the need for legislative reform.</P>
      <P>In the past few days, Yu said, mainstream public opinion has
shown sympathy for the Cabinet's stance and disdain for the two
lawmakers' irrational actions.</P>
      <P>Even though the two lawmakers and their party have not apologized
for their actions, Yu said he still decided to lead his Cabinet
ministers to the Legislature to take questions out of respect for the
nation's constitutional system.</P>
      <P>"I find comfort in our compatriots' support for the Cabinet's
stance. Their encouragement and support indicate that our legislative
reform agenda will eventually make headway," Yu said.</P>
      <P>In his statement, the premier also recommended that the
Legislature adopt four measures to improve its interpellation system.</P>
      <P>First of all, Yu said he hopes that lawmakers and administration
officials pose questions or make replies only after receiving
approval of the chairman of the legislative session.</P>
      <P>Since the main purpose of interpellation is for policy
explanation and discussion, Yu said, the procedures and time frames
for the questioning and responding parties should be handled in line
with the principles of parity and impartiality in order to promote
rational debate.</P>
      <P>The scope of interpellation should be restricted to issues
regarding the administration's work schedules, policy lines and other
relevant affairs, Yu said, adding that the chairman of the session
should order a halt to proceedings whenever lawmakers violate this
principle and pose irrelevant questions.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Yu said he hopes that the provisions in the
legislators' code of conduct and the statute on the exercise of
legislative power that prohibit lawmakers from reviling or insulting
government officials can be strictly enforced.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the people of Taiwan have high expectations
regarding legislative reform and upgrading of legislative efficiency,
Yu said he earnestly hopes that all lawmakers can exercise
self-discipline and set a good model for legislative operations.</P>
      <P>"I also hope none of our lawmakers will keep silent over a few of
their colleagues' distasteful actions in the future," he added.</P>
      <P>After delivering his statement, Yu led all the Cabinet ministers
in entering the legislative conference hall to take questions from
lawmakers from across the party spectrum.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said earlier in the day it would come up with
a proposal next week demanding that the legislative disciplinary
committee mete out punishment to the two PFP lawmakers -- Chuang
Shao-ho and Lai Chin-ling -- both of whom branded Yu as a "rascal"
politician during Tuesday's question-and-answer session.</P>
      <P>The two PFP lawmakers said they already retracted their comments
on Yu at the request of Legisaltive Yuan Vice President P. K. Chiang
who chaired Tuesday's session.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SISY CHEN: LUCKY FOR BEING CHOSEN TO DEBATE MAC HEAD</HEADLINE>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Independent Legislator Sisy Chen said
Friday that she is the "luckiest one" for being chosen in a draw to
debate Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council, in the upcoming public debates on the referendum.</P>
      <P>Chen, who will represent the "nay" side in one of the 10 public
debates on the two referendum questions, said she feels lucky to be
chosen because she considers Tsai, who will be the only woman
representative on the "yea" side, or the government side, to be a
respectable opponent of top caliber in professional knowledge,
learning and moral standards.</P>
      <P>The debates are being organized by the Central Election
Commission in accordance with the Referendum Law. The referendum will
be held on the day of the presidential election set for March 20.</P>
      <P>The first of the 10 public debates, five for each of the two
referendum questions, is set to be held this coming Sunday.</P>
      <P>The two questions are whether Taiwan should strengthen its
missile defenses if mainland China refuses to remove its missiles
aimed at the island, and whether the government should negotiate with
Beijing on the establishment of a peace and stability interaction
mechanism.</P>
      <P>On the first question regarding strengthening the nation's
defenses, Executive Yuan spokesman Lin Chia-lung will face aboriginal
Legislator Chin May; while Joseph Wu, deputy secretary general of the
Presidential Office will go up against Chan Chao-li, a poet who is
concerned with the rights of grass-roots voters. Chan was one of the
leaders of the 120,000-strong group of farmers and fishermen who
protested in Taipei on Nov. 23, 2002 -- the largest protest rally
ever by farmers and fishermen in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislator Lo Chih-ming from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) will face former Control Yuan member Yeh
Yao-peng; DPP Legislator Yu Ching will face Green Party leader Kao
Cheng-yen; and DPP Legislator Julian Kuo will face Jaw Shau-kong,
chairman of the UFO Network and a TV talk show host.</P>
      <P>On the second question, Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh will face off
against writer Li Ao; Minister without Portfolio Yeh Chun-jung will
go up against former DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang; DPP Legislator Chiu
Tai-san will face National Taiwan University professor Tim T.Y. Ting;
DPP Legislator Cho Jung-tai will debate Tamkang University Professor
Juan Ming; and Tsai Ing-wen will square off against Sisy Chen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ALL TAIWANESE ARE MASTERS OF THE ISLAND: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Saturday said
that there is no difference between "new Taiwanese" and " old
Taiwanese" among the 23 million people of Taiwan and that all
Taiwanese are masters of the island.</P>
      <P>The president made the comments in a feature he wrote to mark the
57th anniversary of the tragic 2-28 Incident in which the
government's suppression of Taiwanese caused a bloody conflict
between native Taiwanese and local residents from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Noting that the 2-28 Incident is still a sensitive topic in
Taiwan and that some people think it's best not to touch on the issue
and to leave it behind, Chen said that as the nation's leader, he
does not think this is the way to deal with the matter.</P>
      <P>He said that having love for Taiwan and for the people, looking
at the past and at ourselves with self-examination, and having a
forgiving attitude toward others is the best way to approach the
sensitive topic.</P>
      <P>He further said that if "our hearts are filled with love,
forgiveness and self-examination," then history will lead us forward,
and the pursuit of democracy and justice will never falter.</P>
      <P>Looking back on history also helps to remind the people of Taiwan
of their achievements as well as the sacrifices of their forefathers,
Chen said, adding that the people should always believe that they are
the masters of their own land.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has been a multi-ethnic society for some four
hundred years, Chen said that the differences between the people and
their leaders should definitely not be viewed as differences among
the ethnic groups.</P>
      <P>"Descendants of the aboriginal people, the Haklo, the Hakka,
mainland Chinese, as well as newcomers from other nations are all
masters of the big family of Taiwan, " Chen said, adding that " in
today's Taiwan, there is no difference between masters and guests,
nor distinction between "minority" and "majority" since the 23
million people are all an integral part of Taiwan and share in its
destiny.</P>
      <P>Reiterating that Taiwan belongs to the people of Taiwan and is
not a vassal state of any other nation or people, the president said
that the island should think about its future structure and form. He
pointed out that "emphasizing Taiwan's separate identity is not
tantamount to the 'de-Sinicization' of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan stands at the intersection of "oceanic
culture and continental culture, " and that besides its multicultural
assets, the island has also absorbed the essence of Chinese, Asian as
well as European and American culture.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is not a part of mainland China from the
standpoint of sovereignty, Chen said, "China" and "Chinese culture"
are certainly a part of Taiwan from the standpoint of history,
culture and blood ties.</P>
      <P>Saying that there is no longer any distinction between "new
Taiwanese" and "old Taiwanese," the president called on the people of
Taiwan to trust each other and work together as all the 23 million
people of Taiwan are the masters of Taiwan's present and future.</P>

      <P>New York Times: Two
studies cite child sex abuse by 4 percent of

      <P>Two long-awaited studies have found that the
Roman Catholic Church suffered an epidemic of
child sexual abuse that involved at least 4
percent of priests over 52 years and peaked with
the ordination class of 1970, in which one of
every 10 priests was eventually accused of
abuse.</P>
      <P>The human toll amounted to 10,667 children
allegedly victimized by 4,392 priests from 1950
to 2002, but the studies caution that even
these numbers represent an undercount. The totals
depend on self-reporting by American bishops, the
studies note, and many victims have never come
forward out of fear or shame.</P>
      <P>The studies were commissioned by the American
Catholic bishops in 2002 in response to
accusations of a massive episcopal cover-up of
sexual abuse by priests. They will undoubtedly
provide fodder for controversies between left and
right in the church about issues like
homosexuality in the priesthood and whether the
celibacy requirement for priests should be
revoked.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER PRESIDENT HAILS HUMAN CHAIN RALLY AS MOST MOVING MOMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Miaoli,  Taiwan, Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui said
Saturday that he was deeply moved when he saw more than one million
fellow compatriots hold hands together to form a human chain to
express their love for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"This is the most touching moment in my life, " an emotional Lee
told a huge crowd of people gathering at the Miaoli command center
for the unprecedented mass rally. "I believe it is also one of the
most moving moments in Taiwan's history."</P>
      <P>Lee, an outspoken critic of mainland China's military threat to
Taiwan and an ardent advocate of Taiwan's separate national identity,
said the human chain rally was a show of "people power" and the "hope
for Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"The successful 'one million people hand-in-hand' rally signifies
our recognition of Taiwan's national identity and underscores our
refusal of Beijing's unification proposal," Lee said, adding that the
historic rally was a success for the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Through this largest-ever mass movement on the island, Lee said,
the people of Taiwan have shown to mainland China and the
international community their firm love for peace and aversion to
mainland China's deployment of hundreds of missiles against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The event, which organizers said attracted about 1.2 million
people, was the biggest islandwide rally in Taiwan's history.
Participants expressed the hope that the rally would win the world's
sympathy for Taiwan in its struggle against mainland China.</P>
      <P>The human chain stretched 487 kilometers from the Hoping Island
in the northern city of Keelung down the flat western coast to
Pingtung County near the island's southern tip. Local TV stations
that covered the event from helicopters said the chain was complete.</P>
      <P>The event was jointly organized by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, of which
former President Lee is the spiritual leader.</P>
      <P>Organizers chose Feb. 28 as the date to hold the human chain
rally to mark the anniversary of an uprising in 1947, known as the
"2-28 Incident, " when anti-corruption protests turned violent.
Soldiers with the former Nationalist government put down the
demonstrations, killing hundreds, maybe thousands, of people.</P>
      <P>The participants linked hands just before 2: 28 p.m. and held
hands for about three minutes. They shouted slogans, such as "Taiwan
Yes! " "Love Peace! " "Missiles No! " "Ethnic Harmony and Unity" and
"Hold Hands Together to Protect Taiwan."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PEOPLE WANT A LEADER WHO SPEAKS THE TRUTH: SOONG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition vice presidential candidate
James Soong said Saturday that Taiwan's problem today is that the
people "have had enough" and want a president "who speaks the truth
and really gets things done."</P>
      <P>Soong, chairman of the People First Party, made the comments in a
televised forum for vice presidential candidates sponsored by the
Central Election Commission.</P>
      <P>Soong, who is Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan's running mate
first addressed the families of the victims of the 2-28 Incident in
his 30-minute presentation to offer them his deepest sympathy as
Saturday marked the 57th anniversary of the tragic incident.</P>
      <P>Soong said that if the Lien-Soong ticket is elected, it will
advocate the "separation between politics and the economy" in
cross-strait relations. He said that in the political area, both
sides should maintain the status quo, while in terms of the economy,
cross-strait relations should not be stalled for even a single day,
as "we will lose our future if we have no competitiveness."</P>
      <P>He also said that if the Lien-Soong ticket is elected, the new
administration will seek to make the interests of the people the top
priority regardless of their political affiliation or ethnicity and
respect the professionalism.</P>
      <P>He noted that President Chen Shui-bian had said in the second
debate between the presidential candidates that Lien's only move over
the past four years has been "to expel (former ROC President and KMT
Chairman) Lee Teng-hui and team up with Soong."</P>
      <P>Although Chen aimed to mock Lien, Soong claimed, the president's
words actually attested to the fact that Lien has decided to cut off
the KMT's links with corrupt "black gold" politics, which marred the
latter half of Lee's rule and was one of the major reasons behind the
KMT losing power after ruling Taiwan for more than five decades. Lien
also wants to work with his the efficient team of the former Taiwan
Provincial government, he added.</P>
      <P>Soong, who served as Taiwan provincial governor between 1994 and
1998, said he grew up in Taiwan and has an attachment to this land.
He said he is devoted to the country, adding that he contributed to
Taiwan's democratization and took pride in the "silent revolution" of
Taiwan's transformation.</P>
      <P>He lashed out at the current administration for its poor economic
performance over the past four years, adding that the spectre of
"black gold" politics lingers.</P>
      <P>"People question whether President Chen has really introduced
reforms as he had advocated, " Soong said.</P>
      <P>He stressed that if the Lien-Soong team is elected, the new
administration will not betray the Taiwan people's insistence on
freedom and democracy for more business with mainland China, but
neither will it lose out on trade opportunities due to political
ideology.</P>
      <P>He said that the new administration will provide Taiwan with
stability, adding that a leader should "lead, not mislead" the
country and must "tell the truth and really get things done" so as to
bring hope to Taiwan and to the people.</P>
      <P>Soong pointed out that a leader should tell the people about the
real situation, citing Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong as an
example by saying that when Goh was faced with the nation's economic
crisis, he chose to communicate with the people and didn't blame it

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MUST PURSUE PIVOTAL ROLE IN COMING PACIFIC CENTURY: LU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Saturday
that Taiwan should strive to play a pivotal role in what she called
the "Pacific century" now taking shape, rather than seeking to
integrate with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lu made the call in a televised campaign forum sponsored by the
Central Election Commission -- the only one of its kind to be held
ahead of the March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan occupies a strategic location in the
Asia-Pacific region, Lu said mainland China's insistence on taking
control of Taiwan is closely related to what she called its attempt
to build a Chinese empire.</P>
      <P>Without Taiwan in its control, Lu said, mainland China cannot
enjoy free access to the Pacific Ocean.</P>
      <P>In the face of mainland China's rise as a new economic
powerhouse, Lu said, Taiwan must choose whether to integrate with
mainland China or to glorify its unique role as a Pacific "maritime"
country.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan companies continue their exodus to mainland China, Lu
claimed, Taiwan could face a crisis of being absorbed into the vast
mainland market and being marginalized in the international market.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Lu said, Taiwan should adopt a new strategic thinking
to cope with the new challenges.</P>
      <P>In her view, Lu said, Taiwan should continue reinforcing its
defense capabilities and strengthening defense cooperation with the
United States and Japan.</P>
      <P>Given mainland China's persistent military threat, Lu said
the opposition "pan-blue alliance's" campaign promise to replace the
current conscription system with an all-volunteer one is extremely
unrealistic.</P>

      <P>Building trust will be high on the work

vice presidential candidate said Saturday.</P>
      <P>People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong, who is Kuomintang

and Vice President Annette Lu, made the comments in a televised

      <P>Ridiculing what he called President Chen's frequent policy
flip-flops and Chen's confusing explanations of his "four noes plus
one" pledge outlined in his 2000 inaugural speech, Soong claimed that
the Taiwan people have lost their trust in the president over the

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Saturday called
for "love, forgiveness and reflection" while speaking at a ceremony
marking the nation's 2-28 Peace Memorial Day.</P>
      <P>The ceremony, commemorating the 57th anniversary of the tragic
2-28 Incident, was held at a wharf in Keelung where troops sent by
the Nationalist government from mainland China landed in 1947 and
began a bloody suppression of "riotous" locals.</P>
      <P>Music played by trumpet and a string quartet began the solemn
ceremony. President Chen as well as the family members of some of the
victims of the bloody suppression observed a moment of silence for
those who suffered in the 2-28 incident.</P>
      <P>The family members watched with tears as a group of performers
reenacted the tragic event which was triggered by a clash between an
old woman selling contraband cigarettes and an armed agent of the
Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau on Feb. 27, 1947. Tens of
thousands of people were reportedly killed or imprisoned during the
protest and riots the following day and the subsequent "white terror"
period.</P>
      <P>After the moment of silence, President Chen led the family
members in laying bouquets of flowers on a mock monument on the
stage in honor of the victims, symbolizing that they will face the
historic wound with love and reflection.</P>
      <P>The president then presented to the family members certificates
restoring the reputations of the fallen victims.</P>
      <P>Noting that "some have said that reopening the historial wound of
the 2-28 Incident will divide Taiwan's ethnic groups and destabilize
society, " Chen said he disagreed with this view. "The victims
included Hoklo (Taiwanese), Hakka, aboriginal people and mainlanders.
They were all victims of Taiwan history."</P>
      <P>The president said that he was deeply "moved" when he presented
the rehabilitation certificates to the victims and their families. He
expressed the hope that the Taiwan people will use their "forbearance
and reflection" through the reexamination of the historial wound
and the establishment of a memorial monument.</P>
      <P>Chen also stressed that pluralism is a major asset of Taiwan,
adding that "we should face the truth, families of the victims, and
mistakes with forgiveness, compassion and firmness."</P>
      <P>He urged everybody to take part in the islandwide "hand-in-hand"
rally in the afternoon to show their determination to ensure the
nation's security, saying this would be "the best way to commemorate
the 2-28 incident."</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-huang, chairman of a 2-28 foundation, recalled the
sending of the troops of the 21st division by Nationalist government
to land at Keelung Harbor to suppress the local population. He
contrasted that episode with the current situation where mainland
China has more than 500 missiles aimed at Taiwan and where "the
Taiwan people face a constant threat."</P>
      <P>He urged the people to participate in the "hand-in-hand"
human-chain activity in the afternoon to convey to the world the
message that the Taiwan people love peace.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP APPEALS TO VOTERS FOLLOWING HUMAN CHAIN SUCCESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 29 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After mobilizing more than a million people
to form a human chain winding through Taiwan to mark 2-28 Peace Day,
the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is hopping its presidential
candidate, Chen Shui-bian, can ride the success of the Peace Day
rally and win the March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The Peace Day rally's theme, "millions joining hands to protect
Taiwan" is similar to the purpose of the referendum -- to unite the
Taiwan people to say "no" to Beijing's missile threat against the
island.</P>
      <P>With the presidential election and the referendum only 20 days,
away, the president's strategists considered the Feb. 28 rally a
"rehearsal" for the presidential election, as those who attended
Saturday's rally are likely to vote "yes" in the referendum and to
support Chen's re-election bid.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lo Wen-chia, who is a campaign strategist for the
president, said the DPP was encouraged by the good turnout at
Saturday's rally. However, he said, people's memories are short and
it will be a challenge to extend their enthusiasm for "protecting
Taiwan" to March 20.</P>
      <P>Ten rounds of public debates about the two referendum questions
is another way to keep public attention on Beijing's military threat
to Taiwan, said Legislator Chen Chi-mai, a spokesman for Chen's
national campaign headquarters.</P>
      <P>In 20 days before the people going to the polls, Chen said his
party will launch a "100 campaign" to urge people to choose the No. 1
candidate -- Chen Shui-bian -- in the election and to vote "yes" for
both referendum questions, represented by two naughts.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsai Huang-lang, the DPP whip at the Legislative Yuan
said the Feb. 28 rally aroused public patriotism and raised their
awareness about Taiwan's separate identity from that of mainland
China. This, he claimed, will drive many "floating" voters who have
no specific political preference to support Chen and his party.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the more people turn out to vote, the better for
Chen and the DPP, and he predicted that Chen is "sure to win" if only
70 percent of the voters cast their ballots.</P>
      <P>Chen's camp will also boost the performance of his
administration, which has been ignored because of misleading
information spread by the camp of Chen's rival in the race,
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Chen's administration has been much more aggressive
and efficient in carrying out policy than the preceding KMT
administration, Tsai said DPP will launch another round of campaign
advertisements before March 20.</P>
      <P>Many DPP lawmakers agree their party is dominant in southern
Taiwan but is no match for the KMT in northern Taiwan. In order to
win the presidential election, they feel that the DPP has to win
overwhelmingly in southern Taiwan, win slightly in central Taiwan and
lose only a little in northern Taiwan. Now, the DPP's top priority is
to keep the people's zeal to defend the country and translate this
strong feeling into support for Chen in the election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW TAIWAN DOLLAR TO MAINTAIN DEPRECIATION AGAINST U.S. DOLLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 29 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The new Taiwan dollar is expected to hover
around against the U.S. dollar between a range of 33.35 to 33.45 this
week, maintaining a trend of slight depreciation against the
greenback, market dealers said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Market dealers predicted that the local currency, continuing its
depreciation trend against the U.S. dollar of last week, will further
move down in value in the coming days, prompted by a weaker yen and
stronger demand from local importers' for U.S. dollars.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the yen might continue to depreciate against
the U.S. dollar in the short term, moving between the 108-111 level,
they said, predicting that it will be very difficult for the yen to
pick up in value against the greenback at a level above 110 in the
near future. It closed at 109 Feb. 20.</P>
      <P>Market dealers forecast that the local currency will hover around
against the U.S. dollar in the 33.35-33.45 range this week. The new
Taiwan dollar ended at 33.364 against the U.S. dollar last Friday, a
drop of NT$0.145 from the previous week's level of 33.22.</P>
      <P>The U. S. dollar's short-term appreciation last week was ascribed
to a devalued euro that was the result of rampant speculation that
the European central bank will raise interest rates. However, market
dealers said the euro will stand firm against the greenback at a
level of 1.24 and that the U.S. dollar will gradually drift lower in
the mid- and long-term.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRC MILITARY THREAT HAS NOT LESSENED OVER PAST FOUR YEARS: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 29 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Sunday that
the Chinese communist military threat toward Taiwan has not been
alleviated over the past four years.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of an international symposium on Taiwan's
national defense, Chen said the country's national defense is a
firewall against the People's Liberation Army's military attempts.</P>
      <P>Chen said that since he spelled out his "four noes plus one"
pledge during his inauguration in 2000 as a gesture of goodwill to
mainland China, he has not seen the PRC reduce its military threat
toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the contrary, he added, the PRC arms buildup, particularly
its missile deployment targeting Taiwan, has increased rapidly
over the past four years.</P>
      <P>The PLA's speedy modernization, particularly the improving of the
precision of its ballistic missiles and its large-scale deployment of
missiles, are all factors contributing to the increasing changes in
the military balance across the Taiwan Strait, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Chen quoted military intelligence as indicating that the number
of the PLA's tactical guided missiles increased 11-fold between 1995
and 2003 and is still rising at the rate of one every six days.</P>
      <P>Facing Beijing's ever-mounting military threat, he added, the
Taiwan people must consolidate and jointly throw their support behind
the armed forces, while the government accelerates the modernization
of the military, including the building of anti-missile preparedness.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that the factor of "people" stills plays an
important role in efforts to upgrade Taiwan's overall defense
capability and competitiveness. Thus, seeking to raise the caliber of
military personnel is one of the goals of national defense reform, he
added.</P>
      <P>As commander of the Republic of China armed forces, Chen said, it
is his responsibility to ensure that Taiwan's national security is
well protected. He added that he will refer to professional expertise
from the Ministry of National Defense whenever making comments
regarding military affairs.</P>
      <P>Still, he said, he cannot agree with some of the "empty promises"
made by his presidential election rival about the nation's military
recruitment and conscription policy.</P>
      <P>Chen said that while he has advocated a system of recruitment for
10 years, he has also insisted that the policy on calling and
maintaining a standing army must be implemented step-by-step, with
the country's national security being the top and ultimate goal.</P>
      <P>Chen's rival, "pan-blue alliance" presidential candidate Lien
Chan said in a debate with Chen last week that he advocates a system
of recruitment or drafting for the armed forces that would encourage
more career soldiers and that compulsory military service should be
shortened to three months instead of the current 20 months.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Lien's remarks, Chen said Lien was issuing a
campaign check that is bound to bounce.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FIRST TWO ROUNDS OF REFERENDUM DEBATE OPEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  29 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The first two of 10 rounds of televised
debates about the two questions in the March 20 referendum were
staged Sunday by the Chinese Television System (CTS).</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan's spokesman, Lin Chia-lung, debated with
independent Legislator Kao Chin Su-mei over the country's
missile-defense system, while Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh argued
against writer Lee Ao over the possibility of setting up a
negotiating framework with Beijing.</P>
      <P>In the debate between Lin and Kao over the first question in the
referendum -- whether the country should strengthen its missile
defense capability in the face of Beijing's missile threat -- Kao,
who was elected by the country's aborigines, questioned the wisdom in
earmarking NT$700 billion (US$20.9 billion) for an anti-missile
system in light of the miserable lives of the island's aborigines.</P>
      <P>Beijing has targeted the island with 496 missiles and Kao claimed
that in the event of an attack, the country would be leveled and a
missile defense system would not boost Taiwan's chance if survival.</P>
      <P>Lin countered by describing the referendum as both legal and
necessary, although his opponent did not call into question the
referendum's legality.</P>
      <P>Describing the first national referendum a historic event in the
country's democratic development, Lin said he is looking forward to
what he called the glorious result of many democratic activists'
bloodshed and struggle.</P>
      <P>Defense capability is to a country what air is to humans, Lin
said, adding that no country can survive without defenses.</P>
      <P>Noting that 15 years ago, the people of the three Baltic states
stood up to assert their opposition to rule by their powerful
neighbor, Russia, and affirm their statehood via referendum, Lin
urged the public to take a cue from those three states and show the
world their opposition to Beijing's military threat.</P>
      <P>He played down critics' concerns that Taiwan's purchase of
anti-missile systems will trigger an arms race with the mainland,
claiming that the systems will give the country the ability to
survive a first strike by Beijing and give the country's allies time
to come to the island's defense.</P>
      <P>He said a referendum on the question of whether the country needs
to strengthen its missile defense capability is the cheapest and most
efficient way to underline Beijing's military threat against Taiwan
and to seek international sympathy for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the second round of debate between Hsieh and Lee, also staged
by the CTS, the two argued over whether the country should negotiate
with Beijing for a peaceful interaction framework.</P>
      <P>Lee said that President Chen Shui-bian should ask the people in
the unprecedented referendum whether Taiwan should declare
independence rather than whether the country should negotiate with
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Without assuming a new name, Lee claimed, Taipei would play into
the hands of Beijing by negotiating with Beijing as the Republic of
China, whose Constitution still considers the mainland as part of its
territory, that there is only one China and that the "One China"
policy is the bottom line of any negotiation with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Suggesting that the referendum is a precursor for a referendum to
justify the island's separation from the mainland, Lee dared his
opponent in the debate to call for a referendum on Taiwan
independence rather than beating around the bush by calling for a
referendum on a question that is of no importance.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said there might be no doubt that the answer to the second
referendum question is "yes" and that the government will go to the
negotiating table with Beijing even if the referendum fails, but he
added that a failure would weaken the government's negotiating
position with Beijing and give rise to the misconception that the
country is divided on the issue.</P>
      <P>Just like Saturday's 2-28 rally that made headlines in newspapers
around the world, the island will be catapulted into the
international limelight again and its message will get across to the
world if there is a good referendum turnout March 20.</P>
      <P>"We all love Taiwan, so let's rally behind the government by
casting votes in the referendum to show our firm national desire for
peace," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>There are still eight rounds of debate about the referendum --
four each for the two questions -- to be staged before March 14, the
last Sunday before voting day. The Central Election Commission, which
has to organize the debates under the terms of the Referendum Law,
has lined up one round for each question, on every Wednesday and
Sunday over the next two weeks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PLA PONDERING TAIWAN INVASION OPTION: U.S. PUNDIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 29 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A U.S. scholar of national defense affairs
said in Taipei Sunday that he has learned that the mainland Chinese
military has been pondering a sweeping attack on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Andrew Scobell, an associate research professor at the Strategic
Studies Institute of U.S. Army War College, said at an international
symposium on Taiwan's national defense that while he has considered a
conventional and sweeping invasion of Taiwan by mainland forces
impossible over the past years, he has since the beginning of 2004
not excluded the possibility of Beijing taking this option.</P>
      <P>Scobell, author of China's Use of Military Force: Beyond the
Great Wall and the Long March, said that he is positive that the
mainland's People's Liberation Army has been mulling, planning and
exercising this Taiwan attack scenario.</P>
      <P>In view of this scenario, Scobell suggested that Taiwan beef up
its counter-attack capabilities by strengthening its air and sea
combat tactics and giving top priority to upgrading its
anti-submarine and anti-torpedo capabilities.</P>
      <P>Strategically, he said, the best way to smash a PLA attempt to
invade Taiwan is to demonstrate strength and determination without
being provocative.</P>
      <P>He said the Taiwan leaders should continue to stress that if the
PLA launches a military attack against Taiwan, it will be time for
Taiwan to announce independence. This in turn would serve as a
message to Beijing that early prevention of growing hostility across
the Taiwan Strait would be the only option for mainland China to
prevent Taiwan from announcing independence -- the last scenario that
Beijing would like to see, he added.</P>
      <P>In his theory titled "Coercion or Capture" presented during the
symposium, Scobell said that the Beijing leadership has adopted an
optimistic attitude toward cross-strait relations in the past. But
the Beijing leaders have been forced to re-evaluate the situation, as
Taiwan's politics have changed drastically in recent years, he said.</P>
      <P>For most analysts and experts in Chinese affairs, Scobell said,
the Beijing leaders still tend to adopt a "coercion" policy toward
Taiwan rather than the "capture" option.</P>
      <P>The problem is, he pointed out, that there is only a very thin
grey line between "coercion" and "capture, " given that the PLA's
action of coercion might develop into a real invasion operation,
while an invasion operation might turn out only to be a drill.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CARAVAN ORGANIZED TO MARK OPENING OF AIRPORT IN CENTRAL TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 29 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A caravan of cars and horses decorated with
colorful flowers moved through the streets of downtown Taichung City
in central Taiwan Sunday to mark the opening of an international
airport in the region.</P>
      <P>The carnival-style activities were sponsored by the Central
Coordination Office under the Executive Yuan to celebrate the March 6
inauguration of the international airport in Chingchuankang, which is
also an air force base.</P>
      <P>Three chartered flights to Tokyo, Phuket Island and Palau,
carrying a total of 360 lucky tourists selected through a draw, were
scheduled to take off later in the day to mark the opening of
Chingchuankang International Airport, which will only operate
outbound charter flights in the initial stage.</P>
      <P>Office director and former Taichung County Chief Liao Yung-lai
hailed the charter flights, saying that they mark the very first step
for the airport that will serve the 6 million people living in
central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taichung Chamber of Commerce Chairman Lai Cheng-i, who was in
charge of organizing the three chartered flights in cooperation with
China Airlines and Far East Air Transport Corp., said he is
optimistic about the business prospects for Chingchuankang airport.
He forecast that the airport will undoubtedly play a significant role
after Taiwan and mainland China establish normal transport links.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PERCENTAGE OF DIALYSIS PATIENTS IN TAIWAN TOPS THE WORLD: DOCTOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 29 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of patients in Taiwan who need
renal dialysis totals about 35,000, the highest figure in the world
in terms of percentage of the population, a nephrology doctor said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Dr. Yang Wu-chang, chairman of the Taiwan Society of Nephrology
and a physician at the Veterans General Hospital in Taipei, said that
the annual increase rate of dialysis patients also tops the world at
3,000 to 4,000, mostly senior citizens.</P>
      <P>He attributed the high percentage of such patients mainly to the
facts that there are relatively higher percentages of patients with
diabetes and high blood pressure, and that Taiwan patients tend to
use excessive amounts of medication that contain nephrotoxins.</P>
      <P>Yang pointed out that people aged over 65 with high blood
pressure and hyperazoturia and who have suffered from diabetes for
more than 10 years tend to be potential nephrological patients
needing regular dialysis treatment.</P>
      <P>Yang suggested that people aged over 40 should have their kidneys
examined once every two years, while those aged over 50 should have
them checked once every year. People with hyperazoturia should have
their kidney function examined once every three months, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENTIAL RACE AFFECTING OUTBOUND TRAVEL WILLINGNESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 29 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The approaching presidential election has
sent a chill through domestic tourist agencies operating outbound
travel, as demand for package tours departing before March 20
election day is extremely low, business sources said Sunday.</P>
      <P>To encourage travelers to holiday abroad in the runup to the
election, tourism agencies are offering reduced prices to lure
customers, the sources said, adding that the election is having a
major impact on their business.</P>
      <P>Pointing to the last presidential election as an example, they
said bookings for outbound travel before noon March 20 were only half
full, pushing tourist agencies to lower their prices by two-thirds to
cope with the situation. Those groups which left after noon March 20
four years ago were also offered at lowered prices, they noted.</P>
      <P>To avoid losses this year, tourist agencies have organized fewer
outbound chartered trips and all the outgoing groups will depart
after noon at promotional prices, they said. They encouraged the
public to seize the opportunity of cheap package tours.</P>
      <P>Now that demand for pleasure trips to mainland China and Japan,
as well as to destinations in Europe and other parts of the northern
hemisphere, is set to peak after March 20, they said that prices
probably be adjusted upward by at least 10 percent.</P>
