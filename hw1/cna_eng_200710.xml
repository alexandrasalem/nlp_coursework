    <HEADLINE>DPP congress ends with vow to build normal country, happy Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)  concluded its annual national
congress Sunday,  with a declaration that pledges to make Taiwan a "normal
country and happy homeland."</P>
      <P>According to the declaration, Taiwan would be able to break out of old shackles
and go down its own road under its own name so long as the DPP can continue its
grip on the presidency and win more than half of the seats in the Legislative
Yuan in next year's elections.</P>
      <P>The declaration also singles out the party's two other major tasks -- working to
ensure the passage of two planned referendums on forcing the main opposition
Kuomintang to return its ill-gotten party assets to the national coffers and
joining the United Nations under the name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>About 300 party delegates  attended the half-day  national congress, which was
presided by Premier Chang Chun-hsiung.</P>
      <P>Notably absent from the session were President Chen Shui-bian, DPP Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun and Frank Hsieh, the party's candidate for the 2008 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>The congress was overshadowed by a controversy over a "normal country
resolution" that was set to be passed at the meeting to serve as the party's
platform for the coming presidential election.</P>
      <P>Yu decided to step down from party chairmanship Thursday after the party's other
bigwigs reached a consensus a day earlier to omit more hardline suggestions in
the draft "normal country resolution" to change the country's name to "Taiwan"
from the current Republic of China to declare to the world that Taiwan is
already an independent sovereign state.</P>
      <P>Although the party's heavyweights, from President Chen on down, tried to
persuade Yu to remain on his post at least until the party congress, Yu insisted
on quitting at once and didn't show up at Sunday's congress.</P>
      <P>Two versions of the "normal country resolution" were presented for discussion at
the congress -- the Yu-proposed hardline version and the "consensus" version
that was reached at a Sept. 26 meeting of party heavyweights chaired by
President Chen.</P>
      <P>After two hours of debate, the hardline version was rejected by a vote in which
only 43 delegates raised their hands to express their support for the version
that could have further upset China and even the United States.</P>
      <P>Later on, the "consensus" version, which reaffirms the party's commitment to
"push for Taiwan's name rectification and write a new constitution, " was
approved, with an overwhelming majority of congress delegates applauding to show
their endorsement.</P>
      <P>The formally adopted "normal country resolution" will serve as road map for the
DPP administration in its efforts to fortify Taiwan-centric consciousness and
create a Taiwan identity, party officials said.</P>
      <P>The party congress was originally designed to serve as a pep rally to boost
morale of DPP candidates for the Jan. 12 legislative elections and March 22
presidential election. But arguments over wording of the "normal country
resolution" spoiled the atmosphere. DPP presidential candidate Frank Hsieh chose
not to attend the meeting.</P>
      <P>Yeh Chu-lan, the Presidential Office secretary-general who also serves as top
manager of Hsieh's campaign, said the morale-boosting pep rally will be
rescheduled later as it might need more time for party members with dissenting
views to calm down.</P>
      <P>Noting  that all DPP founding  members  risked arrest and imprisonment during
the martial law ear to create the party, none of them would compromise the
party's ultimate goal of building Taiwan into a "normal and great" democratic
country. She called for all party members to think about policy issues from a
broader vision instead of personal perspective for the sake of maintaining party
unity.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang voiced similar views, urging all DPP members to stand united and
refraining from internal strife over trivial technical details.</P>
      <P>"The DPP is a mature democratic party.  We tend to have pluralistic views on
policy issues. We have the ability to cope with different opinions. We should
never let minor issues undermine our morale and harmony," he said in his opening
remarks.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Chen Chi-mai said President Chen
didn't attend the congress mainly because he was informed in advance that the
pep rally to boost candidates' morale would be canceled. He said the president
supports the proposal to choose a more opportune time to hold such a rally to
drum up support for the party's candidates for the two coming elections.</P>
      <P>Many congress delegates said they support the omission of the hardline clause
from the "normal country resolution" because an overly  provocative  pro-
independence  platform  could  alienate middle-of-the-road voters who prefer to
maintain the peaceful status quo in the Taiwan Strait.</P>

      <P>Hsieh Wen-ting, a head prosecutor with the Supreme Prosecutors Office, will
serve as new secretary-general of the Judicial Yuan, judicial sources said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian once nominated Hsieh to serve as the country's  top
prosecutor,  officially  called  state  public prosecutor-general. But the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan vetoed Hsieh's nomination. The top
prosecutorial post later went to Chen Tsung-ming.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, new Judicial Yuan President Lai In-jaw, who will
assume office Monday, has invited Hsieh to serve as the country's top judicial
body's chief of staff. Hsieh confirmed in an interview with CNA that he has
accepted Lai's invitation.</P>
      <P>A changeover ceremony for Judicial Yuan president and vice president will be
held Monday morning. Lai will replace Weng Yueh-sheng as new Judicial Yuan head.
Weng will retire. Hsieh Tsay-chuan will be sworn in as Judicial Yuan vice
president, a post that has been left vacant since the resignation of Cheng
Chung-mo in April 2006 amid allegations that he had an affair with an assistant
professor at a local university.</P>

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh
faces tough challenges in consolidating party ranks following the party's annual
national congress, political sources said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Despite the passage at the party congress of a "consensus" version of the
"normal country resolution" that Hsieh supports, many thorny issues remain to be
resolved, the sources said.</P>
      <P>The most urgent issue is who should be the party's next chairman if Yu Shyi-kun
insists on his resignation offer.</P>
      <P>Yu decided to step down Thursday after the party's other bigwigs reached a
consensus on omitting a Yu-proposed hardline clause from the "normal country
resolution" that calls for changing the country's title to "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Although party heavyweights, including President Chen Shui-bian, have publicly
persuaded Yu to remain on the post, Yu has not been seen in public since
Thursday. He didn't show up to preside over the party's 21st founding
anniversary celebrations Friday nor attended Sunday's party congress.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time in the party's 21-year history that no party chairman
was available to chair its birthday celebrations and party congress.</P>
      <P>As Yu-proposed "hardline" version of the "normal country resolution" was
rejected at the party congress, with only 43 radical members voicing explicit
support, party sources said Hsieh will have a hard time reaching conciliation
with Yu and his hardline pro-independence followers.</P>
      <P>Hsieh has publicly supported the proposal that President Chen serves as the
party's chairman again if Yu would not return to the post. But it remains
uncertain whether Chen would accept the proposal.</P>
      <P>With the party's morale dropping to a new low over the controversy over the
"normal country resolution," party sources said Chen and Hsieh should come up
with new initiatives to reignite party members and supporters' passion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA chief unveils '21st century global village diplomatic policy'</HEADLINE>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang proposed his "21st century global
village diplomatic policy" at the Legislative Yuan Monday.</P>
      <P>While delivering a report at a Legislative Yuan Foreign Affairs Committee
meeting, Huang said the new policy is an "updated, situation-coping"  policy
that also stresses Taiwan's  distinct identity.</P>
      <P>The policy includes four major strategies for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) to follow, namely assuming a more "combative" approach in diplomatic
efforts to counter China's attempts to suppress Taiwan in the international
arena, adopting a "blue ocean strategy" to build relations with other countries,
promoting the "Taiwan experience" abroad, and adopting an "environmental
diplomacy" strategy, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Noting that China's efforts to suppress Taiwan's maneuvering space in the
international arena have reached an "insane level, " Huang said that MOFA
personnel on the "frontlines" abroad must work more aggressively to pre-empt
Beijing's attempts to isolate Taiwan diplomatically.</P>
      <P>On promoting the "Taiwan experience" abroad, Huang said that democracy, freedom
and economic co-prosperity form the foundation of the Taiwan experience, adding
that Taiwan has the ability to make contributions to the international community
and is willing to share its experience in economic development for the benefit
of the global community.</P>
      <P>Following a "blue ocean strategy, " Huang said, Taiwan will not engage in a
"zero sum" competition with China and will instead use its advantages in various
fields to build comprehensive partnerships with nations around the world.</P>
      <P>On adopting an "environmental diplomacy" strategy, Huang said it is hoped that
via cooperation in environmental protection efforts, Taiwan will be able to
strengthen its relations with the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Huang said in his report that the country's efforts to join the
United Nations under the name Taiwan launched this year have been a success in
terms of promoting Taiwan's bid to join the world body. Noting that the number
of media reports on the issue have increased three-fold, he said Taiwan's bid
has been brought into the international spotlight.</P>

      <P>The inauguration of the high speed railway has greatly affected domestic air
carriers, with the number of passengers on domestic flights in the first half of
this year declining 22.14 percent over the figure for the same period last year,
the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) reported Monday.</P>
      <P>MOTC officials said there were around 119,000 domestic flights in the first six
months this year, down 13.72 percent from the 138,000 flights during the same
period last year.</P>
      <P>The number of air passengers on domestic routes totaled 6.72 million in the
first six months of this year, down 22.14 percent from the 8.63 million the same
period last year.</P>
      <P>In comparison, the number of international flights (to and from Taiwan) totaled
95,820 during the Jan.-June period, up 3.36 percent over the figure for the same
period last year.</P>
      <P>The number of passengers on these international flights totaled 12.01 million
for the January-June period, up 4.26 percent from the 11.52 million of the first
half of last year.</P>
      <P>Transportation and Communications Minister Tsai Duei said that the official
inauguration of the high speed railway in early January has affected other
transportation operators, especially domestic air carriers.</P>
      <P>The MOTC, taking the people's rights as well as the sustainable development of
air carriers into consideration, has reviewed flight routes and numbers and
begun working with related sectors to promote package tours, he said.</P>
      <P>Civil Aeronautics Administration Director-General Billy Chang said that the
sluggish economy as well as convenient land transportation have affected
domestic air carriers.</P>
      <P>As the air carriers cannot let their planes lie idle, some have been forced to
cut air fares to compete with the high speed rail, Chang said, adding that "this
is not a good thing."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Researchers at Academia Sinica have completed the development of a new "sugar
chip" that is able to diagnose cancer cell, bacterial, or viral infection within
seconds and with high accuracy, academic sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>The chips, based on glycan micro-array technology,  detect specific interactions
between carbohydrates and proteins to determine the onset of known diseases,
they said, adding that in the next stage, the team at the institution's Genomics
Research Center will make the chip applicable to the detection of human
immunodeficiency virus and avian influenza virus.</P>
      <P>Liang Pi-hui, a post-doctoral researcher at the Genomics Research Center, said
the chip has the potential to become a very reliable detection method in
clinical use, for it requires only seconds and a small quantity of sample to
produce results with near-100 percent accuracy.</P>
      <P>In addition to that feature, Liang also noted that the chip can trace  even  the
slightest  alteration  in carbohydrate-protein interactions, allowing the
physician to discover latent cancers or infections that would be invisible to
other methods.</P>
      <P>The advances in the chip research and development have been published in the

      <P>A free flu vaccination program kicked off Monday, providing flu shots free of
charge for groups of people considered to be at high risk of influenza, the
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of Health reported
Monday.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-yi, a deputy director of the CDC, urged these groups -- including
persons over 65 years of age or children aged between six months and two years
-- not to rush in an attempt to receive their shots on the first day of the
program, since the vaccines will be available over the next two months.</P>
      <P>Shih called for flu shot recipients to stay at the place where they receive
their shots for at least half an hour to make sure that they develop no allergic
reaction to the vaccine.</P>
      <P>The free flu shot program is also available to first-line medical professionals,
hospital volunteer workers, community pharmacists, medical lab workers, school
nurses, crew of international airlines, quarantine workers, poultry farmers and
bird raisers, nursing home residents, people suffering from severe injuries or
diseases, as well as first-year and second-year primary school students.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, there will be 2.73 million doses of free flu vaccine
available for adults and 320,000 doses for children this year.</P>
      <P>Shih said Taiwan usually enters flu season around the end of November, with
cases reaching a peak around Christmas. The CDC, after analyzing reported flu
cases between 2000 and 2006, said the incidence of flu turning into serious
disease among children under 12 years is four or five times the number among
people over 65, while the mortality rate is also three or four times that of the
elderly, far higher than other age groups.</P>
      <P>CDC experts said the best way to prevent flu is to get flu shots.</P>
      <P>Paid flu shots are also available at major hospitals around the country, where
ordinary people can get flu vaccinations at around NT$580 per dose.</P>

      <P>The International  Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF) under the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will cooperate with the Inter-American Development Bank
(IDB) in offering loans to encourage Ecuadorian expatriates to return home to
purchase houses in Ecuador, an ICDF official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The project worth US$5.7 million was signed by the ICDF and the IDB Group in
Ecuador Sept. 26, with the ICDF and IDB's Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF)
each injecting US$2.5 million into the project, and the remaining US$700,000
being provided by the MIF and Ecuador's real estate loan granting organization
Mutualista Pichincha.</P>
      <P>The official said that under the project, each Ecuadorian expatriate is expected
to be offered an average loan of US$46,000.</P>
      <P>According to the official, 85 percent of Ecuadorian expatriates live in Spain,
the United States or Italy, and the project will help Mutualista Pichincha to
set up four offices in the three countries to lure more Ecuadorian expatriates
there to return home and purchase houses in Ecuador to further boost the South
American country's economy.</P>
      <P>Ecuador suffered a financial crisis in 1998, which resulted in a massive wave of
emigration. Ecuador's official statistics show that some 650,000 Ecuadorians, or
nearly 11.2 percent of the country's labor force, relocated abroad between
1999-2004.</P>
      <P>An average of more than 100,000 Ecuadorians have emigrated per year since 2004,

      <P>Education Minister Tu Cheng-sheng said Monday that Taiwan's national name is the
Republic of China but claimed that the meaning of ROC "varies depending on
differing historical situations."</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan Education Committee, Tu said
educators must give students around the country a "clear and definite" answer
about the ROC's national territory, which he said covers only Taiwan proper and
the islands of Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu and Nansha.</P>
      <P>Tu made the remarks in response to several legislators who asked Tu about his
perception of the country's formal title.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tu said that regularly monitoring the safety and security of campuses
has been one of the major administrative measures of the Education Ministry.</P>
      <P>Tu made the remarks in response to a question raised by opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu, who, backed up by a videotape showing a student
in school uniform being beaten by a gang of his peers, said that campus violence
has become increasingly rampant in recent years.</P>
      <P>Hung said the number of officially reported cases of campus violence stood at 10
in 2004, but this number had increased to 75 in 2006, while the number of campus
sexual assaults and cases of harassment surged to 915 that same year.</P>
      <P>Hung accused the Education Ministry of whitewashing the campus security
situation by simply including a sentence in its annual report saying that "the
number of cases undermining public order on campuses at various levels have been
steadily decreased."</P>
      <P>Responding to another question raised by KMT Legislator Lee Ching-hua that many
college students have reportedly conducted direct sales operations on campus and
some have even quit school to operate businesses, Tu urged students to return to
their studies, saying that being distracted from studying in the college years
is not conducive to students' development.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>National Security Bureau (NSB) Director Shi Hwei-yow said Monday that the bureau
will take action against anyone attempting to disturb the Oct. 10 National Day
celebrations.</P>
      <P>Shi made the remarks amid reports that anti-President Chen Shui-bian protesters
are preparing to disrupt the Double Ten celebrations as they did last year.</P>
      <P>Shi said the public's freedom of speech in a democratic society will be
respected as long as they do not interfere with the progress of the
celebrations. If others' security is jeopardized, however, resolute action will
be taken, he went on.</P>
      <P>Asked about contingency measures if someone unfurls banners in front of
President Chen, Shi said that would be construed as jeopardizing the security of
the nation's leader and disrupting the progress of celebrations, and therefore
would not be permissible.</P>
      <P>Legislator Ho Ming-hao of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union asked if the
NSB has any information concerning possible anti-Chen "red shirt" protests this
year.</P>
      <P>Shi responded that the information so far is that the protesters will take some
"sporadic" action, but as there is still some time to go before Double Ten day,
the NSC will continue to monitor the situation.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kao Chien-chih of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) asked
about security measurers to protect the president, to which Shi responded that
sharpshooters will be deployed on high buildings near the Presidential Office
and there will also be anti-assassination measures in place.</P>
      <P>The NSC has done everything possible, Shi said, although he declined to go into
detail, saying only that he is confident of maintaining law and order on the
day.</P>
      <P>The "red shirt" protesters in the "Million Voices Against Corruption" campaign
staged several large sit-ins and rallies in September 2006 that climaxed in a
demonstration Oct. 10. during which tens of thousands surrounded the
Presidential Office and the president's official residence to demand the
resignation of Chen, whose family and close aides are involved and have been
indicted over a series of corruption cases.</P>
      <P>During the Double Ten rallies last year, opposition legislators lending support
to the campaign flashed the "thumbs-down" gesture of the campaign and unfurled
banners to demand Chen's ouster while he was addressing the rally.</P>
      <P>Their actions invoked angry responses from the DPP legislators sitting next to
them and brief scuffles broke out.</P>
      <P>The campaign, initiated by former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh, petered out at the
end of 2006.</P>

the Showcasing American Composers program organized by the New York City Opera

      <P>Chen's opera is a modern interpretation of the legendary love tragedy of Tang
Ming Huang, the seventh emperor of ancient China's Tang Dynasty, and his

      <P>A collaboration between Taiwan and Japan, the opera is directed by Tomo Sugao,
director of the New National Theater, Tokyo, and conducted by Taiwan-born Wen

      <P>A direct China links promise made by main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou has discarded Taiwan's best interests and
ignored the nation's dignity, Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Shieh made the remarks to reporters after Ma declared Saturday that he will
immediately embark on pushing for the establishment of direct shipping and air
links between Taiwan and China if he is elected president in the March 22, 2008
election.</P>
      <P>Ma pledged that he will conclude bilateral negotiations on the opening of direct
cross-Taiwan Strait transport links within one year upon his election and will
fulfill the task by starting with weekend charter flights and expanding the
service scope of the current ferry links maintained between Taiwan's Kinmen and
Matsu islands and three ports in China's Fujian Province -- known as the mini-
three links.</P>
      <P>Shieh accused Ma of turning a blind eye to Taiwan's national dignity and to
China's ambition to swallow Taiwan when making the pledge -- something he said
shows that Ma embraces Beijing's "one-China" principle.</P>
      <P>Ma's request that the Democratic  Progressive  Party (DPP) administration
establish direct shipping and air links across the strait in compliance with
Beijing's "one China" condition is "out of the question," Shieh said.</P>
      <P>"It is unthinkable that the DPP administration would trade off Taiwan's national
sovereignty for opening direct transport links with China, " Shieh said,
although he pointed out that the government has put many opening measures in
place in response to the people's practical needs, such as setting up the mini
links and offering special charter flight services on major festivals.</P>
      <P>"There is a marked difference between Ma's `eventual one China' objective and
the DPP government's goal of sustainably managing Taiwan," he argued,
criticizing that "Ma must not threaten the government with Beijing's requests,
hurting the nation's and  the people's interest."</P>
      <P>The issue of direct cross-strait transport links was put under the spotlight
after Ma goaded Frank Hsieh, the DPP's presidential candidate, to demand that
the incumbent DPP administration swiftly realize Hsieh's promise concerning
opening direct cross-strait links instead of just paying lip service.</P>
      <P>Hsieh recently told the Singapore-based Straits Times that he would allow for
the establishment of direct China links and the entry of Chinese capital and
tourists if he wins the election.</P>

      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will sponsor an activity on the Oct. 24,
"Taiwan United Nations Day, " KMT Secretary-general Wu Den-yih said Monday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks following Premier Chang Chun-hsiung's announcement last week
that Oct. 24 will be designated "Taiwan U.N. Day" in accordance with a proposal
by local civic groups and that the Council of Sports Affairs will sponsor a
torch relay to publicize Taiwan's bid to join the world body.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the KMT's activity will underscore the glorious past of the
Republic of China, Taiwan's official name, when it was one of the founding
members of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The activity will also convey Taiwan people's aspiration to join the
international community and shoulder the responsibility to help promote peace,
prevent disease and eradicate poverty.</P>
      <P>The details of the activity are still being planned, Wu added.</P>
      <P>On Oct. 24, President Chen Shui-bian will ignite the torch at Ketagalan
Boulevard in front of the presidential office, and the torch will pass from
Taipei City to Keelung City, Yilan County, Hualien County and all other 25
cities and counties in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>That day -- the anniversary of the coming into force of the Charter  of the
United  Nations  in 1945  --  is celebrated internationally as United Nations
Day.</P>
      <P>The "China" seat in the United Nations was taken over by the People's Republic
of CHina at the expense of the Republic of China in 1971. Taiwan has tried
without success since 1993 to have the United Nations consider the issue of its
representation.</P>
      <P>It suffered a fresh setback in its quest for representation in the world body
last week when an item endorsed by 16 of Taiwan's diplomatic  allies asking the
world body to address  Taiwan's membership application was excluded from the

      <P>A 24-man roster for the 2007 Baseball World Cup and a preliminary 60-man roster
for the 2007 Asian Baseball Championship were announced Monday as Taiwan eyed on
the lone Asian seed in the hopes of representing the nation in the 2008 Beijing
Olympics.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will enjoy home park advantage throughout  as both tournaments will be
held in Taiwan. However, priority will be given to the Asian Championship, which
is the 2008 Beijing Olympics qualifier, said Tsai Huang-lan, Deputy Director of
the Sports Affairs Council (SAC).</P>
      <P>The home team will have to beat Japan, South Korea and the Level-B winner for
the title in the Asian Championship, which will be held in Taichung Nov. 27 -
Dec. 3,  to take the tournament championship and seize the only Asian seed in
the 12-team field of the Beijing Olympic baseball event.</P>
      <P>Kuo Tai-yuan, head coach of Taiwan's national baseball team, announced the
60-man roster, which included U.S. Major League pitchers Wang Chien-ming, Kuo
Hong-chih, Tsao Chin-huei and infielder Hu Chin-lung, which will be trimmed down
before the tournament.</P>
      <P>Former Major Leaguer Chen Chin-feng, generally seen as Taiwan's top hitter, and
others who currently play in the U.S. Minor League and Japanese professional
league were also included.</P>
      <P>The 2007 Baseball World Cup, which will be held from Nov. 6-18 in Taichung,
Xinjhuang and Tianmu, is still important, but it will be regarded as a "warm up"
series for the Asian Championship, said Kuo.</P>
      <P>"By saying that, we're not giving up on the World Cup though. It's a special
event for Taiwan, " Kuo said. It was after winning the bronze medal in the 2001
Baseball World Cup, which was also held in Taiwan, that Taiwan's professional
baseball blossomed again and emerged from the shadow of the game-fixing scandals
of the late 1990s, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan finished in fourth place in the 2004 Athens Olympics and 11th in the 2005
Baseball World Cup.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Referendum to add momentum to U.N. cause: foreign minister</HEADLINE>

      <P>The government's bid to seek U.N. membership for the county under the name
Taiwan is not an emotionally charged move, and it will help add momentum to the
government's drive if a planned public referendum approves of the move, Minister
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) James Huang said Monday.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks during a question-and-answer session at the Legislative
Yuan in response to main opposition Kuomintang lawmakers'  inquiries about the
effectiveness  of a government international media campaign calling for Taiwan's
U.N. membership.</P>
      <P>The government's drive to push for Taiwan's U.N. cause is not a precipitous
action, but rather a move in response to popular desire to push the country to
enter the international organization as a full member, he explained.</P>
      <P>The U.N bid issue has stirred up widespread international discussion after
several of Taiwan's diplomatic allies proposed in mid-September that the U.N.
General Committee include Taiwan's membership application on the agenda of the
world body's 62nd General Assembly, Huang noted, adding that global media
outlets have more extensively reported on Taiwan's U.N. bid this year.</P>
      <P>The latest development has allowed the voice of the people to be heard around
the world, and if a public referendum -- slated to be held alongside the March
22, 2008 presidential election -- indicates approval of the government policy of
pursuing U.N. membership, it will help inject greater energy into the ongoing
campaign, he said.</P>
      <P>Responding to a question on whether the United States has objected the
government's U.N. referendum plan, Huang stressed that the country's U.N. cause
and a planned referendum concerning the issue are two separate matters.</P>
      <P>While seeking Taiwan's U.N. membership is a major government policy, holding a
referendum to explore the public's opinion on the issue is common practice in
democratic nations, he said, arguing that there is no need to regard a U.N.
referendum as a move toward Taiwan independence.</P>

      <P>National Security Bureau (NSB) Director Shi Hwei-yow said Monday that despite
expressing displeasure  over Taiwan's plan to hold a referendum on its bid to
join the United Nations under the name Taiwan, the United States' basic stance
toward Taiwan remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>Shi made the remarks in responde to questions by legislators from the opposition
"pan-blue" alliance regarding whether the government has a contingency plan in
place given the opposition from abroad, especially the United States and China,
to President Chen Shui-bian's plan to hold a referendum on Taiwan's application
to join the United Nations under the name Taiwan alongside next year's
presidential election in March.</P>
      <P>The U.S. sees such a referendum as an attempt to unilaterally change the status
quo across the Taiwan Strait, while China considers it as an "important step" to
declare Taiwan's de jure independence.</P>
      <P>In response to questions from opposition People First Party Legislator  Chang
Hsien-yao  on whether the NSB has made any contingency plan in response to
China's declaration that it has made the "necessary preparations" against
Taiwan's plan to hold such a referendum, Shi said his agency has established a
mechanism to properly respond to any situation.</P>
      <P>Shi noted that although the U.S. has expressed its displeasure over Chen's plan
to push for the referendum, the U.S. basic stance toward Taiwan remains
unchanged, adding that at least U.S.-Taiwan communications regarding security
issues remain normal.</P>
      <P>It was reported that the U.S. government had rejected Chen's request for his
transit stops in major U.S. cities or to stay overnight during his transit stops
for Chen's Central American visit in late August as a way to express its
discontent with Chen's intention to push for the referendum. Chen later called
the treatment he received during his transit stops in Alaska "inconvenient,
uncomfortable and indecent."</P>
      <P>Shi stressed that though the United States adopted a deterrent policy to try to
persuade Taiwan not to go through with the referendum, it has not changed its
basic policy toward Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan sues ISO over incorrect reference</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has filed a lawsuit against the International Organization for
Standardization, widely known as ISO, over its reference to the country as
"Taiwan Province, China" instead of "Republic of China (Taiwan)," an official
said Monday.</P>
      <P>According  to Ministry  of Foreign Affairs spokesman  Wang Chien-yeh, the
government filed the suit with a court in Geneva July 20 after the ISO failed to
respond positively to its repeated requests to rectify Taiwan's designation in
the ISO 3166 country codes list.</P>
      <P>Wang said the lawsuit was filed in the name of the government of the Republic of
China (Taiwan).</P>
      <P>Claiming that the ISO is in violation of Taiwan's name rights by using the
"Taiwan Province, China" designation in its country codes list, the lawsuit
demands the ISO stop using such a derogative reference and instead refer to
Taiwan with its correct formal name "Republic of China (Taiwan)."</P>
      <P>Wang further said that using the title "Republic of China (Taiwan) " not only
complies with legal provisions and political reality but also meets the demands
of various domestic political camps.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time that Taiwan has taken a legal action against a major
international organization over the name issue. The Geneva court has accepted
the suit and the development of the issue will hinge on the court's judgment.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years, Wang said, the country's representative office in
Geneva has negotiated with the ISO authorities on many occasions and expressed
the government's solemn stance on the issue by retaining  lawyers to send
letters of protest to the ISO headquarters.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, Wang said, all such efforts have not received any goodwill response
from the ISO. As the ISO 3166 list has been widely used in the international
community,  cases  of international organizations and multinational business
groups referring to the country  as "Taiwan Province,  China" have become
increasingly prevalent.</P>
      <P>"Such a development has not only invited misunderstanding and confusion for
Taiwan but has also undermined Taiwan's national status and interests," Wang
lamented.</P>
      <P>Up until  now,  Wang  said,  the MOFA  and the country's representative offices
abroad have dealt with the issue on a case-by-case basis, asking each
international organization or private corporation that refers to the country as
"Taiwan Province, China" to correct the mistake.</P>
      <P>However, such an approach cannot possibly resolve the issue once and for all,
Wang said, adding that the government has thus decided to file a lawsuit against
the ISO with a view to requiring it to revise its 3166 country codes list.</P>
      <P>The Geneva-based ISO is an international standard-setting body composed  of
representatives  from various  national  standards organizations. Founded on
Feb. 23, 1947, the organization promulgates world-wide industrial and commercial
standards. It is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.</P>
      <P>While ISO defines itself as a non-governmental organization, its ability to set
standards that often become law, either through treaties or national standards,
makes it more powerful than most NGOs. In practice, ISO acts as a consortium
with strong links to governments.</P>
      <P>ISO officials once said that the 3166 list was formulated in 1974 in line with
the United Nations practice of referring to Taiwan as "Taiwan Province, China."</P>

      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) vice presidential candidate departed
Monday for a 12-day visit to the United States and Canada in a bid to help
strengthen Taiwan's relations with the two countries.</P>
      <P>Speaking prior to his departure from the Taoyuan International Airport, Vincent
Siew said that the major purpose of his trip is to help re-build mutual trust
and mend bilateral relations with the United States, which he claimed have sunk
to a low ebb under the Democratic Progressive Party administration.</P>
      <P>Siew, a former premier, stressed that he is not carrying out the mission for the
KMT, but rather called it a task undertaken for the sake of the whole country.</P>
      <P>"At a time when great diplomatic difficulties face the nation, any capable
individual,  regardless  of his or her political affiliation, should act for the
government," he said.</P>
      <P>Siew was accompanied by John C. T. Feng, a former ambassador to the Dominican
Republic, and Chan Chi-shean, a well-known doctor who once served as president
of the Chi Mei Foundation Medical Center, among others on the tour.</P>
      <P>While in the United States, Siew will visit officials at the State Department,
the Department of Defense and those in charge of trade and finance affairs. He
is also slated to meet secretarial staffs in charge of diplomatic  affairs  for

      <P>A group of foreign resource recycling professionals visited resource recycling
plants in Kaohsiung County in southern Taiwan to acquire a better understanding
of Taiwan's performance  in  this  regard,  an  Environmental  Protection
Administration (EPA) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Liu Juei-hsiang, deputy executive secretary of the EPA's Recycling
Fund Management Board, these foreign professionals came to Taiwan to attend the
Resource Recycling Forum at the Taipei World Trade Center Oct. 3-5 and to
exchange information on resource recycling.</P>
      <P>Participants visiting the plants included Kenichi, professor of Kumamoto
University, Hirotaka Ohki, senior managing director of Japan Automobile
Recycling Promotion Center, Bertrand Schultz, president of European Battery
Recycling Association, and Steve Andrews, director of Department of Enterprise,
Business and Innovation of Britain.</P>
      <P>They visited Thye Ming Industrial Co. in the county's Taliao township, which
recycles about 36,000 tons of waste lead batteries per year, and an
environmental engineering company that enjoyed an increase in recycling rate
from 65 percent in 2001 to 72 percent in 2007.</P>
      <P>Liu said Taiwan's recycling performance tops the world, with a recycling rate of
36 percent. The nation has over 500 resource recycling plants, and over 200
factories reusing recycled resources. It recycles about 220,000 waste vehicles
every year, and enjoys a recycling rate greater than 70 percent when it comes to
waste lead batteries.</P>
      <P>The two companies these foreign resource recycling professionals visited are two
of the nation's best, capable of fully displaying the results of Taiwan's
efforts to promote resource recycling, Liu said. He went on that as 50 percent
of waste is composed of recyclable resources, there is space for Taiwan to make
further improvements.</P>

      <P>Approximately one in four university students who responded to a recent poll are
constantly depressed, according to the results of the poll released by a local
charitable organization Monday.</P>
      <P>The John Tung Foundation, which devotes itself to the promotion of anti-smoking
and public health in Taiwan, conducted the poll of students at 58 local
universities and colleges in May and June. A total of 6,198 valid replies were
collected.</P>
      <P>The poll found that 25.7 percent of the respondents, up 1.4 percent from last
year, suffer serious depression.</P>
      <P>When in a bad mood, those surveyed said that they often deal by turning to their
classmates or friends for help, or sleep or exercise, said Vivian Yeh, the
foundation's mental health section chief.</P>
      <P>In addition, the poll said that 5.5 percent of the respondents noted that they
often relieved their depression by talking to their online friends. The ratio is
higher than the 1.9 percent of those responding to the poll who said they would
talk to school counselors about their depression, the poll went on.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, women suffer higher levels of depression than their male
counterparts.  The poll also found that more first-year students than seniors
are emotionally troubled.</P>
      <P>Foundation Chairman Huang Chen-tai urged school counselors to take the
initiative in caring for their students, adding that it is also necessary to
help those who are depressed realize that it is not difficult to seek
assistance.</P>
      <P>Lai Tung-ming, chairman of the Good Neighborhood Foundation, for his part, noted
that the foundation has designed a questionnaire to help the public determine
whether they are troubled by depression.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) rebutted as "wrong claims" Monday Chinese
Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi's recent remarks at a United Nations session in
which he called Taiwan an inseparable part of China and criticized Taiwan's
planned referendum on its U.N. bid as a move toward de jure independence.</P>
      <P>Yang made the remarks in a speech delivered at a U.N. General Assembly session
Sept. 28.</P>
      <P>The MOFA rebutted Yang's allegations in a news release, pointing out that Taiwan
and China have been unrelated since 1949, with no one subordinate to the other,
for China has never had sovereignty over Taiwan nor has it had right to levy tax
on the Taiwanese people. Taiwan is by no means a part of China, the press
statement said.</P>
      <P>It also stated that the U.N. Resolution 2758 only decided China's representation
in the world body, but did not define Taiwan's relations with China, nor
Taiwan's representation in the U.N.</P>
      <P>Regretting that China and its allies have repeatedly cited the resolution to bar
Taiwan from taking part in the United Nations, the statement said they have
distorted the true meaning of Resolution 2758.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the MOFA statement said China, not Taiwan, should be held responsible
for causing tension across the Taiwan Strait. China's saber-rattling, missile
threat and diplomatic suppression have made the two sides further apart and lack
mutual trust, it added.</P>
      <P>Popular support for holding a referendum on the U.N. bid proves that the people
of Taiwan refuse to tolerate China's threats and unreasonable treatment any
longer, the statement said.</P>
      <P>It also defended Taiwan's diplomatic allies who have spoken up at the ongoing
U.N. sessions for Taiwan's U.N. bid, saying that they would not stand to see the
international community continually ignore Taiwan's right to joining the United
Nations simply because of China's obstruction. China should not smeared Taiwan's
diplomatic allies due to their support for Taiwan's cause, the MOFA statement
added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is expected to see a 30 percent reduction in tourist arrivals from China
in 2007, mainly because Beijing has begun to forbid its nationals sightseeing in
other countries to travel to Taiwan, a senior tourism official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Janice Lai, director-general of the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications, told the Legislative Yuan's Transportation
Committee that the total number of tourist arrivals from China this year is
estimated to be 70,000, down 30 percent from last year's 98,000.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that China has not relaxed its policy to allow its citizens to
visit Taiwan as tourists.</P>
      <P>Although many Chinese tourists have come to Taiwan via a third country since May
2002 when Taiwan began to welcome the "second category of visitors from China,"
Beijing has now stepped up its efforts to prohibit them coming to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Minister of Transportation and Communications Tsai Duei told legislators on the
Transportation Committee that "the ball is now in China's court."</P>
      <P>Figures compiled by the Tourism Bureau show that although Taiwan's tourist
arrivals in the first eight months this year saw a 4.5 percent increase over the

period dropped 20 percent, with the total for the entire year of 2007 estimated

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu announced Monday that she will establish a network
under the framework of the Democratic Pacific Union (DPU) to help push for
democratization of Myanmar.</P>
      <P>Lu said that she will solicit support from the private sector and draw on
Taiwan's experience of democratization in an effort to help the junta-ruled
Southeast Asian country achieve democracy.</P>
      <P>The DPU, an international body founded by Lu in 2005 and currently chaired by
Lu, aims at promoting "democracy, peace, and prosperity" in the Asian Pacific
region and the world.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks at a seminar organized to voice support for the pro-
democracy campaign in Myanmar. Also present at the seminar were Jerome Cohen --
Lu's mentor at Harvard University and a think tank senior researcher -- as well
as with government officials and members of the DPU, the Taiwan Foundation for
Democracy, and a group of Taipei-based Japanese journalists.</P>
      <P>Lu added that 15 years ago, she might have met the Japanese video reporter,
Kenji Nagai, who was recently shot to death by a soldier in Myanmar  as he was
filming a bloody military  clamp down on anti-government protests staged by
local civilians and monks.</P>
      <P>Lu recalled that in 1992, she planned to lead a group of courageous Taiwanese
people to attend the National Day ceremony in Beijing to test how communist
China would react to those who came from a democracy.</P>
      <P>She said that at an international press conference called in Tokyo, one day
prior to her planned trip to Beijing, she met the Japanese reporter who told her
that he was a supporter of Aung San Suu Kyi, a pro-democracy activist and also
the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner who has been under a house arrest over the
past decade.</P>
      <P>The reporter told Lu that he helped Suu Kyi several times, noting that Lu is
very much like Suu Kyi, according to Lu.</P>
      <P>The reporter later gave his camera, which he described as a "lucky camera, " to
Lu as a lucky charm for her safety in China, Lu went on.</P>
      <P>Lu said that she failed to enter China, but has cherished the gift ever since.</P>
      <P>Hailing the reporter as a "hero, " Lu said that Nagai sacrificed his life for

      <P>The Council of Grand Justices has become younger with the addition of four new
members to its roster Monday.</P>
      <P>The council now has 11 grand justices, including Judicial Yuan President Lai In-
jaw and his deputy Hsieh Tsay-chuan, both of whom were originally grand justices
and assumed their new posts in a ceremony held earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>According to the existing constitutional provisions, the Judicial Yuan president
and vice president concurrently serve as grand justices.</P>
      <P>The average age of the new Council of Grand Justices is approximately 57 years.
Eight of the previous grand justices were older than 60.</P>
      <P>The four new grand justices -- Lin Hsi-yao, Tsai Ching-you, Che Chi-ming and Lee
Chen-shan -- are all from academic or judicial communities. As all of them are
familiar with administrative and criminal laws, their recruitment will help
upgrade the Council of Grand Justices' competence in interpreting constitutional
provisions and safeguarding the dignity of the country's Constitution, judicial
sources said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Outgoing ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun issued a
statement late Monday, in which he reiterated his determination to step down
from the party's chairmanship.</P>
      <P>Yu asked the party's heavyweights not to try to retain him because he has no
intention to stay at all. He urged them to start the process of selecting a
successor to take over the party's helm as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Despite his departure from the top party post, Yu said he will continue working
for the party's cause and help ensure the party's victory in the 2008
presidential and legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Yu also called for all party workers and pro-independence civic groups to throw
their support behind the party's presidential ticket and legislative candidates.</P>
      <P>After he was indicted on graft charges over misuse of special allowance funds
set aside for his discretionary use during his tenures as Presiential Office
secretary-general and premier, Yu decided to quit after the party's Sept. 30
national congress. But he later decided to step down earlier after his proposal
to add a more radical clause to the "normal country resoultion" to underscore
the party's commitment to change the country's name to Taiwan and write a new
constitution was rejected by the party's other bigwigs. He didn't attended
Sunday's paty congress.</P>
      <P>Party sources said Presidential Office Secretary-General Yeh Chu-lan, who
concurrently serves as top manager of presidential candidate Frank Hsieh's
campaign office is likely to serve as DPP acting chairwoman if Yu rejects to
return.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan sues ISO over incorrect reference</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1 (CNA)
10/02/07  11:28:36
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has filed a lawsuit against the International Organization for
Standardization, widely known as ISO, over its reference to the country as
"Taiwan Province, China" instead of "Republic of China (Taiwan)," an official
said Monday.</P>
      <P>According  to Ministry  of Foreign Affairs spokesman  Wang Chien-yeh, the
government filed the suit with a court in Geneva July 20 after the ISO failed to
respond positively to its repeated requests to rectify Taiwan's designation in
the ISO 3166 country codes list.</P>
      <P>Wang said the lawsuit was filed in the name of the government of the Republic of
China (Taiwan).</P>
      <P>Claiming that the ISO is in violation of Taiwan's name rights by using the
"Taiwan Province, China" designation in its country codes list, the lawsuit
demands the ISO stop using such a derogative reference and instead refer to
Taiwan with its correct formal name "Republic of China (Taiwan)."</P>
      <P>Wang further said that using the title "Republic of China (Taiwan) " not only
complies with legal provisions and political reality but also meets the demands
of various domestic political camps.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time that Taiwan has taken a legal action against a major
international organization over the name issue. The Geneva court has accepted
the suit and the development of the issue will hinge on the court's judgment.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years, Wang said, the country's representative office in
Geneva has negotiated with the ISO authorities on many occasions and expressed
the government's solemn stance on the issue by retaining  lawyers to send
letters of protest to the ISO headquarters.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, Wang said, all such efforts have not received any goodwill response
from the ISO. As the ISO 3166 list has been widely used in the international
community,  cases  of international organizations and multinational business
groups referring to the country  as "Taiwan Province,  China" have become
increasingly prevalent.</P>
      <P>"Such a development has not only invited misunderstanding and confusion for
Taiwan but has also undermined Taiwan's national status and interests," Wang
lamented.</P>
      <P>Up until  now,  Wang  said,  the MOFA  and the country's representative offices
abroad have dealt with the issue on a case-by-case basis, asking each
international organization or private corporation that refers to the country as
"Taiwan Province, China" to correct the mistake.</P>
      <P>However, such an approach cannot possibly resolve the issue once and for all,
Wang said, adding that the government has thus decided to file a lawsuit against
the ISO with a view to requiring it to revise its 3166 country codes list.</P>
      <P>The Geneva-based ISO is an international standard-setting body composed  of
representatives  from various  national  standards organizations. Founded on
Feb. 23, 1947, the organization promulgates world-wide industrial and commercial
standards. It is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.</P>
      <P>While ISO defines itself as a non-governmental organization, its ability to set
standards that often become law, either through treaties or national standards,
makes it more powerful than most NGOs. In practice, ISO acts as a consortium
with strong links to governments.</P>
      <P>ISO officials once said that the 3166 list was formulated in 1974 in line with
the United Nations practice of referring to Taiwan as "Taiwan Province, China."</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT vice presidential candidate embarks on visit to U.S., Canada</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) vice presidential candidate departed
Monday for a 12-day visit to the United States and Canada in a bid to help
strengthen Taiwan's relations with the two countries.</P>
      <P>Speaking prior to his departure from the Taoyuan International Airport, Vincent
Siew said that the major purpose of his trip is to help re-build mutual trust
and mend bilateral relations with the United States, which he claimed have sunk
to a low ebb under the Democratic Progressive Party administration.</P>
      <P>Siew, a former premier, stressed that he is not carrying out the mission for the
KMT, but rather called it a task undertaken for the sake of the whole country.</P>
      <P>"At a time when great diplomatic difficulties face the nation, any capable
individual,  regardless  of his or her political affiliation, should act for the
government," he said.</P>
      <P>Siew was accompanied by John C. T. Feng, a former ambassador to the Dominican
Republic, and Chan Chi-shean, a well-known doctor who once served as president
of the Chi Mei Foundation Medical Center, among others on the tour.</P>
      <P>While in the United States, Siew will visit officials at the State Department,
the Department of Defense and those in charge of trade and finance affairs. He
is also slated to meet secretarial staffs in charge of diplomatic  affairs  for
the presidential candidates of both the Republican Party and the Democratic
Party.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Approximately one in four university students who responded to a recent poll are
constantly depressed, according to the results of the poll released by a local
charitable organization Monday.</P>
      <P>The John Tung Foundation, which devotes itself to the promotion of anti-smoking
and public health in Taiwan, conducted the poll of students at 58 local
universities and colleges in May and June. A total of 6,198 valid replies were
collected.</P>
      <P>The poll found that 25.7 percent of the respondents, up 1.4 percent from last
year, suffer serious depression.</P>
      <P>When in a bad mood, those surveyed said that they often deal by turning to their
classmates or friends for help, or sleep or exercise, said Vivian Yeh, the
foundation's mental health section chief.</P>
      <P>In addition, the poll said that 5.5 percent of the respondents noted that they
often relieved their depression by talking to their online friends. The ratio is
higher than the 1.9 percent of those responding to the poll who said they would
talk to school counselors about their depression, the poll went on.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, women suffer higher levels of depression than their male
counterparts.  The poll also found that more first-year students than seniors
are emotionally troubled.</P>
      <P>Foundation Chairman Huang Chen-tai urged school counselors to take the
initiative in caring for their students, adding that it is also necessary to
help those who are depressed realize that it is not difficult to seek
assistance.</P>
      <P>Lai Tung-ming, chairman of the Good Neighborhood Foundation, for his part, noted
that the foundation has designed a questionnaire to help the public determine
whether they are troubled by depression.</P>
      <P>Copies of the questionnaire have been made available at 4,000 7-eleven
convenience stores around the country over the past seven years, Lai continued.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA rebuts Chinese FM's remarks at U.N. meeting</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) rebutted as "wrong claims" Monday Chinese
Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi's recent remarks at a United Nations session in
which he called Taiwan an inseparable part of China and criticized Taiwan's
planned referendum on its U.N. bid as a move toward de jure independence.</P>
      <P>Yang made the remarks in a speech delivered at a U.N. General Assembly session
Sept. 28.</P>
      <P>The MOFA rebutted Yang's allegations in a news release, pointing out that Taiwan
and China have been unrelated since 1949, with no one subordinate to the other,
for China has never had sovereignty over Taiwan nor has it had right to levy tax
on the Taiwanese people. Taiwan is by no means a part of China, the press
statement said.</P>
      <P>It also stated that the U.N. Resolution 2758 only decided China's representation
in the world body, but did not define Taiwan's relations with China, nor
Taiwan's representation in the U.N.</P>
      <P>Regretting that China and its allies have repeatedly cited the resolution to bar
Taiwan from taking part in the United Nations, the statement said they have
distorted the true meaning of Resolution 2758.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the MOFA statement said China, not Taiwan, should be held responsible
for causing tension across the Taiwan Strait. China's saber-rattling, missile
threat and diplomatic suppression have made the two sides further apart and lack
mutual trust, it added.</P>
      <P>Popular support for holding a referendum on the U.N. bid proves that the people
of Taiwan refuse to tolerate China's threats and unreasonable treatment any
longer, the statement said.</P>
      <P>It also defended Taiwan's diplomatic allies who have spoken up at the ongoing
U.N. sessions for Taiwan's U.N. bid, saying that they would not stand to see the
international community continually ignore Taiwan's right to joining the United
Nations simply because of China's obstruction. China should not smeared Taiwan's
diplomatic allies due to their support for Taiwan's cause, the MOFA statement
added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Two more allies back Taiwan's bid at U.N. General Assembly</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York,  Oct.  1 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two more of Taiwan's diplomatic allies expressed their support for the country's
bid to join the United Nations Monday at the ongoing annual session of the U.N.
General Assembly.</P>
      <P>Raising the issue during the general debate of the session, Tuvaluan Deputy
Prime Minister Tavau Teii expressed his country's disappointment at the fact
that the world body has refused even to put the issue of Taiwan's membership bid
on the agenda of the session.</P>
      <P>Teii urged the United Nations to urgently address the issue of the Taiwan
people's right to join the United Nations, stressing that Taiwan has the ability
to fulfil its obligations as a full member of the world body as required under
the U.N. Charter.</P>
      <P>"The United Nations cannot be said to be universal, nor can global peace and
security be assured until the issue of membership for Taiwan in the organization
is properly resolved," Teii said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Patteson Oti, minister of foreign affairs, external trade and
immigration of the Solomon Islands,  attributed the "indignity"  suffered  by
Taiwan to what he called "organized international hypocrisy" by "a powerful
constellation of states interested only in the protection of trade and
investment rather than any humanitarian concerns."</P>
      <P>Oti said Solomon Islanders have a native empathy for all people who are
struggling to reclaim what is rightfully due to them under international law,
adding that his country's preference is to recognize both China and Taiwan "on a
realistic rather than an imaginary politico-juridical footing."</P>
      <P>Oti urged the General Assembly to implore China to pledge to use peaceful means
to settle its sovereignty dispute with Taiwan and proposed that the Security
Council launch an investigation into the cross-Taiwan Strait situation to
determine whether it is likely to endanger international peace and security.</P>
      <P>Also Monday, the U.N. representative of Malawi wrote letters to U.N. Secretary-
General Ban Ki-moon; Srgjan Kerim, president of the 62nd session of the General
Assembly; and Leslie Christian, Ghana's permanent representative to the United
Nations who is serving as the president of the Security Council for the month of
October, urging the world body to deal with Taiwan's membership application
"properly and seriously."</P>
      <P>While Taiwan has tried without success to have the United Nations consider the
issue of its representation since 1993, this year marks the first time the
country has applied to join the world body under the name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, following the return of Taiwan's application by the U.N. Secretariat
first in July and again in August, an item endorsed by 16 of Taiwan's diplomatic
allies asking the United Nations to address Taiwan's membership application has
also been excluded from the agenda of the 62nd session of the General Assembly.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND to review control mechanism for handling confidential papers</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of National Defense Lee Tien-yu said Tuesday the military needs to
review its current mechanism for handling confidential papers in order to plug
information leaks.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks after the Apple Daily reported that an orderly at Chief of
General Staff Hou Shou-yeh's office had not rigorously followed the standard
procedures of destroying shredded confidential papers and had instead sold them
to a private recycling operator for profit.</P>
      <P>A reporter for the local daily was able to buy two bags of</P>
      <P>the shredded confidential papers for NT$40 (US$1.2) and to piece them together
to obtain information concerning the movement of China's air and sea forces,
Taiwan's military drills, and the movement of U.S. armed forces, according to
the report.</P>
      <P>Lee, while communicating with the opposition Kuomintang's legislative caucus on
next year's central government budget, said that he was indignant upon learning
of the news and that Gen. Hou was also very upset.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the ministry's paper shredding machines are very old and do not
shred documents into small enough strips, which he added is a problem that the
ministry needs to address.</P>
      <P>On possible information leaks, Lee said that he has instructed related personnel
to deal with the matter according to regulations.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) said in a press release Tuesday that the
orderly's actions represented a dereliction of duty.</P>
      <P>The MND stressed that the military has established rigorous procedures for the

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will take a direct flight to the Marshall Islands in
October for a meeting with his counterparts from Taiwan's six diplomatic allies
in the South Pacific region, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Yu Teh-sheng, deputy director general of the MOFA Department of East Asian and
Pacific Affairs, indicated at the MOFA's routine press conference that President
Chen is scheduled to attend the second summit of heads of state between Taiwan
and its South Pacific allies Oct. 12-13.</P>
      <P>According to the announced plan, Chen will take off Oct. 11, and return to
Taipei Oct. 14. The president will not fly to other allied nations during the
four-day journey, Yu said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan maintains diplomatic relations with Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands,
the Solomon Islands, Kiribati and Nauru in the South Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Yu said presidents of those countries will join the 2007 summit, except
President of Kiribati Anote Tong who has informed Taiwan that his vice president
will participate in the meeting on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Tong is occupied by his re-election campaign, Yu added.</P>

      <P>At the press conference, Yu also addressed the high-profile meeting between
South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun and his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong-
il, which began in Pyongyang, North Korea earlier the day.</P>
      <P>Yu said the MOFA has been paying close attention to the regional situation and
interactions between the Korean leaders.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the possibility that the United State might strike North Korea from
its list of countries that support terrorism and set up a liaison office in
Pyongyang after the communist country promised to give up its nuclear facility

      <P>Noting that it is consistent with the DPP's system for the president to serve

      <P>The 2007 Taipei International Flower Exhibition will be held Oct. 31-Nov. 4 at
the Taipei World Trade Center, with local growers and counterparts from six
other countries -- the Netherlands, Australia, Japan, Thailand, the Philippines
and Malaysia -- invited to showcase their special flora, a spokesman for the
event organizer, the Council of Agriculture (COA), said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-teh,  director  general  of the COA International Cooperation
Department, said it has been 12 years since the last flower exhibition of this
kind was held in 1995.</P>
      <P>In that year, the value of Taiwan's flower production was a mere NT$9 billion
(US$276.24 million), with exports worth US$9.7 million. National output has
since grown to NT$12.5 billion, while exports surged to US$78 million in 2006,
Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's flower exports have also seen changes in flora strains over the 12-year
period, Chen went on, indicating that chrysanthemum was the major export in
1995, but that this flower has been gradually replaced by other flowers,
including dancing lady and butterfly orchids, as well as Eustoma.</P>
      <P>Over the years, Taiwan's flower output has greatly improved in terms of quality
and variety thanks to local farmers' dedication to developing new strains and
seeking new markets, Chen said.</P>

Plans for an autumn general election were being stepped up last night after
proposals to exclude all but millionaires from paying inheritance tax
electrified the Tory conference. Tax was thrown into the centre of the election
battleground as Labour claimed that the Tories could not afford George Osbornes
proposal to raise the inheritance tax threshold from G300,000 to G1 million.</TEXT>

      <P>Taiwan's representative to the United States Tuesday dismissed as "groundless" a
report from Taipei that he was going out of his way to interfere with a visit to
the United States by Taiwan opposition Kuomintang's vice presidential candidate
Vincent Siew.</P>
      <P>Joseph Wu said he wouldn't do any such thing, nor would the U.S. government
allow him to interfere.</P>
      <P>He made the comment after claims were published in a Taipei-based newspaper that
he is trying to spoil Siew's visit by preventing, as far as possible, the
opposition candidate from meeting U.S. senior officials.</P>
      <P>Wu said U.S. officials had told him before the July visit of Frank Hsieh, the
presidential candidate of Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party, that
they would extend the same treatment to Hsieh's opposition counterpart, adding
that there is no way for his office to sway the host country on this regard.</P>
      <P>Contrary to the report in the Taipei-based paper, the leading Taiwan official in
the United States said his office would do its best to help Siew arrange his
itinerary in the United States, although he has not yet received any information
on Siew's trip thus far.</P>
      <P>His remarks were supported by the KMT's representative to Washington, Jason
Yuan, who claimed that he had seen nothing to indicate that Taipei's officials
in Washington are trying to frustrate Siew's visit until he read the report on
paper.</P>
      <P>Yuan said he didn't believe that there was any truth to the report as Siew will
prod Washington to conclude a free trade agreement with his country during his
meetings with U.S. officials, which benefit Taiwan and is consistent with
efforts made by Wu's office.</P>
      <P>Siew will arrive in Washington later in the day for a four day visit. He will
then travel to California, where he will fly from San Francisco to Canada for a
six day visit to that country.</P>

      <P>More than 600 bartenders and guests from 56 countries will attend the
International Bartenders Association (IBA) meeting in Kaohsiung next month, the
Bartenders Association of Taiwan (BAT) announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Announcing the news at a press conference, BAT officials said the IBA meeting,
as well as the International Cocktail and Flairtending Competition, will be held
in the southern port city Nov. 24-25.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office Secretary-General Yeh Chu-lan, who spoke at the press
conference, expressed hope that Taiwanese bartenders can keep the championship
of the competition in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yeh is credited with promoting bartending during her tenure as acting Kaohsiung
mayor 2005-2006.</P>
      <P>She also lauded Frank Hsieh, presidential candidate of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>She said that Hsieh, during his tenure as Kaohsiung mayor 1998-2005, used some
of the "special allowance fund" set aside for his discretionary use to train
young bartenders and encourage them to excel in the job.</P>
      <P>Yeh said Taiwanese bartenders have made their mark during major competitions in
recent years and that they often note that they "come from Taiwan" during award
ceremonies.</P>
      <P>She expressed the hope that those who enter the competition this year will be
spokespeople of Taiwan so as to raise the country's profile in the international

      <P>An annual parade of the gay, bisexual and transgender (GBT) communities will be
held Oct. 13 in downtown Taipei to showcase the "rainbow power" of these
communities whose members are often discriminated against, parade organizers
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The parade, which is entering its fifth year and is expected to draw over 10,000
participants, will make its way down Zhongxiao East Road and end in the square
behind Taipei City Hall, where a stage will be set up for music performances,
said Wang Ping, chief convener of the parade.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's GBT communities ask for anti-discrimination, equality, diversity and
respect with the parade, which can also be seen as a platform for them to
directly dialogue with other citizens, Wang said.</P>
      <P>From a humble beginning of only 1,000 participants in the inaugural 2003 parade
to more than 10,000 participants last year, the parade has established itself as
the biggest of its kind in Asia, said the president of the Taiwan Tongzhi
Hotline Association, who uses the alias Gofyy.</P>
      <P>"It's true that the movement in Taiwan still has a long way to go, but we are
very proud at the same time to say that it plays a leading example compared to
other Asian countries, such as Japan and Thailand, " said Gofyy.</P>

      <P>One nail polish product of 46 samples examined by the Consumers' Foundation (CF)
was found to contain lead in excess of 1,000 ppm, far beyond the 20 ppm limit,
CF Chairman Cheng Jen-hung said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The substandard product is in the brand of "BICHUN," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The 46 samples were collected during March at 10-dolar shops, night markets,
grocery stores, and department stores in Taipei, Taichung, Nantou, Changhua,
Tainan, Kaohsiung, and Pingtung areas, Cheng said. All of the samples were
colored red, Cheng added.</P>
      <P>Cheng said lead can be absorbed through the skin, mouth or nose. People who have
long-term contact with lead are susceptible to lead intoxication, which can
cause anemia, renal failure, and pathological changes of the cranial nerves.</P>
      <P>He suggested consumers avoid nail biting while wearing nail polish, and avoid
using nail polish too frequently.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Cheng pointed out that some 67 percent, or 31 of the 46 examined
samples, were improperly labeled.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, the sixth article of the Cosmetics Sanitary Control Act
stipulates that a list detailing the composition, purpose, usage, weight,
quantity, factory address, approval number and date at which the product leaves
the factory, should all be included on product labels.</P>

      <P>Representatives from 15 member countries of the Asia Trade Promotion Forum
(ATPF) are participating in an event to promote its Capacity Building Initiative
Program (CBIP) which opened Monday at the Taipei World Trade Center.</P>
      <P>The CBIP, part of an ATPF exchange program now in its fifth year, was organized
by the quasi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) and
will run through Wednesday, a TAITRA official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The official noted that this is the first time that Taiwan has won the right to
host a CBIP meeting. It is hoped that the series of activities will allow Taiwan
to demonstrate its economic power and help bolster its international profile, he
added.</P>
      <P>According to the official, ATPF was initiated by the Japan External Trade
Organization (JETRO) to promote multilateral exchanges among more than 20 ATPF
member countries. The JETRO now acts as secretariat of the forum. The official
said the member countries take turns hosting its annual meeting.</P>
      <P>This year, nearly 30 trade promotion organizations from 15 countries have sent
representatives to attend the program in Taiwan, including Japan, South Korea,
Australia, China, Hong Kong, Macau, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia,
Nepal, India, Sri Lanka and Mongolia.</P>
      <P>The official said the program serves as a platform for members to exchange
experiences in international trade promotion in order to upgrade  the service
quality offered by their trade promotion organizations.</P>
      <P>TAITRA will also organize a trip for program participants to visit a newly
completed exhibition hall in the Nankang district of Taipei City, and arrange
for them to embark on the Taiwan High Speed Railway and take a cultural tour of
central Taiwan to learn more about the development of local cultural and
recreation industries and experience the beauty of the central island landscape.</P>

      <P>Election candidates are welcome to do more than speak up for gay rights so they
can secure votes from members of the gay, bisexual and transgender (GBT)
communities, representatives from these communities said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan society has been more open for the awareness of gay rights, and many
election candidates want votes from this specific group. However, they have to
submit their `beef' rather than just offering lip service, " said the president
of the Taiwan Tongzhi Hotline Association (TTHA), who goes by the alias Gofyy.</P>
      <P>The U.S.-based Kinsey Institute estimates that 10 percent of the human
population are gay, bisexual or transgender, he said, adding that this fact
makes such communities a focus group politicians cannot afford to ignore.</P>
      <P>More often than not, however, Gofyy said, politicians and candidates say they
support gay rights but fail to come up with substantial opinions and policies.</P>
      <P>"GBT communities welcome any support, but these people are not fools either.
They know very well who are for real and who are not. Candidates cannot expect
to win votes by simply participating in gay pride parades and offering vocal
support, " he said.</P>
      <P>The annual "Taiwan Pride Parade, " organized by TTHA and more than a dozen GBT
groups, is set for Oct. 13 in downtown Taipei to raise gay rights awareness.</P>
      <P>GBT communities in Taiwan have been establishing "observation groups" in past
elections to examine candidates' opinions and positions on gay rights, Gofyy
said.</P>
      <P>"Some candidates who have shown support for GBT groups during their campaigns
never did anything after being elected. Some did push for new legislation or
amendments but in the end they were stuck in the Legislative Yuan due to
opposition from conservative legislators, " he said.</P>
      <P>Two major elections are coming up in Taiwan, while legislative elections
scheduled to be held at the end of 2007 and the presidential election set for

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu expressed strong disappointment Tuesday over a Ministry
of Finance (MOF) formal announcement of the winning bank of the country's first
sports lottery to be launched next year.</P>
      <P>Chen urged the ministry not to make the public lose faith in the sports lottery
issuer and pushed prosecution authorities to finish an investigation into the
role of the bid winner, Taipei Fubon Bank, in an insider trading scandal as soon
as possible.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a city government meeting in the southern port city one
day after the MOF announced Taipei Fubon Bank as the winner of the sports
lottery license.</P>
      <P>The ministry had delayed the announcement since Sept. 3 when an MOF screening
committee selected Taipei Fubon Bank over two other bidders -- the Bank of
Kaohsiung and Chinatrust Commercial Bank.</P>
      <P>The delay was the result of widespread concern about Fubon Financial Holding Co.
Chief Investment Officer Daniel Chiang, who was detained for questioning by
prosecutors in August over his alleged role in Standard Chartered Bank's
acquisition of Hsinchu International Bank and was recently released on bail
pending further probes.</P>
      <P>Taipei Fubon Bank is a division of Fubon Financial Holding Co., the second-
biggest financial services provider in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen described the Kaohsiung city government, which partially owns the Bank of
Kaohsiung, as "highly disappointed" over the MOF announcement.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Bank of Kaohsiung filed a complaint with the MOF over the bidding
process last month and had yet to receive the response. The ministry's decision
to make the announcement at this point will prompt the public to question the
propriety of the bidding process and lose confidence in the sports lottery, she
claimed.</P>
      <P>However, Vice Minister of Finance Liu Teng-cheng defended the announcement,
saying that the ministry had asked the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC)
whether Taipei Fubon Bank is involved in the scandal and whether the bank will
be punished.</P>
      <P>Quoting the FSC, Liu said Taipei Fubon Bank has received no punishment for
violating any financial regulations since one year before the bank filed its
application for the sports lottery bid.</P>
      <P>There is also no substantial evidence to suggest that the bank is involved in
the Hsinchu bank acquisition scandal, Liu noted.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taipei Fubon Bank promised last week that it will unconditionally
give up its rights to run the sports lottery if punished by the FSC in the
future due to its involvement in the insider trading case, Liu added.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the possibility that the delayed announcement will lead to a
postponement of the planned date for the official launch of the sports lottery,
Liu said that in principle, Taipei Fubon Bank will still launch the lottery
April 15 as scheduled.</P>

Taiwan sponsored by Taiwan Heart -- a non-profit group initiated by the vice
president to carry out various social welfare programs.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, the country will embark on a new stage of judicial reform from
now until the inauguration of the next president May 20, 2008 after Lai In-jaw
took over the post as Judicial Yuan president from Weng Yueh-sheng Oct. 1, and
because the Control Yuan will also rekindle its routine operations next year
after a hiatus of more than two years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Heart is committed to joining forces with the nation's judicial reformers
in the coming months as the legislative and presidential elections approach, she
said, adding that group members will assist government authorities in wiping out
vote buying and other irregularities in the run-up to the two major elections.</P>
      <P>Apart from political issues, Lu said, the group will also do its best to recruit
more professionals, such as lawyers and doctors, to further advocate social

      <P>Amid public concern about the mercury content in flu vaccine, TPA President Lin

organomercury compound that has been commonly used as an antiseptic and
antifungal agent in some vaccines since the 1930s.</P>

      <P>The research, which was published on the influential New England Journal of
Medicine in September, concluded that mercury-containing vaccines have caused no
side effect on childrens' nervous systems.</P>
      <P>A comment in the popular weekly general medical journal also says that the issue
of mercury-containing vaccines has been magnified in an irrational manner in the
U.S. to a political and judiciary problem, the TPA said, urging the Taiwan
people to be "rational."</P>
      <P>Earlier, Legislator Sun Ta-chien of the opposition Kuomintang brought up the
public concerns over the safety of flu vaccines during a question-and-answering
session at the Legislative Yuan, following the government's implementation of a
free flu vaccination program for high-risk groups of people Monday.</P>
      <P>The government's 2007 free flu vaccination program covers all first- and second-
grade elementary school students around the country after an analysis by the
Center for Disease Control (CDC) on reported flu cases between 2000 and 2006 in
Taiwan found that the incidence of flu turning into serious disease among
children under 12 years is four or five times the number among people over 65,
while the mortality rate is also three or four times that of the elderly, far
higher than other age groups.</P>
      <P>According to CDC experts, the best way to prevent flu is to get flu shots.</P>
      <P>Taiwan usually enters flu season around the end of November, with cases reaching
a peak around Christmas.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Party members hope president will assume chairmanship: lawmaker</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 2 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have reached a consensus on
President Chen Shui-bian assuming the party's chairmanship after Yu Shyi-kun
insisted on stepping down from the post, DPP Legislator Wang Tuoh claimed
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wang, who is also a DPP legislative caucus whip, made the comments while
answering questions from reporters at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The issue of the DPP chairmanship has been under the spotlight since Yu offered
to resign from the party's top post late last month following his indictment for
embezzlement by Taipei prosecutors over allegedly misusing special allowance
funds during his tenures as premier and as Presidential Office secretary-
general.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, it is the common desire of most DPP members that Chen
concurrently assume the chairmanship to lead the party to victory in the coming
legislative and presidential elections. Chen concurrently served as DPP chairman
from 2002-2004.</P>
      <P>Turning  to  a  media  report  that  Presidential  Office Secretary-General Yeh
Chu-lan may serve as DPP acting chairwoman if Yu insists on quitting, Wang said
that he has never heard of such discussions within the party.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Yeh Yi-jin said that it would be good for President Chen to serve
as party chairman to help forge unity.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yeh Chu-lan said that she will fully respect the party's decision to
handle the chairmanship issue through party mechanisms -- something which the
Central Standing Committee (CSC) will discuss in its weekly meeting Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Party sources said Chen is likely to assume DPP chairmanship if Yu insists on
stepping down. But they also predicted that Yeh Chu-lan may serve as acting
party chairwoman should Chen be loath to take over the post.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the same issue, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said earlier the same
day that Yu's offer to depart has to be considered by the CSC.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Public Prosecutors Office in Changhua indicted three men Tuesday for
supplying the illegal veterinary drug ractopamine and the banned antibiotic
chloramphenicol to pig farms in Changhua County.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors are seeking one year in prison for Ho Po-yen, owner of a trading
company in Taipei, an eight-month sentence for Huang Shih-hui, owner of a
company in Kaohsiung, and a six-month sentence for Lin Chieh-sheng, owner of a
firm in Changhua County.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors are also asking for a fine of NT$10,000 each for the companies
of Ho and Huang.</P>
      <P>According to the prosecutors,  Ho bought large amounts of ractopamine from China
and sold it to hog raisers in Changhua County. He also supplied the drug to
Huang for distribution among pig farmers in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors, supported by police and a central Taiwan mobile unit organized
by the Bureau of Investigation under the Ministry of Justice, raided a warehouse
in Taipei July 31 and another warehouse in Kaohsiung Aug. 2, and seized 28
metric tons of ractopamine and 150 kilograms of material for making
chloramphenicol.</P>
      <P>Ractopamine is a drug used as a feed additive to increase protein and decrease
fat in pigs. Taiwan has zero tolerance for ractopamine residue in pigs, although
it is legal to use the drug in more than 20 countries, including the United
States.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also banned chloramphenicol as a feed additive since 2002, with
offenders liable to fines of NT$6,000 to NT$30,000 under the Veterinary Drugs
Control Act.</P>
      <P>The use of ractopamine to produce more lean meat in hogs became a issue of
contention in Taiwan in July after two shipments of pork from the United States
were found to contain ractopamine residue.</P>
      <P>To allay fears of the public about the drug's harmful effects on their health,
the Department of Health assured that the ban on the use of ractopamine in pigs
will remain in place and that imports of pork containing residue of the drug
will not be permitted.</P>

      <P>The cause of a 77-cm fracture in the fuselage of a China Airlines (CAL) Boeing
737-800 that was found after the plane landed in Japan Sept. 20 remains unknown,
aviation sources said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to data and information provided by CAL, the sources said, the
fracture is suspected to be a symptom of corrosion, but the cause of the
corrosion remains a mystery.</P>
      <P>CAL maintenance workers discovered the hairline crack near the tail of the jet
during a routine post-flight inspection Sept. 20 afternoon at Saga Airport on
the southern Japanese island of Kyushu. No anomalies were detected during the
plane's flight from Taipei.</P>
      <P>The fracture was found about 30 minutes before the plane's scheduled departure
for a return trip to Taipei. The airline sent another plane from Taipei to pick
up the flight's 49 passengers, who left Saga Airport nearly 5 1/2-hours behind
schedule.</P>
      <P>CAL, Taiwan's largest carrier, sent 10 maintenance technicians to Saga Sept. 21,
but the sources said repair work had not yet been started because Boeing Co. has
not yet come up with any repair or maintenance instructions.</P>
      <P>Noting that Boeing exercises great caution in dealing with the issue, the
sources said Boeing has sent technical staff to Saga to assist in investigating
the cause of the fracture.</P>
      <P>With the cause undetermined, the plane has been stuck at Saga for nearly two
weeks as the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) is reluctant to issue a
certificate of air worthiness for the aircraft to fly back to Taipei.</P>
      <P>CAA officials originally supposed that the fracture was caused by scratching
from a ground service vehicle after the plane landed, but that possibility has
been ruled out after an extensive investigation, the sources said.</P>
      <P>CAL planes are subject to two rounds of thorough checks before any flight. If
the fracture existed before its flight from Taipei to Saga, it should have been
found. As a result, the fracture could have occurred in mid-air, the sources
said.</P>
      <P>On Aug. 20, a China Airlines Boeing 737-800 that landed at Okinawa's Naha
airport exploded in a fireball at a gate seconds after all 157 passengers and
eight crew safely evacuated.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Four more allies plead Taiwan's case at U.N. General Assembly</HEADLINE>

      <P>Four more of Taiwan's diplomatic allies voiced support for the country's bid to
join the United Nations Tuesday during the ongoing session of the U.N. General
Assembly, bringing to 17 the total number of allies which spoke for Taiwan at
the annual meeting.</P>
      <P>Raising  the issue  during  the general  debate  were the representatives of
Saint Kitts and Nevis, Burkina Faso, Belize, and Kiribati.</P>
      <P>In his statement, Timothy Harris, minister of foreign affairs of Saint Kitts and
Nevis, said Taiwan should be admitted to the United Nations according to the
principle of universality followed by the world body.</P>
      <P>Addressing China's accusation that Taiwan's bid is a separatist move amied at
achieving independence, Harris pointed out that U.N. membership is not a
"deterrent to unification" as seen in the example of the former East Germany and
West Germany, nor is it "the panacea to fragmentation" as seen in the
deconstruction of the former Soviet Union.</P>
      <P>"What has always been clear is that the United Nations has extended a warm
welcome to all states and respected the equality of all states," Harris said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has shown that it can be "a true partner in development, "
Harris said that the international community has been deprived of the gift of
that partnership by rejecting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Djibrill Yipene Bassole, minister of foreign affairs of Burkina Faso, claimed
that by denying membership to Taiwan -- a democratic and modernized country with
23 million people, the United Nations has given up its pursuit of modernization
and the principle  of universality.</P>
      <P>Belizean Minister of Foreign Affairs Lisa Shoman said that his country remains
steadfast in its support of Taiwan's membership bid and that it will continue to
advocate representation for Taiwan in the world body.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Natanaera Kirata, minister of public works and utilities of
Kiribati, expressed his regret that once again, the issue of U.N. representation
for Taiwan was not given a fair opportunity to be discussed by the General
Assembly this year.</P>
      <P>Kirata said Taiwan and its 23 million people deserve to be treated justly by the
United Nations, given the country's upholding of the principles of democracy,
mutual respect and understanding as stipulated in the U.N. Charter.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has not been represented in the United Nations since 1971, when the
Republic of China's U.N. seat was given to the People's Republic of China. While
the country has tried without success to have the United Nations consider the
issue of its representation since 1993, this year marks the first time the
country has applied to join the world body under the name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, following the return of Taiwan's application by the U.N. Secretariat
first in July and again in August, an item endorsed by 17 of Taiwan's diplomatic
allies asking the United Nations to address Taiwan's membership application has
also been excluded from the agenda of the 62nd session of the General Assembly.</P>
      <P>Of the total of 24 diplomatic allies of Taiwan, only seven did not plead
Taiwan's case during the week-long general debate.</P>

      <P>Cross-Taiwan Strait peace will be built on negotiations between Taiwan and China
on an equal footing, a caucus whip of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Wang Tuoh made the remarks after South Korean President Roh Moo
Hyun met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang Tuesday on the first
day of three days of talks between the two leaders, marking the second meeting
between the heads of state of the two Koreas since the Korean Peninsula was
divided 60 years ago.</P>
      <P>Wang said the meeting is significant in that the two Koreas are engaging in
talks on an equal footing based on mutual respect.</P>
      <P>He lamented that China has yet to view Taiwan as a sovereign, independent state,
saying that cross-strait peace should be built on mutual respect so that
negotiations between the two sides based on an equal footing will be possible.</P>
      <P>He said that both Koreas are members of the United Nations. In comparison, China
has continued to obstruct Taiwan's bid to join the world body.</P>
      <P>He urged China to "take a cue" from the Roh-Kim meeting, acknowledge that Taiwan
is a sovereign, independent country and help Taiwan join the United Nations.</P>
      <P>China should also remove the 900 missiles deployed along its southeastern coast
to end the military threat against Taiwan and contribute to peace in Asia and
the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Legislator Huang Wei-cher accused Ma Ying-jeou, presidential
candidate of the main opposition Kuomintang, of being unwilling to face the fact
that the relationship between Taiwan and China is a "state-to-state" one.</P>
      <P>He urged Ma to learn from the meeting between the two Korean heads of state,
saying that talks on direct transportation links between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait should also be conducted on an equal footing.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet finalized a draft amendment to the Income Tax Law Wednesday that
would allow taxpayers to claim higher deductions for salaries and educational
expenses.</P>
      <P>According to the bill, which requires final approval by the Legislative Yuan,
the deductions for salaries and for the physically or mentally challenged would
be increased from NT$78,000 (US$2,393) and NT$77,000, respectively, to
NT$82,000.</P>
      <P>In addition, taxpayers would be able to claim a deduction of up to NT$25,000 for
each dependent studying in college or university, as opposed to up to NT$25,000
per household at present.</P>
      <P>In a measure aimed at preventing taxpayers from using donations to avoid paying
taxes, the bill stipulates that only donations made in cash would be eligible
for deductions.</P>
      <P>Sheu Yu-jer, director-general of the Ministry of Finance's Taxation Agency,
estimated that the changes would reduce the government's revenues by NT$200
million per year.</P>
      <P>While the change in the deductions for donations would increase the government's
revenues by NT$3.5 billion per year, the changes in the deductions for salaries,

its revenues by NT$1.7 billion, NT$200 million and NT$1.8 billion, respectively,
according to Sheu.</P>
      <P>He said the proposed amendment would lessen the tax liability of members of the
middle class,  prevent  tax evasion and lower operational costs of businesses.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President Chen 'best choice' to serve as DPP chairman: lawmaker</HEADLINE>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Trong Chai of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said
Wednesday that President Chen Shui-bian is the best choice to serve as the new
DPP chairman.</P>
      <P>The issue of the DPP chairmanship has been in the spotlight since Yu Shyi-kun
offered to resign from the party's top post late last month following his
indictment on forgery and corruption charges by Taipei prosecutors for allegedly
misusing special allowance funds during  his  tenures  as premier  and as
Presidential  Office secretary-general.</P>
      <P>Yu had originally planned to step down from the post after the party's national
congress held Sept. 30. However, he left the post Sept. 27 after other DPP
bigwigs came to a decision Sept. 26 to only change the wording of the party's
"normal country resolution" instead of adopting his proposal to add a clause
call for the changing of the country's name to "Taiwan".</P>
      <P>On the question of who should succeed Yu, Legislator Chai said that it would be
suitable for President Chen to serve concurrently as the head of the DPP.</P>
      <P>Chen served as DPP chairman from July 2002 to December 2004 when he resigned to
assume responsibility for the party's failure to win a majority in the
legislative elections that year.</P>
      <P>Chai said that if President Chen is unwilling to assume the DPP chairmanship
again, then Presidential Office Secretary-General Yeh Chu-lan would be the
"second best choice."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, another DPP legislator, Huang Wei-cher, expressed the hope that
President Chen will assume the post as soon as possible to help allay DPP
supporters' concerns that the party seems divided while the opposition camp has
consolidated itself ahead of the presidential election slated for March next
year.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung said Wednesday that the succession issue is
expected to be discussed at a DPP Central Executive Committee meeting next
Tuesday and that hopefully a final decision will be made by then.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers urged the Ministry of Education (MOE) Wednesday to come up with
substantial measures within one month to address the issue of students not
getting enough sleep due to heavy school workloads.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Ching-an of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said the ministry
should take responsibility for this problem.</P>
      <P>Her colleague Chiang Yi-hsiung said that a study should be conducted to
determine whether insufficient sleep affects the mental development of students.</P>
      <P>Deputy Education Minister Lu Mu-ling said Education Minister Tu Cheng-sheng has
instructed related agencies in the ministry to deal with the matter.</P>
      <P>Pan Wen-chung, director of the MOE's Department of Elementary Education, urged
parents to pay more attention to their children's daily schedules to make sure
that they get at least eight hours of sleep per night, noting that many children
spend too much time watching TV or surfing the Internet.</P>
      <P>In addition, he urged students to get more exercise, saying that doing so will
ensure good sleep quality and benefit their physical and mental development.</P>
      <P>He also asked parents to assess the condition of their children and not to push
them to engage in too many extracurricular activities so that their school work
will not be negatively affected.</P>
      <P>The two lawmakers' expressed their concern on the issue after the results of a
survey released earlier the same day showed that Taiwan teenagers sleep half an
hour less than their counterparts in other countries.</P>
      <P>Huang Yi-shu, a child psychiatrist at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital who
conducted the survey, said that Taiwan's teenagers get 7.5 hours of sleep per
night on average, less than the 7.9 hours enjoyed by their counterparts in the
neighboring countries of Japan, South Korea, and China, where the importance of
education is stressed as strongly as in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>She said that not getting enough sleep will affect the development of teenagers,
adding they could display such symptoms as hyperactivity, irritation or anxiety
if the problem persists over an extended period of time.</P>
      <P>She suggested that elementary school students get more than nine hours of sleep
per night and go to bed before 10 p.m., while junior and senior high school
students should go to bed before 11 p.m. and get eight hours of sleep.</P>
      <P>Huang conducted the survey on more than 2,000 students between Grade Six in
elementary school and the second year of senior high school between June 2005
and June 2006.</P>
      <P>She found that the sixth-graders get an average of 7.9 hours of sleep per night,
junior high school students get 7.5 hours, and senior high school students get
6.8 hours.</P>

to persuade the ruling junta to conduct dialogue with local democracy activists

      <P>Chang made the call after he heard a report at the Executive Yuan by the

    <HEADLINE>DOH will take responsibility if flu vaccines harmful</HEADLINE>

10/03/07  16:31:34

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) said Wednesday that all the influenza vaccines
imported and offered by the government are safe and that it will take full
responsibility if any of the doses are found to cause harm to people.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-yi, a deputy director of the DOH Center for Disease Control (CDC), said
that so far, there is no scientific evidence to prove that mercury-containing
flu vaccines are unsafe, adding that since there is no way to prove they are
unsafe, the center cannot exclude the products from its order list.</P>
      <P>Shih said the CDC will not consider importing only mercury-free flu vaccines,
since these products are scarce and imports would be insufficient to meet
domestic demand.</P>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation voiced opposition Wednesday to the availability of
mercury-containing flu vaccines, saying that the government should guarantee the
safety of the vaccines.</P>
      <P>A foundation spokesman said it does not exclude the possibility of filing a
lawsuit against the DOH for providing "health-impairing" mercury-containing flu
vaccines and demanding national compensation.</P>
      <P>Responding to the accusation, Shih said the CDC guarantees the safety of
mercury-containing flu vaccines and is willing to take full responsibility.</P>
      <P>He also challenged the Consumers' Foundation by asking whether the foundation
will take responsibility if people stop receiving flu vaccinations because of
what he claimed were "unfounded allegations" made by the foundation.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Pediatric Association (TPA) urged people considered to be at high
risk of influenza to take advantage of free vaccinations offered by the
government, claiming that the mercury-containing vaccine is safe.</P>
      <P>Amid public concern about the mercury content in the free flu vaccine, TPA
President Lin Tzou-yien and Assistant Secretary-General Lee Ping-ing released a
joint statement to claim the safety of the vaccine, which contains thimerosal --
an organomercury compound that has been commonly used as an antiseptic and
antifungal agent in some vaccines since the 1930s.</P>
      <P>In the  statement,  the  pediatricians  claimed  that  the organomercury "cannot
cause illness" and that it is discharged from the human body soon after the
injection of the thimerosal-containing vaccine.</P>
      <P>The statement quoted results of a joint research by the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control,  Harvard University  and Stanford University targeting 1,074 children
aged between seven and 10 through a comprehensive neurophysiologic evaluation.</P>
      <P>The research, which was published in the influential New England Journal of
Medicine in September, concluded that mercury-containing vaccines have caused no
side effect on childrens' nervous systems.</P>
      <P>A comment in the popular weekly general medical journal also says that the issue
of mercury-containing vaccines has been magnified in an irrational manner in the
U.S. to a political and judiciary problem, the TPA said, urging the Taiwan
people to be "rational."</P>
      <P>Legislator Sun Ta-chien of the opposition Kuomintang brought up the public
concerns over the safety of flu vaccines during a question-and-answer session at
the Legislative Yuan the day before, following the government's implementation
of a free flu vaccination program for high-risk groups of people Monday.</P>
      <P>The government's 3 million-dose free flu vaccination program for 2007 covers
persons over 65 years of age or children aged between six months and two years.</P>
      <P>The free flu shots are also available to first-line medical professionals,
hospital volunteer workers, community pharmacists, medical lab workers, school
nurses, crew of international airlines, quarantine workers, poultry farmers and
bird raisers, nursing home residents, people suffering from severe injuries or
diseases, as well as first-year and second-year primary school students.</P>

      <P>The combined turnover of three science industrial parks affiliated to the
Cabinet-level National Science Council (NSC) reached NT$1.2 trillion (US$36.85
billion) during the January-August period, posting an 11.6 percent growth
compared with the level of the same period of 2006, according to an NSC report

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei District Court ruled Wednesday that 10 defendants connected with the
Rebar Asia Pacific Group scandal will remain in custody for two more months
despite their plea for release after their current custody term expires.</P>
      <P>The court noted that the defendants, including several family members of Wang
You-theng, the fugitive founder of the Rebar Asia Pacific Group, have embezzled
from various subsidiaries under the Rebar group and that they have played major
roles in the scandal.</P>
      <P>The evidence is against them, said Liu Shou-sung, spokesman of the Taipei
District Court.</P>
      <P>Their embezzlement from the corporations has not only affected the economy, but
has had widespread ramifications in the whole of society, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>Liu said that to facilitate the trial of the case, the court will hold them in
custody until Dec. 8.</P>
      <P>Also, because they have committed felonies, there will be no limits on the
number of times their custody period can be extended -- usually it is extended
only once or twice.</P>
      <P>The 10 defendants include Wang Shih-chan, younger brother of Wang You-tseng, and
three of Wang You-tseng's children -- China Rebar Vice Chairman Wang Lin-tai,
Asia Pacific broadband Telecom President Wang Lin-yi and Chia Hsin Food and
Synthetic Fiber Co. Chairman Wang Lin-chiao, as well as top executives working
for Wang in various companies.</P>
      <P>In an indictment in March, the prosecution said the Wang family obtained illegal
benefits by setting up numerous dummy corporations through which they engaged in
fraud, insider trading and embezzlement on a massive scale.</P>
      <P>The scandal came to light in early January when two of its member companies --
Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic Co. and China Rebar Co. -- filed for bankruptcy
restructuring with the Taipei District Court. The move sparked a run on the
Chinese Bank, another Rebar subsidiary that has since been taken over by the
state-run Central Deposit Insurance Corp.</P>
      <P>Wang You-tseng and his wife Wang Chin She-ying fled to China and later to the
United States last year before the group's financial woes became public. They
remain on the nation's most-wanted list.</P>

      <P>The number of Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan during China's Oct. 1-7 national
holiday is estimated to grow 18 percent as compared with the same period of last
year, despite a drop in Chinese tourist arrivals in the first nine months, an
official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Transportation and Communications Ho Nuan-hsuan said 56,122
Chinese tourists traveled from Hong Kong, Macau or other countries to Taiwan
during the nine-month period, a drop of 23 percent compared with the same period
of last year.</P>
      <P>The ministry attributed the decline to Beijing's reinforced move to crack down
on illegal Taiwan visits by Chinese people living in China via other countries,
and its reluctance to formally allow Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has opened its doors for Chinese citizens living abroad to make
sightseeing trips to the island. Chinese citizens living in China are also
allowed to visit for sightseeing via a third country.</P>
      <P>It has been assessed that 1,840 Chinese tourists will visit Taiwan during
China's so-called "golden week" National Day holiday in China, according to the
MOTC.</P>
      <P>In general, the number of foreign tourists to Taiwan totaled over 2.4 million in
the January-August period, representing an increase of 4.52 percent year-on-
year, according to MOTC statistics.</P>
      <P>During the eight-month period, local people made 6.14 million overseas visits,
registering a 3.54 percent year-on-year growth, the tallies show.</P>
      <P>In terms of domestic tourism, the number of visits to the 295 major tourist
attractions around the country reached 96.37 million in the first seven months
of the year, according to the MOTC statistics.</P>
      <P>The most popular privately operated tourist attraction was the Taipei 101
Observatory, the MOTC said, noting that the National Museum of Natural Science
in Taichung City, central Taiwan attracted more tourists than other entry-fee
government-run tourist attractions in the seven-month period.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday that there is still ample room for
development between Taiwan and Britain in bilateral trade exchanges.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks when he received a British parliamentary group at the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>He said bilateral trade between the two countries reached more than  US$4
billion  last year,  with Britain  being  Taiwan's third-largest trading partner
in Europe.</P>
      <P>He noted that since the two countries signed an agreement to avoid double
taxation and tax evasion in 2002, it has contributed a great deal to promoting
investment in each other's country.</P>
      <P>As of the end of last year, Taiwan had invested in 150 projects in Britain
totaling US$1 billion, accounting for half of the island's investment in Europe,
he said.</P>
      <P>Just as Britain is the top choice of Taiwanese businessmen in Europe, British
manufacturers have also invested in over 400 projects amounting to US$4 billion,
the fifth-largest source of investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen also praised Lord Faulkner, co-chairman of a pro-Taiwan parliamentary
group, for his contribution to the enhancement of substantial relations between
the two countries. Faulkner led a delegation that attended Chen's inauguration
ceremony for his second term as president in 2004.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the pro-Taiwan group had only 17 members when it was inaugurated
in May 2005, a number that has since grown three-fold to 51 members.</P>

      <P>Flu vaccination is progressing well in Kaohsiung City, in southern Taiwan, with
3,031 citizens already receiving flu shots on the first day of free vaccination
service, an official of the Kaohsiung city government's Department of Health
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Concerns over the vaccine, which contains traces of mercury in the form of the
preservative thimerosal, seems to have had no impact on Kaohsiung citizen's
acceptance of the service, the official said.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government bought 116,921 vaccines for the use of people in
high-risk groups this year. Some 69,053 target senior citizens over the age of
65, while 15,292 are for kids aged between six months and two years.</P>
      <P>Other 32,576 are for the first-and second-grade elementary students, who are
included in the free vaccination service this year, the official said, adding
that the department will send medical teams to administer vaccination to
eligible students in schools.</P>
      <P>The free influenza vaccination service for people in high-risk categories will
last until Nov. 30, and the remaining flu shots will be open to the general
public from Dec. 1, the official said.</P>
      <P>The official said influenza vaccination is safe, and seldom causes side effects.
However, he still suggested that people who had adverse reaction from getting
flu shots or kids under six months, should avoid vaccination.</P>
      <P>People who are in fever or have acute disease should put off vaccination time

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung, once an influential figure in the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), renounced his party membership Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Shen told reporters that he has posted his party membership certificate to the
DPP office in Taipei. The DPP's head office confirmed that the office has
received Shen's certificate.</P>
      <P>The DPP office also said that Shen sent a statement accompanying his
certificate, declaring that from now on he will have nothing to do with any DPP
policies and decisions.</P>
      <P>Shen said he had remained in the DPP long enough, mainly because his presence
would make the "bad boys in the party" uncomfortable.</P>
      <P>"Now that they seem to have become numb, there is no point for me to remain in
the DPP," he said.</P>
      <P>Shen, 68, served as legislator for four terms from 1993 to 2005. An eloquent
man, he never hesitated to criticize his own party and has been considered by
the opposition as the "conscience" of the DPP.</P>
      <P>Once a torch-bearer for the pro-independence movement, Shen lost the legislative
election in 2004 when he was considered by DPP members as a divisive figure
within the party.</P>
      <P>During the past three years, he has become a virtual loner in the DPP and has
been listed as one of the "11 nemeses" within the party who dared to criticize
the DPP and call for reform.</P>
      <P>Some  DPP  members  disliked  his close  association  with pro-opposition
figures, including Sisy Chen, a former independent legislator who left the DPP,
and Jaw Shaw-kong, chairman of UFO Radio and supporter of the pan-blue
opposition alliance of the Kuomintang and the People First Party.</P>
      <P>A main reason leading to Shen's isolation in the DPP was his failure to back up
President Chen Shui-bian's denial that first lady Wu Shu-jen ever accepted
unlawful campaign contributions from Chen Yu-hao, a business tycoon.</P>
      <P>During his 2004 re-election campaign, President Chen ordered Chen Yu-hao, former
chairman of the Tuntex Group and a fugitive exiled abroad, to be placed on
Taiwan's "most wanted list."</P>
      <P>A furious Chen Yu-hao revealed in the week before the election that he gave NT$3
million (US$91,900)  in cash to help Chen Shui-bian's campaign for Taipei mayor
in 1994, and another NT$3 million in 1998 to fund his campaign for a second
mayoral term.</P>
      <P>Chen Yu-hao said that on both occasions, Shen, who was a legislator at the time
and served as Chen Shui-bian's campaign manager, accompanied him to the
residence of the president on Minsheng East Road in Taipei and witnessed the
handovers of the cash to the first lady.</P>
      <P>Chen Yu-hao claimed that he had received thank-you phone calls from Chen Shui-
bian on both accounts. Although President Chen denied that his wife ever met
with Chen Yu-hao, the allegations cast serious doubt over his integrity and
caused a fall in his support rating.</P>
      <P>Despite being held in high esteem as a man who always told the truth, Shen
neither confirmed nor denied Chen Yu-hao's allegations. As a result, he pleased
neither side and drew criticism from within the DPP for not backing up the
president. However, he eventually confirmed in June 2006 that he had accompanied
Chen You-hao to the president's residence twice to meet with the first lady.</P>

      <P>Hsinchu Science Park Administration Director-General Huang De-ruei expressed his
hope Wednesday that the production value of integrated circuit design, or IC
design, will grow to take a 40 percent share of the global market in two or
three years, thereby establishing it as No. 1 in the world.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks as he and his counterparts from the Central and Southern
Taiwan Science Park reported on the revenues of the three parks in the first
eight months of this year at the invitation of the National Science Council.</P>
      <P>Huang said that the revenues of Hsinchu Science park in the January-August
period totaled NT$737.3 billion (US$22.34 billion), amodest growth of 3.36
percent from the same period last year.</P>
      <P>Of those revenues, the production value of the IC design sector totaled NT$160.5
billion, up 24.85 percent over the same period last year, with a global market
share of 20 percent, to rank second in the world.</P>
      <P>Among the six major sectors in the Hsinchu Science Park, the IC sector accounted
for 72 percent of revenues, the largest, at NT$533.1 billion, up 4.27 percent
from the same period last year. The opto-electronics sector is the second
largest with revenues of NT$105.5 billion, up 11.42 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Huang also reported that exports to Malaysia recorded the greatest growth at 88
percent in the first eight months, which he said is a good thing in terms of
market diversification.</P>
      <P>Exports to Vietnam also registered an increase, showing that exports to Vietnam
will grow rapidly, Huang added.</P>
      <P>Yang Wen-ke, director-general of Central Taiwan Science Park, said that although
the park is only four years old, it reported revenues of NT$156.48 billion in
the first eight months of the year, up 54.66 percent from the same period last
year, and the revenues at the end of the year should reach NT$240 billion.</P>
      <P>He predicted that the park's revenue next year will reach NT$360 billion with
the number of manufacturers stationed in the park reaching 110. He envisioned
revenues reaching NT$1 trillion, and the number of manufacturers stationed in
the park reaching 150 within a decade.</P>
      <P>Southern Taiwan Science Park Director-General Chen Chun-wei said that park
revenues reached NT$331.3 billion in the first eight months, up 16.86 percent
from the same period last year after strong demands for TFT-LCD due to falling
costs and price reductions for flat panel displays.</P>
      <P>He predicted production values this year will reach around NT$520 billion, and
reach NT$1 trillion within five years thanks to strong demands for high-end
communications, digital and consumer electronics products.</P>

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung has defended the Cabinet's major economy-boosting
plans over the years, saying that it would be a distortion of the facts to say
that the plans have made a "negative contribution" to the country's economic
growth.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks Tuesday while fielding questions from Kuomintang (KMT)
Legislator Lin Te-fu at a question-and-answer session of the Legislative Yuan
about an assessment recently released by the legislature's Budgetary Research
Center on next year's total government budget.</P>
      <P>The assessment report said that over the past seven years, the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) administration initiated the "8100 Get Taiwan Moving"
project, the "Ten New Major Construction Projects" (investing NT$500 billion
over five years), and "Mega Investment, Mega Warmth" project.</P>
      <P>The claimed that all those economic development projects have failed to boost
the country's economy.</P>
      <P>Chang questioned the center's evaluation criteria, saying that the country's
economic growth rates in recent years have surpassed 4 percent and that the
Cabinet has slashed next year's budget for personnel expenses as requested by
the legislature.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in a response to the lawmaker's question about low wage levels in
Taiwan compared to those in South Korea, Hsu Chang-yao, head of the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) , said that the comparison
did not take into account fluctuations of the two countries' currency exchange
rates.</P>
      <P>In recent years, South Korea's exchange rate has risen by 25 percent, while that
of Taiwan has remained quite stable, Hsu went on.</P>
      <P>In addition, consumer price levels in South Korea have also increased, Hsu said,
adding that these factors contribute to the impression that South Koreans'
salaries are higher than those of their Taiwanese counterparts.</P>
      <P>Yet, if calculated in terms of global purchasing power, actual wage levels are
higher in Taiwan than in South Korea, Hsu noted.</P>

      <P>Changhua County Magistrate Cho Po-yuan is currently on a visit to Hokkaido,
Japan in an effort to boost trade and learn from the Japanese prefecture's dairy
industry.</P>
      <P>According to a press release issued by the county government of Changhua in
central Taiwan, Cho met with the mayor of Otaru City, a port city of Hokkaido,
Tuesday to exchange views on possible bilateral cooperative programs.</P>
      <P>Heading a delegation composed of Changhua County Council Speaker Pai Hung-sen
and several high-ranking county government officials, Cho visited Hokkaido's
Tokai University Wednesday to get a better understanding of park golf, a new
form of sport developed in Hokkaido. As the sport requires no special techniques
or physical strength, this sport has been popular in Hokkaido among people of
all ages as a family sport.</P>
      <P>According to Tokai University, golf courses in Hokkaido are closed from November
through April due to the icy winter weather.</P>
      <P>A Tokai University spokesman suggested that Taiwanese enterprises construct more
golf courses to lure more Japanese park golf lovers to spend their vacations in
Taiwan, taking advantage of the direct flights between Taiwan and Hokkaido.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, if Changhua County can develop more golf courses and hot springs,
it could attract 10,000 to 20,000 Japanese tourists to spend the winter there,
the spokesman added.</P>
      <P>Noting that Hokkaido boasts one of the best dairy industries in the world,  Cho
said  his county  government  will strengthen communications with this Japanese
prefecture to learn from its development in this regard.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Yu Cheng-hsien, chairman of the state-owned enterprise Taiwan Sugar Corp.
(Taisugar), said Wednesday that he had tendered his resignation two weeks ago to
Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R.L. Chen, so that he could concentrate on
his campaign for a legislative seat.</P>
      <P>Yu, told reporters that he is now on leave, waiting for his successor to take
over the chairmanship.</P>
      <P>He said that with the election only 100 days away, he has to devote himself
full-time to the election campaign and let voters in his constituency -- the
Kangshan township in Kaohsiung County -- come to understand the new "single-
member constituency, two-vote" system through vigorous publicity.</P>
      <P>Yu, 48, was legislator from 1987 to 1993 and served as minister of the interior
from 2002 to 2004. He resigned the ministerial post in April 2004 to take
responsibility for the March 19 shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice
President Annette Lu on the eve of the 2004 presidential election. He was
appointed Taisugar chairman in 2005.</P>
      <P>The "319 shooting" occurred while Chen and Lu were campaigning in a jeep in
Tainan, southern Taiwan. The opposition believes the incident generated sympathy
votes for Chen and Lu, helping them to win the election by a mere 29,500 votes.
The opposition parties also suspect that the incident was staged, but their
efforts to form a commission to investigate the shooting have met resistance
from the DPP and its ally the Taiwan Solidarity Union.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition  Kuomintang  (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou vowed
Wednesday that he will not double as party chairman if elected president in the
March 22, 2008 election.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks to reporters during a visit to Miaoli County in northern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma asserted that if he wins the presidential election, he will not serve double-
duty, no matter what the situation, so as to fully dedicate himself to state
affairs.</P>
      <P>However, Ma declined to comment on whether President Chen Shui-bian  should
concurrently  serve as the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) chairman,
saying he is not in a position to comment on the DPP's internal affairs.</P>
      <P>The DPP chairmanship issue has been under the spotlight since Yu Shyi-kun
offered to step down from the post late last month following his indictment by
Taipei prosecutors over alleged misuse of special allowance funds during his
tenures as premier and as Presidential Office secretary-general.</P>
      <P>It has been widely speculated that President Chen may take over the DPP's
chairmanship following Yu's resignation.</P>
      <P>The DPP's Central Standing Committee (CSC) agreed to accept Yu's offer to resign
during its weekly meeting Wednesday and approved a proposal to invite Chen to
concurrently take over the party's helm. Chen concurrently served as DPP
chairman from 2002-2004 after winning the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>It was also agreed in the CSC weekly meeting that the party's Central Executive
Committee (CEC) should come to a final decision concerning the DPP chairmanship
issue in its Oct. 5 meeting.</P>
      <P>Speaking after the CSC weekly meeting, DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung said
that President Chen is "certainly" the best one to take over the party's helm,
and that the CEC will make a formal announcement following the Friday meeting so
as to help forge party unity in the run-up to the legislative and presidential
polls.</P>
      <P>A DPP legislative caucus whip said Tuesday that it is the common desire of most
party members that President Chen assumes chairmanship and lead the party to win
the two coming elections.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Justice made public Wednesday a short anti-vote buying
commercial as part of its efforts to raise public awareness of irregularities in
the run-up to the Jan. 12 legislative polls.</P>
      <P>The commercial was screened at a news conference presided over by Justice
Minister Shih Mao-lin at the Baoan Temple in Taipei's Talungtung district.
Hundreds of Talung Elementary School pupils and residents in the nearby region
were invited to take part in the event. Schoolchildren chanted anti-vote buying
slogans to add fanfare and momentum to the activity.</P>
      <P>Shih told the audience that his ministry has started a campaign to fend off vote
buying and wipe out irregularities  as the legislative and presidential
elections approach, and reiterated that cash rewards for successful tips could
be as much as NT$10 million.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice has to date paid over NT$400 million (US$12.3 million)
in cash awards to informants, he noted.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, the Justice Ministry has tracked 27 and 1,624 vote-buying
cases related to the coming presidential and legislative elections,
respectively. Anyone caught buying votes could be jailed for three to 10 years,
he said, adding that the ministry is closely watching some 1,665 individuals who
might engage in vote-buying ahead of the two key elections.</P>
      <P>National Police Agency Director-General  Hou Yu-ih said in a meeting called
later the same day at the agency that police authorities across the country will
step up crackdown on gangsters and illegal weapon possession to maintain public
order and protect candidates' personal safety prior to the legislative and
presidential elections.</P>
      <P>In addition, Hou said, police will also go all out to eradicate vote-buying or
other activities that might upset the holding of free and fair elections and
their results.</P>
      <P>Competition among candidates in the Jan. 12, 2008 legislative election is
expected to be intense due to the adoption of a new "single-member constituency,
two-vote system" that will see the current number of legislative seats halved
from 225 to 113 in the new legislature.</P>

      <P>The Cloud Gate Dance Theatre of Taiwan once again impressed audiences in New
York Tuesday evening with choreographer Lin Hwai-min's Chinese calligraphy
inspired production "Wild Cursive." The opening performance of the 25th Next
Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) received a full-house
welcome.</P>
      <P>"Wild Cursive" is the final chapter of Lin's trilogy. Inspired after studying
Chinese calligraphy masterpieces, Lin created the first installment of "Cursive"
in 2001.</P>
      <P>Lin told media in New York the process in producing the trilogy has much to do
with the development of the dancers. He said that training in martial arts, tai
chi tao yin, modern dance, ballet, meditation, and Chinese opera movements
enables the dancers to turn themselves into bodily brushes.</P>
      <P>In 2003, Cloud Gate opened the Melbourne International Arts Festival with
"Cursive II", winning both the Age Critics' Award and the Patrons' Award. In
2006, "Cursive: A Trilogy" was chosen as the best dance choreography of the year
as a result of critics' poll by Ballettanz and Theaterheute.</P>
      <P>Cloud Gate made its BAM Next Wave debut in 1995 with "Nine Songs".  In 2000,
the dance theater brought Hermann  Hesse's "Siddhartha" inspired "Songs of the
Wanderers" to the Next Wave, and again in 2003 was invited to present the
internationally-acclaimed "Moon Water" at the festival.</P>
      <P>Five performances of "Wild Cursive" at the BAM Howard Gilman Opera House are
scheduled on Oct. 2, and Oct. 4-7.</P>
      <P>A co-sponsor of the event, the Asia Society in New York, invited Lin Hwai-min to
speak on Cloud Gate and to give his views on choreography on Oct. 3. BAM has
also arranged "a dialogue with Lin Hwai-min" moderated by art critic Anna

    <TEXT>
      <P>A visiting Britain official is promoting European directives, which set targets
on the collection, recycling and recovery of all types of electrical goods, to
Taiwanese companies and government agencies.</P>
      <P>The directives apply to all electrical products in the European market and focus
on producer responsibility, extending the "polluter pays" principle, said Steven
Andrews, an official who came from U.K.'s Department of Business Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform (BERR).</P>
      <P>Andrews is promoting the WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) and
RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) directives, both of which were
adopted by the European Union in 2003 to regulate the production of electrical
products, in this, his first visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is a must-go stop because of its leading position in the electrical and
information communication technology (ICT) industries, said Andrews, who had
visited Japan and North America to promote the regulations.</P>
      <P>WEEE directive asked all EEE producers who sell their products in Europe to
finance the collection and treatment of WEEE. The RoHS directive also seeks to
reduce the environmental impact of EEE by restricting the use of six hazardous
substances during manufacture, Andrews summed up.</P>
      <P>According to statistics provided by the Industrial Development Bureau of
Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs, he said, more than 90 percent of Taiwan
products are in compliance with the RoHS directive.</P>
      <P>Implementing the directives means short-term production cost increases for
companies, which must re-design products to meet the requirement, he said. In
the long term, he noted, prices for ICT products will invariably go down with
time, and by using fewer resources, the industry will see its costs drop.</P>
      <P>Several countries, including Japan and the United State, have described the
directives as "a European way of excluding other countries' products in the EU
market, " he said, adding that the U.S. also claims that it is a breach of World
Trade Organization (WTO) regulations.</P>
      <P>But Andrews stated, "It's not true, since the directives applied to all 27 EU
member states as well. And the WTO has issued a clearance [of the directives]."</P>
      <P>By launching the initiate, Europe is taking the lead to protect environment,
reduce resources  consumption  and promote energy efficiency. And it's being
recognized as the right thing to do, by the many countries copying the European
initiate, he said.</P>
      <P>Andrews is scheduled to speak at the 2007 Resource Recycling Forum, which is
taking place in Taipei from Oct. 3-5.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan issue becomes international one: president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 3 (CNA)
10/03/07  23:32:25
(By T.C. Jiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday that the Taiwan issue has become an
international one, as more than 140 countries discussed the country's U.N.
membership bid for four hours at the General Assembly for the first time this
year.</P>
      <P>The development shows that the government has adopted the right strategy in
launching its U.N. bid under the name Taiwan rather than the official title,
Republic of China, as in its previous 14 annual bids, and therefore captured
international attention, Chen added.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks during a meeting with members from Taiwan
chapters  of the  Kiwanis  International,  the  Rotary International, the Lions
Clubs International, and Junior Chamber International at the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the success of the U.N. bid cannot solely rely on the government
or the president alone, but rather requires a collective effort from public and
private sectors.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said that while the world community harshly condemns the
ruling military junta in Myanmar for bloody crackdowns on protests staged by
Myanmese civilians and Buddhist monks demanding democracy, China regarded the
crackdowns as the Southeast Asian country's "internal affairs" which it claimed
"does not adversely affect the regional peace."</P>
      <P>Chen expressed regret over China's remarks and said that it is hard to believe
that "different countries could have different understandings of universal
values, such as democracy and freedom."</P>
      <P>Universal  values should transcend national borders,  race, politics, and
political parties, Chen went on, adding that while many countries are imposing
sanctions on the Myanmese junta government, China chooses to take side with
violence.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that the planned referendum on whether to join the United Nations
under the name Taiwan is not intended to change the country's official title.</P>
      <P>Through the U.N. bid, the Taiwanese people wish to make their voices heard by
the international community, Chen said, adding that the world community now
increasingly understands the demands of local people.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of a recent survey, Chen said that a mere 3 percent of the
American people who responded to the survey have visited Taiwan, but up to 55
percent said that they support Taiwan becoming a U.N. member.</P>
      <P>The ratio would increase to over 70 percent if Taiwan passes a referendum to
back the U.N. bid next year, Chen continued. By then, U.S. lawmakers, the
government, or even the president would need to follow the mainstream public
opinion to throw support behind Taiwan's U.N. bid, he suggested.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan issue becomes international one: president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 3 (CNA)
10/04/07  10:21:35
(By T.C. Jiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday that the Taiwan issue has become an
international one, as more than 140 countries discussed the country's U.N.
membership bid for four hours at the General Assembly for the first time this
year.</P>
      <P>The development shows that the government has adopted the right strategy in
launching its U.N. bid under the name Taiwan rather than the official title,
Republic of China, as in its previous 14 annual bids, and therefore captured
international attention, Chen added.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks during a meeting with members from Taiwan
chapters  of the  Kiwanis  International,  the  Rotary International, the Lions
Clubs International, and Junior Chamber International at the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the success of the U.N. bid cannot solely rely on the government
or the president alone, but rather requires a collective effort from public and
private sectors.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said that while the world community harshly condemns the
ruling military junta in Myanmar for bloody crackdowns on protests staged by
Myanmese civilians and Buddhist monks demanding democracy, China regarded the
crackdowns as the Southeast Asian country's "internal affairs" which it claimed
"does not adversely affect the regional peace."</P>
      <P>Chen expressed regret over China's remarks and said that it is hard to believe
that "different countries could have different understandings of universal
values, such as democracy and freedom."</P>
      <P>Universal  values should transcend national borders,  race, politics, and
political parties, Chen went on, adding that while many countries are imposing
sanctions on the Myanmese junta government, China chooses to take side with
violence.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that the planned referendum on whether to join the United Nations
under the name Taiwan is not intended to change the country's official title.</P>
      <P>Through the U.N. bid, the Taiwanese people wish to make their voices heard by
the international community, Chen said, adding that the world community now
increasingly understands the demands of local people.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of a recent survey, Chen said that a mere 3 percent of the
American people who responded to the survey have visited Taiwan, but up to 55
percent said that they support Taiwan becoming a U.N. member.</P>
      <P>The ratio would increase to over 70 percent if Taiwan passes a referendum to
back the U.N. bid next year, Chen continued. By then, U.S. lawmakers, the
government, or even the president would need to follow the mainstream public
opinion to throw support behind Taiwan's U.N. bid, he suggested.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cloud Gate's 'Wild Cursive' receives full-house welcome in N.Y.</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cloud Gate Dance Theatre of Taiwan once again impressed audiences in New
York Tuesday evening with choreographer Lin Hwai-min's Chinese calligraphy
inspired production "Wild Cursive." The opening performance of the 25th Next
Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) received a full-house
welcome.</P>
      <P>"Wild Cursive" is the final chapter of Lin's trilogy. Inspired after studying
Chinese calligraphy masterpieces, Lin created the first installment of "Cursive"
in 2001.</P>
      <P>Lin told media in New York the process in producing the trilogy has much to do
with the development of the dancers. He said that training in martial arts, tai
chi tao yin, modern dance, ballet, meditation, and Chinese opera movements
enables the dancers to turn themselves into bodily brushes.</P>
      <P>In 2003, Cloud Gate opened the Melbourne International Arts Festival with
"Cursive II", winning both the Age Critics' Award and the Patrons' Award. In
2006, "Cursive: A Trilogy" was chosen as the best dance choreography of the year
as a result of critics' poll by Ballettanz and Theaterheute.</P>
      <P>Cloud Gate made its BAM Next Wave debut in 1995 with "Nine Songs".  In 2000,
the dance theater brought Hermann  Hesse's "Siddhartha" inspired "Songs of the
Wanderers" to the Next Wave, and again in 2003 was invited to present the
internationally-acclaimed "Moon Water" at the festival.</P>
      <P>Five performances of "Wild Cursive" at the BAM Howard Gilman Opera House are
scheduled on Oct. 2, and Oct. 4-7.</P>
      <P>A co-sponsor of the event, the Asia Society in New York, invited Lin Hwai-min to
speak on Cloud Gate and to give his views on choreography on Oct. 3. BAM has
also arranged "a dialogue with Lin Hwai-min" moderated by art critic Anna
Kisselgoff at the academy on Oct. 4.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice made public Wednesday a short anti-vote buying
commercial as part of its efforts to raise public awareness of irregularities in
the run-up to the Jan. 12 legislative polls.</P>
      <P>The commercial was screened at a news conference presided over by Justice
Minister Shih Mao-lin at the Baoan Temple in Taipei's Talungtung district.
Hundreds of Talung Elementary School pupils and residents in the nearby region
were invited to take part in the event. Schoolchildren chanted anti-vote buying
slogans to add fanfare and momentum to the activity.</P>
      <P>Shih told the audience that his ministry has started a campaign to fend off vote
buying and wipe out irregularities  as the legislative and presidential
elections approach, and reiterated that cash rewards for successful tips could
be as much as NT$10 million.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice has to date paid over NT$400 million (US$12.3 million)
in cash awards to informants, he noted.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, the Justice Ministry has tracked 27 and 1,624 vote-buying
cases related to the coming presidential and legislative elections,
respectively. Anyone caught buying votes could be jailed for three to 10 years,
he said, adding that the ministry is closely watching some 1,665 individuals who
might engage in vote-buying ahead of the two key elections.</P>
      <P>National Police Agency Director-General  Hou Yu-ih said in a meeting called
later the same day at the agency that police authorities across the country will
step up crackdown on gangsters and illegal weapon possession to maintain public
order and protect candidates' personal safety prior to the legislative and
presidential elections.</P>
      <P>In addition, Hou said, police will also go all out to eradicate vote-buying or
other activities that might upset the holding of free and fair elections and
their results.</P>
      <P>Competition among candidates in the Jan. 12, 2008 legislative election is
expected to be intense due to the adoption of a new "single-member constituency,
two-vote system" that will see the current number of legislative seats halved
from 225 to 113 in the new legislature.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President raps China for trying to bar intervention on Myanmar issue</HEADLINE>

10/04/07  15:24:42

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian condemned China Thursday for attempting to block
international intervention on the issue of Myanmar after the recent violent
crackdown on demonstrations against military rule in the Southeast Asian country
by calling the incident an "internal affair" of Myanmar.</P>
      <P>Chen said in the latest issue of his online newsletter that China's move to
define the incident as an "internal affair" of Myanmar is aimed at influencing
the international  community's perception  of the situation  in Myanmar and
exonerating  the Beijing-backed military junta.</P>
      <P>Most importantly, Beijing is trying to find a sound excuse to justify its "anti-
democracy, anti-freedom and anti-human rights" despotic governance of the
Chinese people, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Based on this reason, Chen continued, China has repeatedly emphasized that
"different countries" can adopt "different standards" for democracy, freedom and
human rights in an attempt to eliminate the universality of these values so as
to allow all dictators around the world to legitimize their despotism.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that China has continued to suppress dissidents, Falun Gong
followers and press freedom in the country, intimidate neighboring democracies,
including Taiwan, and secretly support dictatorial regimes in the rest of the
world, the president urged leading democracies in Europe and the Americas not to
deliberately use a looser standard in judging China.</P>
      <P>"We must again emphasize that there is only one standard for democracy, freedom
and human rights," Chen said.</P>
      <P>"Only if we courageously pinpoint the facts of China's violations against
democracy, freedom and human rights, condemn the acts, and sanction China for
them can we provide any protection to regional and international peace and
stability," he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that Western democracies' conniving at human rights abuses and
suppression of freedom by the Nazi and Fascist regimes in Europe during the
interwar years from 1921-1939 allowed these dictatorial regimes to become
powerful at a great cost to humanity, Chen said that history  has taught us that
"paying  no regard  to the disadvantaged is tantamount to nurturing evil."</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan,  as an emerging democracy, is willing to contribute to regional
and global peace and development based on the universal principles of democracy,
freedom and human rights.</P>
      <P>Also, Taiwan will closely monitor the developments in Myanmar and provide any
humanitarian assistance whenever necessary, the president said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Eighteen of Taiwan's diplomatic allies voiced support for Taiwan's membership
bid at the 62nd U.N. General Assembly session held Sept. 25 to Oct. 3, Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Top leaders of 17 of Taiwan's diplomatic allies -- namely Honduras, Paraguay, El
Salvador, Swaziland, Sao Tome and Principe, Nauru, Palau, Gambia, the Marshall
Islands, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Lucia, Saint Kitts and Nevis,
Tuvalu, the Solomon Islands, Burkina Faso, Belize, and Kiribati -- spoke in
support of Taiwan's U.N. membership bid during the session, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the first day of the debate session on Sept.25, Panamanian President
Martin Torrijos expressed concerns about the tension in the Taiwan Strait,
urging countries in areas that face security threats to take steps to alleviate
tensions and resolve disputes by peaceful means, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>In their speeches  delivered  during the debate  sessions, representatives of
the 17 countries, including several heads of state,  all pointed out that
Taiwan,  as an independent  and peace-loving sovereign state, is qualified to
become a U.N. member.</P>
      <P>They cried foul at the United Nations' exclusion of Taiwan, saying such unfair
treatment and discrimination should come to an end.</P>
      <P>Moreover, they criticized U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for failing to
impartially handle Taiwan's membership application in line with the U.N. Charter
and relevant meeting regulations. They also demanded that the United Nations
respond to the 23 million Taiwan people's aspiration and embrace Taiwan as a new
member.</P>
      <P>The leaders of Gambia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and the Solomon Islands
further urged the United Nations to take active steps to alleviate cross-strait
tensions and help hammer out a peaceful solution to the disputes between the two
sides.</P>
      <P>Among Taiwan's 24 diplomatic allies,  only five -- Haiti, Nicaragua, Guatemala,
the Dominican Republic and Malawi -- didn't speak up for Taiwan at this year's
U.N. General Assembly session. Taiwan's one other ally -- the Vatican -- is not
a U.N. member.</P>
      <P>The MOFA expressed its gratitude in a news release for the diplomatic allies'

    <HEADLINE>President to 'seriously consider' calls for him to serve as DPP head</HEADLINE>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian stopped short of saying Thursday that he would accept
the chairmanship of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, but he did say he
would "seriously consider" the matter.</P>
      <P>President Chen made the remarks after a meeting with local dignitaries and a
visit to a temple in Taipei County, one day after the DPP Central Standing
Committee "reluctantly"  accepted the resignation of DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun
and unanimously passed a resolution asking President Chen to assume the post.
Chen served as the party chairman between 2002-2004.</P>
      <P>Whether Chen will accept the post should become clear Friday when a provisional
DPP Central Executive Committee meeting is slated to be held. The participants
in the meeting are expected to unanimously urge Chen to take the party's helm.</P>
      <P>The president said he "does not know if [he] is capable of shouldering the
position of DPP chairmanship, " pointing out that it is "no easy job."</P>
      <P>Chen said that as the president, he is already shouldering a burden of a "weight
of 100 kg" and that if he is to concurrently serve as the DPP chairman, this
would require him to shoulder "another 100 kg."</P>
      <P>"If the party indeed expects me to shoulder the responsibility, I'll seriously
consider the matter," he said.</P>
      <P>He urged former Presidential Office Senior Advisor Koo Kuan-min to use his sway
with Yu to try to persuade the latter to stay on as chairman.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that he hopes Yu will stay on in the post, Chen said that if Yu is
willing to do so, then the DPP Central Executive Committee can still keep him.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yeh Chu-lan, secretary-general of the Presidential Office, said
Thursday that the president has heard the call of the DPP for him to take the
helm of the party but "has to take various things into consideration."</P>
      <P>"The president is now cautiously thinking about the matter, " Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Yu announced his decision to resign late last month after being indicted on
graft charges for his alleged misuse of a "special allowance fund" during his
terms as premier and as Presidential Office secretary-general.</P>
      <P>Despite calls for him to stay, he expressed that he was adamant about resigning
after his more radical version of the "normal country resolution" was voted down
at the party's national congress last Sunday.</P>
      <P>The version, which included the words "changing the country's title to 'Taiwan'
from the current Republic of China to declare to world that Taiwan is a
sovereign independent country, " failed to receive the support of more than half
of the congress delegates.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) aims to collect 2 million
signatures by the end of this month for the party's petition to hold a
referendum on Taiwan's U.N. membership bid, "in the hope that the number can be
recognized as a Guinness World Record," a DPP official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>So far,  917,000 people have signed the petition for the referendum on whether
to apply to join the United Nations under the name Taiwan, which is expected to
be held alongside the March 2008 presidential election,  according to DPP
Secretary-General  Lin Chia-lung.</P>
      <P>Lin said he has checked related documents and discovered that no referendum-
related records are listed in the Guinness World Records.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Taiwan has the world's highest threshold for the initiation of
referendums, Lin said the DPP will apply to have the signature number listed in
the annual reference book after the party achieves its goal of collecting 2
million signatures.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, 60 percent of people responding to a recent DPP-organized
opinion poll think the referendum is very important, compared with 30 percent
who think the referendum is not important.</P>
      <P>Also, the survey found that nearly 90 percent of the supporters of the "pan-
green camp" of the DPP and the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union are in favor
of the referendum and will turn out for the 2008 presidential election, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>The petition is the second phase of a procedure in which the DPP is required to
obtain the signatures of more than 5 percent of the number of eligible voters in
the last presidential election -- more than 825,359 -- after obtaining more than
0.5 percent of the number in the first phase.</P>
      <P>The DPP, which is determined to push for the referendum despite strong
opposition by the United States, had originally set its target at 1 million
signatures. However, the party's decision-making Central Standing Committee
officially  raised the target to 2 million Wednesday.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan has tried without success to have the United Nations consider the
issue of its representation since 1993, this year marks the first time the
country has applied to join the world body under the name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, following the return of Taiwan's application by the U.N. Secretariat
first in July and again in August, an item endorsed by 17 of Taiwan's diplomatic
allies asking the United Nations to address Taiwan's membership application has
also been excluded from the agenda of the 62nd session of the General Assembly.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has projected the annual output value of
Taiwan's textile industry for 2015 at NT$580 billion (US$17.75  billion)  and
has suggested development directions such as innovation for the industry,
according to Economic Minister Steve R.L. Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks Wednesday at the opening ceremony of the Textile
International Forum and Exhibition 2007 in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>He said textile products should focus on being innovative, functional,
industrial and with high added value if they are to create more business
opportunities.</P>
      <P>The output value of the textile industry for 2006 reached NT$460 billion, with
the textile trade surplus reaching US$9 billion, Chen said,  adding that
Taiwan's  textile industry  has made great contributions to the nation's
economic development.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should enforce its competitiveness through innovation and good market
segmentation to counter the impact of cheap products from emerging countries,
Chen said.</P>

      <P>A former Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MOJIB) officer who fled the
country in June this year was repatriated from Malaysia Thursday.</P>
      <P>Ou Tsung-jung, formerly an investigator with the MOJIB Taipei Office, was
indicted by Taipei District Prosecutors' Office on charges of corruption,
embezzlement and theft in late 2001 after he was discovered to have stolen 34
antiques or artifacts owned by former Kuomintang Legislator Wu Tse-yuan.</P>
      <P>Wu was indicted in 1996 on charges of corruption related to two graft cases
involving the building of two waste water processing plants in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>At the time, Ou was one of the MOJIB investigators responsible for Wu's cases.
In November 1996, the investigators searched Wu's residence and removed 77
antiques, bronzes, ivory carvings and other artifacts as evidence.</P>
      <P>In March 2001 after his indictment, Wu demanded the return of all his property.
The MOJIB Taipei Office checked the items and found that 34 were missing.</P>
      <P>Ou's colleagues than searched Ou's residence and discovered the missing items,
along with checks and IOUs that Ou embezzled from other cases he had handled.</P>
      <P>After he was given a prison term of five years and four months for graft,
embezzlement and theft in late 2001, Ou appealed. Judges from the Supreme Court
upheld the sentence.</P>
      <P>Ou again appealed, and in June this year, the National Police Agency was
informed that Ou had fled the country, together with his family, for Malaysia
using passports from Belize.</P>
      <P>The National Police Agency then informed the Malaysian police, who in turn
apprehended Ou Oct. 1 on an expired visa.</P>

      <P>The opposition Kuomintang's vice presidential candidate, Vincent Siew, visited
the U.S. Congress on the first day of his visit to America, with an aim of
strengthening bilateral relations, the party's representative in Washington,
D.C. said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Jason Yuan said Siew met with 18 senators, including Chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee Carl Levin, Chairman of the Committee  on Homeland
Security and Governmental  Affairs Joe Lieberman, and Sen. Mitch McConnell, the
Republican minority leader.</P>
      <P>The senators stated that they expect Taiwan will act as a peacemaker in the
Asia-Pacific area and take pragmatic measures to maintain regional peace across
the Taiwan Strait, Yuan said.</P>
      <P>Siew replied that the KMT understands their concerns and will act responsibly
instead of acting as a "troublemaker, " if victorious in the upcoming elections.</P>
      <P>The House Committee on Foreign Affairs held a welcome party for Siew the same
day, which was attended by 24 House members, including the committee's Chairman
Tom Lantos, Co-Chairman of the House Congressional Taiwan Caucus Steve Chabot,
and senior Republican Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, as well as House
Majority Leader Steny Hoyer.</P>
      <P>They all praised Taiwan's freedom and democracy, and agreed that the Taiwanese
people have the right to decide their future.</P>
      <P>Siew introduced the KMT's political vision to the senators, congressmen and
congresswomen, and said that the KMT supports Taiwan's purchase of F-16 C/D jet
fighters from America. He added that both Taiwan's ruling and opposition parties
hope the U.S. government would consent to the deal.</P>
      <P>Lantos and Ros-Lehtinen  both mentioned that the House of Representatives
unanimously passed Resolution 676 the day before, declaring that the United
States,  consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act, will make available to Taiwan
articles and services necessary to maintaining a self-sufficient defense
capacity.</P>
      <P>Siew told reporters that the warm welcome he received in America is indicative
of the good friendship between Taiwan and America, and has also indicated that
the United States pays great attention to bilateral relations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Hong Kong experience provides an undesirable and unacceptable model for
Taiwan given that Hong Kong's records on human rights, freedom, and democracy
have worsened since its handover to China in 1997, Taiwan's representative to
the United States Joseph Wu said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wu was responding  to a question from the audience after delivering a speech at
the Leadership Institute, a Virginia-based organization which provides seminars
and workshops to conservatives in the U.S.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the Chinese government has been touting the "one country, two
systems" model of Hong Kong to Taiwan in its campaign to make the island accept
unification with China.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Taiwanese people are resisting China for two reasons -- the
wealth gap between the two sides, as well as China's totalitarian political
system.</P>
      <P>Wu said he believes that if China turns itself into another U.S. or the United
Kingdom, it would encounter less resistance from the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said if China is to become a democracy like the U.S., it will need
to learn to respect the will of the Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>In addition, Wu said that Taiwan is a de facto independent country, even though
the U.S. does not recognize the country's statehood.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan enjoys a vigorous democracy and a brisk economy, people in the country
think that they are entitled to be a member of the international organizations,
Wu said.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan has been barred from joining the United Nations and the World
Health Organization, which he said is "unfair to Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Wu blasted China for relentlessly oppressing Taiwan and for claiming that Taiwan
is a part of China, which he said threatens Taiwan's participation in the world
community.</P>
      <P>Noting that China has continued to provide assistance  to dictatorships,
including North Korea, Myanmar, and Iran, Wu said that China does not simply
pose a threat to Taiwan but also creates problems for other democratic
countries.</P>
      <P>As China is expanding its military clout, and thus escalates tensions in East
Asia, enhanced cooperation between Taiwan, Japan, and the U.S. is needed to
ensure security in the region, Wu went on.</P>
      <P>Saying that there are frequent exchanges between Taiwan and the U.S., Wu noted
that Taiwanese people share a similar mentality with their American
counterparts.</P>
      <P>However, Wu noted that recently the U.S. government's image has not been very
good in Taiwan as it opposes the Taiwan government's push for the country's bid
to enter the U.N. under the name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of a recent survey, he said that 16.8 percent of the survey
respondents consider the U.S. government to be "friendly," indicating that the
ratio saw a drop from last year's 32.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the U.S. government could improve its image in Taiwan by granting
visa-free access to Taiwanese people, allowing the use of Taiwanese driving
licenses in the U.S., signing a free tree agreement with Taiwan, selling more
defensive weapons to Taiwan, and strongly supporting Taiwan's participation in
the international community.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan maintains a good relationship with the U.S., there are some
limits for Taiwan, Wu noted, giving an example that on his own name card, he is
not called "Taiwan's Representative" but "Representative of the Taipei Economic
and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO)."</P>
      <P>As a result, he is sometimes regarded as a company's sales representative and
has even been asked what product he sells, according to Wu.</P>
      <P>We said that there are also many restrictions on the broadcasting of Taiwan's
national anthem and the display of the country's national flag in the U.S., and
"that hurts sometimes," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Thursday that President Chen Shui-
bian will not address the National Day rally in front of the Presidential Office
this year.</P>
      <P>Wang, the chief organizer of the National Day celebration ceremony, said that
the Presidential Office has given notice that the president will not address the
rally and that the message he wants to deliver to the nation will be expressed
in a meeting held within the Presidential Office prior to the rally.</P>
      <P>The practice of the president addressing the National Day rally has been
observed for years.</P>
      <P>However, last year, as the president was addressing the rally, opposition
legislators sitting on the two sides of the grandstands unfurled red banners and
flashed 'thumbs down" signs to show their support for an ongoing campaign to
depose the president over a spate of corruption allegations against his family
members and close aides, their actions prompted the president to suggest that
the rally be scrapped in 2007.</P>
      <P>Wang said that he will address the rally and then enter the Presidential  Office
to invite  the president  to join rally participants and observe the
performances.</P>
      <P>Wang also said that in respect to the rally's host -- the Presidential Office --
a publicity board bearing the slogan on Taiwan's bid to U.N. membership in front
of the Presidential Office will not be removed.</P>
      <P>Noting that last year protesters from the "Million Voices Against Corruption"
campaign disrupted National Day celebration activities, he expressed hope that
they will observe order and not disturb the progression of celebration
activities this year.</P>
      <P>The "National Defense Show" arranged by the Ministry of the National Defense
(MND) is expected to be the main attraction of the rally, which will be run from
9 a.m. till noon.</P>
      <P>The MND has mobilized 2,300 military personnel, 71 fighter planes and various
armored vehicles for the show, although the long-range Hsiungfeng missiles,
which reportedly could hit targets in China, will not be on display.</P>
      <P>The planes will pass the Presidential Office in flying formation to kick off
this part of the show. Marching bands will then lead military  personnel  to
display various kinds of weaponry and equipment, culminating with elite
parachutists gliding down Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential
Office.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) ordered Thursday that a batch of live crabs
imported from India be destroyed after it was discovered that they contained
residue of the forbidden antibiotic nitrofurans, a DOH official said that same
day.</P>
      <P>Officials from the DOH Bureau of Food Safety said that 384 kgs of live crabs,
imported from India by a company in Taipei County, had been found to contain
nitrofuran metabolites -- substances that indicate use of the drug.</P>
      <P>The concentration of nitrofuran metabolites detected in the Indian crabs stood
at 5.4 ppb,  in contravention of Taiwan's regulations, which allow no nitrofuran
metabolites in any seafood produce, regardless of whether it is imported or
locally-produced.</P>
      <P>The officials said that consumers can be at ease as none of this batch of live
crabs from India had been distributed on the domestic market.</P>
      <P>In the wake of this finding, the DOH has increased the inspection rate of India-
imported live crabs from 5 to 20 percent, the officials said.</P>

      <P>The most important aspect that the experience of German unification might offer
Taiwan is that there was not a single incident of bloodshed, a visiting German
professor said Thursday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"There was not a drop of blood shed during the process of German unification. I
think it's the most important part of the experience," said Rudolph Wagner, a
professor at Germany's Heidelberg University and one of the most respected
sinologists in Europe, during a roundtable with press.</P>
      <P>Wagner is scheduled  to deliver a speech,  titled "German Unification: Popular
Culture, Maoist Students, and the Socialist Disneyland, " Saturday in an
international lecture series organized by Lung Yingtai Cultural Foundation.</P>
      <P>The background to and process of German unification was unique, as is the Taiwan
Strait issue, which is why the experience cannot be duplicated, he said, adding
that it's not suitable to compare these two cases.</P>
      <P>Most West German citizens neither talked about unification, nor saw it coming
six weeks before the 1989 unification. In fact, it was East German citizens who
pushed for unification. And the German unification essentially defied post-Cold
War common sense, which postulated that continued separation, rather than
unification, was more likely he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Wagner described German unification as an "accident" of history amid the
unpredictable and rapid changing international situation of the late 1980s.</P>
      <P>"Wait for the historical moment, then something will happen, " he said in a
comment on the future of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>With a Ph.D. from the University of Munich, Wagner has done extensive research
on Buddhism, Taoist philosophy, and contemporary Chinese politics and the media.
In 1992, he was awarded the Leibniz Prize, Europe's most prestigious prize in

      <P>Ma Ying-jeou, presidential candidate of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), was
visibly furious Thursday when he and his entourage  were barred from visiting
Taoyuan International Airport's second terminal because of what he termed
"pressure" from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government.</P>
      <P>Ma, former KMT chairman, was to tour the terminal before announcing his new
aviation policy but had to change his schedule after being told by airport
authorities that he was not allowed to engage in political activities in the
terminal.</P>
      <P>"Let everyone see the ugly face the DPP government. The ruling party is using
such acts against an opposition candidate. They will get what they deserve, and
we will see about that," he told reporters.</P>
      <P>"They can prevent me entering the airport, but they cannot stop me from pushing
for reform," he added.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Taoyuan County Magistrate Chu Li-lun, Ma proceeded to visit a
free trade zone managed by the Farglory Group and hear a briefing on its plan to
attract international companies to set up offices in the zone.</P>
      <P>When told that according to international surveys the Taoyuan International
Airport now ranks 85th among the world's 136 major airports and 20th among 27
airports in Asia, Ma appeared saddened, saying, "It makes me so angry that I
feel like crying."</P>
      <P>He deplored that the Taoyuan airport, which used to be Taiwan's pride, has now
become a symbol of backwardness.</P>
      <P>"Simply by changing the airport's name from Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport to Taoyuan International Airport will not bring better luck," he said,
adding, "Only by pushing reform and replacing the ruling party will the nation
see better luck."</P>

      <P>Germany's tragic experience of nationalism spanning from 1930s to 1940s offers
something for Taiwan and China to consider as a responsible government should be
more rational than its citizens, a visiting German professor said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Germans abandoned their "nationalism dream" after the nightmare of the Nazi era
and World War II, which provide them with a better reading of nationalism, said
Rudolph Wagner, a professor at Germany's Heidelberg University.</P>
      <P>Responding to a reporter's question about the development of nationalism on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait, especially in China, Wagner said that the Chinese
government is very much aware of the dangers of whipping up nationalistic fever.</P>
      <P>China has used nationalism as a political tactic against other countries, such
as Japan, but always knows when to stop and pull people out of the streets
because it is a two-sided blade which might very well turn against the Communist
government itself, he said.</P>
      <P>"Neither China nor Taiwan has anything to gain [from whipping up nationalism], "
he claimed.</P>
      <P>Wagner said he didn't want to elaborate on Taiwan's situation since he is not an
expert, and the future of any country is difficult to predict. However, he noted
that there are many things happening simultaneously  in Taiwan right now,
including  Taiwan's huge investment in China and the call to normalize Taiwan's
status as an independent country.</P>
      <P>"A responsible government has to be more rational than its citizens, " he said,
adding that a responsible government will not tolerate age-long political or
military standoff.</P>
      <P>Wagner is scheduled  to deliver a speech,  titled "German Unification: Popular

      <P>The presidential candidate of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Thursday that
if elected president in 2008, he will develop Taoyuan International Airport and
its peripheral areas into an "aviation city."</P>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou told reporters that his plan would incorporate 6,150 hectares  of
adjacent  land  with  the airport  and encourage transportation, trade and
entertainment operators to form a "Taoyuan Aviation City."</P>

Sungshan Airport,  Chingchuankang Airport in Taichung, Kaohsiung Hsiaokang

will focus on conducting marine resources survey, research, conservation,
management as well as manpower cultivation, eco-tourism development and raising
public awareness of marine life conservation.</P>
      <P>The Dongsha Atoll National Park, covering the Dongsha Island along with two
coral reefs completely submerged at high tide -- the Beiwei Bank (also known as
the North Vereker Bank) and the Nanwei Bank (or South Vereker Bank) -- is
located 240 nautical miles southwest of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The government constructed a national monument on the island June 30, 1989 and
an adjacent structure to protect the monument May 18, 1993, to assert its
sovereignty over the archipelago.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a marine national park administration has become urgent
because the marine resources and natural ecology in the area have been gravely
damaged over the past decade due to rampant poaching by fishermen using
destructive fishing methods such as poison and explosives, an Interior Ministry
official said.</P>
      <P>According to government data, the Dongsha islands cover an area of 350,000
hectares, with atolls accounting for 80,000 hectares.</P>
      <P>Noting that the islands cover an area three times that of Taipei City, the
official said the archipelago boasts the largest and most unspoiled group of
atolls in the West Pacific.</P>
      <P>With their unique maritime eco-system, the official said, the coral reefs
surrounding the islands are the best in Taiwan's territorial waters. Dongsha's
coastal waters are also known for their biodiversity, with 489 fish species and
about 200 coral strains documented, as well as numerous other marine species.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the official went on, it has become urgently necessary
for the government to set up a marine national park administration to better
protect and conserve the natural ecology of the area.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU lawmakers call for 'pan-green' integration</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 4 (CNA)

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), an ally of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) in the "pan-green" camp, urged President Chen Shui-bian Thursday to
help integrate the two parties ahead of two key elections should he decide to
assume the DPP chairmanship.</P>
      <P>TSU legislative caucus whip Lo Chih-ming and party lawmakers, including Ho Ming-
hao, Tseng Tsahn-deng and Lin Chih-chia, issued the call at a Legislative Yuan
news conference to display their support for DPP presidential candidate Frank
Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun offered to resign from the DPP's top post late last month after his
indictment over alleged misuse of special allowance funds set aside for his
discretionary use during his tenures as premier and as Presidential Office
secretary-general.</P>
      <P>Yu insisted on stepping down from the DPP chairmanship despite Chen's efforts to
persuade him to stay on the post, and reiterated that he fully backs Chen to
concurrently serve as DPP chairman.</P>
      <P>The DPP's Central Standing Committee (CSC) agreed to Yu's resignation and
approved a proposal to invite Chen to assume party chairmanship at its weekly
meeting Wednesday. According to CSC members, the party's Central Executive
Committee will formally announce Chen's chairmanship in a Friday meeting.</P>
      <P>As President Chen is almost certain to assume DPP chairmanship, Lo urged Chen to
swiftly resolve fractional disputes within the DPP and mend its differences with
the TSU so as to score a "pan-green" victory in the coming legislative and
presidential elections.</P>
      <P>Lo asserted that the TSU will firmly back Hsieh in the March 22 presidential
election and urged Chen to take concrete action to step up DPP-TSU cooperation
in order not to upset the "pan-green" camp's overall chances.</P>
      <P>According to Tseng, "pan-green" grassroots backers are deeply concerned that
DPP's internal strife might affect the pan-greens' chances in the coming two
elections. He called on Chen to quickly coordinate and arrange mutual
cooperation to secure "pan-green" electoral victory after he assumes DPP
chairmanship.</P>
      <P>Chen's takeover of the DPP chairmanship would provide a new opportunity for the
two parties to re-unite and maintain the DPP's grip on power, Lin said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>German nationalism history something for Taiwan, China to consider</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Germany's tragic experience of nationalism spanning from 1930s to 1940s offers
something for Taiwan and China to consider as a responsible government should be
more rational than its citizens, a visiting German professor said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Germans abandoned their "nationalism dream" after the nightmare of the Nazi era
and World War II, which provide them with a better reading of nationalism, said
Rudolph Wagner, a professor at Germany's Heidelberg University.</P>
      <P>Responding to a reporter's question about the development of nationalism on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait, especially in China, Wagner said that the Chinese
government is very much aware of the dangers of whipping up nationalistic fever.</P>
      <P>China has used nationalism as a political tactic against other countries, such
as Japan, but always knows when to stop and pull people out of the streets
because it is a two-sided blade which might very well turn against the Communist
government itself, he said.</P>
      <P>"Neither China nor Taiwan has anything to gain [from whipping up nationalism], "
he claimed.</P>
      <P>Wagner said he didn't want to elaborate on Taiwan's situation since he is not an
expert, and the future of any country is difficult to predict. However, he noted
that there are many things happening simultaneously  in Taiwan right now,
including  Taiwan's huge investment in China and the call to normalize Taiwan's
status as an independent country.</P>
      <P>"A responsible government has to be more rational than its citizens, " he said,
adding that a responsible government will not tolerate age-long political or
military standoff.</P>
      <P>Wagner is scheduled  to deliver a speech,  titled "German Unification: Popular
Culture, Maoist Students, and the Socialist Disneyland, " Saturday in an
international lecture series organized by Lung Yingtai Cultural Foundation.</P>
      <P>With a Ph.D. from the University of Munich, Wagner has done extensive research
on Buddhism, Taoist philosophy, and contemporary Chinese politics and the media.
In 1992, he was awarded the Leibniz Prize, the most prestigious European prize
in the humanities.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The presidential candidate of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Thursday that
if elected president in 2008, he will develop Taoyuan International Airport and
its peripheral areas into an "aviation city."</P>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou told reporters that his plan would incorporate 6,150 hectares  of
adjacent  land  with  the airport  and encourage transportation, trade and
entertainment operators to form a "Taoyuan Aviation City."</P>
      <P>The former KMT chairman stressed that to implement the plan, Taiwan will have to
allow direct transportation links with China -- a policy which he said is
unlikely under the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government, no matter who
in the DPP becomes president.</P>
      <P>Ma said that if he wins the 2008 election, he will allow direct flights  between
China and four airports  in Taiwan:  Taoyuan International Airport,  Taipei
Sungshan Airport,  Chingchuankang Airport in Taichung, Kaohsiung Hsiaokang
International Airport.</P>
      <P>His plan will also see a third terminal at the Taoyuan airport completed in 2018
to meet increased passenger and cargo volumes.</P>
      <P>In addition, he added, Keelung Port, Taichung Port and Chiayi County's Putai
Port will open for direct shipping to China.</P>

      <P>The government opened a marine national park office in the southern port city of
Kaohsiung Thursday to signify its determination to protect the oceans and their
marine inhabitants.</P>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Lee Yi-yang and Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu jointly
presided over a nameplate unveiling ceremony for the Marine National Park
Headquarters (MNPH) , located in Metropolitan Park in downtown Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Initially, Lee said, the MNPH will administer the country's first marine
national park, namely the Dongsha Atoll National Park in the South China Sea.</P>
      <P>In the future, Lee said, the ministry's Construction and Planning Agency will
evaluate the feasibility of designating several scenic outlying islands, such as
Green Island, Penghu Islands and three islets off northern Taiwan coast, as
marine national parks to better manage and conserve marine resources in those
areas.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of National Defense activated emergency response operations Friday
to deal with Typhoon Krosa which has continued on its forecast course toward
Taiwan and is expected to increase in intensity to become a "super typhoon" by

    <TEXT>Los Angeles TimesG Child health veto risky to both parties.

With his long-promised veto Wednesday of a bill to expand health insurance for
children, President Bush has ignited an ideological battle that could well rage
on onto next year's presidential campaign. The GOP may be seen as heartless.
Democrat's uncompromising pursuit of the bill could derail bipartisan support.

    <HEADLINE>People urged to wash hands often to avoid pinkeye amid outbreak</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of Health urged
people Friday to wash their hands regularly to avoid being infected with
conjunctivitis, commonly known as pinkeye.</P>
      <P>Responding to newspaper reports Friday that pinkeye has spread rapidly
islandwide in recent days, particularly in the northern city of Keelung  and the
southern  county  of Yunlin,  CDC Deputy Director-General Shih Wen-yi said that
to avoid being infected, people should wash their hands often and avoid rubbing
their eyes.</P>
      <P>Shih said that since the conjunctivitis outbreak has not been declared an
epidemic, the CDC is unable to determine exactly how many people in the country
have been infected. However, he added that the center has been told by hospitals
that the number of pinkeye patients has increased rapidly over the past several
days.</P>
      <P>Shih further said that the center has already contacted the Ministry of
Education and epidemiologists to work out measures to cope with the situation
and informed hospitals under the direct jurisdiction of the Department of Health
to take measures to prevent a further spread of the disease.</P>
      <P>Noting that the last time that a pinkeye outbreak occurred in Taiwan was in the
1970s and that it was the result of enterovirus type S70, Shih said that this
time around, the outbreak also seems to have been caused by enterovirus.</P>
      <P>Lu Tah-wen, director of the the Ophthalmology Department of Tri-Service  General
Hospital,  said that pinkeye is a highly contagious epidemic disease which can
be caused by infections (such as bacteria and viruses), allergies, or substances
that irritate the eyes, but that judging from recent cases he has treated, he
believes that the current pinkeye outbreak is related mainly to enterovirus.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chiu Hsiao-wen, deputy director of Yunlin County's Bureau of
Education, discounted a China Times report Friday that over 1,000 people in
Yunlin have been infected, saying that as of Friday morning, the bureau had not
been notified by any school in the county of an outbreak of the disease.</P>
      <P>Kao Kun-yu, an official with the Yunlin County Bureau of Health, also said
Friday that as of noon, his bureau had not received any requests from any
schools or the Yunlin Bureau of Education for help regarding a pinkeye outbreak.</P>
      <P>Kao called for students, particularly young kids, and all members of the public
to seek medical aid if they are infected with pinkeye -- an inflammation of the
conjunctiva, the clear membrane that covers the white part of the eye and the
inner surface of the eyelids.</P>
      <P>To avoid being infected, Kao said, kids should be taught to wash their hands
often with water and soap. They also should not share eye droppers, tissues,
wash cloths, towels, or pillowcases with other people, Kao added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The outstanding debt of over one year of all the governments at all levels in
Taiwan had reached NT$4.19 trillion (US$126.96 billion) as of the end of last
year, the nation's top auditing official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Auditor-General Lin Ching-long made the remarks while giving an auditing report
on the central government's revenue and expenditures as well as on a special
fund for the expansion of investment in infrastructure projects in 2006.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the central government's revenue in 2006 totaled NT$1.54 trillion,
or NT$161.7 billion higher than the original estimate, while expenditures
amounted to NT$1.52 trillion, or NT$41.8 billion less than the original
estimate.</P>
      <P>He noted that the government has been unable to balance its budget in recent
years and has had to rely on issuing government bonds and borrowing to tide over
its financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that the central government has appropriated funds to repay its debt
every year over the past five years but has not been able to repay the total
amount owed each year.</P>
      <P>Adding to the central government's financial woes has been the high level of tax
evasion, the slow progress in privatization of state-owned enterprises, as well
as the worsening financial situation of the nation's health insurance system, he
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH to probe use of bovine bone-based material in dental treatment</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) pledged Friday to step up its inspections
concerning the illegal use of bovine bone-based material in dental implant
surgery, amid fears that such material may have been imported from mad cow
disease-affected areas.</P>
      <P>Liu Li-ling, deputy chief of the DOH's Bureau of Medical Affairs, pointed out
that medical devices made from bovine bone are currently forbidden in the
country unless they are sent to the DOH for inspection in advance and obtain a
permit from the department.</P>
      <P>As no permits have been issued by the department so far, it is safe to say that
any bovine bone-based medical devices currently available on the market are
illegal, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks in response to a claim by opposition Kuomintang Legislator
Chu Chun-hsiao that approximately 30 percent of dental clinics in the country
use bone graft material made of bovine bone from mad cow disease-affected
countries, such as the United States, a practice which the legislator said
exposes patients to the risk of being infected with the deadly disease.</P>
      <P>In some cases, bone grafting is required in dental implant treatment, and bovine
bone is one of the options for bone expletive substances in the process that is
aimed at regenerating lost bone and tissue to create a better quality bone site
for the implantation.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, anyone who is caught manufacturing, importing, selling or
supplying unlicensed medical devices will be subject to imprisonment of up to
three years and a maximum fine of NT$100,000.</P>
      <P>Lu said that members of the general public can call the DOH's hot line at
0800-625748 to report any such activities.</P>
      <P>Peng Ming-hsing, a section chief at the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
Inspection and Quarantine's Animal Quarantine Division, said that although there
has not been any evidence showing that using bone material from animals infected
with mad cow disease in bone grafting will transmit the disease to the
receivers, the government should still deal with the issue carefully  to
minimize  the possibility of infection among the country's citizens.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Typhoon Krosa approaching Taiwan at declining speed: CWB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 5 (CNA)
10/05/07  16:52:55
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Typhoon Krosa has been declining in speed as it moves toward Taiwan, a
meteorologist for the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) said Friday, attributing this
to the effects of a weak Pacific high pressure system.</P>
      <P>Tsai Fu-tien, an official responsible for weather forecasts at the CWB, said
that as Krosa approaches Taiwan, it will decrease in speed. He predicted that
when the strong typhoon gets close to the island, it will turn north and drop
further in speed, describing the situation as a moving car which slows down as
it enters a curve.</P>
      <P>Now, the challenge in predicting the typhoon's impact on Taiwan is to calculate
how weak the Pacific high pressure is -- the key factor that influences a
typhoon's direction of movement, according to Tsai. He added that the typhoon
may either pass across the northern part of Taiwan or make landfall in the
eastern region.</P>
      <P>How the typhoon will affect Taiwan depends on where it lands, the meteorologist
said, noting that the CWB meteorologists will not be able to determine how much
of an effect the typhoon will have on the island until it gets closer.</P>
      <P>Krosa was upgraded to a typhoon from a tropical storm on Tuesday, and since
then, it has been moving northwest at 16 kph. On Thursday night, the typhoon's
speed had decreased to 10 kph, according to the CWB.</P>
      <P>At 2 p.m. Friday, Krosa was centered 430 km east-southeast of Oluanpi -- the
southernmost tip of Taiwan, moving northwesterly at 14 kph toward the island and
packing maximum sustained winds of 184 kph.</P>
      <P>Affected by the outer edge of the typhoon, most of Taiwan is expected to
experience showers Friday, with the chance of rain registering 90-100 percent in
the northern and northeastern regions, 40-60 percent in the central and southern
regions, and 7 percent in the southeastern region, according to the CWB.</P>
      <P>The CWB predicted that the rainfall brought about by Typhoon Krosa in
mountainous areas over the next few days is likely to reach 800-1,100 mm in the
northern and northeastern regions, 200-400 mm in Taitung, 600-800 mm in the
central region, 300-500 mm in Tainan, and 200-400 mm in Kaohsiung and Pingtung.</P>
      <P>In low lying areas, rainfall is expected to amount to 300-500 mm in the northern
region, 400-600 mm in the northeastern region, 200-300 mm in central Taiwan, and
80-150 mm in the south.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Court rejects president's bid to reclaim evidence</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei District Court Friday turned down a request by President Chen Shui-
bian to reclaim materials held by prosecutors as evidence in his "state affairs
fund" case, which were recently proclaimed by the president to be "absolute
secrets."</P>
      <P>The court ruled that the process in which the materials were proclaimed as
"absolute secrets" involved "serious, obvious flaws" and should be regarded as
invalid.</P>
      <P>According to current law, President Chen is eligible to appeal against the
district court ruling.</P>
      <P>On Sept. 6, Chen petitioned the court to return invoices, vouchers,  magnetic
records,  written  testimony  by concerned individuals and data related to six
secret diplomatic missions that are used by prosecutors as evidence in the case,
on the grounds that the materials have been proclaimed as "absolute secrets."</P>
      <P>The president made the move after the Council of Grand Justices confirmed June
15 the president's constitutional right to decide what is a state secret and his
right to refuse to disclose such information.</P>
      <P>However, the court determined Friday that Chen lacks any reason or legal basis
to ask for the return of the materials because the president's privilege to
refuse to give testimony and produce evidence should be exercised before, not
after, the testimony is given and the evidence submitted.</P>
      <P>On Chen's claim that the materials were seized by the prosecutors without a
warrant, the court noted that the seizure was carried out based on a warrant
issued by the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office.</P>
      <P>Further rebutting Chen's claim that the materials were held without his consent,
the court said the invoices and vouchers were taken away with the consent of the
head of the Presidential Office's accounting department, because the department,
not Chen, was the keeper of the invoices and vouchers.</P>
      <P>Also, the data regarding the six secret diplomatic missions was submitted to the
prosecutors by presidential aide Lin Te-hsun after obtaining Chen's approval,
the court said.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Chen did not insist that the withheld materials were state
secrets when receiving questioning by prosecutors last year, the court claimed
that the president's move to proclaim the materials as "absolute secrets" only
during the final stage of the trial was "aimed merely at covering up the
administrative negligence and even irregularities" of the defendants.</P>
      <P>The court added that the move, which was not intended to protect national
security or national interests, violates the State Secrets Protection Act and
should be considered unlawful.</P>
      <P>According to the court, the president's "state secrets privilege" is part of
executive power and should be exercised in accordance with the State Secrets
Protection Act and subject to scrutiny by the judiciary.</P>
      <P>The prosecution named Chen as a "joint perpetrator" while indicting first lady
Wu Shu-jen on charges of corruption and forgery Nov. 3, 2006, after determining
she had used receipts provided by others to claim reimbursements totaling
NT$14.8 million (US$450,000) from the president's "state affairs fund" between
July 2002 and March 2006.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that none of the money went into his own pocket, claiming it was
necessary to use receipts from different individuals to muster the funds to
engage in secret diplomatic missions in certain  countries  because of the
confusing  and inconsistent accounting system governing expenditures by the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>However, the Taipei District Court ruled Jan. 19 that the six diplomatic
missions cited by the president as having drawn on the state affairs fund were
not secret as the president claimed, and should be disclosed in court
proceedings.</P>

      <P>The Double Ten National Day is the best time for the country to demonstrate its
determination in bidding for U.N. membership, a legislative caucus whip of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wang Tuoh made the remarks at a press conference at the Legislative
Yuan while explaining why no placards carrying words of "celebration for the
Republic of China National Day" were erected on the tower building of the
Presidential Office this year, as is usually the case.</P>
      <P>It's the first time since the seat of the ROC government was relocated to the
island in 1949 that the tower building will not be decorated with festive
placards of this kind.</P>
      <P>Wang said it is more important to reflect the "essential problem" of Taiwan's
absence in the United Nations in the celebration of the country's National Day
than to highlight the festivity.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, the chief organizer of the official
National Day celebration ceremony, said Thursday that President Chen Shui-bian
will not address the National Day rally in front of the Presidential Office this
year, and that the Taiwan U.N. bid banners hung on the front of the office will
not be replaced by those traditionally hung for the ROC National Day
celebration, respecting request of the Presidential Office -- the rally's host.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the message President Chen wants to deliver to the nation will be
expressed in a meeting held within the Presidential Office prior to the rally,
despite long observance of the practice of the president addressing the National
Day rally.</P>
      <P>Regarding the name "ROC", which was replaced by the slogan of "Taiwan joins the
U.N." in National  Day decorations  on the Presidential Office, Ma Ying-jeou,
the presidential candidate of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , said that
concealing the country's formal designation on the National Day is "obviously
not respectful of the country."</P>
      <P>Ma also said that he will not take part in the National Day rally in front of
the President Office because he did not receive an invitation from the host.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung revealed his intention of "no show" at the
rally due to the controversial banner decorating the Presidential Office.</P>

      <P>Lin stated that more and more local governments are sponsoring ever larger-scale

spend more than NT$4 million (US$121,210) sponsoring large-scale tourism

      <P>A new business alliance grouping a noted hotel, a travel agency and a local
medicine association announced a joint program Friday to promote Taiwan's travel
medicine.</P>
      <P>It is the first time that the three industries have joined together to work to
promote travel medicine, the market for which, according to estimates by the
Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development, could be worth NT$7
billion (US$220 million) per year.</P>
      <P>Under the program, Grand Hotel and the Taipei-based Asia-Pacific Society of
Travel Medicine (ASTM) will cooperate in promoting travel medicine packages to
attract foreign visitors for both pleasure and medical purposes.</P>
      <P>The cost of a specially designed four-day medicinal tour being programmed is
estimated to be worth NT$30,000 - NT$60,000, and it includes a three-hour health
checkup. An anti-oxidation treatment course, skin care and a magnetic wave face
lift session will also be available.</P>
      <P>Customers will be accommodated in the Grand Hotel in Taipei and spend their
leisure time visiting local tourists spots, such as Taipei 101 Tower and the
National Palace Museum.</P>
      <P>ASTM Director Shieh Ying-hua said at a news conference that Taiwan's medical
services rank among the best in Asia,  with relatively low costs.</P>
      <P>Citing Thailand as an example, Shieh said, foreign nationals paid some 730,000
travel medicine visits to the Southeast Asian country in 2003, and the number
further grew by 16 percent in 2005.</P>
      <P>Although Thailand, Singapore, South Korea and India have engaged in travel
medicine for years, Shieh said he believes that Taiwan stands a good chance of
attracting a considerable number of foreign visitors for travel medicine thanks
to the superior medical care and treatment available.</P>
      <P>Visitors from Japan and Middle Eastern countries are potential customers, he
added.</P>
      <P>Chiu Wen-ta, president of the Taiwan Hospital Association, said that Singapore
lures some 500,000 travel medicine patients each year and Thailand, double that
number.</P>
      <P>The critical point now facing Taiwan is that the country must effectively
improve the standard of its services if it hopes to catch up with Thailand or
Singapore in the travel medicine field, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>According to Dragon Tours General Manager Yang Chung-lin, Taiwan has a great
potential to develop travel medicine, even it just starts to embark on that
course.  "Taiwan's  medical level is quite competitive compared with those of
neighboring countries,"  he said confidently.</P>

during Double Ten National Day celebration next week lest they threaten the

      <P>They stressed  that they will ensure  the safety  of the participants, their

      <P>Taiwan's contribution to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum is
very much appreciated and Taiwan is encouraged to keep up its engagement in APEC
activities, APEC Secretariat Executive Director Colin Haseltine said Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has submitted initiatives and participated in various APEC projects over
the years, said Haseltine, the 15th executive director of the APEC Secretariat
for the 2007 APEC Year hosted by Australia.</P>
      <P>"My suggestion for Chinese Taipei would be keep doing what you're doing, " he
said in a round table discussion organized by the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research and attended by local government officials and academics.</P>
      <P>The Australian diplomat talked about APEC's present achievements and future
prospects. What APEC has done, especially at the working group and ministerial
level, has been underpublicized, underestimated and underappreciated, he said.</P>
      <P>The leadership meeting of the heads of 21 member economies has always been the
public focus, but it is lower-level meetings and projects that have made
differences and promoted what APEC sets out to do -- promote fair and open
trade, Haseltine said.</P>
      <P>In the future, APEC plans to keep promoting regional economic integration and a
free trade area in the Asia-Pacific region, although the latter will be
difficult to accomplish, he said.</P>
      <P>The organization will undertake internal reform to improve its efficiency and
push for domestic economic structure reform among member economies as well, he
said, noting that better domestic economic structures serve the interest of all
APEC members.</P>
      <P>Haseltine formerly served as head of the Australian Commerce and Industry Office
in Taipei from 1992-1997.</P>

The biggest banking deal ever is likely to conclude today, resulting in the
dismemberment of one of Europe's largest banks.

The significance of the deal goes beyond its $101 billion price tag and the
demise of 183-year- old ABN Amro Holding NV of the Netherlands. Depending on how

      <P>The program, launched by NTHU this summer for the first time, sent 32 students
to five countries -- Indonesia, Malaysia, China, Nepal and Poland -- to do
social and educational work from July to September.</P>
      <P>"Now I know that even electricity and clean water are blessings, "said Tseng
Chia-hsing, one of 15 students who helped teach basic medical knowledge, hold an
English summer camp and a garden party in the remote village of Jugedi, Nepal
during a 45-day stay.</P>
      <P>Kerwin Cheng,  a material science and engineering graduate student, taught
computer operation in eight training camps in Medan and Aceh, Indonesia, which
were hit by a tsunami in 2004 and are still recovering. Cheng said he was
inspired by the bright and passionate spirit of the Indonesians, who lost almost
everything in the disaster but never gave up.</P>
      <P>Liao Ching-yi spent more than two months in Poland living with drug addicts
under treatment. The program was a collaboration with the  Monar  Association,
one  of the  largest  non-government organizations (NGOs) in Poland and Europe.</P>
      <P>The other two groups went to Qinghai, China and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to teach
high school students.</P>
      <P>The program is a variation of the school's mandatory course on labor services,
which in the past usually required students to help clean the campus, said
Hocheng Hong, dean of student affairs. Judging from the results, the program is
a good learning experience for students, he said.</P>
      <P>NTHU will collaborate with organizations in Haiti, Nigeria and China next year,
Hocheng said.</P>

      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) urged Beijing Friday to pay heed to the
existing communication channels between Taiwan and China in the face of the lack
of formal negotiation mechanisms between the two sides.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Liu Teh-hsun issued the call at a routine news conference in
response to reporters' questions about a summit between North and South Korean
leaders, who exchanged joint declaration documents Thursday in Pyongyang, North
Korea, with commitments to forging peace and creating economic prosperity
between the two Koreas.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the meaning of the Korean summit to cross-Taiwan Strait relations,
Liu said the event indicates that "it is necessary for the governments on the
two sides of the strait to enhance communications and step up contacts through
relevant channels so as to explore more positive relations."</P>
      <P>Liu urged China to pay heed to the importance of continuing two-way dialogue and
communications now that Taiwan and China have for some time been negotiating
technical matters at the working level concerning setting up direct cross-strait
charter flight services and regarding Taiwan's opening to Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Although bilateral negotiations between the Taipei-based Straits Exchange
Foundation  (SEF)  and its Chinese counterpart,  the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) , have "temporarily" been halted for some 10
years, Liu said, communication channels between the two semi-official
organizations still exist and should not be overlooked.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS were set up by Taipei and Beijing, respectively, to deal with

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will appeal against a Taipei District Court ruling that
turned down his request to reclaim materials held by prosecutors as evidence in
his "state affairs fund" misuse case, the Presidential Office said Friday.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office made the announcement in a news release after the
District Court ruled earlier in the day that Chen lacks legal basis to ask for
the return of the materials because the president's privilege to refuse to give
testimony and produce evidence should be exercised before, not after, the
testimony is given and the evidence submitted.</P>
      <P>On Sept. 6, Chen petitioned the court to return invoices, vouchers, magnetic
records, written testimony and data related to six secret diplomatic missions
that are being used by prosecutors as evidence in the "state affairs fund"
embezzlement case, on the grounds that the materials have been proclaimed
"absolute secrets."</P>
      <P>The president made the move after the Council of Grand Justices confirmed June
15 the president's constitutional right to decide what is a state secret and his
right to refuse to disclose such information.</P>
      <P>In terms of the constitutional principle of division of power, the Presidential
Office press statement said, the court should respect other government organs'
legitimate powers, including the president's "state secret privilege."</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the statement said, the District Court should not have
denied the president's right to proclaim the withheld materials as "absolute
secrets;" otherwise,  the constitutional provisions safeguarding the president's
special status would be rendered void.</P>
      <P>Even if the court is entitled to scrutinize the propriety of the president's
exercise of his "state secret privilege, " the statement said, the scrutiny
should be conducted by another more suitable judicial agency, not by a court
that is trying the "state affairs fund" case and has withheld the evidence
materials in question.</P>
      <P>Since the District Court ruled that the president's proclaiming the materials as
"absolute secret" is an administrative decree, the statement said, the propriety
or legality of such a move would be determined by an administrative court in
accordance with the existing law. Consequently, the statement said, the District
Court has apparently violated the law in making such a ruling.</P>
      <P>Noting that the District Court seems to have readily quoted prosecutorial
indictment to incriminate the defendants in the "state affairs fund" case, the
statement said such a premature judgment is in obvious violation of the Criminal
Procedural Law that demand all suspects be considered innocent before a final
ruling is handed down.</P>
      <P>The statement also rebutted as "false allegations" the District Court's claim
that the president's move to proclaim the materials as "absolute secrets" only
during the final stage of the trial was "aimed merely at covering up the
administrative negligence and even irregularities" of the defendants.</P>
      <P>As the country's constitution has not explicitly prescribed a "state secret
privilege" system, the statement said the president has to seek a constitutional
interpretation and wait until after the Council of Grand Justices meted out a
ruling to proclaim those evidence materials as "absolute secret."</P>
      <P>Stressing that Chen has on many previous occasions declared those materials as
"sate secrets, " the statement said the District Court has deliberately ignored
Chen's previous announcement. The District Court's allegations against Chen were
"putting the cart before the horse," the statement said.</P>
      <P>Since both the District Court has a vested interest in the outcome of the
ruling, the statement said, the court is not in a position to make a ruling on
whether the withheld materials should be returned to the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The prosecution named Chen as a "joint perpetrator" while indicting first lady
Wu Shu-jen on charges of corruption and forgery Nov. 3, 2006, after determining
she had used receipts provided by others to claim reimbursements totaling
NT$14.8 million (US$450,000) from the president's "state affairs fund" between
July 2002 and March 2006.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that none of the money went into his own pocket, claiming it was
necessary to use receipts from different individuals to muster the funds to
engage in secret diplomatic missions in certain  countries  because of the
confusing  and inconsistent accounting system governing expenditures by the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>However, the District Court ruled Jan. 19 that the six diplomatic missions cited
by the president as having drawn on the state affairs fund were not secret as
the president claimed, and should be disclosed in court proceedings.</P>
      <P>After the Council of Grand Justices confirmed the president's "state secret
privilege" in a constitutionality ruling in June, the court has made all court
proceedings behind closed doors.</P>

      <P>Forty-four Taiwan companies were ranked among the world's top 1,000 non-EU
companies investing the largest sums in research and development in 2006,
according to a report released recently by the European Commission's Joint
Research Center.</P>
      <P>The 2007 EU Industrial R&amp;D Investment Scoreboard, published in early
October, shows that the largest number of companies on the list were from the
United States and Japan.</P>
      <P>The 44 Taiwan companies on the list covered the areas of semiconductors,
electronic equipment, computer hardware, electrical components  and  equipment,
personal  goods,  fixed  line telecommunications,  automobiles and parts,
electricity, leisure goods,  industrial  metals,  computer services,  and
industrial machinery.</P>
      <P>They included Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which ranked 120th for
investing 374.15 million euro (US$528.75 million) in R&amp;D in 2006; BenQ
Corp., which ranked 132nd for investing 349.55 million euro; and Hon Hai
Precision Industry, which ranked 176th for investing 248 million euro.</P>
      <P>The annual report indicates that corporate R&amp;D grew by 10 percent for 2006,
with EU-based companies increasing their R&amp;D investment by 7.4 percent.</P>
      <P>Total R&amp;D investment by the top 1,000 EU-based companies and the top 1,000
non-EU companies amounted to 372 billion euro, accounting for more than 85
percent of the world's total, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Worldwide, the U.S.-based pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. was the largest
R&amp;D investor in 2006, spending 5.76 billion euro in this regard.</P>
      <P>Among EU countries, the Germany-based automobile manufacturer DaimlerChrysler
took top spot for spending 5.23 billion euro on R&amp;D in 2006.</P>
      <P>By sector, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies invested the most in
R&amp;D in 2006, overtaking equipment sector and technology hardware companies.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the report shows that EU companies continued to increase their
R&amp;D investment at a lower rate than companies in the rest of the world last
year.</P>

      <P>Forty-seven rivers are at high risk of experiencing mudflows owing to heavy rain
caused by Typhoon Krosa, officials at the Council of Agriculture's Soil and
Water Conservation Bureau warned Saturday.</P>
      <P>The affected areas include 21 villages in five townships located in Taipei
County, Yilan County and Hsinchu County, where residents have been evacuated to
safer places, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Another 831 rivers are listed as at moderate risk, affecting 80 townships in
Yilan County, Taipei County, Taipei City, Taoyuan County, Hsinchu County, Miaoli
County, Taichung County, Taichung City, Nantou County and Chiayi County, they
said adding that residents in these areas have been advised to prepare for
evacuation.</P>
      <P>According to the Central Weather Bureau (CWB), Typhoon Krosa was centered 100 km
east-southeast of Yilan in northeastern Taiwan at Saturday noon, packing maximum
sustained winds of 184 kph, with the radius of the storm covering the whole of
Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>While rain and wind in the northern and northeastern regions have been
intensifying, some areas have seen heavy rainfall of more than 50 mm per hour,
particularly in the mountainous areas in the northern and northeastern regions,
CWB forecasters said.</P>
      <P>CWB tallies show that between early Friday until 11 a.m. Saturday, accumulated
rainfall registered 786 mm on Yilan County's Taiping Mountain, 584 mm on Hsinchu
County's Niaotsui Mountain, 495 mm in Taoyuan County's Fuhsing township, 424 mm
in Miaoli County's Taian township, 419 mm in Taipei County's Wulai township, 397
mm in Taichung County's Hoping township.</P>
      <P>Forecasters said the typhoon has shown signs of decreasing in intensity and is
expected to decrease in speed -- from 15 kph to 11 kph, meaning that the storm
will likely not depart Taiwan until Sunday afternoon at the earliest.</P>
      <P>They advised the public to avoid any trips to the mountainous areas or
riversides, which are prone to landslides, falling rocks, mudflows and floods.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will appeal as soon as possible a Taipei District Court
ruling turning down his request to reclaim materials held by the prosecution as
evidence in his "state affairs fund" misuse case, a Presidential Office official
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>David Lee, director of the Department of Public Affairs, said that when the
Presidential Office receives formal notification from the Taipei District Court,
expected next Monday, it will file an appeal with the Taiwan High Court within
five days.</P>
      <P>Lee's remarks came one day after Taipei District Court rejected President Chen's
request on Sept. 6 that the court return invoices, vouchers, magnetic records,
written testimony by concerned individuals, and data related to six secret
diplomatic missions being used by prosecutors as evidence in the case.</P>
      <P>The president said he made the request on the grounds that the materials had
been re-labeled as "strictly confidential" materials that should be kept secret
permanently after the Council of Grand Justices confirmed June 15 the
president's constitutional right to decide what is a state secret and his right
to refuse to disclose such information.</P>
      <P>Taipei District Court ruled Friday that the process in which the materials were
labeled as "strictly confidential" involved "gross flaws" and should be
considered invalid. The related documents and data should not be listed as
"state secrets" under the State Secret Act but instead as evidence that
prosecutors can use against the defendants, the court further said.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office said in a news release issued late Friday that the
District Court is not in a position to deny the president's "state secret
privilege."</P>
      <P>The news release said that as the Taipei District Court has a vested interest in
ruling on whether to return the withheld materials, it is not suitable to deal
with the case which it said should be conducted by another more suitable
judicial agency.</P>
      <P>The prosecution named Chen as a "joint perpetrator" while indicting first lady
Wu Shu-jen on charges of corruption and forgery Nov. 3, 2006, after determining
she had used receipts provided by others to claim reimbursements totaling
NT$14.8 million (US$450,000) from the president's "state affairs fund" between
July 2002 and March 2006.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that none of the money went into his own pockets, claiming it was
necessary to use receipts from different individuals to muster the funds to
engage in secret diplomatic missions in certain countries because of the
confusing and inconsistent accounting system governing expenditures by the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>However, the Taipei District Court ruled Jan. 19 that the six diplomatic
missions cited by the president as having drawn on the state affairs fund were
not secret as the president claimed, and should be disclosed in court
proceedings.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic crime has become a serious problem in Taiwan in recent years, an
academic said Saturday, noting that since 2000, over 450 individuals and
corporations have been indicted for embezzling a total of more than NT$276.7
billion (US$8. 38 billion) in public or corporate funds.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on the issue, Soochow University Professor Hsieh Yi-hung
said that this wave of economic crime has been tantamount to "a catastrophe."</P>
      <P>He noted that over the past eight years, 92 corporations and 367 individuals
have been involved in embezzlement scandals.</P>
      <P>Although  the Ministry of Justice has mapped out standard procedures for
preventing major economic criminals from fleeing to other countries, Hsieh
lamented that several notorious tycoons remain at large, namely Rebar Pacific
Group Chairman Wang You-tseng, who allegedly embezzled NT$70 billion from
various listed companies under his group, Chen Yu-hao of Tuntex Group, who is
accused of embezzling NT$60 billion, and Wang Yu-yun of Chung Hsing Bank, who is
believed to have embezzled NT$30 billion from the company.</P>
      <P>What is worse, Hsieh said, is that these fugitive tycoons have continued living
lavish lifestyles and even started new businesses overseas.</P>
      <P>Hsieh attributed the rampant corporate crime in recent years to the fact that
the line between government and business has become blurred to such an extent
that it has undermined the government's supervisory role.</P>
      <P>The best way to restore public confidence in the government is to have those
indicted for economic crimes repatriated back to Taiwan and to retrieve the
embezzled money, he said.</P>

      <P>Financial officials who have failed to actively fulfill their duties of
overseeing banking, capital market and corporate operations should be subject to
strict criminal penalties to ward off major economic and financial crimes, a
prosecutor said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Yung-chin, a head prosecutor with the Shihlin Prosecutor's Office in Taipei
City, made the appeal in a speech delivered at a seminar on updating the
country's financial supervisory mechanism to cope with emerging economic and
high-tech crime.</P>
      <P>Hsu, the country's first prosecutor ever to be posted at a financial supervisory
agency, said that during his stint as a proscutor stationed at the Cabinet-level
Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), he came to find that many financial
officials were passive in policing stock market operations and corporate
accounting practices.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who has investigated many high-profile financial scandals, including a
Taiwan Development Corp. stock insider trading case involving Chao Chien-ming,
President Chen Shui-bian's son-in-law, said economic crime, financial crime, and
crime involving the rich and the famous could simply stem from weak corporate
oversight.</P>
      <P>However, these criminal activities might also involve legal, economic, social
and political problems, Hsu said. For instance, a corporate financial scandal
usually originates from "greed, " but ruptures or negligence in the internal
monitoring mechanism could also be a cause, he noted, adding that accounting and
administrative overseeing units should reflect on whether they have fulfilled
their duties of timely and effective supervision.</P>
      <P>In the past, Hsu said, stock market price rigging and insider trading tended to
be different in style. But nowadays, he said, the two criminal activities have
often been interwined. Worse still, big-time players now often simultaneously
manipulate prices of many stocks, making it even more difficult for prosecutors
to investigate.</P>
      <P>If supervisory  organs  fail  to actively  cooperate  with investigative and
prosecutorial agencies, Hsu said, probes into such cases can be a tall order.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Hsu said, financial supervisors who have been lax or
passive in carrying out their watchdog duties should be prosecuted and given
harsh prison sentences to prevent corporate scandals and financial
irregularities.</P>

Response Center in Taipei Saturday as Typhoon  Krosa lashed Taiwan with strong
winds and torrential rainfall.</P>
      <P>Chen was briefed on the latest typhoon situation and its impact on public
infrastructure. As the storm has cut power supplies to many homes, caused
flooding and disrupted traffic services in some areas, Chen directed relevant
central government agencies to assist local governments in rehabilitation work.</P>
      <P>"All levels of government units should step up repair of damaged public
facilities so that our people can resume normal daily life, " Chen said during

Deputy Secretary-General Cho Jung-tai during the inspection tour.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, torrential rains brought by the storm have damaged 27 major
roads leading to several aboriginal communities in mountainous regions around
the country. Chang said he has directed the Ministry of Transportation and the
Council of Indigenous Peoples to take contingency measures to prevent those
communities from losing contact with outside world or being left isolated.</P>

cut blacked out 400,000 households, officials said.</P>
      <P>The island's capital, Taipei, was eerily quiet with shops and offices closed and
residents staying home. City officials said strong winds uprooted more than 200
trees in the city, while knee-deep water flooded a residential area in suburban

      <P>Responding to press inquiries about the possibility of his return to the DPP
chairmanship, Chen said he is listening attentively to pros and cons of the
arrangement.</P>
      <P>"I'll consult with other party heavyweights and those concerned about the DPP
chairmanship issues to get a better understanding of their opinions," Chen said,
adding that he will refer to their advice in making his final decision.</P>
      <P>Several noted pro-independence diehards, including former senior presidential
adviser Koo Kwan-min and talk show host Wang Ben-hu, have voiced strong
opposition to the proposal of Chen doubling as party chairman again. They said
Yu should stay on to avoid putting yet another burden on Chen's shoulders.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, Chen said he is seeking reasons to politely reject DPP
members' call for him to take over the party chairmanship as he is already
shouldering a heavy duty as the country's head of state.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he added that if the party indeed expects him to take up the
responsibility, he will give the proposal a serious thought.</P>
      <P>Asked about his view on the Taipei District Court's rejection of his request for
return of classified documents seized in the high-profile "state affair fund"
embezzlement case, Chen said the ruling didn't come as a surprise to him.</P>
      <P>While expressing his respect for judicial authorities, Chen said he will defend
his legitimate rights by appealing the ruling to the Taiwan High Court.</P>
      <P>On Sept. 6, President Chen requested that the District Court return invoices,
vouchers, magnetic records, written testimony by concerned individuals, and data
related to six secret diplomatic missions being used by prosecutors as evidence
in the case. All those materials are now kept by the District Court.</P>
      <P>The president said he made the request on the grounds that the materials had
been re-labeled as "strictly confidential" materials that should be kept secret
permanently after the Council of Grand Justices confirmed June 15 the
president's constitutional right to decide what is a state secret and his right
to refuse to disclose such information, also known as "state secret privilege."</P>
      <P>But the District Court rejected Chen's request in a ruling issued Friday, saying
that the exercise of the president's "state secret privilege" should still be
made in line with the constitutional principle of balance of power and should be
subject to scrutiny.</P>
      <P>In a press statement issued late Friday, the Presidential Office said that since
the documents are now in the District Court's possession, the District Court is
not a suitable judicial organ to decide whether they should be returned to the
Presidential Office or not.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the statement said it will appeal to the High Court
within five days after it formally receives the ruling.</P>

1950: Communist Chinese troops enter Tibet.

1958: Communist Chinese begin to launch a mass movement in Tientsin to make iron

President to help plan the policy framework for national unification and to

moral nature who is able to combine in himself quickness of magnanimity,
generosity, benignity, and gentleness: qualities necessary for the exercise of
patience."</TEXT>

      <P>The Soil and Water Conservation Bureau under the Council of Agriculture issued
"red alerts" given the threat of rock and mudslides in 264 locations in Taipei
City and nine other counties islandwide Sunday.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Krosa -- which swept across northern Taiwan Saturday -- bringing
torrential rains to the island,  triggered slides in locations in north and
northeastern Taiwan and still threatens to cause additional mudslides in central
and southern counties.</P>
      <P>The Soil and Water Conservation Bureau issued "red alerts" Sunday against
potential rock and mudslides at 264 sites in 119 villages in nine counties
around the island and Taipei City.</P>
      <P>In Yangming Mountain in Taipei City's northern suburb, two men -- father and son
-- were confirmed to have been killed early Sunday morning after their home was
buried by a mudslide Saturday.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials urged the public to remain on high alert against the
possibility  of rock and mudslides  and called for local governments to evacuate
people if the situation warrants preventative measures.</P>
      <P>The 264 risky areas are scattered throughout the eastern county of Yilan, the
northern counties of Taipei, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Miaoli and the central counties
of Taichung and Nantou, the southern counties of Yunlin and Chiayi, as well as
the capital, Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Officials warned that mountainous  areas are now extremely vulnerable to
landslides because the soil in these areas is water saturated due to Typhoon
Krosa, which is expected to continue bringing torrential rains to the island
over the next two days.</P>
      <P>They said that after a "red alert" is issued, the local government is

      <P>Siew was greeted at the airport by Mark W. P. Liao, director of the Taipei

expatriates.</P>
      <P>Describing his just-concluded three-day visit to the U.S. capital as
"satisfactory, " Siew told reporters that he can tell that the United States has
great expectations of Taiwan and keenly hopes to maintain traditionally cordial

      <P>Siew said he strongly  believes  that friendly Taiwan-U.S. relations can be
restored and further improved if the KMT retakes power in March 22, 2008

      <P>While in Washington D.C., Siew visited the U.S. Congress and met with 18

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian called for members and supporters of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Sunday to set aside their differences and
reunite in an esprit de corps so as to help facilitate his decision on taking up
the helm of the DPP once again.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is still pondering whether he is competent enough to concurrently
serve as DPP chairman, but he "would not shun the duty if assured by an obvious
demonstration of unity by party members and supporters."</P>
      <P>He called for everybody to pitch in, saying that he is not capable of taking on
all the responsibilities single-handedly, and it would be meaningful for him to
assume the DPP chairmanship only if all others  do their  part and take up a
share  of overall responsibility.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during a grassroots community outreach lunch in the
Zhongshan District, Taipei City.</P>
      <P>He said he has told DPP members that there are 100 reasons for him to politely
reject the party chairmanship as he is already shouldering a heavy duty as the
country's head of state, but "DPP members have demonstrated great goodwill in
asking me to take the party helm again."</P>
      <P>Chen served as DPP chairman from July 2002 to December 2004 when he resigned to
assume responsibility for the party's failure to win a majority in the
legislative elections that year.</P>
      <P>On Friday, the DPP's Central Executive Committee (CEC) held an extraordinary
meeting during which it formalized a call by the party's Central Standing
Committee for Chen to take over the DPP chairmanship after Yu Shyi-kun stepped
down Sept. 27.</P>
      <P>Yu announced his decision to resign late last month after being indicted on
graft charges for his alleged misuse of a "special allowance fund" during his
terms as premier and as Presidential Office secretary-general.</P>
      <P>Despite calls for him to stay, Yu said that he was adamant about resigning after
his more radical version of the "normal country resolution" was rejected by
party leaders Sept. 26.</P>
      <P>The version, which included the words "changing the country's title to 'Taiwan'
from the current Republic of China to declare to world that Taiwan is a
sovereign independent country, " failed to receive the support of party leaders.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang presidential candidate said Sunday that maintaining
the status quo of the Republic of China reflects the common wish of the majority
of the people in Taiwan and is in the best interests of the country.</P>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou traveled to Lungtan in the northern county of Taoyuan Sunday to pay
a courtesy visit to 82-year-old Hakka novelist Chung Chao-cheng at his home,
where the writer questioned Ma about his theory of "an ultimate unification
across the Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>Ma answered Chung by clarifying his stance that presently it is not an opportune
time for Taiwan to talk about independence or unification with China and
"maintaining the ROC's status quo" remains the common wish of the majority of
the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>He added that currently, economic issues, public order and education are all
much more pressing than the independence vs unification question.</P>
      <P>Chung, who is regarded as one of the founding fathers of Taiwan's "native
literature, " seemed to be satisfied with Ma's explanation, saying that he found
Ma's discourse based on democracy and the people's will acceptable.</P>
      <P>Ma talked with Chung for 40 minutes until they were forced to end their meeting
earlier than expected because members of the public, interested in the Ma-Chung
meeting, had swamped the road in front of Chung's residence, causing a traffic
jam.</P>
      <P>When asked by a reporter whether he paid the visit to Chung in hopes of winning
over more voters, Ma said it is not the first time for him to visit the writer,
adding that he has read Chung's books since he was a child, and visited Chung
while serving as Taipei's mayor. "It would not be right not to include Chung on
my Taoyuan itinerary," Ma said.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chung said that some people had dissuaded him from meeting with
Ma,  but he met the candidate  anyway,  out of consideration that he might have
an chance to learn the KMT presidential candidate's thoughts on the question of
independence vs unification.</P>
      <P>Chung said he asked Ma to remain consistent in his stance on that issue during
the campaign and after the presidential election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSE chief calls for clearer regulations governing insider trading</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Wu Rong-i, chairman of the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corp. (TSE), Saturday urged the
government, in collaboration with law experts, to review existing rules
regulating insider trading cases and come up with clearer and more feasible
regulations.</P>
      <P>Wu made the call while delivering a speech on the differences between theory and
practice in dealing with insider trading.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the TSE has handed over more than 100 suspected insider trading
cases to prosecution for probes in recent years, but the accused in most of the
cases were cleared of any wrongdoing.</P>
      <P>Noting that as regulations governing the nature and scope of "material, non-
public information" for insider trading and the definition of when the
information becomes material are not clear, many business representatives have
expressed concerns that they could be inadvertently caught up in insider
trading.</P>
      <P>Wu said since assuming the TSE chairmanship, he has found that there is ample
room for discussions exploring the implications of the lawfulness of some
commercial activities.</P>
      <P>He said that the key point for judicial agencies to decide whether the accused
is guilty or not lies on the definition of the point at which information
becoming material.</P>
      <P>According to existing insider trade regulations, insiders -- including a
company's directors, supervisors, managers and their close relatives -- are
banned from buying or selling stocks of their company within 12 hours of the
release of important information likely to affect the company's stock price, but
the problem is determining at what point information should be judged as being
in the public domain, according to Wu.</P>

      <P>The Central Taiwan Science Park in Taichung County will have to recruit at least
1,700 workers in 2008 due to its rapid business expansion, according to an
investigation by the Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA).</P>
      <P>Chung Chin-chi, director of the CLA's service center in charge of Taichung,
Changhua and Nantou counties, said that enterprises based in the compound are
expected to experience great manpower demands next year -- with 55 percent of
some 1,700 jobs available for factory workers and 32 percent targeting computer
hardware engineers.</P>
      <P>According to Chung, a total of 89 companies have been approved to open shop in
the science park in central Taiwan. Thirty-four enterprises have already kicked
off operations in the compound, with approved investments of over NT$1.7
trillion and 16,000 employees, he said.</P>
      <P>The Central Taiwan Science Park will have a demand for as many as 90,000 workers
in the coming years -- a figure which may climb to 140,000 if job opportunities
released by nearby industrial zones are also included, Chung said.</P>
      <P>Thanks to its rapid growth, the park is expected to create even more jobs and to
become the prime employment hub for job seekers in Taiwan's central regions, he

    <HEADLINE>High Court prepares for president's appeal to reclaim evidence</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
10/07/07  19:50:49
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court has selected eight senior chief judges in preparation for
an imminent appeal by President Chen Shui-bian to reclaim evidence held by a
lower court in probes of his "state affairs fund" case, court sources said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to the Council of Grand Justices (CGJ) Ruling No. 627 issued June 15,
the High Court is obliged to form a special tribunal to deal with a dispute
between the president and the prosecution or a district court over the exercise
of the president's "state secrets privilege."</P>
      <P>The CGJ ruling also stipulates that such a special tribunal should be led by a
senior chief judge and include another four judges.</P>
      <P>Eight of the 16 chief judges at the High Court meet the seniority requirement to
head the special tribunal, as each of them has been in on the bench for more
than 10 years, the court sources said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the sources said, the High Court is scheduled to unveil the roster of
each five-member tribunal Monday.</P>
      <P>When the High Court receives President Chen's appeal, it will determine by
drawing lots which tribunal will handle the case.</P>
      <P>Chen is expected to appeal the Taipei District Court's Friday ruling that
rejected his request for the return of a collection of documents and articles
held by the court as evidence in the probes into his alleged misuse of the
"state affairs fund".</P>
      <P>According to CGJ Ruling No. 627, Chen can appeal the District Court ruling to
the High Court within five days after receiving the notification.</P>
      <P>The District Court obtained the evidence collection from a prosecutorial team
that indicted the first lady Wu Shu-jen and three former and incumbent
presidential aides last November on charges of corruption and forgery for
allegedly embezzling NT$14.8 million (US$450,000) from the "state affairs fund,
" a special allowance fund set aside for the president's discretionary use for
state affairs.</P>
      <P>The collection consists of invoices, vouchers, magnetic records, written
testimony by concerned individuals and data related to six secret diplomatic
projects from 2002 to last December.</P>
      <P>Chen asked for the return of the collection Sept. 6 on the grounds that the
collection were "strictly confidential" information under the protection of the
Classified National Security Information Protection Act and should be kept
secret permanently.</P>
      <P>The president said in his petition that the collection was labeled "strictly
confidential" in line with CGJ Ruling No. 627, which confirms the president's
constitutional right to decide what constitutes a state secret and his right to
refuse disclosure, also known as "state secrets privilege."</P>
      <P>However,  the District Court ruled illegal the president's declaration that the
collection was top secret, claiming that while the June 15 CGJ constitutional
interpretation states that the president has the right to keep classified
information secret, the exercise of the right should still observe the
constitutional principle of balance of power and be subject to scrutiny.</P>
      <P>In a news release issued late Friday, the Presidential Office said the District
Court has no power to deny the president's right to proclaim that the court-held
collection of documents are "strictly confidential" since the grand justices
have already confirmed the president's "state secrets privilege."</P>
      <P>Even if the exercise of the "state secrets privilege" should be subject to
judicial scrutiny, the news release said it should be conducted by a more
suitable judicial organ rather than the District Court.</P>
      <P>Regretting that the District Court made many biased allegations and judgments in
its ruling about the pending "state affairs fund" case, the press statement said
the District Court is by no means an appropriate agency to decide whether the
collection of documents in question should be returned to the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office further said that as the District Court has a vested
interest in the outcome of the ruling on the "ownership" of the collection, it
should not be permitted to issue a ruling on the case given the potential
conflict of interest.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office also rebutted the District Court's "false allegations"
that the president's move to proclaim the collection secret was merely aimed at
covering up the defendants' wrongdoings. Making such a premature judgment is in
obvious violation of the Criminal Procedure Law, which stipulates that all
defendants be considered innocent before a final ruling is handed down.</P>

      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) lifted the land warning for Typhoon Krosa on
Taiwan proper Sunday at 5: 30 p.m. after Krosa skirted Taiwan's northeast
regions the previous day.</P>
      <P>According to the CWB, it lifted the typhoon's land warning for all of Taiwan
proper because the strong typhoon had lost steam and weakened to a tropical
storm as it moved on towards China at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour.</P>
      <P>However, meteorologists warned residents in mountainous areas from Hsinchu
County to Pingtung County of heavy rains yet to come, brought by the remnants of
the typhoon.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, agricultural losses around the country climbed further Sunday noon,
with ravaged crops in Hualien County in eastern Taiwan reaching NT$200 million
in losses. Chiayi and Taitung counties in southern and southeastern Taiwan
sustained agricultural damages of more than NT$80 million and NT$50 million,
respectively, while Nantou County in central Taiwan and Kaohsiung County in the
south suffered losses of over NT$47 million.</P>
      <P>Vegetable prices in Taipei's wholesales market have skyrocketed to an average of

      <P>Typhoon Krosa took a toll worth NT$748.67 million (US$22.96 million) on
agriculture, according to tallies released Sunday by the Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>That amount includes NT$567 million in damage to about 20 percent of crops on
13,283 hectares, which is tantamount to the complete loss of crops on 2630
hectares.</P>
      <P>The hardest hit crops include bananas, rice, persimmons, guavas, papayas, and
grapes.</P>
      <P>Livestock and poultry damage comes to NT$190,000. Fishery damage amounts to
NT$1.16 million, with 13.2 hectare of fish ponds flooded. Forestry damage stands
at NT$2.22 million caused mainly by damage to 15 hectares of woodland.</P>
      <P>Damage to agricultural facilities amounts to NT$26.75 million, while damage to
fishery facilities, particularly the set nets installed around the coast of the

million respectively.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Krosa also knocked out power to 2.32 million households during its
onslaught against Taiwan, according to the Taiwan Power Co.</P>
      <P>Thanks to its repairing crew and contractors, power supply has been restored to

      <P>Defense Minister Lee Tien-yu said Monday that the Hsiung Feng-2E cruise missile
-- the latest version of Taiwan's domestically-developed missiles -- will not be
showcased during the military display scheduled for the Double Ten National Day
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Lee said that the land-attack cruise
missile will not be displayed at the event because it is still in the
development stage.</P>
      <P>However, Lee said that other domestically-developed advanced missiles, including
the supersonic anti-ship Hsiung Feng-3 missile and the anti-tactical ballistic
missile Tien Kung-3, as well as several unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will be
displayed.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks in response to a question raised by opposition Kuomintang
Legislator Lin Yu-fang about whether Washington had suggested that Taiwan not
showcase the Hsiung Feng-2E for fear that doing so could be provocative to
China.</P>
      <P>The defense minister said that the United States has respected Taiwan's decision
to develop defensive weapon systems, adding that "we will handle the matter with
great vigilance."</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of National Defense (MND), a variety of advanced
military hardware will be showcased at this year's National Day military
display, the first to be held since 1991.</P>
      <P>MND officials said that the flyby to be staged by the Air Force during the
National Day event will showcase many aircraft purchased in the years after the
last gathering, including the AH-1W attack helicopter, the OH-58D combat search
helicopter, the S-70C chopper, and several fixed-wing aircraft, such as the F-16
and Mirage 2000 jetfighters.</P>
      <P>Other advanced military hardware to be showcased at the event include two eight-
wheel-drive CM-32 Clouded Leopard vehicles, an Avenger air defense missile
system armed with Stinger missiles and a 50-caliber machine gun, as well as
armored Humvees equipped with TOW armor-piercing missiles, the officials said.</P>
      <P>An Assault Amphibian Vehicle AAVP7, purchased from the United States in 2001,
will also featured, they added.</P>
      <P>Mobile Army and Marine radar, fire fighting vehicles of the chemical corps, and
a pontoon bridge of the engineering corps will also be included in the display.</P>
      <P>Members of several military units, including the Marine Corps Amphibious
Reconnaissance and Patrol Unit and the Army Special Forces, as well as a
skydiving team will perform as part of the display, the officials said.</P>

      <P>Paraguay is one of Taiwan's staunchest supporters and cannot be "bought" in any
way, visiting Paraguayan President Nicanor Duarte Frutos said Monday.</P>
      <P>Duarte expressed his sincere wish that Taiwan can achieve its goal of finding
its identity in the international community as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian met with Duarte and his wife at the Presidential Office
for a talk Monday after a red-carpet welcome ceremony for the Paraguayan couple
outside the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>President Duarte and his wife are among many foreign dignitaries who have come
to Taipei to attend the Republic of China Double Ten National Day celebrations
slated for Wednesday.</P>
      <P>President Chen said that although Paraguay is the furthest from Taiwan
geographically among all the country's diplomatic allies, the close ties and
strong friendship between the two sides has erased that distance.</P>
      <P>Noting that Paraguay has spoken out in support of Taiwan's U.N. membership bid
at every General Assembly gathering since Duarte assumed the presidency in 2003,
Chen said that Paraguay is one of the most important forces assisting Taiwan's
bid to join the world body.</P>
      <P>"President Duarte's clear and powerful speech in support of Taiwan's bid
delivered at this year's U.N. General Assembly gathering moved many people in
Taiwan and was greatly appreciated," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen further said that President Duarte's current visit to Taiwan is
particularly significant as the two countries are celebrating the 50th
anniversary of the establishment of formal diplomatic relations this year.</P>
      <P>Chen also expressed his congratulations to Duarte on the occasion of his
birthday, which happens to coincide with Taiwan's National Day on Oct. 10.</P>
      <P>For his part, Duarte told Chen that he always feels at home when he visits
Taiwan and that he will spare no efforts to further cement ties between Taiwan
and Paraguay as the two countries share common goals and ideals.</P>
      <P>Duarte and his wife last visited Taiwan in May 2004 to attend President Chen's

movement in that country, which was hit with a bloody crackdown by the military
junta in Yangon last month.</P>
      <P>The MOFA hopes it can connect with international friends via the Web page in a

support network for Myanmar's pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel

      <P>Sun said earlier at a conference on the Myanmar issue held by the Taiwan

      <P>An anti-corruption campaign spokesman said Monday that Shih Ming-teh, a former
chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) who initiated the
campaign, will attend the Double Ten National Day rally.</P>
      <P>Jerry Fan, spokesman of the "Million Voices Against Corruption" campaign, made
the remarks after he and other key officials of the campaign called on
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, the chief organizer of the National Day
rally,  earlier in the day to communicate with him on the behavior of those
attending the rally.</P>
      <P>Fan noted that the nation's security authorities, as well as a pro-government TV
station, have in recent days continued to claim that the "red-clad" anti-
President Chen Shui-bian protesters will attempt to disrupt the Double Ten
National Day celebrations like they did last year.</P>
      <P>The media also reported that Chen has said that "if the protesters dare to make
any move on National Day, they will be arrested," Fan said.</P>
      <P>Fan said the campaign will only mobilize Shih and added that a poster of Shih in
his fugitive days when he was wanted by the then-Kuomintang administration will
be displayed with the caption " Chen Shui-bian, are you going to arrest me one
more time."</P>
      <P>The appearance of Shih, who was put behind bars for a quarter of a century for
preaching democratic ideals, will be "enough to represent the spirit of the red-
clad army," according to Fan.</P>
      <P>Fan said Shih will wear a red shirt and will "show up somewhere" on the
periphery of the rally. He will follow the regulations of the organizing
committee by not carrying any dangerous weapons and will not shout slogans or
unfurl banners.</P>
      <P>The campaign, initiated by Shih to despose Chen in August 2006 in the wake of a
series of scandals surrounding Chen's family members and close aides, created a
phenomenon in which several large-scale rallies culminated with the encircling
of the Presidential Office and Chen's official residence on National Day last
year. The campaign only petered out toward the end of last year.</P>
      <P>Legislators of the opposition and the ruling parties scuffled briefly on the
grandstand while Chen was delivering a speech on National Day as opposition
legislators flashed the "thumbs down" gesture to lend support to the protesters.
The move caused great embarrassment for Chen and prompted him to say that the
rally should be scrapped.</P>
      <P>Chen has decided not to address the National Day rally this year, in a departure
from past precedent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President hopes Taiwan and Dominican Republic will sign FTA soon</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian expressed hope Monday that Taiwan and the Dominican
Republic will sign a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) as soon as possible to benefit
enterprises in both countries.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during a meeting with visiting Dominican Republic Vice
President Rafael Alburquerque, who was in Taipei to participate in celebrations
of Republic of China's Oct. 10 National Day.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan and the Dominican Republic have concluded the first-round of
FTA negotiations, Chen expressed hope that such talks might continue so as to
strengthen bilateral trade and economic ties.</P>
      <P>Until now, countries in Central America signing FTAs with Taiwan -- including
Panama, Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras -- have been those with
which Taiwan maintains diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Chen also extended gratitude to the Dominican Republic government for its
support to Taiwan's participation in world organizations and activities,
although it has not publicly spoken in favor of Taiwan's bid to join the United
Nations as the Caribbean country is applying to be a non-permanent member of the
U.N. Security Council and would rather not express publicly its support to
Taiwan's entry to U.N. so as to not incur China's veto over its U.N. Security
Council bid.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China has tried in vain to re-enter the United Nations since
1993, and this year changed tactics by applying for a seat under the name
Taiwan, although that too failed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice President Annette Lu has said that there will be a trade
conference held Tuesday in Taipei to help attract Taiwanese enterprises to
invest in the Dominican Republic.</P>
      <P>Lu added that she will also accompany Alburquerque on visits to several trade
establishments in Taiwan Tuesday, and host a banquet in honor of the Dominican
Republic delegation, which more than 100 local high-tech business executives in
Taiwan will attend.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Fund for Children and Families said Monday that it has decided to
sponsor 1,000 children in an impoverish village of northern Vietnam.</P>
      <P>Fund officials said the village, Quang Phong, in the Na Ri region about 240 km
north of Hanoi, capital of Vietnam, has a population of around 30,000, composed
mainly of five minority tribes: the Tay, Nung, Dao, Hmong and Kinh.</P>
      <P>The officials said that because the village is in a remote mountainous area with
little access to the outside world, it has been listed as one of the country's
most impoverished areas by the Vietnamese government.</P>
      <P>This is why the fund has decided to help the children in the village, noting
that when the fund recently sent officials to visit the village, they found the
backwards and impoverished situation very similar to that of Taiwan four decades
ago.</P>
      <P>The fund called for Taiwan's people to extend a helping hand so as to improve
the medical care, living conditions and education in the village.</P>

      <P>The government's economic growth target for next year will be no less than 4.5
percent, Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Chairwoman Ho Mei-
yueh said Monday.</P>
      <P>At a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Economics and Energy Committee, Ho said
Taiwan's economic growth in the first half year was adjusted upward to 4.62
percent thanks to better-than-expected private investment, with the economic
growth for the whole year forecast to be 4.58 percent thanks to prosperous
foreign trade and stable private consumption.</P>
      <P>The CEPD originally set the goal for Taiwan economic growth for this year at 4.6
percent, according to Ho.</P>
      <P>Noting that although the crisis caused by sub-prime loan problems in the United
States has also caused tremendous losses in Asia's financial markets, Ho said
the crisis will have a limited impact on the world as many countries have
abundant foreign exchange reserves and have committed to financial reforms that
will enhance the stability of banks. Ho predicted that China and India will
maintain their rapid economic growth in the future.</P>

      <P>The 2007 FIA Asia Derivatives Conference will take place in Taipei  Oct.  10-12,
with more than 250 representatives from financial exchanges and futures
industries of nearly 20 countries expected to attend, a spokesman for the Taiwan
Futures Exchange (TFE) said Monday.</P>
      <P>It will be the largest international event of its kind held in Taiwan since the
TFE was established in 1997, the spokesman said, adding that the event will help
boost Taiwan's profile on the world stage.</P>
      <P>The event will provide opportunities  for domestic futures companies to learn
from the international market experiences of the Korea Exchange (KRX) , the
Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM) , the European Exchange (EUREX), the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) , among
others, the TFE noted.</P>
      <P>The event will also be beneficial to the fostering of cooperation between
financial exchanges in the Asia Pacific region and their counterparts in other
parts of the world, the TFE spokesman went on.</P>
      <P>Since becoming a member of the Futures Industry Association (FIA) in 2001, the
TFE has taken an active role in the association's annual meetings in an effort
to enhance its relationships with other members, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, the TFE won the right to organize the conference in
March as part of efforts to raise its global profile and highlight Taiwan's
significant role in the derivatives markets in the Asia Pacific region.</P>
      <P>The conference will feature more than 20 keynote speeches and seminars on
information  exchanges between financial exchanges, business opportunities for
investing in Taiwan's futures market, the new role of market participants, and
introductions to Asian markets, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The conference will also provide an overview of Chinese and Indian  markets  to
help  participants  understand  the latest developments of derivatives products
in Asia, the spokesman went on.</P>
      <P>In addition, a total of 23 local and foreign futures companies will join the
event to increase participants' understanding of the derivatives markets in
various countries, he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that the formation  of collaborative  and strategic alliances has become
a global trend among the world's financial exchanges  aiming  to expand their
market shares  amid fierce competition, the spokesman said that Asian financial
exchanges should seriously consider how to respond.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Bill Brodsky, chairman and chief executive officer of the
Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), will be invited to share ideas and
experiences  on mergers  between financial exchanges, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Brodsky is expected to touch upon the merger between the Chicago Board of Trade
and Chicago Mercantile Exchange earlier this year, which created the world's
largest  and most diverse financial exchange.</P>
      <P>The Washington D.C.-based FIA, the world's largest institution for futures
trading, established the FIA Asia last year to help promote derivative products
in the Asia Pacific region amid the brisk development of Asian derivative

      <P>A medical team organized  by the government-run Hsinchu General Hospital (HSGH)
took a flight Monday for the Solomon Islands, where it is to remain for 15
months for medical aid services.</P>
      <P>The medical team is part of the government's efforts to boost diplomatic

HSGH President Chang Ching-nan.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that the medical team, made up of HSGH physicians including Chang

treatment as well as training in techniques dealing with medical research,
hospital management, and constructing modern medical care and treatment
facilities.</P>
      <P>On the Solomon Islands, many local patients suffer from chronic diseases such as
hypertensive cardiovascular disease and diabetes. In infectious disease control,
the country is seen with high rates of malaria and tuberculosis, according to

      <P>Taiwan should do more to help democratic development in Myanmar and thereby
demonstrate its unyielding support for universal human rights and advance its
democracy-promoting diplomatic policy, participants of a forum said Monday.</P>
      <P>"For example, Taiwan should pass the Refugee Act as soon as possible and help
establish a Myanmar refugee settlement regime here to show our support of
democracy in Myanmar, " said Lai I-chung, Director of ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) Department of International Affairs, in a forum
focused on the latest political developments in Myanmar following the recent
massive protests.</P>
      <P>More than 100,000 persons of Myanmarese descent currently living in Taiwan are
also welcome  to voice their opinions  to the international community on the
democratic development in their home country, said Joyce Lin, a professor at
Tamkang University.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should also seize this opportunity to increase its exchanges with
Myanmar, the only Southeast Asian nation that does not trade with Taiwan, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>Discussants  of the forum,  which was organized by Taiwan Thinktank, agreed that
the effect of global condemnation of Myanmar's ruling junta will be limited
since the regime enjoys the support of China and Russia in the United Nations'
Security Council. However, Taiwan should keep sending strong messages that it
sides with the people.</P>
      <P>"We don't want people to get the impression that whenever Taiwan speaks or makes
the international headlines, we only do so out of concern with our own problem,
which is the Taiwan Strait issue. We should keep communicating to let people
know that, as a member of the international community, we do care about what
happens elsewhere, " Liu noted.</P>
      <P>There are so many things Taiwan can do with the Tibet and Myanmar issues to act
as a "guardian of democracy" in the Asia-Pacific region, Lai said, adding that
Hong Kong relinquished that role after the 1997 handover to China.</P>
      <P>Political parties, non-government organizations (NGOs) and the legislature can
all act to show Taiwan's support of the people of Myanmar, Lai added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan registered a trade surplus of US$17.44 billion in the first nine months
of this year, setting a new high, an official of the Ministry of Finance (MOF)
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee Li-hsueh, director-general of MOF's Department of Statistics said that
exports totaled US$178.74 billion, while imports totaled NT$161.3 billion in the
Jan.-Sept. period. The trade surplus of US$17.44 billion represents an increase
of 28.1 percent over the same period last year.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that trade surpluses in the Jan.-Sept. periods from 2001 to 2006 were
US$11.7 billion, US$15.3 billion, US$16.5 billion, US$11.8 billion, US$7.7
billion and US$13.6 billion, respectively.</P>
      <P>Exports in September alone totaled US$22.22 billion, up 10.6 percent from the
same month last year, while imports totaled US$19.07 billion, up 10.5 percent
from the same month last year: the second highest total for a single month.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the trade surplus in September totaled US$3.15 billion, or the
19th consecutive month in which a trade surplus has been registered since March
2006.</P>
      <P>She attributed the increase in exports to increased trade with Hong Kong, China
and six Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries -- Singapore,
Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia, which she said grew
by over 19 percent when compared with the same month last year. Exports to
Europe also increased by 10.8 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, imports from the United States and China increased by 25.9 percent
and 12.8 percent, respectively. Imports from Japan, Europe and the six ASEAN
countries increased by 7.7 percent, 7.4 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Lee said that generally speaking, exports in the fourth quarter are stronger
than those in the third quarter, with the exception of last year.</P>
      <P>Particularly  noteworthy is that Taiwan's exports to China accounted for 44.1
percent of the total exports, breaking the 40 percent level for the first time,
while exports to the United States declined for the third consecutive month, and
exports to Japan declined for the fifth straight month.</P>

      <P>Vincent Siew, vice presidential candidate of the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT), clarified Sunday a rumor that the KMT might split while stressing the KMT
ticket's resolve to win the March 22, 2008 presidential poll.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks to reporters on his second-day visit to San Francisco
prior to a welcome party hosted by more than 600 "pan-blue" supporters of the
KMT ticket pairing Siew with former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Reiterating that Ma and he himself are determined to win the next presidential
election, Siew said that the KMT is also committed to acting as a peacemaker for
Taiwan in the international community.</P>
      <P>Siew expressed his strong belief that the Taiwan people will pass a correct
judgment on the competing tickets, and that the KMT will eventually prove itself
to be an indigenous regime by obtaining their approval.</P>
      <P>He also rebutted speculation that the KMT might split due to "rifts" among the
party's central committee, the Ma-Siew ticket, Honorary Chairman Lien Chan and
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng.</P>
      <P>"It is to be expected that there will be different viewpoints within a
democratic party, " he noted, while describing the rumors as an attempt by ill-
intentioned elements to divide the party.</P>
      <P>In terms of cross-Taiwan Strait relations, Siew made it clear that the KMT
stands firm on maintaining the status-quo between Taiwan and China by
safeguarding its principles of "no unification, no independence, no military
confrontation."</P>
      <P>According to Siew, a "strong ROC" must possess a sufficiently strong deterrent
capability, be supported by allies like the United States, refrain from
preaching Taiwan independence and be committed to democratic values.</P>
      <P>Earlier the same day, Siew took part in a national flag raising ceremony in
front of the Santa Clara County Government building to mark the 96th Oct. 10
National Day of the Republic of China organized by local ethnic Chinese
communities.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of ROC expatriates, local U.S. politicians and ROC officials stationed
here, including Mark W. P. Liao, director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in San Francisco, also took part in the activity.</P>
      <P>Siew addressed the occasion and stressed the KMT's determination to safeguard
the ROC and the national flag. He encouraged overseas ROC nationals to return to
Taiwan and vote for the KMT ticket in the coming presidential poll.</P>
      <P>Siew arrived in San Francisco Saturday from Washington D. C. after concluding a
three-day visit to the U. S. capital, where he met U.S. congressmen and think
tank members.</P>
      <P>Siew is slated to stay in San Francisco for three days and will proceed to
Canada before wrapping up his 12-day tour to North America.</P>

      <P>Minister of National Defense Lee Tien-yu said Monday that the country's defense
budget will hit 3 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) next year,
compared to this year's 2.69 percent of GDP.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks during a Legislative Yuan defense committee meeting in
response to queries by ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmaker Hong
Chi-chang, who concurrently serves as chairman of the semi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation, which is responsible for Taiwan's  dealings  with China in
the absence  of direct government-to-government contacts.</P>
      <P>According to Hong, many military strategic research has shown that the military
balance across the Taiwan Strait is increasingly tilted in China's favor.</P>
      <P>Amid persistent and continuously growing saber-rattling from China, Taiwan must
maintain a strong defense force, Hong said, questioning how the Ministry of
National Defense would build a strong deterrent force to tackle ongoing military
threats from China, particularly in the coming years which will be critical to
Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>Echoing Hong's viewpoint, Lee admitted that the cross-strait military build-up
is tilting in favor of China and pointed out that his ministry has been working
to build up a new generation of state-of-the-art weaponry to deal with

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) Monday called for the elderly and children under

number receiving the free shot in the first week of the month slipped by 30
percent compared with the same period last year.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-yi, deputy director of the DOH Centers for Disease Control, said that
according to the center's estimate, only 360,000 of those over 65 years of age,

percent of 2.4 million elderly who got the free shots during the same period
last year.</P>
      <P>Of children aged between six months and two years, 19,000 had received flu
shots. That figure represents approximately 9 percent of the children in that

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday the government should consider raising the
import quota for Paraguayan beef since it is highly popular on the local market.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while hosting a dinner party in honor of visiting

      <P>According to Chen, Paraguay's beef import quota of 440 tons for the year was
already used up in April.</P>
      <P>After learning that the last batch of Paraguayan beef was reserved for the Oct.
10 National Day reception, Chen said the Presidential Office had to negotiate
with the reception's host ministry -- the Ministry of Foreign Affairs -- to get
a portion of the beef to serve at Monday's welcoming party for Duarte, which was
also held to wish Duarte many happy returns as Oct. 11 marks his birthday.</P>
      <P>Chen said he will ask relevant government agencies to evaluate the feasibility
of increasing import quota for Paraguayan beef in the future.</P>
      <P>Noting that Paraguay is the best bridgehead for Taiwanese businesspeople to tap
into the vast market in South America, Chen said the government will continue to

      <P>Minister of National Defense Lee Tien-yu said Monday that the country's defense
budget will hit 3 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) next year,
compared to this year's 2.69 percent of GDP.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks during a Legislative Yuan defense committee meeting in
response to queries by ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmaker Hong
Chi-chang, who concurrently serves as chairman of the semi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation, which is responsible for Taiwan's  dealings  with China in
the absence  of direct government-to-government contacts.</P>
      <P>According to Hong, many military strategic research has shown that the military
balance across the Taiwan Strait is increasingly tilted in China's favor.</P>
      <P>Amid persistent and continuously growing saber-rattling from China, Taiwan must
maintain a strong defense force, Hong said, questioning how the Ministry of
National Defense would build a strong deterrent force to tackle ongoing military
threats from China, particularly in the coming years which will be critical to
Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>Echoing Hong's viewpoint, Lee admitted that the cross-strait military build-up
is tilting in favor of China and pointed out that his ministry has been working
to build up a new generation of state-of-the-art weaponry to deal with
contingencies across the strait.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition  Kuomintang (KMT)  vice presidential  candidate  Vincent Siew has
'disgraced'  Taiwan's democracy by portraying the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) -led Taiwan as a troublemaker, Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered at the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council in Washington,  D.C.
last weekend,  Siew claimed that the DPP's incompetence has made more and more
Taiwan people skeptical about whether democracy can resolve many of the social
and political problems facing Taiwan, according to Shieh.</P>
      <P>"Wasn't this kind of accusation echoing the Chinese leadership's rhetoric?"
Shieh asked, adding that if Siew has any doubts about the value of democracy, he
should bow out of next year's presidential election.</P>
      <P>Shieh was even more critical of Siew's allegations that the DPP administration
has made Taiwan be viewed as a "troublemaker" in the international  community,
calling  it a "nasty  and  shameful accusation."</P>
      <P>Siew departed Taipei last Monday for a 12-day visit to the United States and
Canada as part of his barnstorming campaign tour.</P>
      <P>His speech to the audience at the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, which groups
American companies with business interests in Taiwan, was titled "Marching
Toward a Strong, Steady and Positive Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Shieh said Siew was not courageous by failing to state the country's official
name, "the Republic of China, " in his speech on such a solemn occasion.</P>
      <P>"The KMT has always proclaimed itself to be the faithful guardian of the
Republic of China. So why didn't Siew refer to our country by its official title
treasured by the KMT?" Shieh asked.</P>

      <P>The government will go ahead with its plan to merge three wholly state-owned
banks into a holding company, despite a Legislative Yuan motion demanding a halt
to the project, Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Shieh made the remarks a day after the opposition-controlled legislature's
Finance Committee passed a motion requiring the administration to suspend its
plan to form the Taiwan Financial Holding Co. which will combine the Bank of
Taiwan, the Land Bank of Taiwan and the Export-Import Bank of the Republic of
China under one umbrella.</P>
      <P>Noting that bank mergers and transformation are under the jurisdiction of the
executive branch, Shieh said the legislature can only offer advice or
recommendations.</P>
      <P>"While the Executive Yuan respects the legislature's power to make suggestions,
it will go ahead with the plan to merge and transform the three state-owned
banks into a financial holding company," Shieh said.</P>
      <P>The motion to put the brakes on the plan was initiated by opposition Kuomintang
Legislators Lo Ming-tsai and Alex Fai, who claimed that the government, while
working out the merger plan, had not taken bank staff's rights and interests
into account. Moreover, they added that the terms of the contract between the
new holding company and staff of its subsidiary banks remain unclear and
undecided and that the "demise" of the Export-Import Bank will lead to an abrupt
halt to export financing for small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs).</P>
      <P>In response, Shieh said the lawmakers' concerns about the rights of the bank
staff are unfounded. "Since all three banks are 100 percent state-owned, their
staff's rights and interests will be fully guaranteed  after  the  banks  are
transformed  into  a fully government-controlled financial holding company," he
added.</P>
      <P>As to concerns about export financing for SMEs after the merger, Shieh said
trade financing and export insurance will be taken over by the Bank of Taiwan's
relevant departments. Given the Bank of Taiwan's financial  strength  and
experience  in corporate  banking and international financing, Shieh said, trade
financing will be further expanded and become even more accessible to SMEs after
the merger.</P>
      <P>Shieh further said the statute governing the Export-Import Bank will not be
scrapped for the time being. "The Executive Yuan will not seek an annulment of
the statute until after the completion of the merger of the three banks," he
added.</P>
      <P>While screening the Bank of Taiwan's 2007 budget bill earlier this year, the
legislature passed a resolution demanding that the Bank of Taiwan be transformed
into a financial holding company.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung then announced in mid-August that he had instructed
the Ministry  of Finance  (MOF)  to draft an all-encompassing plan to form a
Taiwan Financial Holding Co. grouping the Bank of Taiwan, the Land Bank of
Taiwan and the Export-Import Bank of the ROC under one umbrella.</P>
      <P>The premier set Dec. 31 as a deadline for the MOF to come up with the blueprint
for the merger, which will be carried out in three phases.</P>
      <P>According to MOF officials, the planned Taiwan Financial Holding Co., with
US$158.8 billion in assets, will emerge as the country's most pre-eminent
financial services provider.</P>
      <P>The new company will also be the 89th largest financial services company in the
world and the 18th largest in Asia, the officials said, adding that the new
holding company will have the necessary economies of scale to enable it to boost
productivity and broaden and deepen its reach into new markets.</P>
      <P>Such expanded capabilities will also help reduce operational costs, maximize
utilization of stockholder equity, and optimize risk management, the officials
added.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) condemned China's players in the 2007
World Cyber Games (WCG) Tuesday for verbally insulting and attempting to
physically assault Taiwan's participants upon the conclusion of the games in the
U.S. city of Seattle over the weekend.</P>
      <P>The Chinese contestants did so in protest after Taiwanese player Liu You-chen,
who won a bronze medal in the competition, displayed the Republic of China flag
while receiving the medal on stage at the presentation ceremony.</P>
      <P>MOFA deputy spokeswoman Yeh Fei-pi said the incident indicates that China's
suppression of Taiwan has reached such an extent that Beijing is "almost insane
and unselective in the methods it uses, " adding that the Chinese players
actions at the cyber games event will only deepen the international community's
and Taiwan's resentment against China.</P>
      <P>Yeh urged citizens participating in international events to request the
assistance of the country's representative offices overseas beforehand if they
feel any threat to their personal safety.</P>
      <P>In this latest case, officials at Taiwan's representative office in Settle
arrived at the scene 15 minutes after the occurrence of the incident to lodge a
protest with the organizer and help report the case to the U.S. police, Yeh
said.</P>
      <P>Also Tuesday, a group of ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers
demanded that Chinese President Hu Jintao apologize to the Taiwan people and to
the world over the incident.</P>
      <P>According to Legislator Wang Sing-nan,  Beijing should not mistakenly believe
that it will succeed in forcing the Taiwan people to surrender and agree to
unification with China by using such means.</P>
      <P>"Instead, Beijing should punish the participants to appease the angry Taiwan
people," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wang Tuoh said Beijing has not only humiliated the Taiwan people but
has also "disgraced Chinese civilization." He urged the opposition Kuomintang
and People First Party to join the DPP in condemning China.</P>

      <P>Wholesale vegetable prices dropped by 5 percent in Taipei fruit and vegetable
wholesale market Tuesday -- the first trading day in the market since Typhoon
Krosa swept through northern and northeastern Taiwan Saturday, a spokesman for
the Council of Agriculture (COA) said.</P>
      <P>The prices decreased from NT$40.76 (US$1.25) per kg last Friday to NT$38.7 on
Tuesday, while the volume of vegetables shipped to the market grew to 931 tons
Tuesday from Friday's 640 tons, according to COA statistics.</P>
      <P>The reason for the price drop is that farmers had harvested crops prematurely
ahead of Krosa's arrival out of fear that the storm would destroy their crops,
the COA spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Wholesale vegetable prices are expected to fluctuate over the next several days,
he added.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Krosa caused over NT$2.6 billion worth of losses in the agricultural
sector, according to the COA, which revealed Monday that it will release frozen

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Tuesday that ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh may have been "on retreat" for the last
few days to deliberate on what to do next in his campaign and for the country.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks after Hsieh delivered a speech by video posted on his
campaign Web site Monday following his disappearance from public sight for ten
days.</P>
      <P>Rumors had been rampant in both the DPP and the opposition camps regarding
Hsieh's "disappearance" during the period as it was considered quite unusual,
especially during a peak period in campaigning. Many speculated that it might be
one of Hsieh's new campaign tactics, while others said they believed that Hsieh
was really "exhausted" by the political struggle within his party.</P>
      <P>In the video speech, Hsieh said that he was recovering from a foot injury and at
the same time pondering Taiwan's future. He said he will reveal his thoughts on
important issues after "the political structure of the party is determined." The
DPP chairmanship remains vacant since Yu Shyi-kun resigned from the post late
last month.</P>
      <P>Hsieh pointed out that although he was at home during the last 10 days, he kept
up to date on events in Taiwan and the rest of the world by watching television
and using the Internet. He said he expressed online his concern for three
aboriginal young men who were sentenced to three months in jail Sept. 28 for
making off with government-owned windfall timber.</P>
      <P>Hsieh further said he also expressed concern for the victims of Typhoon Krosa
and sent donations to them, adding that he now sees his good health as a gift
from the God and will use it for the welfare of humanity.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's first humanoid robot performer "Janet, " which is capable of speaking,
singing and walking, debuted at a news conference on Monday to promote a robot
design and manufacturing contest and made a splash.</P>
      <P>"Janet" announced  on the occasion that the 11th National University  and
Technical  College  Creative  Robot Design and Manufacturing Contest organized
by the Ministry of Education is slated to be held Oct. 19-21 at Cheng Shiu
University in the southern county of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>According  to Lin Chi-yu,  a professor at National Taiwan University of Science
and Technology (NTUST) , which developed the performing robot over two years,
the university plans to create another robot of the same type named "Thomas"  to
facilitate interactive performances between the pair.</P>
      <P>Lin added that the duo are expected to begin staging their performances for
disadvantaged groups beginning next summer on a trial basis in preparation for
their future international debut.</P>
      <P>He said that although Japanese auto maker Honda created ASIMO, the world's most
advanced humanoid robot featuring posture control technologies, it has no facial
features or other performance-related functions.</P>
      <P>While another robot HUBO, developed by professor Oh Jun-ho at the Korean
Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, can display facial expressions, it
lacks the capability to stage a show, Lin added.</P>
      <P>From the very beginning, the biped walking robot "Janet" was designed and
developed with a view to developing interactive and performing functions, Lin
said, adding that the state-of-the-art performing technology was created through
the concerted efforts of NTUSC and several Japanese robotics labs.</P>
      <P>Noting that a total of seven teachers and scores of doctoral and master students
at NTUSC are taking part in the development of "Janet, " Lin said that the
hardware needed to build the robot has cost NT$10 million.</P>
      <P>In addition to "Janet" and "Thomas", the research team will also develop two
double-wheeled intelligent robots to join the shows, according to Lin, he added
the team plans, in five years, to set up a "Taiwanese robotic theater" in major
amusement parks around the world, such as Disneyland and Universal Studios in
the United States, to help build Taiwan's high-tech image and boost the
country's international profile.</P>

National Taiwan University (NTU) for a "love animal" benevolent project to be
implemented jointly by the NTU and the Taipei County Government.</P>
      <P>Kuo, Hong Hai Precision Industry Co. chairman and one of Taiwan's richest men,
signed a memorandum of understanding with NTU President Lee Si-chen and Taipei
County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei Tuesday morning.</P>
      <P>In mid-May a Taipei high school teacher knelt in front of Kuo's company
headquarters in Tucheng, Taipei County asking for assistance to help salvage a
large number of captured stray dogs that were to be slaughtered by the Taipei
County authorities.</P>
      <P>According to Kuo, upon learning of the incident, he immediately called Chou
while on board a plane and voiced his hope that the Taipei County could shelve
the planned slaughter.</P>
      <P>However, Kuo said he found it to be a complex matter that must be addressed

after discussing with Chou feasible means of tackling the stray animal problem.</P>
      <P>Admitting that the donation was inspired by the teacher's plea, Kuo stressed
that it is a positive development for all of society and concerned  charity

Taipei County and the medical team at the Yonglin Foundation, whose collective
efforts have led to the three-way cooperative project.</P>
      <P>Kuo also called for charitable organizations to help scrutinize the project and
join forces in promoting the project in other cities and counties.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the project personnel plan to spend three years implementing
the love animal project and will introduce international top-level training
courses for staff and commit to raising public awareness, reducing the number of

      <P>It is estimated that the Taipei country will have to spend an additional NT$2.1

      <P>The Taiwan Alliance to End the Death Penalty will hold a film festival starting
Oct. 12 to call public attention to the issue of abolishing capital punishment,
officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Murder by Numbers Film Festival, the second of its kind since 2004, will be
held to mark the Oct. 10 World Day Against the Death Penalty and to underline
the violent nature of the death penalty, according to alliance CEO Lin Hsin-yi.</P>
      <P>The festival, scheduled for Oct. 12-14 in Taipei and Oct. 19-21 in Kaohsiung,
will feature nine films from Taiwan, Italy, Sweden, France, Denmark, India and
the United States, Lin said, adding that the alliance hope the films will help
the public better understand the issue.</P>
      <P>Liu Ching-yi, president of the Taiwan Association for Human Rights, noted that
the issue of a moratorium on the death penalty has been included on the agenda
of the ongoing 62nd session of the United Nations General Assembly and that the
General Assembly is expected to adopt a resolution on the issue in November.</P>
      <P>Liu suggested that Taiwan proactively adopt the human rights values and
practices advocated by the United Nations if the country wishes to join the
world body.</P>
      <P>Wu Chih-kuang, deputy convener of the alliance, pointed out that although Taiwan
remains one of the few countries where the death penalty has not been abolished,
no executions have been carried out over the past two years, a situation which
he said could be taken as the beginning of the end of the death penalty.</P>
      <P>Noting that 28 criminals are still on the death row in the country,  Judicial
Reform Foundation  CEO Lin Feng-cheng urged President Chen Shui-bian to
officially declare a moratorium on the death penalty and grant amnesty or
sentence commutations to criminals under sentences of death.</P>
      <P>Lin also suggested that the Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin not sign any
execution orders, but rather work to amend related laws to pave the way for the
abolition of the death penalty.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian accompanied visiting Paraguayan President Nicanor
Duarte Frutos on a visit to a hospital in southern Taiwan Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Duarte, who arrived here Sunday to attend the Double Ten National Day
celebrations, and his wife took the high speed train to Chiayi county to visit
Buddhist Tzu Chi Hospital's Dalin branch, one of the hospitals set up by the Tzu
Chi Foundation, the largest charity organization in Taiwan, founded by Master
Cheng Yen.</P>
      <P>In a briefing to the visitors, hospital superintendent Lin Chun-lung noted that
Tzu Chi had its first contact with Paraguay in 1992 when Paraguay and Argentina
suffered serious floods after days of heavy rains. Tzu Chi followers in
Argentina went to Paraguay for flood relief and their good deeds so touched the
hearts of the Chinese expatriates there that they set up a Tzu Chi liaison
office in the South American country in 1996.</P>
      <P>The volunteers in the liaison office have regularly visited orphanages, nursing
homes and provided urgent assistance, as well as set up five elementary schools
in impoverished villages, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The Tzu Chi hospital in Hualien, eastern Taiwan, also donated a container of
medical equipment to the Asuncion University Hospital in 2001.</P>
      <P>Noting that Tzu Chi is dedicated to charity missions, medical aid, and the
promotion of culture and education, Lin said that it has in recent years
expanded its works to include international relief, bone marrow donation,
environmental  protection  and community volunteer works.</P>
      <P>After visiting the hospital, Duarte, his wife and their son went to the
Janfushan Fancy World in Kukeng township, Yunlin County.</P>
      <P>Duarte has spoken up for Taiwan in the United Nations General Assembly on the
nation's bid to join the world body for the past five consecutive years since
assuming the presidency in 2003.</P>

      <P>Seven out of 10 herbal medicine product packages examined by the Consumer
Reports, a magazine published by Consumers' Foundation, Chinese Taipei (CFCT),
exaggerated the medical effects on their labels, CFCT President Cheng Jen-hung
announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The samples were collected by the magazine at grocery stores and supermarkets in
the Taipei area this May, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>One of the seven exaggerated labels claimed to produce effects that would change
one's physical condition and appearance. The other six products were implied to
possess body shaping effects, and their labels made claims that the contents can
change one's physical appearance, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Cheng asked authorities to inspect the seven products which he claimed to have
violated regulations of the Food Sanitation and Management Act and should be
fined between NT$30,000 (US$918) and NT$150,000, or have their business licenses
suspended if violations are repeated, he added.</P>
      <P>Cheng reminded consumers to keep an eye on exaggerated herbal medicine claims
and to be careful when choosing products. Products claiming to be able to reduce
weight usually contain purgatives such as plantain seed whose effects are only
short-lived, and should not be taken without consulting a qualified doctor.</P>
      <P>Consumers should consult doctors for directions and information on the effects
and side effects of their active ingredients, particularly pregnant women,
children, and breast-feeding mothers, Cheng said. He added that consumers should
avoid taking western medicine and Chinese herbal medicine at the same time and
should stop taking medicines if any adverse reactions arise.</P>

      <P>Visiting Dominican Republic Vice President Rafael Alburquerque made an appeal
Tuesday for more Taiwanese companies to invest in his country once the country's
science park is completed.</P>
      <P>Alburquerque, who was here to participate in celebrations of the Republic of
China's Oct. 10 National Day, made the appeal during a visit, accompanied by his
Taiwanese counterpart Annette Lu, to several science parks and a free trade zone
located in Taoyuan County, northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lu hailed the planning and the achievement of a semiconductor and
optoelectronics science park constructed by Formosa Plastics Group, adding that
it might serve as a model for the Dominican Republic in the planning of its own
science park.</P>

both have maintained solid diplomatic ties for several decades, Lu said she
believes that Taiwan's process of high-tech development can be taken as a lesson
by the Dominican Republic.</P>
      <P>Alburquerque mentioned that the Dominican Republic and Taiwan have been

      <P>If inbound passengers attempt to sneak them into the country, they will

      <P>The Kaohsiung County government has sent health officials and quarantine experts
to neighboring Tainan City to help halt an expanding outbreak of dengue fever in
the run-up to the Oct. 20 opening of the 2007 National Athletic Games in the
southern Taiwan city, a county official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-chung, director of the Kaohsiung County Bureau of Health, made the
announcement in his report to the county government during a routine meeting of
senior officials.</P>
      <P>Huang indicated that the number of indigenous dengue fever cases in Tainan City
has reached 477 since the beginning of the year, while Kaohsiung City has
recorded 64 cases and Tainan County 32.</P>
      <P>Huang said there are five to 10 new cases of dengue fever reported in Tainan
City everyday, while Kaohsiung has only reported three confirmed cases of the
mosquito-borne disease since the past summer.</P>
      <P>Given that dengue fever virus will remain rampant in October, the county
official suggested that athletes coming for the upcoming Tainan City games take
anti-dengue precautions, noting that a delegation from his bureau is now in

      <P>Kaohsiung Harbor is at risk of losing its No. 6 global ranking in terms of
container handling volume after a period of slow growth, according to the latest
tallies released Tuesday by the Department of Aviation and Navigation under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications.</P>
      <P>Department  officials said the harbor handled 7.58 million twenty-foot
equivalent units (TEUs) of containers in the first nine months this year, an
increase of 4.41 percent compared with the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>However, the pace of the increase has declined, the officials said, noting that
in January and February, the handling volume increased by more than 10 percent,
but then declined to less than 7 percent in the next two months, and slipped to
less than 5 percent between May and September.</P>
      <P>They said the handling volumes of Rotterdam in the Netherlands and Dubai in the
United Arab Emirates are fast catching up and that Kaohsiung could be taken over
by both of them.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that many countries are pursuing harbor development. In
comparison, Kaohsiung Harbor has good conditions but many shipping companies
have to adjust their navigation routes because there is no direct transport link
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, which they said undermines
Kaohsiung's competitive edge.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Harbor retained third place after Singapore and Hong Kong in container
handling volume for many years until slipping to fourth place in 2000. It
dropped a further notch to fifth place in 2002 and has been in sixth place from
2003 to 2006.</P>

spokesman for the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The show has entered its 33rd year and will run through Oct. 13, said the
spokesman.</P>
      <P>The show consists of four theme halls aimed at increasing local and foreign
buyers' understanding of global accreditation standards for  electronic
components,  new  applications  of  broadband communication technology, the
latest trends in electronic security equipment, as well as the Industrial
Technology Research Institute's research results in the field, the spokesman
noted.</P>
      <P>In addition,  the show contains a special exhibition area highlighting Taiwan-

      <P>The locally developed Syongfong 2e missiles will not be displayed in the
military display in the Double Ten National Day celebration rally Wednesday,
because it is an attack weapon that can reach Shanghai, Legislative Yuan Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng, the rally's chief organizer, said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>It could be "too sensitive" to display such a weapon of aggression in the
military parade, Wang said during a meeting with representatives of Taiwanese
expatriates living in New York who were invited to attend the Oct. 10
celebration.</P>
      <P>However, the anti-ship Syongfong III missiles, as well as the Sky Bow and
Patriot missiles, will be displayed, along with Mirage 2000 fighters, F-16 A/B
jet fighters and Indigenous Defense Fighters, Wang noted.</P>
      <P>Referring to a planned skydiver display, Wang said the weather conditions will
govern whether or not that show can take place.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the controversial issue concerning the decoration of the
Presidential Office's central tower building, which was hung with a plaque
carrying the slogan "Taiwan joins the U.N., " instead of the traditional
"Republic of China National Day Celebration, " Wang said that this year is a
"special" year and that the host of the official National Day celebration
ceremony -- the Presidential Office -- has insisted on the U.N. message.</P>
      <P>It is the first time since the seat of the ROC government was relocated to the
island in 1949 that the tower building will not be decorated with the placard
reading "ROC National Day celebration."</P>
      <P>Wang also noted President Chen Shui-bian will not address the National Day rally
in front of the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The message the president wants to deliver to the nation will be expressed in a

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng called Tuesday for a vote on the opening
of casinos on Taiwan's outlying islands within the current session.</P>
      <P>Wang made the comments following a meeting with Penghu Magistrate Wang Chien-fa,
County Council Speaker Chen Chao-ling, Legislator Lin Ping-kun and local
township chiefs, who asked for Wang's support for quick passage of the bill. The
Penghu group also paid a visit to the legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) later in the day.</P>
      <P>Wang said the main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) legislative caucus should no
longer use the DPP's objection as an excuse to block the bill's passage now that
Ma Ying-jeou, the KMT's presidential candidate, has publicly expressed support
for the establishment of a gambling industry on the offshore county of Penghu.</P>
      <P>The issue has been deferred for too long and now is the time to swiftly deal
with it through a vote, since some DPP and opposition Taiwan Solidarity Alliance
lawmakers have said they might agree to vote in favor of the bill's passage.</P>
      <P>Wang also criticized the DPP administration's intention of allowing the opening
of casinos in three central and southern counties on Taiwan proper, calling it
an indication of its deep lack of knowledge about the gambling industry.</P>
      <P>He urged the DPP administration not to put off the bill any longer with the
pretext of a lack of complementary measures.</P>
      <P>Pointing to Las Vegas' and Singapore's development experience as examples, Wang
said it is "obvious" that the gambling industry must be clustered in a specific
area.</P>
      <P>He questioned whether visitors would be willing to travel to outlying islands to
gamble if the same entertainment were available on Taiwan proper,  stripping the
outlying islands of economic opportunities.</P>
      <P>Admitting that some caucus members have objected to the idea of allowing the
opening of casinos on outlying islands, DPP legislative caucus whip Ker Chien-
ming said the party will gauge how to respond to the issue after the bill has
been included on the legislative agenda by the Procedure Committee.</P>
      <P>"It is too early to discuss the issue, " he said, "because the caucus will have
to exchange views with relevant agencies to find common ground."</P>
      <P>Later that same day, the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) said that it is unaware of how the Legislative Yuan will deal
with the gambling bill but that it will fully respect its authority in this
regard.</P>
      <P>According to the CEPD, the government will not start to promote the gambling
industry until all complementary measures have been put in place.</P>
      <P>CEPD Chairwoman Ho Mei-yueh said during a legislative meeting the previous day
that it is necessary for the government to first acquire social consensus before
it begins to promote the industry.</P>
      <P>It is extremely important to establish relevant laws and create a sound system
before casinos are allowed to be set up, she said, noting that it is the case in
other countries that casinos are authorized to open only when related
legislation has been implemented and when a supervisory agency has been
instituted to regulate the industry.</P>

    <TEXT>The New York Times: Democrats Seem Ready to Extend Wiretap Powers

Two months after insisting that they would roll back broad eavesdropping powers
won by the Bush administration, Democrats in Congress appear ready to make
concessions that could extend some crucial powers given to the National Security
Agency.

The Wall Street Journal: Zoellick Charts Inclusive Course At World Bank

The World Bank's new president, Robert Zoellick, has put an end to a staff
insurrection at the bank by styling himself as the opposite of his predecessor,
Paul Wolfowitz, a former Pentagon official. Three months on the job, he has
become the un- Wolfowitz. Where Mr.  Wolfowitz relied on a few recruits from the
Bush administration, Mr. Zoellick hasn't hired a single one. While Mr. Wolfowitz
froze out bank staff, Mr. Zoellick meets with the bank's 24 vice presidents
every morning.</TEXT>

      <P>Taiwan Stock Exchange Corp. (TSE) Chairman Wu Rong-i said Tuesday that there is
a "transitional crisis" for China's economy, which he claimed is "highly likely"
to collapse.</P>
      <P>In a speech at the Kaohsiung County Hall, Wu further urged local businessmen to
invest in the United States and Europe, which he described as "truly profitable
and safe" markets.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, Taiwan relies too much on China in terms of investment and
trade, which he described as highly risky.</P>
      <P>No countries are like China, which allows its economy to develop freely and yet
has a tight political control over it, according to Wu.</P>
      <P>Describing China as Taiwan's "enemy" with an economy fraught with risk, Wu said
Taiwanese businessmen should eye what he claimed are the "profitable and safe"
markets in the U.S. and Europe rather than China.</P>
      <P>In addition,  Wu said the government should ease economic regulations and
increase the modernization of laws and regulations to strengthen the country's
competitiveness. He also particularly called for an improvement in the
legislature's efficiency in reviewing bills.</P>
      <P>Describing Taiwan's economy and foreign trade as competitive, Wu said Taiwan
ranks 17th globally in terms of total foreign trade value, adding that the
country has been "enjoying a trade surplus over the years."</P>
      <P>Wu also noted that Taiwan's Gross National Product (GNP) ranks 20th in the
world, while Taiwanese people's purchasing power is in 18th place globally.</P>
      <P>He said the ratio of foreign stock holdings in Taiwan and that of foreign stock
trade are also increasing annually, which indicates foreign investor confidence
in the prospects for Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>He said that as of late July, foreign investors owned 33.67 percent of Taiwan's
stock market, which amounts to NT$7.8 trillion (US$239 billion).</P>
      <P>Responding to Kaohsiung Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing's observation that South
Korea, whose national income is half of Taiwan's, now outperforms Taiwan
economically,  Wu expressed doubt about the reliability of South Korea's
economic figures.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, Taiwanese people's purchasing power is far ahead of that of the
South Korean people, which he said demonstrates that Taiwan enjoys much more
stable economic growth than South Korea.</P>

      <P>A total of 1,005,670 signatures were solicited during the second phase of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) petition campaign for holding a
referendum on the government's bid to join the United Nations under the name
Taiwan, according to a statement released Tuesday by the DPP.</P>
      <P>The press statement said the number of signatures solicited is a big step toward
the DPP's referendum  threshold of 2 million signatures for the second phase.</P>
      <P>The party raised the referendum petition target from the previous 1 million to 2

    <HEADLINE>President pledges to continue pushing Taiwan's U.N. bid</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 10 (CNA)
10/10/07  13:22:26
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian pledged Wednesday that Taiwan will continue its quest
to join the United Nations despite its latest setback.</P>
      <P>Chen reiterated in his 2007 National Day address that by applying for U.N.
membership under the name Taiwan, the country has no intention of challenging
Resolution 2758 adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 1971, according to which
the Republic of China's U.N. seat was given to the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>He further said that Taiwan also has no intention of competing with the PRC for
the right to represent China,</P>
      <P>"Resolution 2758 neither defined Taiwan as a part of the PRC nor affirmed the
proposition that the PRC has any right to sovereignty over Taiwan, " Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Stressing that it is a historical fact and the status quo that Taiwan and the
PRC are two sovereign, independent nations, Chen said the PRC has neither the
right nor the ability to represent the 23 million people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Though thwarted, the country's first membership application under the name
Taiwan received unprecedented attention this year, with representatives of more
than 140 U.N. member states participating in a debate on the issue during the
annual session of the General Assembly and media reports on the bid numbering
more than four times as many as in the previous year, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"This all goes to show that this year's efforts to join the United Nations have
been a diplomatic success and have greatly raised Taiwan's visibility in the
international community," he said.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of a recent opinion survey in which 70 percent of Americans
said they would support U.N. membership for Taiwan if a referendum on the issue
were passed in Taiwan, Chen said this shows whether the people of Taiwan are
united is a factor crucial in whether the U.N. membership bid will succeed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen again urged the ruling and opposition parties to work together
to amend the Referendum Act as soon as possible to address the "absurdity" and
"unreasonableness" of the law, such as restrictions on the referendum topics,
depriving administrative agencies of the right to initiate referendums, and
excessively high thresholds for referendum petitions and passage of referendums.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , which is pushing for a
referendum  on the U.N.  bid alongside the March 2008 presidential election,
aims to collect 2 million signatures by the end of this month for the party's
petition, in the hope that the number can be recognized as a Guinness World
Record.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan has tried without success to have the United Nations consider the
issue of its representation since 1993, this year marks the first time the
country has applied to join the world body under the name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, following the return of Taiwan's application by the U.N. Secretariat
first in July and again in August, an item endorsed by 17 of Taiwan's diplomatic
allies asking the United Nations to address Taiwan's membership application was
also excluded from the agenda of the 62nd session of the General Assembly.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan has not lost its place as 'Asian tiger': President Chen</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 10 (CNA)

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, quoting domestic and international tallies, said
Wednesday that Taiwan is no less impressive economically than South Korea and
has not lost its place as one of the "four Asian tigers."</P>
      <P>Speaking during his National Day address, Chen said that Taiwan is a success
story and that the people of Taiwan should not underestimate or look down on
themselves, stressing that Taiwan has never been marginalized or ceased to be
one the "four Asian tigers."</P>
      <P>In his address to government officials, lawmakers, foreign dignitaries and
representatives from all walks of life delivered in the Presidential Office to
mark the Double Ten National Day, Chen said that over the past seven years, some
people have tried to disparage Taiwan for personal political gain.</P>
      <P>Recently, Chen said, they have even repeatedly claimed that Taiwan has lost its
place as one of the "four Asian tigers." "I would like to call upon my
compatriots to realize that so long as we cherish Taiwan in our hearts, we
certainly will not fail to note its presence as an economic power," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said that according to forecasts  released by Taiwan's Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics and by the Central Bank of Korea, each
country's economy will grow by 4.6 percent for this year; Taiwan's consumer
price index will post a rise of 1.5 percent, while South Korea's will rise by
2.5 percent; Taiwan's unemployment rate for the year will be about 3.8 percent,
compared to South Korea's 3.3 percent; and the ratio of average incomes in the
highest 20-percent and lowest 20-percent income brackets will be 6: 1 in Taiwan
and about 8:1 in South Korea.</P>
      <P>Quoting the 2007 World Competitiveness Report released by the International
Institute for Management Development May 10, Chen said that Taiwan ranked 18th
and South Korea 29th this year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said, in the three major indices of the World Economic Forum's
Global Competitiveness Report 2006-2007 released in September 2006 -- the Growth
Competitiveness Index, the Global Competitiveness Index, and the Business
Competitiveness Index -- Taiwan ranked 6th (first in Asia), 13th, and 21st in
the world, respectively, while South Korea ranked 21st, 24th, and 25th.</P>
      <P>As the aforementioned statistics and rankings demonstrate, Taiwan is no less
impressive, economically speaking, than South Korea, Chen said, adding that both
nations qualify as "Asian tigers" in terms of overall economic performance,
government finances, domestic purchasing power parity, and various
competitiveness rankings.</P>
      <P>Currently, he said, Taiwan's production values in the important categories of
large TFT-LCD flat panel manufacturing, contract IC chip-making, and IC
packaging and testing rank first in the world.</P>
      <P>As of the end of August, this year's business turnover at Taiwan's three major
science parks -- Hsingchu Science Park, Central Taiwan Science Park and Southern
Taiwan Science Park -- stood at NT$1.23 trillion (US$37.88 billion). The figure
is expected to increase to a record high of NT$2 trillion by the end of the
year, Chen continued.</P>
      <P>In the future, he continued, this administration will work to accelerate
development of and attract investment in the newly expanded facilities of each
science park. The government will also work to promote precision machinery,
communications electronics, and biotechnology  to become  Taiwan's  third,
fourth  and  fifth trillion-NT-dollar industries, following the semiconductor
and flat panel industries.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that this will help achieve the goal of balanced industrial and
regional development within Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>"As for the stock market, which reflects our economy's prospects, the Taiwan
Stock Exchange weighted index has risen by about 25 percent from the beginning
of the year, and the overall value of traded stocks has hit record highs," he
said.</P>
      <P>As can be seen, far from falling out of the ranks of the "four Asian tigers, "
Taiwan has become a leader in numerous high-tech realms, he said, adding that
Taiwan has expanded beyond Asia to achieve a global presence. "Given this
shining record, I am confident that as long as we keep Taiwan in our hearts and
have confidence in the country, it will certainly have high visibility in the
world."</P>
      <P>Noting that in the past few years, Taiwan-born stars, such as Ang Lee, Chien-
ming Wang, Chen Shih-hsin, Chu Mu-yen, Kevin Lin, Chan Yung-jan and Chuang Chia-
jung, have had stellar performances on the world stage and continued to bring
honor to the nation, Chen said "it is hard to put into words the pride we feel
for their outstanding achievements."</P>
      <P>At the same time, however, he said, "we feel deep distress when people, for
political reasons and in pursuit of power, disparage Taiwan. For in denying
Taiwan, they deny all the sacrifices and contributions made by the 23 million
people of Taiwan for their nation over the past half century and more."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that it is his greatest honor to be
invited to attend the 100th anniversary ceremony of the National Press Club
(NPC) in the United States after he leaves office next year.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during a meeting with Peter Hickman, vice chairman of the
NPC Newsmaker Committee, at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Chen said that it is an invitation to the 23 million people of Taiwan and that
he is willing to represent the Taiwan people to take part in the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen lauded Hickman's strong belief in democracy and press freedom,
saying that three incidents can show that Hickman does not cave in to any
pressure from China.</P>
      <P>First of all, Chen said, the NPC did not remove Taiwan's national flag from
among those of other countries displayed at the NPC's hall as China has
repeatedly requested.</P>
      <P>Secondly, Chen said that Hickman, facing even greater pressure from Beijing in
May, invited him to speak to U.S. press members and academics via a NPC-
organized videoconference.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, despite mounting pressure from China, the NPC still invited Wang Wenyi,
a Falun Gong member, to talk about how the Chinese government oppresses Falun
Gong practitioners and particularly how China harvests organs from living Falun
Gong members.</P>
      <P>Touching upon Taiwan's bid to join major international organizations, Chen noted
that there are still many countries that would not support or even explicitly
oppose Taiwan's entry into the World Health Organization (WHO) or the United
Nations for fear of offending China.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the people of Taiwan undoubtedly have the freedom and the right
to express their common aspiration for the country to become a member of
international organizations and that they should not be deprived of this right.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that the Taiwan people have been excluded from the U.N. for 36
years, which he described as "extremely unfair."</P>
      <P>In response, Hickman said that China will not be able to achieve its aims by
putting pressure on the NPC, adding that he hopes more people from Taiwan can
give speeches at the NPC in the future.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin presided over a national flag raising ceremony in the
public square in front of City Hall Wednesday to celebrate Double Ten National
Day.</P>
      <P>Instead of attending the central government-organized celebration rally in front
of the Presidential Office, the mayor held a separate ceremony along with a
road-running activity to show his disagreement with the way the Presidential
Office celebrated the birthday of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Hau, a member of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , claimed that the reluctance
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party to spell out the words the Republic
of China "has deeply hurt the feelings of the people."</P>
      <P>Hau was referring to decorations on the Presidential Office's main tower, which
was decorated with a plaque carrying the slogan "Taiwan joins the U.N. " instead
of the traditional "Republic of China National Day Celebration" that has been
used since the seat of the ROC government was relocated to the island in 1949.</P>
      <P>Hau's predecessor,  Ma Ying-jeou,  who is the presidential candidate of the KMT,
attended the National Day celebration ceremony at City Hall. In his address, Ma
said he supported Hau's move to organize his own celebration and blasted the
ruling party for "concealing" the formal national name amid celebrations to mark
the county's birthday.</P>
      <P>Also attending the City Hall ceremony were KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung and
Secretary-General Wu Den-yih, New Party Chairman Yok Mu-ming, as well as
lawmakers and city councilors of the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the
People First Party.</P>
      <P>Ma did not attend the Presidential Office rally as he was not invited by the
host.</P>
      <P>After the national flag raising ceremony, the politicians took part in the road
run on streets surrounding City Hall, along with 3,000 citizens, to celebrate
the day in a "healthy" way.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, at Taipei County Hall, the county government also celebrated the day
with a national flag raising ceremony at the Banciao Stadium. Thousands of
people attended the ceremony, which was also a celebration  of the county's
recent upgrading to a " quasi-special municipality."</P>

      <P>The 2007 National Day celebration rally was held successfully Wednesday, with
the armed forces shining the brightest with an unprecedented military display.</P>
      <P>The rally began at the Presidential Office plaza at 9 a.m. with hundreds of
elementary school, high school and college students performing rock-n-roll,
traditional Hakka folk dance and dances telling Taiwanese folk tales.</P>
      <P>The dances were followed by a performance staged by tri-service marching bands
on the ground, with a breathtaking flyby performed by the air force showcasing
aircraft purchased in the years since the last display of this type in 1991,
including the AH- 1W attack helicopter, the OH-58D combat search helicopter, the
S-70C chopper, and several fixed-wing aircraft such as the F-16 and Mirage 2000
jetfighters.</P>
      <P>In addition to the flyby was a parade of a wide array of locally developed
advanced missiles, including the supersonic anti-ship Hsiung Feng-3 missile and
the anti-tactical ballistic missile Tien Kung-3, as well as several unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs).</P>
      <P>Also showcased in the military display was other advanced hardware, including
eight-wheel-drive CM-32 Clouded Leopard vehicles, an Avenger air defense missile
system armed with Stinger missiles and a 50-caliber machine gun, as well as
armored Humvees equipped with TOW armor-piercing missiles.</P>
      <P>An Assault Amphibian Vehicle AAVP7 purchased from the United States in 2001,
mobile army and marine radar, fire-fighting vehicles of the chemical corps, and
a pontoon bridge of the engineering corps were also showcased.</P>
      <P>The much-talked-about Hsiung Feng-2E cruise missile -- the latest version of
Taiwan's locally developed missiles -- was not showcased as it is still in the
development stages, said Ministry of National Defense (MND) officials.</P>
      <P>A highly anticipated skydiving display was canceled due to poor weather
conditions.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, former Ruling Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Shih Ming-teh,
leader of the "red-clad anti-graft" campaign formed in 2006 to push for
President Chen Shui-bian to step down over corruption allegations, was formally
invited to attend the National Day celebration rally.</P>
      <P>With the exception of some protesters who were physically ejected from the
audience for shouting anti-Chen remarks, the rally took place peacefully and
successfully.</P>

      <P>The following is the full text of President Chen Shui-bian's 2007 National Day
Address.</P>
      <P>Vice President Lu, Presidents of the Five Yuans, Ministers, Distinguished
Guests, Esteemed Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen:</P>
      <P>A Happy Double Tenth and greetings to you all!</P>
      <P>On this very special occasion of our Double Tenth National Day, we are gathered
under one roof to celebrate our past accomplishments, reflect on our past
shortcomings, and meditate in earnest on the course of Taiwan's future
development.</P>
      <P>You will note that the reviewing stand erected in front of the Presidential
Office is different from past years in that it is adorned with a giant banner
reading "UN for Taiwan, Peace Forever." This message signifies that our quest to
gain entry into the UN will not be abandoned simply because of momentary
setbacks. The Government of Taiwan will continue  to pursue that goal with
unwavering determination.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is a sovereign nation. Its sovereignty rests in the hands of its 23
million people. Only the people of Taiwan have the right to decide their
nation's future.  United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758, passed on
October 25, 1971, neither defined Taiwan as a part of the People's Republic of
China nor affirmed the proposition that the People's Republic of China has any
right to sovereignty over Taiwan. Taiwan and the People's Republic of China are
two sovereign, independent nations,  and neither exercises jurisdiction over the
other. This is a historical fact. This is the status quo across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>The People's Republic of China has neither the right nor the ability to
represent the 23 million people of Taiwan. Our people have the right to demand
appropriate representation in the United Nations. We have the right to apply for
admission to the UN as a new member under the name "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>In the past, we have joined Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) under the
name "Chinese Taipei, " and the World Trade Organization (WTO) using the name
"Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu." Though
dissatisfied with this state of affairs, we have reluctantly accepted it in view
of practical international realities.</P>
      <P>Before 1971, the United Nations was beset with quarreling over the right to
represent China. Hence, if we were to once more demand restoration of our UN
representation under the name "Republic of China," it would not only constitute
a direct challenge to Resolution 2758 but cause us to fall back into the
anachronistic mentality of belief in "one China" and Chiang Kai-shek's dictum
"Gentlemen do not stand with thieves" [i.e.  there can be no conciliation with
usurpers]. We would succeed only in making ourselves outcasts in the
international community and exacerbating the dangers of isolation.</P>
      <P>That we have applied for new UN membership under the name "Taiwan" indicates
that we do not intend to challenge Resolution 2758 of the UN General Assembly.
Nor do we wish to compete with the People's Republic of China for the right to
represent China.</P>
      <P>This year has seen our first application for UN membership under the name
"Taiwan, " and although, as expected, our hopes were not realized,  Taiwan's
membership  bid gave rise to unprecedented discussion of the issue in the
General Assembly. Representatives of some 140 of the 192 UN member states
registered to speak on the question of whether Taiwan's application should be
included on this year's General Assembly agenda, and the debate lasted for over
four hours. Moreover, media reports on our UN bid were more than four times as
many as in last year.</P>
      <P>This all goes to show that this year's efforts to join the UN have been a
diplomatic success, and have greatly raised Taiwan's visibility in the
international community.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the government and people of Taiwan, I would like to express our
heartfelt thanks and highest respect to our diplomatic allies and their leaders
for their support and speaking out at the UN General Assembly.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the importance of the international community's expressions of
support in our quest to gain membership in the UN, the decisive factor, after
all, is the question of whether the people of Taiwan are united. A recent public
opinion poll indicated that 55 percent of Americans think Taiwan should have a
seat in the UN. When asked whether they would support UN membership for Taiwan
if our forthcoming referendum on entering the United Nations using the name
"Taiwan" is passed, another 15 percent, or 70 percent of the respondents, said
"yes." This shows just how much the community of free and democratic societies
respects the principle of referendum, a universal value and basic human right.</P>
      <P>The principle "sovereignty lies in people" is the essence of democracy,  and
referendum is the most concrete,  most direct expression of that principle. In
2003, we passed the first Referendum Act, and, in 2004, we held the first
national referendum. In 2005, the Constitution was amended to abolish the
National Assembly and empower the people to ratify constitutional amendments
through referendum. In 2006, we mothballed the National Unification Council and
its Guidelines  for National Unification,  dispelling  the misconception of
"ultimate unification" with China as a foregone conclusion, thereby enabling the
23 million people of Taiwan to enjoy the right to decide the future of their
nation via referendum.</P>
      <P>On September 14 of this year, the Central Election Commission officially
announced its approval of a referendum proposal on the recovery of improperly
obtained political party assets, to be held on January 12, 2008 in tandem with
the legislative elections. And if the petition drive to hold a referendum on
applying for UN membership under the name "Taiwan" is successful in gaining
enough signatures by the end of October, and is announced valid upon review by
relevant government agencies, we can look forward to holding it in conjunction
with the upcoming March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>From encountering initial resistance and opposition to finally being embraced
and actively promoted, referendum has become a political process affirmed by
both the ruling and opposition parties, and an indispensable  part  of Taiwan's
democracy.  Practical utilization of referendum in the past few years, however,
has highlighted the absurdity and unreasonableness of the Referendum Act. The
act restricts referendum topics, deprives administrative agencies of the right
to initiate referendum proposals, and sets excessively high thresholds for
referendum petition signatures and passage of referendum proposals.</P>
      <P>All this seriously restricts the people and deprives them of the right to be
masters of their nation. Moreover, it runs counter to the democratic principle
that sovereignty lies in the hands of the people. I earnestly urge the ruling
and opposition parties to speedily remedy the flaws in the Referendum Act. I
call on them to complete the review of related legal amendments during the
current Legislative Yuan session, and change the ridiculous "birdcage"
referendum law currently in effect into one that genuinely empowers the people,
and the substance of which lives up to its name.</P>
      <P>This year marks the 60th anniversary of the February 28 Incident as well as the
20th anniversary of the lifting of martial law. Looking back over the past half
century of progress on the path to democracy, we see that Taiwan's people have
steadily realized their aspirations one after anotherXfrom the lifting of
martial law, abolition  of bans on establishing  new political parties and
newspapers, and nationalization of the armed forces [to ensure their loyalty to
the nation rather than to individuals or political parties],  to independence of
the judiciary,  overhaul of the parliament, direct presidential elections, and
the establishment of a referendum system. Moreover, ongoing consolidation and
deepening of democracy have ensured freedoms, human rights and well-being of
Taiwan's people are continually safeguarded.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, however, China, on the other side of the Taiwan Strait, has
distortedly portrayed our people's efforts in the pursuit of democracy as moves
toward "de jure independence." It has opposed and attempted to suppress all of
our democratization efforts. Facts demonstrate that cross-strait problems do not
derive from Taiwan, which respects freedom, democracy, and human rights, but
from China, which is still under totalitarian, dictatorial rule. This is a
reality that the international community must squarely face.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks, the global community of democracies has strongly condemned
Myanmar's military junta for its cruel suppression of the nation's Buddhist
monks and citizens, and expressed the intention to impose sanctions on the
regime. As a member of the alliance of nations that champion freedom and
democratic values, Taiwan is willing to do its share to help restore democratic
order in Myanmar as soon as possible. Infringements of human rights and
suppression of democracy are definitely not mere "domestic affairs." While
showing its keen concern for developments in Myanmar, the international
community should also conscientiously examine China's dismal human rights record
as well as its brutal suppression of the freedoms of speech, the press, and
religion.</P>
      <P>While China's slogan for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games is "one world, one
dream," the international community, for its part, should steadfastly
demonstrate its moral fortitude in demanding that China adhere to a "one world,
one standard" principle. There can be no double standards when it comes to the
universal values of freedom, democracy, human rights, and peace.</P>
      <P>The size of nations is irrelevant. The international community should not, in
fear of China's military might, demand that Taiwan keep quiet. Nor should it,
out of concern for commercial interests, turn a blind eye to China's military
intimidation and diplomatic suppression of Taiwan, or to its "united front"
economic warfare against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a speech made in Kyoto in November 2005, US President George W. Bush said,
"Free nations are peaceful nations, free nations do not threaten their
neighbors, and free nations offer their citizens a hopeful vision for the
future. By advancing the cause of liberty throughout this region, we will
contribute to the prosperity of allX and deliver the peace and stability that
can only come with freedom."</P>
      <P>President  Bush also publicly praised Taiwan's freedom and democracy, describing
it as a model for China and other nations. Therefore, the more democratic Taiwan
becomes, the more strongly it can exert a "lighthouse effect" for China's
democratization, and the more it can contribute to safeguarding security and
stability in the Asia-Pacific region. This evolutionary process, moreover, is in
line with the common interests of the United States,  Japan,  and neighboring
nations.</P>
      <P>With China's rapid rise and relentless military build-up, the "China threat" is
no longer confined to confrontation across the Taiwan Strait. In fact, it has
already seriously impacted world peace. Members of the international community
not only should refuse to join forces with China in suppressing Taiwan's
democracy, but should strongly demand that China immediately withdraw missiles
deployed along its southeastern coast and targeted at Taiwan, stop military
exercises simulating  attacks on Taiwan,  abolish its so-called anti-secession
law, and accelerate political and democratic reforms. We believe that only
through China's democratic awakening can there be lasting peace in the world.</P>
      <P>Faced with China's ever-more belligerent rhetoric and military intimidation
since I took office, I have extended numerous olive branches expressing our
desire for peace and conciliation. In return, we have been subjected  to
Beijing's  five-pronged  policy of suppression, aimed at denigrating our nation,
marginalizing it in the world, cultivating the perception that Taiwan is a local
region of China,  delegitimizing  its  government,  and  undermining  its
sovereignty. To safeguard cross-strait and regional security and stability,
however, we have never diverged from our fundamental policy of maintaining a
firm stance and moving forward pragmatically as the basis for pursuing
normalization of Taiwan-China relations.</P>
      <P>Between 2000 and 2006, the annual number of visits by Taiwan's people to China
increased from 3.11 million to 4.41 million, or an average of more than 12,000
visits per day.</P>
      <P>Regarding direct transportation between Taiwan and China, whereas during the
2003 Lunar New Year holidays, Taiwan's air carriers first provided one-way,
indirect passenger charter flights, during the 2005 Lunar New Year holidays, air
carriers of both sides provided nonstop charter flights. Furthermore, in June
2006, four categories of charter flights were launched [passenger  flights
during major holidays, special cargo flights, medical emergency flights, and
other humanitarian flights].</P>
      <P>At present, passenger charter flight services are provided for more than ten
weeks a year around the times of major festivals, carrying some 100,000
travelers. Moreover, our people make some 600,000 visits to China every year as
part of the "mini-three-links" [direct mail and commercial links are already in
place, while direct transportation is only provided between Taiwan's Kinmen,
Matsu and Penghu islands and ports in China's Fujian Province]. I believe these
transportation arrangements have succeeded in satisfying the demands of Taiwan's
citizens who wish to visit China.</P>
      <P>These figures are an indication that the importance of political considerations
in discussions concerning the "three links" [the aforementioned direct links,
but between Taiwan proper and other destinations in China] far exceeds that of
satisfying transportation demands. Unless one is willing to totally disregard
national security imperatives and abjectly surrender, the three links must
evolve in an orderly, gradual manner. Certainly, it is impossible to reach the
final goal of opening up free and direct links in one huge leap, or to impose
any timeline.</P>
      <P>As I have often reiterated in the past, the mini-three-links must precede the
three links; charter flights must precede regularly scheduled flights; and
facilitation of cargo transportation must precede that of passenger
transportation. Now, the ball is in China's court.  If China truly has the
sincere desire to enter into negotiations on facilitation of cargo charter
flights, we can look forward to solving a lot of problems.</P>
      <P>Regarding economic relations between Taiwan and China: The volume of two-way
trade was US$31.2 billion in 2000, and rose to US$88.1 billion in 2006. Over the
same period, according to the Investment Commission of the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, annual China-bound investment figures increased from US$2.6 billion to
US$7.6 billion, and registered investments in China totaled US$46.6 billion, or
about NT$1.56 trillion. This goes to show that economic interchange between
Taiwan and China has become overheated, not too cold. About 70 percent of all
outbound investment goes to China. This cannot be considered normal for any
country.</P>
      <P>Taiwan cannot cut itself off from the world, nor can it afford to lock all of
its economic bargaining chips and lifeblood in China. It is perfectly
understandable that businesses strive for profits. For its part,  however,  our
government  must consider the impact Taiwan-China trade has on the capital and
labor markets as well as on the livelihoods of farmers, fishermen, and people in
the middle and lower income brackets.  It must also strictly  safeguard  the
sustainable development of industries in Taiwan. Therefore, our economic  policy
of  "proactive  management  and  effective liberalization"  vis-a-vis Taiwan-
China  economic interaction is certainly correct and necessary.</P>
      <P>Though China is a very important market, it is not the only or ultimate market.
We can never accept a "Taiwan-China common market"X that is, a "one China
market" based on acceptance of Beijing's "one China principle"Xas that would
cause Taiwan's economy to lose its autonomy and render it utterly defenseless.
China's cheap labor and agricultural products would flood the Taiwan market,
resulting in our being economically absorbed even before we have been
politically annexed. Only by keeping a firm grip on Taiwan's economic lifeblood
can we ensure our nation's continued existence and sustainable development.
Over the past seven years, some people have tried to promote disparagement of
Taiwan's prospects as a political movement. Recently, they have even repeatedly
claimed that Taiwan has lost its place as one of the "four Asian tigers." I
would like to call upon my compatriots to realize that so long as we cherish
Taiwan in our hearts, we certainly will not fail to note its presence as an
economic power. Take, for example, forecasts for this year released by Taiwan's
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and by the Central Bank
of Korea concerning their respective nations: lEEach country's economy will grow
by 4.6 percent. lETaiwan's consumer price index will post a rise of 1.5 percent,
South Korea's a rise of 2.5 percent. lETaiwan's unemployment rate for the year
will be about 3.8 percent, compared to South Korea's 3.3 percent. lEAnd the
ratio of average  incomes  in the highest-20-percent  and lowest-20-percent
income brackets is 6: 1 in Taiwan, while in South Korea it is 8:1.</P>
      <P>Also according to the two organizations' projections for 2007, although Taiwan's
nominal GDP per capita, at US$16,563, will be less than that of South Korea's
US$19,921, when evaluated in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP) ,  and
discounting exchange rate fluctuations, Taiwan's GDP per capita figure is
equivalent to US$31,041 while South Korea's is equal to US$23,331.</P>
      <P>As of the end of last year, Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves amounted to
US$266.2 billion, while those of South Korea stood at US$239 billion. Our
government's outstanding debt-to-GDP ratio was 31 percent as compared to South
Korea's 33.4 percent.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the 2007 World Competitiveness Report released by the International
Institute for Management Development on May 10 this year ranked Taiwan 18th and
South Korea 29th. Meanwhile, in the three major indices of the World Economic
Forum's Global Competitiveness Report  2006-2007  released  in  September
2006Xthe  Growth Competitiveness Index, the Global Competitiveness Index, and
the Business Competitiveness IndexXTaiwan ranked 6th (first in Asia) , 13th, and
21st, respectively, while South Korea ranked 21st, 24th, and 25th.</P>
      <P>As the aforementioned statistics and rankings demonstrate, Taiwan is no less
impressive, economically speaking, than South Korea, both nations qualifying as
an "Asian tiger" in terms of overall economic performance, government finance,
domestic real purchasing power, and various competitiveness rankings.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan's production values in the important categories of large TFT-
LCD flat panel manufacturing, contract IC chip-making, and IC packaging and
testing rank first in the world. As of the end of August, this year's business
turnover at Taiwan's three major science parksXHsinchu Science Park, Central
Taiwan Science Park, and Southern Taiwan Science ParkXstood at NT$1.23 trillion
[about US$37.88 billion]. This figure is expected to increase to a record high
of NT$2 trillion [about US$60.6 billion] by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>In the future, this administration will work to accelerate development of, and
attract investment in, the newly expanded facilities of each science park. It
will also work to promote precision machinery, communications electronics, and
biotechnology to become  Taiwan's  third,  fourth,  and fifth trillion-NT-dollar
industries, following the semiconductor and flat panel industries. It is hoped
that this will help achieve the goal of balanced industrial and regional
development within Taiwan. As for the stock market, which reflects our economy's
prospects, the Taiwan Stock Exchange weighted index has risen about 25 percent
from the beginning of the year, and the overall value of traded stocks has hit
record highs.</P>
      <P>As can be seen, far from falling out of the ranks of the four Asian tigers,
Taiwan has become a leader in numerous high-tech realms. It has expanded beyond
Asia to achieve a global presence. Given this shining record, I am confident
that as long as we keep Taiwan in our hearts and have confidence in her, she
will certainly have high visibility in the world.</P>
      <P>At the same time that this administration has pursued economic prosperity, we
have never forgotten to work toward social fairness and justice. Over the past
year, especially since Premier Chang Chun-hsiung took office, we have been
striving in that direction by pushing forward the "Big Investment, Great Warmth"
plan. For the first time in a decade, we raised the minimum monthly wage by 9.09
percent, and the minimum hourly wage by 44 percent, from NT$66 to NT$95. Over
1.4 million workers are benefiting from these measures.</P>
      <P>In addition, following the enactment of its organic law, the Labor Pension Fund
Supervisory Committee was established, whose purpose is to enable 8 million
workers to share in the fruits of economic growth and enjoy greater security in
post-retirement life by "holding shares in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>In the meantime, through cooperation between the ruling and opposition parties,
the National Pension Act was enacted on July 20 of this year. It stipulates that
a national pension system be launched on October 1 of next year, setting in
place the final major piece of our social security network and transforming
Taiwan into a modern welfare state.</P>
      <P>Unquestionably, this is a landmark program designed to realize social fairness,
justice, and solidarity. I would like to urge all of my government colleagues to
complete all complementary measures, to ensure that the national pension system
can be launched and become fully functional on time.</P>
      <P>As for taking care of our farmers and fishermen, the Executive Yuan has raised
the monthly payment to elderly farmers, from NT$3,000 to NT$4,000, then to
NT$5,000, and recently to NT$6,000. It also approved a program for rebuilding
rural villages and completed the drafting of the Farm Village Reconstruction
Act. Once the law is enacted, NT$100 billion [US$3 billion] will be allotted to
stimulate the rural economy, with priority given to improving the living
conditions of disadvantaged citizens. Comprehensive programs will also be
launched to beautify farm villages and improve their public facilities. To
mitigate the impact of rising oil prices on the fishery industry, the Executive
Yuan has approved a program to increase the subsidy for fishing boat fuel to 14
percent as of July 1 this year, while at the same time increasing subsidies for
fishing boat insurance premiums.</P>
      <P>With respect to helping disadvantaged groups, the Executive Yuan has also
completed planning for measures to assist disadvantaged students, including
tuition subsidies for children five years of age and under, and to expand
assistance to the families of students of all ages. The measures will include
the provisions of supplementary after-school tutoring for junior and elementary
school students, as well as increased financial assistance for high school,
vocational high school, technical college, and university students. An estimated
658,000 students will benefit from the new measures. Thereby, we hope to enable
all young people to enjoy equal opportunity in and quality of education.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan continues to provide assistance and guidance to small and
medium-sized enterprisesXthe backbone of Taiwan's economyXwith regard to
finance, research and development, and management. On August 20, it appropriated
NT$10 billion [US$303 million] from the National Development Fund to invest in
small and medium-sized enterprises in cooperation with venture capital funds.
This was the first time the National Development Fund departed from its focus on
the domestic high-tech sector to invest in SMEs. It is anticipated that 1,000
enterprises will benefit and that 20,000 jobs will be created, injecting new
vitality into Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>With ongoing implementation of the three-pronged policy to assist Taiwan's
central and southern areas, its middle and lower classes, and its small and
medium-sized enterprises, this administration is on course to meet the goals of
increasing investment in Taiwan, creating jobs, closing the gap between city and
countryside, and reducing disparities of wealth. In addition to pursuing
sustainable growth, we will work hard to build a "wellness economy" that
accentuates Taiwanese characteristics and places emphasis on quality and human
caring.</P>
      <P>My dear colleagues and compatriots:</P>
      <P>Tomorrow I will leave for the Second Taiwan-Pacific Allies Summit, to be held in
the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Whenever I go abroad, far from home, it
makes me realize the preciousness of my own country.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and its Pacific sister nationsXnamely the Republic of the Marshall
Islands, Solomon Islands, Republic of Palau, Republic of Nauru, Republic of
Kiribati, and TuvaluXshare a deep kinship because we are all oceanic nations,
and their peoples as well as our indigenous peoples are all Austronesians.</P>
      <P>Since I became President, I have visited all of these nations and have witnessed
their efforts in pursuit of prosperity, development, and happiness. When I
compare what I have seen with what the 23 million people of Taiwan have
undergone in the past half century, I know we should cherish even more what we
have today.</P>
      <P>In the past few years, Taiwan-born stars, such as Ang Lee, Wang Chien-ming, Chen
Shih-hsin, Chu Mu-yen, Kevin Lin, Chan Yung-jan, and Chuang Chia-jung, have had
stellar performances on the world stage and continue to bring honor to the
nation. It is hard to put into words the pride we feel for their outstanding
achievements.</P>
      <P>At the same time, however, we feel deep distress when people, for political
reasons and in pursuit of power, disparage Taiwan. For in denying Taiwan, they
deny all the sacrifices and contributions made by the 23 million people of
Taiwan for their nation over the past half century and more.</P>
      <P>My dear fellow citizens, Taiwan is a success story. We should not underestimate
and look down on ourselves. Taiwan is our homeland, our mother. It is the 23
million Taiwanese people's foundation and source of hope for development. If we
lose Taiwan, we will lose everything. Taiwan has never been marginalized or
ceased to be one of the four Asian tigers.</P>
      <P>As long as we have Taiwan in our hearts, Taiwan will surely always be prominent.
We, as her children, must work to strengthen ourselves and unite with a spirit
of sincerity, and we must use our hard work, wisdom, and creativity to make her
visible to the whole world.</P>
      <P>In closing, let me wish you a happy Double Tenth National Day. May our great
nation enjoy peace and everlasting prosperity. To all our distinguished guests,
fellow citizens, and colleagues, may you enjoy good health and success in all of
your endeavors. Long live democracy, and go, Taiwan! Thank you.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President was rash to bash `common market' advocacy: KMT candidate</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang presidential candidate  Ma Ying-jeou  discounted
Wednesday  President  Chen Shui-bian's criticism of a "Taiwan-China common
market" advocacy, saying that the president was rash in criticizing  it before
understanding the matter clearly.</P>
      <P>Chen said during his National Day address earlier that day that "we can never
accept a `Taiwan-China common market' -- that is, a `one China market' based on
acceptance of Beijing's `one China' principle -- as that would cause Taiwan's
economy to lose its autonomy and render it utterly defenseless."</P>
      <P>In response, Ma said it is pitiful that Chen had failed to grasp what the
"Taiwan-China common market" idea -- advocated by Ma's running mate, Vincent
Siew, who has served as premier and minister of economic affairs -- is about
before lashing his criticism at the idea.</P>
      <P>Ma explained  that before the "common market" concept  is implemented, the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait should first sign cross-strait cooperation agreements
on various economic issues, including an investment guarantee agreement, a
bilateral taxation exemption agreement and a dispute-solving agreement.</P>
      <P>Noting that not even the former European Common Market was achieved in one huge
leap, Ma said it would take time for the "Taiwan-China common market" to take
shape step by step.</P>
      <P>Responding to Chen's criticism of Ma's promise that if he is elected, he will
open the cross-strait "three links" immediately, Ma said it would take at least
one year for the two sides to sort out relevant laws and regulations as well as
operating problems before the two sides could discuss any agreement, adding that
the president also misinterpreted his idea about the "three links" matter.</P>
      <P>Regarding the opening of the "three links, " Chen said in his National Day
address that "unless one is willing to totally disregard national security
imperatives and abjectly surrender, the three links must evolve in an orderly,
gradual manner. Certainly, it is impossible to reach the final goal of opening
up free and direct links in one huge leap, or to impose any timeline."</P>
      <P>Ma also pointed out that both Chen and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
presidential candidate, Frank Hsieh, have agreed that direct "three links"
should be opened the sooner the better.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Labor income share in Taiwan's GDP declining: DGBAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 10 (CNA)
10/10/07  18:38:04
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The share of labor income in Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) has been
declining over the past two decades, with the ratio having dropped from 51.4
percent in 1990 to 45.8 percent in 2005, according to a report released
Wednesday by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The DGBAS attributed  the trend to the limited growth in employment
opportunities and earnings as a result of industrial exodus and labor outflow to
China.</P>
      <P>The report said over the past 20 years, the globalization of businesses and the
release of huge labor force by emerging markets, including China, India and the
former East Bloc countries, have impacted the global labor market considerably.</P>
      <P>As shown in the 2007 employment outlook report published in June by the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) , the combined
labor force provided by Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRICs) accounted for 45
percent of the world's total in 2005, compared with less than 20 percent by OECD
countries, the report said.</P>
      <P>The participation of a large amount of cheap labor force by developing economies
in the global market has put advanced economies under the pressure of trimming
down the pay for their workers, which has led to the fall in labor income shares
in their GDPs, according to the report.</P>
      <P>For example, the report noted, the labor income shares in the GDPs of advanced
economies declined 6.8 percentage points on average during the 1980-2005 period,
with that of the United States decreasing by 3.9 percentage points, Europe by
9.5 percentage points and Japan by 11.5 percentage points.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the globalization of labor has had greater impact on
workers in unskilled sectors than on those in skilled sectors. While unskilled
workers in Europe and Japan have seen a decrease of more than 10 percent over
the past 20 years, those in the United States have also been decreasing since
2000.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the income disparity between skilled and unskilled workers have also
been expanding as a result of the globalization of labor, the report said,
adding that the government has tried to lessen the impact by introducing
measures such as completing the social security network, subsidizing vocational
training programs, providing unemployment allowances, and upgrading the skills
of workers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu claimed Tuesday at an evening gala to celebrate the
Republic of China National Day that there are "two ROCs" -- one that she claimed
"was established" in Taiwan after the first direct presidential election in
1996, and another one that was established in Nanjing, China in 1912.</P>
      <P>Addressing the gathering, Lu said this year would be the last time for her and
President Chen Shui-bian to host the National Day ceremony in front of the
Presidential Office, adding that both of them have a common wish that Taiwan can
become a normal, complete and beautiful country even though the process of
reaching that goal is very difficult.</P>
      <P>Referring to criticism that the government's efforts to apply for U.N.
membership under the name Taiwan for the first time this year could cross the
"red line" drawn by the United States and have annoyed the U.S. and China, Lu
said it is ridiculous that when people all over the world call the country
Taiwan, the people of Taiwan themselves are "not allowed" to use the title and
use it to join the United Nations.</P>
      <P>She said the Taiwan people must not question the country's status, adding that
no matter who is elected Taiwan's president in 2008, the next president is duty-
bound to make Taiwan a normal country.</P>
      <P>Moreover, issues surrounding Taiwan and the Republic of China should be
addressed, Lu said, adding that there was an ROC that was founded in Nanjing,
China in 1912, the government of which was later ousted by the People's Republic
of China and forced to flee to Taiwan in 1949. According to Lu's claim, "another
ROC" is a sovereign independent country that was born in Taiwan March 23, 1996
when the people of Taiwan directly elected their president.</P>
      <P>The evening gala was held at the Taiwan Police College in Taipei on the eve of
National Day.</P>
      <P>The event was organized by the Overseas Compatriot Affairs Commission (OCAC)
mainly for Taiwan expatriates who returned to Taiwan to attend the National Day
celebrations.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung also attended the party, during which he explained the
government's policies on issues related to Taiwan's separate identity, measures
to take care of disadvantaged groups, education subsidies, the national pension
system, incentives to attract expatriates to invest in Taiwan and Taiwan's bid
to join the United Nations under the name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the same occasion, OCAC Chairwoman Chang Fu-mei encouraged expatriates to use
the travel subsidy of NT$3,200 offered by the government to take a one-day tour
of Taiwan by high speed rail.</P>

      <P>Council for Economic Planning and Development Chairwoman Ho Mei-yueh said
Wednesday that she was "not nervous" about a negative sovereign rating targeting
Taiwan in the Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P) Rating Services' 2007 Asia-Pacific
local and regional government rating report.</P>
      <P>Ho said future ratings of this kind will improve gradually because Taiwan has
done well in improving its financial condition in recent years, proven by the
government enjoying a budget surplus of NT$16.6 billion (US$508.5 million) in
2006 after deducting its annual spending from its income that year.</P>
      <P>Besides, Ho went on, it was the first time in nine years that the government's
2008 general budget will have a deficit smaller than NT$100 billion.</P>
      <P>In the S&amp;P report released earlier in the day, the global leader in credit
ratings and credit analysis stated that although Taiwan's government gained
increasing income in the short term, its budget deficits and debts are not seen
to have obvious changes in the long run.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the report said, tense relations between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait have continued to affect Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Fuji were the only two of 22 regional sovereign entities to undergo

      <P>Republic of China Representative to the United States Joseph Wu predicted
Tuesday that the differences between Taiwan and the U.S. will eventually be
resolved.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks during an interview with a Washington-based journalist of Al
Jazeera English, a 24-hour English-language news TV channel headquartered in
Doha, Qatar. The interview is slated to be aired Oct. 12.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of official diplomatic ties between Taiwan and the U.S., Wu
said that he has smooth communication channels with U.S. government officials
and lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Although he is not allowed to enter the State Department, the White House, or
other federal institutions, he can still meet U.S. officials in other places, Wu
added.</P>
      <P>During the past six months since he took up the post, Wu admitted that Taiwan
and the U.S. have "occasionally differed on certain political issues."</P>
      <P>Describing both countries as "free and democratic, " Wu said he believes that
sincere communication will eventually smooth the differences between the two
sides.</P>
      <P>Offering his appreciation to President George W. Bush for mentioning Taiwan's
free democracy in his speeches delivered in Sydney, Kyoto and the Czech
Republic, Wu said the government appreciates the great contribution the U.S. has
made in the past to Taiwan's democracy and prosperity.</P>
      <P>Wu also said he hopes Taiwan-U.S. relations can be furthered in the future.</P>
      <P>He called on the U.S. to sign a free trade agreement (FTA) with Taiwan as soon
as possible,  saying that Taiwan is America's ninth-largest trading partner and
the fifth-largest importer of U.S. agricultural products.</P>
      <P>A Taiwan-U.S. FTA would increase bilateral trade relations and help U.S.
companies further develop their markets in Taiwan, according to Wu.</P>
      <P>Noting that some of his job challenges come from China's oppression,  Wu said
Beijing  often  interferes  with Taiwan's invitations to U.S. lawmakers,
governors and other officials to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the one hand, China claims Taiwan as part of China, while on the other, it

      <P>Noise complaints reported to the police declined  during the January-September
period,  thanks to the Environmental Protection Administration's (EPA's) offer
of assistance to local  businesses  in solving  their  noise  problems,  an
administration official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>During the period, the number of noise complaints decreased by 727 as compared
with the same period of last year, the official said.</P>
      <P>The decrease could be partly attributed to the administration's success in
helping 121 businesses cope with the problems of noise made by their equipment
and facilities, the official said.</P>
      <P>Among those businesses, the official said, entertainment shops accounted for 66
percent, followed by factories at 25 percent and engineering construction
companies at 2 percent.</P>
      <P>In the past few years, reported noise complaints have risen significantly with

    <HEADLINE>Flocks of gray-faced buzzards arrive in Taiwan on transit stop</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Groups of gray-faced buzzards landed in Kenting National Park in southern Taiwan
Wednesday amid celebrations of the country's Double Ten National Day, a wild
bird expert for the park reported.</P>
      <P>Tsai Yi-jung said the park administration office, Pingtung forest rangers and
county police mobilized a large force Oct. 1 in an effort to protect the
migratory birds from poaching. However, as of Tuesday, he had only recorded 12
buzzards of this kind.</P>
      <P>It was delightful to see flocks and flocks of gray-faced buzzards flying over
the national park today, Tsai said, describing the scene as reminiscent of the
military parade that took place earlier in front of the Presidential Office in
Taipei in celebration of National Day.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has long been an Asia-Pacific stopover point for these birds on their
annual migration to escape the winter cold of Siberia and northeastern China and
seek warmth in Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Because the birds are often observed arriving in Taiwan around the time off the
Oct. 10 National Day, they have been dubbed by locals as "National Day birds."</P>
      <P>Tsai said the number of gray-faced buzzards transiting the island reached 35,000
last autumn, the largest number recorded in the past 10 years. In 2005, only
8,000 of these raptors were seen visiting the island, he added, noting that low
number is far less than the number of birds previous taken by poachers each
year.</P>
      <P>To stem habitual poaching, the Pingtung county government and Kenting park
recruited former poachers this year to form a task force of bird wardens to
protect these wild winter guests.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President Chen vows not to accept 'one China' market</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  10 (CNA)
10/10/07  21:40:28
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday that Taiwan will not accept a proposed
Chinese common market based on the "one China" concept, because such a format
would invite a deluge of cheap Chinese goods and result in a Chinese economic
invasion of Taiwan to be followed by political unification.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while addressing a ceremony marking the 96th Oct.  10
National Day of the Republic of China in the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Stressing that a proposed cross-Taiwan Strait common market would undoubtedly
put Taiwan under serious threat of an influx of cheap Chinese workers and farm
produce, Chen characterized the proposal as an economic invasion and a prelude
to political unification between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Chen insisted that full, direct cross-strait transport links must be implemented
in a piecemeal fashion, starting with the so-called mini links -- direct ferry
services between Taiwan-held Kinmen and Matsu islands and three ports in China's
Fujian Province. He further stated that charter flights must be put in place to
pave way for regular flight service, and that cargo delivery must be implemented
ahead of passenger travel.</P>
      <P>Since 2003 when the first-ever special Lunar New Year charter flights took place
between Taiwan and China, cross-strait charter flight service has been
implemented on a short-term basis for four major festivals, he said, adding that
coupled with the mini-links shipping service should be able to provide Taiwan
people with sufficient access to travel to China.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, discussions surrounding the establishment of China links in
Taiwan have become politically charged rather than remaining purely a
transportation concern.</P>
      <P>Chen then asserted that unless national security is cast aside and Taiwan is
prepared to surrender to China, it is impossible for the government to open full
direct cross-strait air and shipping services in the short term.</P>
      <P>Although it is true that Taiwan cannot remain reclusive, he said that does not
mean that it is good for the country to rely on China for its economic
development. "China is by no means the sole world market available to Taiwan,
and we will not accept a proposed 'one China' common market," he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-China trade totaled US$88.1 billion in 2006, nearly triple the US$31.2
billion level in 2000, while during the same seven-year period, Taiwanese
investment in China jumped to US$7.6 billion, up from US$2.6 billion, Chen cited
statistics compiled by the Ministry of Economic Affairs as saying.</P>
      <P>He stressed that Taiwan's economy has been too heavily dependent on the Chinese
market, pointing to the fact that China currently absorbs at least 70 percent of
Taiwan's outbound investment.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen continued that he will spare no efforts in pursuing the
normalization of Taiwan-China ties despite the fact that China has stepped  up
its saber-rattling  against  Taiwan and consistently given his peace overtures
the cold shoulder.</P>
      <P>The president voiced regret that the aspirations of Taiwan's people for
democracy has long been interpreted by China as a move toward promoting "de-jure
Taiwan independence, " and said that the core of the cross-strait conflict does
not reside in Taiwan's pursuit of democracy, freedom and human rights, but in
China. He went on to assert that "China's hegemonic and authoritarian regime is
an issue to which the international community must face up."</P>
      <P>Now that China has proclaimed "One World, One Dream" as the slogan of the 2008
Olympic Games in Beijing, international society should have the moral courage to
demand that China implement the universal principles of freedom, democracy,
human rights and peace, he said.</P>
      <P>Chen further urged the international community not to bow before China's growing
military might and said that it must not overlook China's persistent
intimidation of Taiwan just because of their business interests and investments
in that country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ex-DPP chairman calls for no amnesty for corrupt ranking officials</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  10 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Shih Ming-teh, a former chairman of the ruling  Democratic  Progressive  Party
(DPP)  who  led  mass anti-corruption protests aimed at President Chen Shui-bian
last year, voiced opposition Wednesday to an idea of granting amnesty or special
pardons to ranking officials found guilty of misusing state funds allocated for
their special missions or discretionary use.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks to reporters after attending National Day celebrations in
front of the Presidential Office for some 30 minutes. Shih was invited by the
National Security Bureau to take part in the ceremony despite his leadership
role in the "red clad" protests against Chen a year ago.</P>
      <P>Expressing his deep dissatisfaction with the DPP government dogged by a series
of corruption scandals in recent years after Chen came to power in 2000, Shih
said the public should exercise self-reflection on National Day instead of
engaging in celebrations.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, who has been dubbed by some the "Nelson Mandela of Taiwan,"
he was proud and rejoiced on May 20, 2000 when witnessing Chen swear to bring
happiness and make Taiwan a democratic and free country at the same venue,
thinking that his life-long struggle for democracy and freedom against the
previous Kuomintang (KMT) government had at last come to an end.</P>
      <P>But with so many people living in misery and desperation seven years after the
DPP came to power, Shih wondered how could so many brazen-faced  political
figures,  regardless  of  their  party affiliation, be in a mood to celebrate.</P>
      <P>The transfer of power from the KMT to the DPP only paved the way for a newly
corrupt party to replace the old, Shih said, questioning whether DPP members
still remember the party's past pledge to "be diligent, love Taiwan and practice
clean politics."</P>
      <P>Although the large number of protesters wearing a red T-shirt failed to make
Chen resign from the presidency to take responsibility for a string of
corruption  scandals involving  his wife and son-in-law, Shih asserted that Chen
still must face legal sanctions after he steps down from the post in May next
year.</P>
      <P>Shih said Taiwan must be revamped to become a normal country and called for the
establishment of an independent judicial system to achieve that goal.</P>

      <P>A dazzling fireworks display brightened the night sky over Dapeng Bay in the
southern Taiwan county of Pingtung Wednesday, bringing a stunning climax to this
year's Double Ten National Day celebrations.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of thousands of ecstatic spectators crowded both sides of the Dapeng
Bay to watch the hour-long extravaganza, which started at 7:00 p.m. in
celebration of the Republic of China's 96th birthday.</P>
      <P>The fireworks show was staged in the Taiwan Strait some 400 meters off the

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will announce his assent to take the helm of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) at a news conference scheduled for 10: 10
a.m. Thursday, according to Presidential  Office Deputy Secretary General Cho
Jung-tai.</P>
      <P>Cho said President Chen will host the news conference in person. Asked whether
Chen will take questions from reporters during the 30-minute news conference,
Cho said it will depend on the situation.</P>
      <P>The DPP's decision-making Central Executive Committee passed a resolution Oct. 5
requesting Chen to concurrently take over the party's chairmanship, a post that
has been left vacant since the resignation of Yu Shyi-kun following his
indictment on graft charges Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>After pondering over the matter for several days, Chen has come to a decision to
take up the DPP's helm again, party sources said.</P>
      <P>Chen concurrently served as DPP chairman between 2002 and early 2005. He quit
the DPP chairmanship after the party failed to win a majority in the late 2004
legislative elections.</P>
      <P>According to party sources, Chen will announce at Thursday's news conference the
appointment of Cho as new DPP secretary-general.</P>
      <P>Cho himself was tight-lipped on his new job, saying that he cannot make any

that Spain, Denmark and the Czech Republic have agreed to exchange "temporary
aviation rights" with the ROC to facilitate bilateral visits.

2001: Chang Siao-yueh, spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs says that
the ROC government supports the U.S.-launched war against terrorism and has
taken steps to prevent terrorists from laundering money in Taiwan.

2001: The results of the first stage of a nationwide English evaluation
examination for people with a junior high school education background are

absolute truth that can order and adjust the great relations of human society,
fix the fundamental principles of morality, and understand the laws of creation

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has set its budget at NT$31.56 billion
(US$956.36 million) for next year, marking a record high, Vice Foreign Affairs
Minister Yang Tzu-pao said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The budget represents an increase of NT$2.7 billion, or an annual growth of 10
percent, over the NT$28.86 billion budget for this year, Yang said, adding that
the increased funds will be mainly used for foreign aid to boost international
cooperation. According to Yang, foreign aid will total NT$1.71 billion, or
around 0.13 percent of gross national product.</P>
      <P>He said the ratio is still lower than the 0.7 percent set as a target by the
United Nations, adding that the ministry will continue to push for foreign aid
programs taking into consideration the nation's financial situation and foreign
diplomatic needs.</P>
      <P>Yang made the remarks while delivering a report on the ministry's budget for
2008 at meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs Committee.</P>
      <P>He noted that the expenditures of NT$31.56 billion for 2008 will include an open
budget of NT$25.78 billion, of which he said NT$11.94 billion will be used for
international cooperation programs, marking an increase of NT$1.71 billion over
the level for this year.</P>
      <P>As for the portion of the budget that will remain confidential, which will total
NT$5.78 billion, the funds will chiefly be used to cement Taiwan's ties with its
diplomatic allies, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently maintains formal diplomatic relations with 24 countries around

      <P>The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) said Thursday that it will conduct an
investigation into the crude oil purchase costs of the state-owned CPC Corp.
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Commission officials said that they will report on the results of the
investigation to the Legislative Yuan in December. Whether the level of recent
petroleum price hikes is reasonable will be known by then, they added.</P>
      <P>The officials made the remarks at meeting of the Economics and Energy Committee
of the Legislative Yuan during which the commission reviewed the budget of the
FTC and passed a resolution requesting that the commission</P>
      <P>immediately conduct a probe into the CPC's oil purchase costs.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wang Tu-fa of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party said that the
CPC has raised petroleum prices repeatedly over the past year based on the
company's calculations that its crude oil purchase costs have accounted for 80
percent of its operating costs.</P>
      <P>Wang claimed that the ratio should only be a little more than 60 percent judging
from the CPC's financial statements. If the costs of phasing out old equipment
are factored in, then the ratio is less than 60 percent, he said.</P>
      <P>Noting that excessive price hikes go against the public's interests, Wang urged
the commission to look into the discrepancy between his calculations and those
of the CPC.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) has started buying unhusked rice
damaged by Typhoon Krosa to help ease rice farmers' financial losses, a COA

      <P>An adult brown booby (sula leucogaster) -- a large seabird of the gannet family
-- which was probably affected by Typhoon Krosa and had drifted from eastern
Taiwan to the west where it was captured, was released into the wild Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the Society for Wildlife and Nature (SWAN) of Taiwan, the bird was
sighted Oct. 8 resting on the deck of a freighter that was anchored in Taichung
Harbor on the west coast of central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The harbor authorities notified SWAN about the unprecedented sighting of the
rare bird that same day, and specialists from the organization went to the
harbor to capture it.</P>
      <P>After examining and feeding the brown booby, SWAN specialists found that the
bird was exhausted but had suffered no physical injuries. They decided to let it
rest for two days before setting it free.</P>
      <P>The booby is a rare seabird and there are only nine species worldwide, only one
of which appears near Taiwan's east coast.</P>
      <P>An adult brown booby reaches about 76 cm in length, with a wingspan of 145 cm.
Its head and upper body are dark brown, with the remainder white.</P>
      <P>While these birds are typically silent, bird watchers have reported them making
occasional sounds similar to grunting or quacking.</P>
      <P>The species breeds on islands and coasts in pantropical areas of the Atlantic
and Pacific oceans. They also frequent the islands in the Gulf of Mexico and the
Caribbean Sea.</P>
      <P>Brown booby pairs may remain together over several seasons. They perform
elaborate greeting rituals.</P>
      <P>They are spectacular divers, plunging into the ocean at high speed. They mainly
eat small fish or squid that they catch near the surface and they can also catch
leaping fish while skimming the surface.</P>
      <P>Although brown boobies are powerful and agile fliers, they are particularly
clumsy in takeoffs and landings -- often an adult bird needs a run-up of 10
meters before it can build up enough speed to take off.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that Taiwan should stop taking the
"guise" of the Republic of China, as the country's sovereign territory covers
only Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu but not China.</P>
      <P>Chen urged the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) to stop "deceiving" the people of
Taiwan and recognize "the fact that the name Republic of China is totally
unacceptable in the international community, " noting that the name has been
rejected in almost all international organizations, including the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum, the World Trade Organization and the World Health
Organization.</P>
      <P>"Don't do things that not even you (the KMT) believe in. Having been cheating
for decades, are you going to go on cheating? " Chen asked.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during a news conference held ahead of his planned visit
to the Marshall Islands, during which he also announced his acceptance  of the
chairmanship  of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>A day earlier, KMT presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou accused the DPP of
"colluding with the Chinese communists to eradicate the ROC, " after Chen
avoided the term ROC in his National Day Address and substituted it with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In defense, Chen said Ma should not have said things that were "inconsistent
with history, " claiming that the ROC was toppled by the Communist Party of
China rather than by the DPP.</P>
      <P>Even the late ROC President and KMT Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, who resumed office
in Taipei in 1950 after fleeing from China to Taiwan, admitted that the loss of
China to the communists meant the downfall of the ROC, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen further challenged Ma to clarify if the ROC he referred to was the one that
co-founded the United Nations in 1945, while calling Ma's attention to the facts
that Taiwan was a Japanese colony when the ROC was established in 1912 in
Nanjing, China and that the ROC Constitution did not include Taiwan when it was
drafted in 1946.</P>
      <P>"It was the existence of Taiwan that enabled Chiang Kai-shek to continue his
regime here under the guise of the ROC. Let bygones be bygones, but we must be
very clear as to what we are," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that as many as 85 percent of the people in Taiwan think the
country's sovereignty covers only Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu but not China
or Outer Mongolia, Chen called on the KMT to admit the "factual status quo" that
"Taiwan is Taiwan."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that getting a planned referendum on the
country's bid to join the United Nations under the name Taiwan passed will be
his "only focus" after taking the helm of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks at a news conference during which he announced
that he will concurrently serve as DPP chairman.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed hope that the DPP-initiated U.N. bid referendum proposal will
solicit 2 million signatures, more than twice the required 850,000 signatures,
in a show of the will and determination of the public in the quest for U.N.
seat. The proposed referendum will take place alongside the March 22
presidential election next year.</P>
      <P>He also expressed hope that the proposal will be passed by receiving more than 8
million "yes" votes.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that a constitutional reform proposal will have a much higher
threshold to be considered passed, as it will require "yes" votes from half of
the eligible voters. A referendum on Taiwan's U.N. bid will only need half of
the voters to turn out and half of them to give approval to be considered
passed.</P>
      <P>The president said that constitutional reforms, amendments or a new constitution
will first require a proposal by three-quarters of the legislators before the
proposal can be put to a referendum, which will be considered passed if half of
the eligible voters cast "yes" ballots.</P>
      <P>As there are no constitutional reform or new constitution proposals in the
legislature, it is "out of the question" that there will be any constitutional
reform before March 2008, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen also described the Referendum Law as "flawed," which he said has hampered
the public's rights and freedom to exercise a referendum, adding that the
problem needs to be redressed.</P>
      <P>But he said redressing the Referendum Law will not affect the DPP-initiated
planned referendums on retrieving the ill-gotten assets amassed by the main
opposition Kuomintang during its five decades of rule, as well as on Taiwan's
membership of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Chen pledged in his 2004 inauguration address that by the time he completes his
presidency in 2008, he would hand the people of Taiwan a new constitution that
is "timely, relevant and viable."</P>

      <P>Four entrepreneurs have donated a total of NT$900 million (about US$27.6
million) to National Taiwan University (NTU) to fund a project to foster its
Hsinchu campus and make it the centerpiece of the nation's biomedical research,
university sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Of the total, NT$150 million came from Etron Technology, a chip-design company;
NT$50 million was provided by Health Banks, a company specialized in umbilical
cord blood-related technology; NT$350 million was donated by Powerchip
Semiconductor Corp. (PSC) ; and the other NT$350 million was offered by an NTU
alumnus who refused to reveal his name.</P>
      <P>Memoranda of understanding were signed by NTU and three of the four donors on
the same day at a press conference in Taipei.</P>
      <P>According to NTU, the Hsinchu campus will be established in three stages, with

      <P>Approximately 3,000 people attended a party organized by the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Representative Office in Washington, D.C. Wednesday to celebrate the
Republic of China's Double Ten National Day.</P>
      <P>ROC Representative to the United States Joseph Wu delivered remarks at the party
while standing on stage with several U.S. lawmakers, making it the first time an
ROC representative has spoken on such an occasion.</P>
      <P>Nine U.S. congressmen, including Republican presidential candidate Tom Tancredo,
attended the party and many of them voiced support for Taiwan's bid to join the
United Nations.</P>
      <P>Tancredo said he hopes President Chen Shui-bian, who gave congratulatory remarks
in a pre-recorded video message, could personally attend such parties in the
future.</P>
      <P>In his video address, Chen lauded Taiwan's economy, culture and democracy, while
urging other countries to resist pressure from China and support Taiwan becoming
a member of the U.N. and the World Health Organization.</P>
      <P>Wu, for his part, described Taiwan as the U.S.'s ninth-largest trading partner,
the fifth-largest importer of U.S. farm produce, and the world's 16th-largest
economy and said Taiwan should be given the same opportunity as other countries
to sign a free trade agreement with the U.S.</P>
      <P>Also present at the party were U.S. defense officials, the Washington-based
military attaches of El Salvador, Italy and Belgium, as well as American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Managing Director Barbara Schrage and many former AIT
officials.</P>
      <P>A number of renowned academics from Taiwan and the U.S. also attended.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs organized a National Day cocktail
party that was attended by Paraguayan President Nicanor Duarte Frutos, Swaziland
House of Assembly Speaker Prince Guduza Dlamini and Nicaraguan Foreign Minister
Samuel Santos, among 1,000 guests.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the gathering, Foreign Minister James Huang thanked the country's

      <P>The Taipei-based Polaris Research Institute revised upward Thursday its forecast
for Taiwan's economic growth for 2007 from 4.58 percent to 4.61 percent.</P>
      <P>The economy is expected to pick up steam slightly this year, benefiting from
steadily growing economies in the rest of the world, said Liang Kuo-yuan,
president of the research think-tank, at a press briefing.</P>
      <P>The rosy prospects have prompted the institute to revise its forecast for the
country's economic growth for 2007 upward to 4.61 percent from the 2006 level,
slightly higher than the 4.58 percent forecast earlier by the Cabinet-level
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), Liang said.</P>
      <P>Polaris predicted that Taiwan's economic growth will reach 4.59 percent for the
third quarter and 4.62 percent for the fourth quarter, with the growth for the
whole year registering 4.61 percent, Liang added.</P>
      <P>Although the country's exports to the United States and Japan have slowed, its
exports to China, Europe and Southeast Asia have continued to expand, Liang
said, adding that Taiwan's export trade is expected to grow at a rate of 5.87
percent this year, with Q3 and Q4 growth topping 4.69 percent and 7.87 percent,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's import trade is forecast to expand by a rate of 3.4 percent
for the year, with Q3 and Q4 growth reaching 2.96 percent and 7.4 percent,
respectively.</P>
      <P>On the inflation rate, Polaris predicted that the consumer price index (CPI)
will rise by 1.3 percent this year over the 2006 level, mainly as a result of
several typhoons that drove up grocery prices, and rising prices of crude oil,
commodities and other raw materials on the international market.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liang said, the Taipei-based Central Bank of China is forecast to
continue to raise domestic interest rates in Q4 in an effort to get rid of the
deficit suffered by the financial service sector in Q1 and Q2.</P>
      <P>Lower interest rates, in turn, have attracted inflow of foreign funds, shoring
up the value of the new Taiwan dollar, Liang said, adding that the currency is
forecast to reach a rate of NT$32.5 to US$1 in Q4.</P>

      <P>China Airlines (CAL) and EVA Airways -- the country's two largest carriers --
expressed interests Thursday in offering flights to Prague, capital of the Czech
Republic, after Taiwan and the Central European country signed an aviation
agreement earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) Director-General Billy Chang and his
Czech counterpart Jindrich Ploch signed the agreement and CAA officials said
that although CAL currently operates cargo flights between Taipei and Prague, it
has to apply separately for each individual flight.</P>
      <P>With the signing of the formal agreement, the two sides agree to 14 passenger
flights per week, with no limit on the number of cargo flights.</P>
      <P>There will also be fifth freedom for both passenger and cargo flight services,
meaning the right to take on passengers, mail and cargo destined for the
territory of another agreeing nation and to put down passengers, mail and cargo
coming from any such territory.</P>
      <P>CAL is considering cooperating with a Czech air carrier in co-sharing flights in
the initial stages and if there are enough passengers, it might open a Taipei-
Prague route via Bangkok.</P>
      <P>EVA Airways, lured by the extended traffic right, also said it is considering
flying the Taipei-Prague route.</P>
      <P>EVA Airways announced late last month that it had decided to cancel its Taipei-
Paris passenger flight services from Nov. 23 due to increasing operational
costs, and to begin cargo-only service on the route in January 2008.</P>

      <P>Some 220,000 Taiwanese citizens operating businesses in China, known in Taiwan
as taishang, are expected to return to Taiwan in March 2008 to cast their votes
in the next presidential election, a Taiwanese business leader in Beijing said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chang Han-wen, president of the Association of Taiwan Investment Enterprises on

Taiwanese citizens, including taishang, their Taiwanese staff and dependents,
return to Taiwan in the period 10 days before the March 22 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>The effort is aimed at demonstrating the voting strength of taishang, as only by
voting can they make sure their wishes and hopes are valued by the
administration in Taiwan, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>Chang said he had already contacted airline companies and had been told that
220,000 seats will be available in March 2008 for taishang and their dependents
wishing to return to Taiwan to vote.</P>
      <P>If more than this number want to vote,  Chang said, his association will help
make arrangements for additional flights or larger airplanes to satisfy demand.</P>
      <P>Asked to speculate on whether most of the taishang will vote for opposition
Kuomintang presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou, Chang said the taishang are
politically pragmatic and that "they will vote for whoever they consider
beneficial to them,  regardless  of the candidate's political persuasion."</P>

      <P>Police officers will not be required to carry firearms while visiting private
homes, an official with the National Police Agency's (NPA's) census division
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The official was responding to a local newspaper report that policemen will be
allowed to carry firearms while conducting what the newspaper claimed are
"census visits" to the homes of parolees, known suspects  and known criminals
under newly revised regulations governing police work.</P>
      <P>Quoting  unidentified  low-ranking  police  officers,  the Taipei-based China
Times said that as police officers tend to conduct the so-called "census visits"
during their daily patrols -- during which they are obliged to be armed -- the
amended police regulations could lead to the scenario in which police officers
enter private homes carrying firearms for census surveys.</P>
      <P>In response to the newspaper's claims, the NPA spokesman pointed out that the
agency has never demanded police officers carry firearms when conducting census
visits. In fact, since 1992, the official noted, the police have not even been
involved with population registration affairs.</P>
      <P>With the evolution of Taiwan's democratic development, the official went on, the
police have not needed to conduct census surveys.</P>
      <P>As a result, the amended police work rules have enshrined a new mechanism for
"selected household visits" to the homes of parolees, prisoners released on
commuted sentences and those deemed prone to criminal activity. The legislature
passed the amendments June 5.</P>

      <P>A business model connecting production and sightseeing has created opportunities
for enterprises stationed in the Changhua Coastal Industrial Park in central
Taiwan, an economic official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the official of the Industrial Development Bureau under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) , the park's annual business turnover for
2006 reached NT$117.8 billion (US$360.24 million).</P>
      <P>A combination of production and sightseeing helped to improve the enterprises
profiles and images and thus contributed to business performance, the official
said.</P>
      <P>Two successful examples of the business model are the Taiwan Glass Exhibition
Hall operated by Taiwan Mirror Glass Enterprise, and Brand's Health Museum
operated by the makers of the popular brand of nutrition preparations. The
former has attracted 600,000 visitors since its inauguration two years ago,
while the latter draws nearly 50,000 visitors every year, the official said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, an up-and-coming human body museum operated by Show Chwan Memorial
Hospital in collaboration with the National Museum of Natural Science is
believed to have potential for creating more business opportunities for the
park.</P>
      <P>The park had investments by a total of 306 enterprises as of September this
year, up from the 155 in 2002, with total rental land reported as 133.8
hectares.  The government's favorable rental policies initiated in 2002 have
contributed to the increasing number of companies in the park, the official
said.</P>
      <P>The MOEA expects the park's business turnover to achieve new highs in the
future, with the potential of the sightseeing sector, more production, and the
establishment of other facilities such as a glass processing zone and wind power
plants, the official said.</P>

displayed at Taipei 101 to showcase the United Kingdom's creative industries and
highlight their combination of creativity and commercial success.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, titled "Love and Money, " features 20 projects and designers
that balance business ambition and commercial success with the invention and
experimentation for which Britain's creative industries are internationally
renowned,  said Michael Reilly, Director of British Trade and Cultural Office
(BTCO) in Taipei.</P>
      <P>From Oct. 11-21, design projects of well-known architect Zaha Hadid, the first
female architect to win the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize, Tom Dixon,
Jamie Hewlett, and other design companies and studios will try to showcase the
U.K's very best in a number of categories, said curator Christine Losecaat in
the opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>"British design still values money, which means investment and returns, before
emotion, " Hanif Kara, who founded the structural engineering firm Adams Kara
Taylor (ATK) , stated matter-of-factly. However, he added, the degree of
creativity and quality of production are what differentiates good designs from
"just designs."</P>
      <P>A series of events will also be held during the exhibition, including an
architectural design symposium, a design forum, and a "Pecha Kucha Night" at
which invited designers will get together to present and exchange ideas in a
casual setting.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, which is jointly organized by UK Trade and Investment and the

      <P>If Taiwan is serious about connecting with the international community, it needs
to pay attention to education, the media and the general mentality, foreign
representatives said in an international symposium Thursday.</P>
      <P>Representatives from Japan, Singapore and South Korea and foreign
representatives stationed in Taiwan participated in the two-day symposium
organized by the Research, Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC) of the
Executive Yuan to discuss "glocalization, " an invented term used to describe
the tempering effects of local conditions on global pressures.</P>
      <P>As globalization integrates economies and societies around the world, the
process has been affected by each country with its own special character, said
RDEC Minister Shih Nun-jeh.</P>
      <P>Because of this,  the government and people should "think internationally, act
both internationally and locally" and create an English-friendly environment,
Shih added.</P>
      <P>Richard Vuylsteke, Executive Director of the American Chamber of Commerce,
encouraged Taiwan to welcome immigrants rather than marginalize them. Taiwan's
traditional teaching methods should be revised and the media should stop
focusing on Taiwan alone, Vuylsteke also suggested in his presentation.</P>
      <P>Singapore's approach to glocalization can be summed up with a simple "three
pro's" -- pro-growth, pro-talent and pro-harmony -- said Raymond Tan,
International Manpower Division Assistant Director of Singapore's Ministry of
Manpower.</P>
      <P>The keys are to create an investment-friendly environment, attract international
talent and maintain cultural diversity and social harmony, Tan explained.</P>
      <P>Promoting multiculturalism, which enhances "connectedness, " is essential in the
development of glocalization as well as public education, because resistance to
immigrants and other cultures can be expected, said Ron McIntyre, executive
director of the Canadian Trade Office in Taipei.</P>

      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang  (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou outlined
Thursday a plan to boost employment, pledging to create new jobs and increase
income levels for the general public if elected president in the March 22, 2008
presidential poll.</P>
      <P>Ma unveiled the economic and employment stimulus program while giving a speech
to unveil his vision to reinvigorate Taiwan's economy during an investment forum
sponsored by Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.</P>
      <P>Ma stated that he is resolved to turn the financial, tourism and health care
sectors into the three engines responsible for driving up Taiwan's economy, with
average economic growth rates of at least 6 percent per year, an average per-
capita income of US$20,000 by 2011 and a jobless rate under 3 percent by 2012.</P>
      <P>Complaining that Taiwan's economy and the people's livelihoods have markedly
dwindled under the rule of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) over the past
seven years, Ma stressed that he will first act to reform and stimulate Taiwan's
financial system with an aim of creating 30,000 jobs in four years and
contributing NT$1.3 trillion (US$40 billion) to the gross domestic product.</P>
      <P>Secondly, Ma said, he will open Taiwan to Chinese tourists, starting with a
daily limit of 3,000 people in the first year, gradually increasing to 10,000
per day in the fourth year.</P>
      <P>The entry of Chinese tourists is expected to generate NT$200 billion in tourism
revenues by the fourth year of his administration and to create an additional
100,000 fresh jobs within four years.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, Ma said Taiwan should quickly jockey for position in the global travel
medicine market, which might be worth as much as US$26 billion in 2007.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, lifting unreasonable restrictions on service businesses will
help sharpen the three engines of Taiwan's economic expansion, the first step in
his efforts to develop Taiwan into a dual business operations center, namely, a
global business operations hub  for Taiwan  companies  and regional  business
operations headquarters for foreign concerns.</P>

      <P>One-fifth of Taiwan's children suffer from vision problems before they reach 6
years of age, an eye doctor said Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a news conference organized by the Bureau of Health under the Department of
Health, Lin Lung-kuang,  an ophthalmologist with National Taiwan University
Hospital, quoted a recently conducted islandwide eyesight survey as finding that
20 percent of first graders in the country are myopic (nearsighted) and 61.8
percent of sixth graders suffer from myopia.</P>
      <P>Among the sixth graders who suffer from myopia, 2.51 percent have severe myopia
of over 600 degrees, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the news conference, Yang Meng-ling, an eye doctor with Taipei
Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, said television is the No.  1 culprit responsible
for damaging the eyesight of preschool-age children.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has the world's highest per capita number of people with
eyeglasses, Yang urged parents not to allow their children to be glued to the TV
or use computers for long periods, and to prevent children under the age of 3
from using computers.</P>
      <P>Many children are now suffering from shortsightedness by the age of 3 or 4, and
the myopic condition increases by 100 degrees a year, Yang added.</P>
      <P>Wu Pei-chang, an eye doctor with Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital,
attributed childhood myopia mainly to the long periods of time that preschool
children stay indoors at home.</P>
      <P>Wu suggested that parents take their children outdoors more often so that the
youngsters will watch less TV and play computer games less often.</P>
      <P>He said it is wrong to believe that nearsightedness is a problem that can be
tackled by wearing glasses, pointing out that severe myopia can result in a
detached retina or glaucoma, as well as eye neural lesions: problems that will
damage one's eyesight for a lifetime.</P>

      <P>Chen made the remarks at the opening ceremony for the 2007 Taiwan International
Photovoltaic Forum and Exhibition, which will last for two days at the Taipei
International Convention Center.</P>
      <P>Following its successful debut in 2006, the Taiwan International Photovoltaic
Forum and Exhibition has this year expanded in terms of exhibits and number of
attendants, with 74 domestic and overseas companies invited and 110 booths set
up.</P>
      <P>Chen also noted that the linkage between the industry's up- and down-stream has
rapidly developed in recent years, with several leading enterprises, including
Taiwan CPC Corp., investing heavily in silicon material production and other
companies expanding production capacity for photovoltaic components.</P>
      <P>On regulatory renewal, Chen said that the government has enforced several key
statutes, including the one on promoting renewable energy, to encourage and
facilitate the industry's development.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU urges government to tackle low-end tea imports</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers and officials of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) urged
the government Thursday to tackle substandard tea imports from China and
Vietnam, which they said have seriously affected the livelihoods of Taiwan's
growers.</P>
      <P>TSU Secretary-General  Chien Cheng-shan and Legislator  Lai Hsing-yuan issued
the call at a Legislative Yuan news conference.</P>
      <P>Chien and Lai asked the government to apply additional emergency measures,  such
as "imposing  temporary  duty increase on the importation" to deal with the
situation, as rampant cheap tea imports from the two countries have dealt a
heavy blow to local farmers. The Council of Agriculture (COA) has applied to the
Ministry of Economic Affairs for importation relief for local tea growers, they
noted.</P>
      <P>While the COA has promised to grant monetary handouts worth NT$400 million
(US$12.27 million) to local tea farmers, Chien asked when the money will be
delivered to them.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, it will be Taiwan's first case concerning "temporary
importation relief tariff, " and will take only three months for relevant
government agencies to implement the measure -- a time much shorter than an
eight-month period required for a regular importation relief case.</P>
      <P>A "temporary importation relief tariff" can be immediately implemented as long
as preliminary documents are available to prove that large amounts of foreign
imports have hobbled local industry or business, Lai said.</P>
      <P>In response to Chien's query, COA Secretary-General Hsu Han-ching made it clear
that local tea farmers will receive the financial aid by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>According to Lu Su-wen, a COA's section chief, the Ministry of Finance has been
considering whether to impose anti-dumping tax on foreign tea imports, but will
probably target only goods from Vietnam.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and Nicaragua exchanged instruments of rectification Thursday of a
bilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA) signed last year to pave the way for its
implementation Jan. 1, 2008.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Economic Affairs Minister Steve R.L. Chen and visiting Nicaraguan
Foreign Minister Samuel Santos Lopez exchanged the instruments of rectification
in a ceremony held at the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and its Central American ally started negotiations on the FTA in August
2004, and signed the pact June 16, 2006, after four rounds of talks.</P>
      <P>Chen and Santos exchanged the notes of rectification after both countries'
parliaments approved the accord.</P>
      <P>After the FTA takes force next year, Nicaragua will allow tariff free entry of
3,374 Taiwanese products, which is about 51.1 percent of Taiwanese exports to
Nicaragua, and Taiwan will also lift tariffs on the entry of 5,797 Nicaraguan
products, or about 65.6 percent of Nicaraguan exports, including beef and
coffee.</P>
      <P>The FTA will also pave the way for the free entry of 97.3 percent of Nicaraguan
products to Taiwan, and 95.1 percent of Taiwanese products to the Nicaraguan
market 10 years after implementation.</P>
      <P>The FTA will be beneficial in boosting bilateral trade and investment, technical
exchanges and cooperation, Santos said, adding that Nicaragua's location at the
center of Central America is convenient for Taiwanese investors looking to
expand their investments to other American countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Enterovirus A 24 confirmed as culprit in pinkeye outbreak</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of Health confirmed
Thursday that an enterovirus is the culprit responsible for the current outbreak
of conjunctivitis, commonly known as pinkeye, among elementary students.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director-General Shih Wen-yi confirmed that the enterovirus, known as
Coxackievirus type 24, is the culprit in the the current outbreak of pinkeye
among elementary students in the northern city of Keelung.</P>
      <P>Shih said Coxackieviruses type 24 has been discovered in all samples taken from
five of the young pinkeye patients from Keelung, proving that the pinkeye
outbreak  was related to enteroviral infection.</P>
      <P>Shih urged people, particularly children, to wash their hands regularly to avoid
being infected with enteroviruses, which can cause pinkeye.</P>
      <P>He said that although the pinkeye outbreak has significantly subsided in
Keelung, it has not completely run its course, so people should remain alert.</P>
      <P>Shih said that since the conjunctivitis outbreak has not been declared an
epidemic, the CDC is unable to determine exactly how many people in the country
have been infected.</P>
      <P>Coxackieviruses previously struck Taiwan in 1985, 1986, 1988 and 1989, but this
year's outbreak is the first after a hiatus of 18 years, Shih said.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan's last outbreak of pinkeye was in the 1970s, and that it
was a result of enterovirus type S70.</P>
      <P>Pinkeye is a highly contagious disease which can be caused by infections (such
as bacteria and viruses), allergies, substances that irritate the eyes, or
enteroviral infection.</P>
      <P>Shih called for students, particularly young children, and all members of the
public to seek medical aid if they are infected with pinkeye -- an inflammation
of the conjunctiva, the clear membrane that covers the white part of the eye and
the inner surface of the eyelids.</P>
      <P>To avoid infection, Shih said, kids should be taught to wash their hands often
with soap and water. Also, they should not share eye droppers, tissues, wash
cloths, towels, or pillowcases with others, he added.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will nominate competent individuals with no evident

opposition-controlled legislature approved only four, vetoing four others in a
confirmation vote held late last month.</P>
      <P>Noting that he is authorized by the country's Constitution to nominate grand
justices, Chen said he will faithfully fulfill that duty.</P>
      <P>"With this duty in mind, I'll propose new nominees to fill the four remaining

      <P>The Taiwan High court opened Friday the corruption trial of former Taipei Mayor
Ma Ying-jeou, who was indicted in February for allegedly embezzling public funds
but later acquitted by the Taipei District Court.</P>
      <P>Before entering the courtroom Friday morning, Ma reiterated that he is innocent
and that he expects the high court to handle the case based on the principles of
justice and fairness.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is the opposition Kuomintang's candidate for next year's presidential
election, was indicted by Taipei prosecutors Feb. 13 for allegedly embezzling
NT$11 million (US$335,365) from his special mayoral allowance during his time in
office between 1998-2006.</P>
      <P>However, the Taipei District Court acquitted him on Aug. 14, accepting that it
was a matter of convention that officials enjoyed considerable flexibility in
dealing with their special allowance funds. The court ruled that Ma had no
intention of embezzling any public funds.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Prosecutors' Office decided Aug. 17 to appeal the ruling.</P>
      <P>On several DPP heavyweights, including Vice President Annette Lu and former DPP

      <P>The Southern Taiwan Science Park posted NT$100.39 billion (US$3.08 billion) in
sales for July and August, the highest level ever recorded by the park for a
single two-month period, according to tallies released Friday by the park.</P>
      <P>The amount marked an increase of 13.26 percent over May and June and a rise of
40.33 percent over the same two-month period last year, Southern Taiwan Science
Park Administration officials said.</P>
      <P>For the first eight months of this year, the park's turnover topped NT$330
billion, or 63.71 percent of the target set by the park for 2007, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>They attributed the park's brilliant performance in July and August to the
strong growth momentum of the semiconductor and photonics industries.</P>
      <P>Owing to the robust market demand for thin film-transistor liquid crystal
display (TFT-LCD) products, the photonics manufacturers in the park posted sales
of NT$72.77 billion for July and August, up 52.11 percent year-on-year and
accounting for 72.49 percent of the park's total turnover for the period, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>For the eight months to August, the photonics manufacturers in the park posted
sales of NT$239.25 billion, up 19.98 percent year-on-year, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, seasonal demand in the contract chip making market boosted the total
sales of the semiconductor manufacturers in the park to NT$22.99 billion for
July and August, up 11.01 percent year-on-year and accounting for 22.91 percent
of the park's total turnover, they said.</P>
      <P>For the first eight months of the year, the semiconductor manufacturers in the

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh
invited his opposition Kuomintang rival, Ma Ying-jeou, Friday to take part in a
debate against him on the issue of holding a nationwide referendum on the
country's bid to enter the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who appeared in public for the first time in 14 days on Friday, said at a
news conference that he challenges Ma to a debate in order to find out whether
Taiwan's bid to "enter" the United Nations under the name Taiwan -- as promoted
by President Chen Shui-bian and the ruling DPP -- would be more realistic or
whether Ma's idea of pushing for the Republic of China's "re-entry" into the
world body would be more feasible.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lai Ching-teh welcomed Hsieh's challenge to Ma, saying that such
a debate could help the country arrive at a consensus on the U.N.-bid referendum
issue.</P>
      <P>Lai said the Hsieh-Ma debate would also help members of the general public
understand more about the two candidates' differing stances on the issue and
also help them make the right decision when they cast a ballot in such a
referendum.</P>
      <P>Lai, however, expressed concerns that Ma might not have "the guts" to face Hsieh
in a debate on the issue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Legislator Kao Chien-chih said that the issue of whether the
country should apply to join the United Nations under the name Taiwan or apply
to re-enter the organization under the name "Republic of China" is an important
issue but that he thinks Ma is pushing for the U.N.-bid referendum simply for
the sake of winning votes in the upcoming presidential election.</P>
      <P>Claiming that "in Ma's campaign, China is the manager," Kao said the Taiwan
people have the right to demand that Ma clarify his stance on the issue in a
debate.</P>

according to the Taipei Agricultural Products Market Corp. (TAPMC)</P>
      <P>Anticipation among vegetable traders of a declining supply in the wake of

TAPMC officials said, noting that wholesale vegetable prices broke the record
high set after Typhoon Sepat hit the island in mid-August.</P>
      <P>It might take a long time for the vegetable producing areas to recover for the
devastation brought by Typhoon Krosa, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The TAPMC reported that 831 tons of vegetables were shipped to the greater

      <P>The wholesale price of spring onions rose to NT$390 per kg and that of bok choys
increased to NT$100 per kg, according to the TAPMC report. It also revealed that
prices of zucchini, bitter gourds, tomatoes and sweet peppers are higher than

      <P>Visiting Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian solicited support from
Taiwan's South Pacific allies Friday in his campaign for the establishment of a
World Environment  Organization  (WEO)  under a United Nations framework.</P>
      <P>Chen, who arrived in the Marshall Islands Friday morning for a three-day state
visit, called for presidents of the Marshall Islands, Palau, Kiribati, Nauru,
the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu to write U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and
other U.N. member countries to jointly push for the establishment of the WEO to
ensure our species' sustainable development and survival.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of the second leadership summit between Taiwan and its
South Pacific allies, Chen said that the adverse impact of civilization on the
environment has reached an immeasurable level, and that the impact will grow
still more severe in the future.</P>
      <P>In the past, he said, militarily powerful nations conducted nuclear tests in the
South Pacific; now, industrially advanced countries discharge excessive amounts
of CO2 into the atmosphere, causing global warming, climate change, and as a
result the sea levels to continue to rise, threatening low-lying Pacific
islands.</P>
      <P>The consequences of such environmental abuse not only pose developmental
dilemmas for South Pacific nations, including the six maintaining formal
diplomatic relations with Taiwan, but also pose a severe threat to these
countries' sustainable existence, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that the world now needs a global organization capable of
realizing the ideals of environmental protection, of integrating the powers of
various countries, and of uniting every nation, without exception, to solve
these problems.</P>
      <P>Noting that he first launched his campaign in May this year calling for the
establishment of a WEO, Chen said he would like to take the opportunity of the
leadership summit to once again push for advocacy of the program, which he said
would also be a reflection of the spirit and goals championed by Palauan
President Tommy Remengesau in his "Micronesian Challenges" published in 2005.</P>
      <P>Consequently,  Chen said,  he keenly looks forward to the presidents of Taiwan's
South Pacific allies writing to Ban and leaders of all U.N. member countries to
push for the establishment of a WEO to benefit the sustainable development and
continued survival of the world's people.</P>

      <P>There will be no punishment of military police officers who handed out
promotional items concerning Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations during the
official National Day ceremony held earlier this week, a Presidential Office
spokesman said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Chang Kung-han, deputy director of the Presidential Office's Public
Affairs Department, the military police officers "did nothing wrong" and should
not be blamed for their actions because seeking membership in the United Nations
is one of the government's main policies.</P>
      <P>However, the Presidential Office respects the decision by the National Day
ceremony's organizing committee to recall the items, Chang said.</P>
      <P>During the National Day ceremony held Wednesday in front of the Presidential
Office, some military police officers in charge of maintaining order were found
to be handing out to participants items such as U.N. bid fliers and inflatable
thunder sticks printed with the "U.N. for Taiwan" logo.</P>
      <P>Legislative  Yuan speaker  Wang Jin-pyng,  who chaired the ceremony's organizing
committee, ordered a recall of the items immediately after being informed of the
situation, on the grounds that the items belong to a list of seven kinds of
articles forbidden at the ceremony, namely large backpacks, sticks and clubs,
knives, loud speakers, balloons, umbrellas and long-lens cameras.</P>
      <P>Some opposition legislators have demanded that the Ministry of National Defense
(MND)  investigate the matter and punish the responsible military police
commander.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on the issue Friday, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said the items
promoting the U.N. bid should not be treated as ordinary promotional items
because joining the United Nations is official government policy.</P>
      <P>However, in light of the attention that the incident received, the Cabinet will
have the authorities concerned look into it, the premier said, adding that he
has no idea if it was the Presidential Office which ordered that the promotional
items be handed out.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister of National Defense Lee Tien-yu said there is no need to
mete out punishment if the military police commander is without fault.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the one who gave the order, or the one who carried it out should
be held responsible, Lee said it is "hard to reach a conclusion" because the
scene where the incident took place was not directly under the control of the
MND.</P>

      <P>Visiting Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian cut the ribbon at the
inauguration ceremony for a Taiwan-funded international convention center in the
Marshall Islands Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Taiwan, as a staunch partner of the Marshall Islands, will do its
best to help the South Pacific nation develop, saying that "a true friend is one
who stands by you when you most need help."</P>
      <P>Linhu Jung-ta, the ROC ambassador to the Marshall Islands, said that after two
years of planning,  construction began on the convention center in March, which
was completed with a total cost of US$5 million.</P>
      <P>Chen, who arrived in the South Pacific nation Friday morning, paid a formal
visit to Marshall Islands President Kessai Note to exchange views on a wide
range of issues of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>Sources said that Note reaffirmed the importance of his nation's diplomatic
relations with Taiwan,  saying he welcomed Taiwan's continued investment in the
nation.</P>
      <P>Note was appreciative of Taiwan's assistance in medical care, outlying island
transportation and agricultural technology, and expressed hope that more
Taiwanese businessmen will take part in the nation's development projects,
especially in the tourism sector.</P>
      <P>He also said that his nation supports Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations

      <P>Taiwan's education system is facing enormous challenges in improving the English
proficiency of Taiwanese students, and it takes a lot more for the government,
schools, teachers and students themselves to achieve the goal, panelists said in
a symposium Friday.</P>
      <P>While the craze to learn English in Taiwan continues to grow, Taiwan's education
system has to work to improve overall proficiency from a wide range of angles,
from college and university to preschool, said Vincent Chang, a professor at
National Taiwan Normal University.</P>
      <P>The fashion for getting an early start in English learning has caused Taiwanese
parents anxiety and set high expectations, Chang said. However, an insufficiency
of qualified English teachers, the "One nation,  different practices"
phenomenon,  and variety of textbooks have all hindered efforts to improve
English proficiency, he said.</P>
      <P>The bi-polarity phenomenon was even more alarming, Chang claimed, as the results
of the Basic Competence Test (BCT) showed two distinct groups of students, one
performing exceedingly well while the other shows little or no English ability.</P>
      <P>This phenomenon reflects the gap between urban and remote areas in terms of the
availability of resources and English-teaching staff, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was not alone as South Korean government had been also making efforts to
improve South Koreans' overall English proficiency and launched a program of
reforms in recent years, said Park Jun-eon, a professor at Soongsil University.</P>
      <P>The measures taken in those reforms include intensive re-training of in-service
English teachers, upgrading the recruiting standard and strengthening
communicative English education, Park said, adding that the Korean government
established 'English experience areas', as well as Web sites and television
channels dedicated to English-learning.</P>
      <P>"Language is a process. It's not something you learn instantly, " said Doris
Brougham, founder and chief executive officer of Overseas Radio and Television,
whose English-teaching career spans 55 years in Taiwan.  Brougham  is also the
publisher  of several  popular English-learning magazines in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It takes motivation for anyone to learn and improve English, and the best
motivation is need, Brougham said.</P>
      <P>The symposium, which focused on the theme of globalization, was organized by the
Research, Development, and Evaluation Commission of the Executive Yuan.</P>

      <P>Responding to ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate
Frank Hsieh's challenge to a policy debate,  opposition Kuomintang presidential
candidate Ma Ying-jeou said if a debate indeed takes place, economic issues
should be the first issue discussed.</P>
      <P>Ma, who was in a Taipei courtroom Friday answering the questions of Taiwan High
Court judges, responded to Hsieh's challenge in a statement announced by his
aides.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who appeared in public for the first time in 14 days on Friday, said in a
news conference earlier in the day that he challenged Ma to a debate in order to
learn which would be more feasible: Taiwan's bid to "enter" the United Nations
under the name Taiwan -- as promoted by President Chen Shui-bian and the ruling
DPP -- or Ma's idea of pushing for the Republic of China's "re-entry" into the
world body.</P>
      <P>In reply, Ma said he is quite disappointed with what Hsieh had said in his news
conference. According to Hsieh's logic, Ma said, what the country's name should
be is more important than issues regarding the people's livelihood and welfare.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh's logic, the country's name is more important than reviving
the sagging domestic economy, spiraling unemployment, the deepening government
budget deficit and education, Ma noted in the statement.</P>
      <P>Ma said that during Hsieh's "14-days in solitude, " he might not have become
aware that the ranking of the container handling capacity of Kaohsiung Harbor
has dropped to sixth in the world from third, a position it held before the DPP
took power in 2000, and that the Standard &amp; Poor's Rating Service local and
regional government rating for the Asia-Pacific in 2007 named Taiwan and Fuji as
the only two of 22 regional sovereign entities to receive negative scores.</P>
      <P>Quoting former U.S. President Bill Clinton from his successful 1992 presidential
campaign against George H.W. Bush, that "It's the economy, stupid, " Ma asked
Hsieh to focus his attention on the economy and people's livelihood.</P>
      <P>Ma said that after visiting local communities around the island over the past
several months, he has become aware of the people's plight, which is entirely
derivative of the poor economic situation, adding, "the people could care less
about whether the country should be called the 'Republic of Taiwan.'"</P>

      <P>Taiwan is eager to learn from the British experience with regards to balancing
creativity, the public interest and commercial success in architectural design,
a Taiwan official said Friday in a U.K. Architecture Design seminar.</P>
      <P>The seminar -- a part of the "Love and Money" exhibition featuring 20 projects
of Britain's best design and promoting the U.K. creative industries -- has
gathered architects and designers from Taiwan and the U.K. to discuss future
trends in architectural design.</P>
      <P>"The title  of 'Love  and Money'  is intriguing  because, traditionally, people
tended to think that it's very difficult for creativity, culture, sustainable
development and public interests to co-exist with financial and commercial
success, " said Charles Lin, Director of Taiwan's Construction and Planning
Agency.</P>
      <P>A budget of more than NT$420 billion has been in the plans for Taiwan's
infrastructure for the next five years, said Michael Reilly, Director of the
British Trade and Cultural Office (BTCO). Reilly said he hopes that the
experience of British designers will be beneficial to their Taiwanese
counterparts.</P>
      <P>British architects  and designers are sharing with seminar attendees their
approaches to engineering and strategies on how to design with a difference.
Speakers included Hanif Kara, an engineer who founded the Adams Taylor Kara

      <P>A mechanic working in Kaohsiung City, southern Taiwan, is confirmed to have
contracted malaria, according to a news release issued by the Kaohsiung City
Bureau of Health Friday.</P>
      <P>The news release said that the man caught the disease during a business trip to
Guinea in West Africa in the period between late-August and Oct. 2.</P>
      <P>The patient sought medical treatment at a hospital in the city's Nantzu district
Oct. 8, after falling ill with a fever, frequently breaking out in a sweat, and
suffering headache, stomach ache, vomiting and diarrhea. Laboratory tests
confirmed Wednesday that the illness was malaria, according to the news release.</P>
      <P>The patient, now in a stable condition, is being treated at the hospital, said
bureau officials, adding that no family members or other people close to the
patient have so far shown any sign of infection.</P>
      <P>Officials indicated that the patient fell ill after being infected by mosquito
bites. In Taiwan, there are mosquitoes of the kind that bit the man in Africa,
however, officials said those mosquitoes live in mountainous areas and usually
do not appear on the flats, and urged the public to remain calm because there is
little chance of being infected by the vector-born disease on the island.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was certified by the World Health Organization in 1965 as a malaria-free
area. Nevertheless, the island reports around 30 imported cases of malaria
annually from other countries in Southeast Asia, Africa and Oceania, according
to the Centers for Disease Control under the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>Malaria causes symptoms, including anemia, fever, chills, nausea, flu-like
illness, and in severe cases, coma and death. Malaria transmission can be
reduced by preventing mosquito bites through the use of mosquito nets and insect
repellents, or by mosquito control measures such as spraying insecticides inside
houses and draining standing water where mosquitoes lay their eggs.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has promised to fully assist Renewable
Energy Corp. (REC) , the world's third largest polysilicon producer, if it
decides to invest in Taiwan, according to MOEA Minister Steve R.L. Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks Thursday during a meeting in Taipei with Erik Thorsen,
president  and chief executive  officer of the Norway-based supplier of silicon
and components to the solar energy industry.</P>
      <P>Thorsen was invited to deliver a keynote speech at the Taiwan International
Photovoltaic Forum that opened Thursday.</P>
      <P>REC is planning to build a factory in East Asia due to the inconvenience of
transporting raw polysilicon materials to the region, Chen said, adding that the
company is also optimistic about the prospect of the optoelectronics industry in
the region.</P>
      <P>REC will dispatch a special task force to Taiwan, South Korea, China, Singapore,
Malaysia, and other countries in the region next week to determine the best
location to build the factory, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>It will take the company three to four months to make the final decision, Chen
went on.</P>
      <P>During the meeting with Thorsen, Chen gave a briefing on the current state of
development of Taiwan's optoelectronics industry, saying that if REC invests in
Taiwan, it will benefit from Taiwan's prosperous information technology (IT)
industry.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Chen also said that the government is determined to boost
the local optoelectronics industry and that it has provided many incentives in
an effort to attract foreign polysilicon manufacturers to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also has complete optoelectronics industry clusters, which would help REC
cut its costs, according to Chen, who also added during the meeting that
Taiwan's local colleges and the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI)
have produced an abundance of human resources.</P>
      <P>At present, Chen said, the MOEA's Industrial Development Bureau has already
established a one-stop window to help REC better understand Taiwan's situation
in the field.</P>
      <P>He also said that the CPC Corp, Taiwan (CPC) , a state-run oil company, and
Formosa Plastics Group (FPC) have expressed their intentions to develop a joint
venture with REC.</P>
      <P>FPC Chairman Lee Chih-tsuen confirmed Thursday that FPC did hold talks with REC
over the possible collaboration and that REC once sent staff members to visit
FPC's factory site in Mailiao in the southern county of Yulin.</P>
      <P>However, Lee said that FPC insists on using a new technology to produce solar-
grade silicon wafers, which he claimed is much faster than traditional methods
and results in an output that is 10 times higher than normal.</P>
      <P>Such a cooperative venture, if realized, would make REC the first polysilicon
producer in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Liao Chi-chou, director of the DOH Bureau of Pharmaceutical Affairs, made the
remarks after several U.S. drug manufacturers announced the recalls.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a report issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease

2 suffered from complications after taking non-prescription cough and cold
drugs.</P>
      <P>In addition, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) statistics show that at
least 54 reported cases of child death involved the use of decongestant  and
another  69 cases  involved  the use of antihistamine. Both medicines can be
used to relieve runny or stuffy nose associated with a cold.</P>
      <P>According to Liao, there are no problems with the medicines per se, adding that
the problem stems from overdosing.</P>
      <P>Liao noted that in the U.S., there are non-prescription medicines that can be
easily purchased by the public at supermarkets.</P>
      <P>As a result, American infants aged under 2 are often found to have been given
excessive amounts of such drugs, Liao went on.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, Liao went on, the DOH has not approved the sale of any cold medicine

declaration after attending the second Taiwan-Pacific Allies Summit held in
Majuro, capital of the Marshall Islands.</P>
      <P>In the joint declaration,  the leaders recognized Taiwan's achievements in
democratization and economic development, and Taiwan as a sovereign country
whose right to participate in international organizations should not be
deprived.</P>
      <P>The leaders hailed Chen's idea of promoting the Taiwan-Pacific Allies Summit and
expressed gratitude to the Taiwan government in implementing cooperation
projects announced at the first such summit held in Palau last year, which were

Taiwan has promised to station permanent medical missions in the region and will
study the idea of setting up a "long-distance health care assistance and
consulting system" with its Pacific allies.</P>
      <P>As climate change has had a harsh impact on the environment and threatens the
lives of people of island nations, the leaders agreed to push for the
establishment of the World Environment Organization (WEO) , a brainchild of
Chen, to combine international efforts in tackling environmental problems.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also promised to help its Pacific allies train law enforcement personnel,
including environmental protection personnel, assist them reduce the digital

students pursue advanced studies in Taiwan, according to the declaration.</P>
      <P>In consideration of the cultural similarity between Taiwan's aboriginal people
and the people of Pacific countries, the leaders support the establishment of a

      <P>The Coast Guard Administration (CGA) is collaborating with Japanese law
enforcement authorities to fight eel fry smuggling, CGA Minister Wang Jinn-wang
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wang said during a legislative session that as the smuggling of eel fry is
expected to reach a peak before the high season for eel fry begins from the end
of October to next February, the CGA and the Maritime Safety Agency of Japan
(MSAJ) are stepping up joint efforts to stop the practice.</P>
      <P>He said that with acute shortages of eel fry in China due to overfishing and
poaching, fry smuggled from Japan is especially popular in Taiwan's aquaculture
industry, prompting the CGA to apply stricter measures to deter smuggling.</P>
      <P>He added that the collaboration is in addition to the "An Kong" operation, a
campaign to step up a crackdown on the smuggling of farm produce and fishery
products launched Nov. 1 last year by the CGA and 10 other agencies, including
the Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>The CGA has always maintained close cooperative relations with the MSAJ in
information exchange, Wang said, citing a successful raid in April in which a
Taiwanese fishing boat was detained by the MSAJ on suspicion of smuggling eel
fry in waters off Ishigaki island in Japan's Okinawa Prefecture.</P>
      <P>The two agencies also apprehended a Taiwanese fishing boat allegedly carrying
amphetamines near Miyako island in Okinawa, Wang said,  adding that with the
same cooperation, law enforcement officials in Myanmar and Malaysia have seized
a large haul of contraband drugs in two trafficking cases.</P>
      <P>The CGA is also working with police authorities in the United States, Thailand
and Hong Kong to control the growing problem of drug trafficking  and drug-
related  crime and strengthen information exchanges and cooperation, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A parliamentary watchdog urged the presidential candidates of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Friday to debate on major policy issues immediately in response to public
expectations.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Society, which is mainly composed of academics, made the appeal after
DPP presidential candidate Frank Hsieh invited his KMT rival, Ma Ying-jeou, to
debate the planned referendums on Taiwan's U.N. bid.</P>
      <P>Hsieh noted that the DPP wants to hold a referendum on the nation's U.N. bid
under the name Taiwan, while the KMT wants to hold a referendum on Taiwan's U.N.
membership under its official name, the Republic of China, or any other
"pragmatic name." Hsieh challenged Ma to debate on which referendum initiative
is more feasible and to let public opinion decide the result of the debate, with
the loser retracting his proposal.</P>
      <P>Ma, in response, said the real problem lies with the economy and that if Hsieh
wants a debate, then economic issues should be given priority.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Society said in a statement that the 2008 presidential election will
be a race between Hsieh and Ma, but the society claimed that for months, the
media has been centered on the vice presidential candidates, the lawsuit against
Ma over his alleged misuse of his "special allowance fund," and the probe into
irregularities in Kaohsiung's MRT system allegedly involving Hsieh during his
tenure as Kaohsiung mayor.</P>
      <P>The society said these issues do not incite the</P>
      <P>passion of the voters and that there are many major issues in the 2008
presidential election that need to be addressed.</P>
      <P>The presidential candidates should debate such issues as whether the country
should pursue eventual unification with China or independence; the checks and
balances against the president, the premier and the legislature; and how to
break through China's obstruction and establish diplomatic relations with more
countries, as well as how to join international organizations.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu pledged Friday to help Malawi athletes attend the World
Games, slated to take place in the southern port city in 2009.</P>
      <P>Chen made the promise during a meeting with Esther Mcheka Chilenje Nkhoma, the
first deputy speaker of Malawi's National Assembly, and three female Malawi
lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Saying that she will give money to allow Malawi athletes and Chilenje to attend
the games, Chen expressed appreciation to Malawi for strongly supporting
Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Chen noted that Kaohsiung  has attached  great importance to ecology
and environmental  protection during its transformation from a heavy-industry
city to a trade-and-tourism city.</P>
      <P>She said she hopes Kaohsiung can have "a clean and natural environment like
Africa."</P>
      <P>Chen said that in Taiwan, women have equal opportunities to men to participate
in politics, pointing out that the vice president and one-quarter of the Cabinet
are women.</P>
      <P>In response, Chilenje said that there are limited opportunities for Malawi women
to take part in politics. However, she said she believes female lawmakers often
pay more attention to social problems related to children, women and minority
groups.</P>
      <P>Chilenje expressed a wish to establish collaboration with Kaohsiung to learn
more about the city's experience in developing heavy industry.</P>
      <P>Chilenje also thanked Taiwan for offering aid to Malawi and reiterated the

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu announced Friday that a new alliance will be formed
Saturday to campaign on behalf of pro-democracy forces in Myanmar.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks while attending a human rights concert on Green Island off
the coast of the eastern county of Taitung.</P>
      <P>Also present at the concert were political victims who were imprisoned on the
island by the previous Kuomintang (KMT) government during its 55 years of
authoritarian rule.</P>
      <P>Lu said more than 30 social groups have expressed willingness to join the
alliance,  adding that in the future, a "democratic development study program"
will be established, with foreign youths doing study in Taiwan,  particularly
the 3,000-plus Myanmarese students in Taiwan, as main targets.</P>
      <P>Speaking to reporters, Lu showed a camera she said was a gift from the Japanese
video reporter Kenji Nagai, who was recently shot dead by a soldier in Myanmar
while filming a bloody military clampdown on anti-government  protests staged by
civilians and Buddhist monks.</P>
      <P>Lu said she received the gift at an international conference she called in Japan
in 1992 to announce a trip she had been planning to make to China. She planned
to lead a group of Taiwanese people to attend a National Day ceremony in Beijing
to see if China would treat them with goodwill.</P>
      <P>At the news conference, Lu went on, Nagai gave her the camera as a lucky charm
for her safety in China and said he had used it to take many photos of Aung San
Suu Kyi, a pro-democracy activist and 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner who has been
under house arrest over the past decade after winning a popular election.</P>
      <P>Lu said she failed to enter China and was sent back to Japan.</P>

      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Friday that if Taiwan hopes to
achieve success in its bid to join the United Nations, it must spare no efforts
to develop friendly relations with China.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks in a speech at Shih Hsin University in suburban Taipei.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should boost its ties and exchanges with China to achieve normality in
the hope that the two sides might offer reciprocal assistance in various fields
and pave the way for the elimination of long-term misunderstandings and
hostility between the two sides, Wang said.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan fails to improve its relations with China, its future U.N. membership
applications -- which China has successfully blocked from inclusion on the
agenda of the annual U.N. General Assembly session since 1993 -- will be
certainly thwarted again by China.</P>
      <P>This is certain, as China is a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council,
which is tasked with processing  membership applications, Wang noted.</P>
      <P>He also urged the government to seek more support from Taiwan's diplomatic

    <HEADLINE>National pension system to be implemented Oct. 1, 2008: premier</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Friday that a much-anticipated national pension
system will be put into practice Oct. 1, 2008, creating a social security
mechanism for disadvantaged people who currently lack any pension benefits.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks in a speech delivered at an evening party marking the
42nd founding anniversary of the Christian Tribune News, a local newspaper.</P>
      <P>Noting that the national pension system will cover some 3.5 million people who
currently lack any pension benefits, Chang said the new mechanism, coupled with
the national health insurance program that has long been in place, will
contribute to the establishment of a fair and just society.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed the National Pension Act in July, making it possible
for people aged 25 to 65 who are not covered by military, civil service,
teachers or labor insurance programs, as well as farmers under the age of 65, to
join the program.</P>
      <P>They will be required to pay a monthly contribution based on a percentage of the
national minimum wage. Contributions will be calculated on a graded scale
ranging from 6.5 percent to 12 percent of minimum wage.</P>
      <P>After retirement at the age of 65, contributors would receive a pension of up to
NT$8,986 per month for the rest of their life, a figure that will be adjusted in
line with changes in the consumer price index.</P>
      <P>Given the current  minimum  wage of NT$17,280,  a monthly contribution of 6.5
percent of the minimum wage would amount to NT$1,123, of which a citizen will
pay 60 percent, or NT$674, per month, while the government will cover the
remaining 40 percent.</P>
      <P>After 40 years, the total amount contributed by the citizen would be NT$515,082,
while the payout would amount to NT$1.83 million over 17 years, calculated on an
average lifespan of 82 years.</P>

unattractive; it is simple, and yet full of grace; it is easy, and yet
methodical."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>National pension system to be implemented Oct. 1, 2008: premier</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Friday that a much-anticipated national pension
system will be put into practice Oct. 1, 2008, creating a social security
mechanism for disadvantaged people who currently lack any pension benefits.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks in a speech delivered at an evening party marking the
42nd founding anniversary of the Christian Tribune News, a local newspaper.</P>
      <P>Noting that the national pension system will cover some 3.5 million people who
currently lack any pension benefits, Chang said the new mechanism, coupled with
the national health insurance program that has long been in place, will
contribute to the establishment of a fair and just society.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed the National Pension Act in July, making it possible
for people aged 25 to 65 who are not covered by military, civil service,
teachers or labor insurance programs, as well as farmers under the age of 65, to
join the program.</P>
      <P>They will be required to pay a monthly contribution based on a percentage of the
national minimum wage. Contributions will be calculated on a graded scale
ranging from 6.5 percent to 12 percent of minimum wage.</P>
      <P>After retirement at the age of 65, contributors would receive a pension of up to
NT$8,986 per month for the rest of their life, a figure that will be adjusted in
line with changes in the consumer price index.</P>
      <P>Given the current  minimum  wage of NT$17,280,  a monthly contribution of 6.5
percent of the minimum wage would amount to NT$1,123, of which a citizen will
pay 60 percent, or NT$674, per month, while the government will cover the
remaining 40 percent.</P>
      <P>After 40 years, the total amount contributed by the citizen would be NT$515,082,
while the payout would amount to NT$1.83 million over 17 years, calculated on an
average lifespan of 82 years.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian expressed hope Saturday that the Kiribati government
led by President Anote Tong will establish an embassy in Taiwan soon.</P>
      <P>Raising the issue during talks with Kiribati Vice President Teima Onorio in the
Marshall Islands, Chen said he is confident Tong will win his Oct. 17 re-
election bid in light of Tong's popularity among his people and the overwhelming
victory of Tong's Pillars of Truth party in an August parliamentary election.</P>
      <P>Chen asked Onorio to help relay an invitation to Tong to visit Taiwan at some
point between late 2007 and early 2008.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Kiribati was the first country to forge diplomatic relations
with Taiwan during his presidency, and he said he cherishes very much the ties
between the two countries and his personal friendship with Tong.</P>
      <P>Noting that Kiribati is the place on which the first daylight falls each day,
Chen said he had decided to use a picture of him watching the sunrise in
Kiribati that was taken during his last visit to the Pacific nation in 2005 on
his 2008 New Year greeting cards.</P>
      <P>Chen said the use of the picture will be a show of his hopes for Taiwan, adding
that he hopes the move will also be helpful to boosting Kiribati's tourism
industry.</P>
      <P>Onorio expressed her gratitude to Taiwan for its assistance in promoting
Kiribati's development and pledged to continue to support Taiwan's bids to join
international organizations, including the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Onorio also said she is deeply impressed that Chen has overcome numerous
challenges with courage and determination  during his presidency.</P>
      <P>The talks were held on the sidelines of the second leadership summit between
Taiwan and its Pacific allies that was held Friday in the Marshall Islands
capital of Majuro.</P>
      <P>In addition to Onorio, Chen was also scheduled to hold talks with Nauruan
President Ludwig Scotty, Palauan President Tommy Remengesau, Jr., Solomon
Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare and Tuvaluan Prime Minister Apisai
Ielemia Saturday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that Taiwan is a sovereign state
independent of China and that trying to join the United Nations under the name
Taiwan will help the country emerge from China's shadow.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during an informal gathering with Taiwanese media during a
visit to the Marshall Islands to attend the second leadership summit between
Taiwan and its Pacific allies.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the Pacific leaders taking part in the summit have expressed
their approval for Taiwan's move to use the name Taiwan to apply for U.N.
membership, because they generally agree that the strategy will help bypass the
obstruction set by Beijing's "one China" policy.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed the situation has proven wrong a notion held by the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) that the country must use the name Republic of China, but not
the name Taiwan, to rejoin the United Nations, in order to secure the country's
relations with its diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>"Don't cheat our people any more. If we continue using the name Republic of
China, we cannot be sure how long our ties with our diplomatic allies can last.
Instead, using the name Taiwan will help us find a way out," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen recalled that in 2005, he held talks with Nauruan President Ludwig Scotty
in the Marshall Islands that were crucial in that they paved the way for the
restoration of Taiwan-Nauru diplomatic ties -- which were cut in 2002 soon after
he assumed the chairmanship of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Chen said it was China's aggressive move to woo away Nauru with the purpose of
embarrassing him and Taiwan that prompted him to publicly declare Aug. 3 that
year that Taiwan and China are two separate countries on each side of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan must not continue downgrading itself by clinging to a "one China"
policy that agrees Taiwan is part of China or claiming Taiwan and China belong
to one country awaiting unification.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is Taiwan and China is China. Taiwan is definitely a sovereign state,
not part of China," Chen said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that Taiwan's future
and its orientation are "absolutely more important" than the issue of the
nation's economy.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks to reporters in Majuro, capital of the Marshall
Islands, where he attended the second leadership summit between Taiwan and its
South Pacific allies the previous day.</P>
      <P>The president dismissed the idea of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) using the economy as the focus of the 2008 presidential election, noting
that opposition Kuomintang presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou has made the
issue the centerpiece of his election campaign.</P>
      <P>Ma cited former U.S. President Bill Clinton's successful 1992 campaign
catchphrase "it's the economy, stupid! " when he was challenged by DPP
presidential candidate Frank Hsieh to debate planned referendums on Taiwan's
U.N. bid Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen said the KMT used the economy during its 2004 presidential campaign and
said "there is nothing new in its repetition."</P>
      <P>Chen said that Taiwan people know the 2008 presidential election is crucial to
Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>"Ma should not think Taiwan people as `so stupid' as to believe that economic
issues are more important than national sovereignty and Taiwan's future," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>He claimed that Ma has continued to preach eventual unification with China and
that the KMT's charter still advocates eventual unification.</P>
      <P>The KMT, or the Chinese Nationalist Party, still has "China" at the front of its
name, Chen continued.</P>
      <P>Ma says Taiwan is the Republic of China, but dare not say the Republic of China
is Taiwan, Chen claimed, adding that Ma shuns the question and only wants to
talk about the economy.</P>
      <P>If one wants to talk about the economy only, then it just turns Taiwan into Hong
Kong and becomes "another special administrative region," Chen claimed.</P>
      <P>Ma needs to be unequivocal about whether he wants "only to focus on the economy
and earning money, " Chen said, asking if that "is in line with the public's
wishes."</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that he will step down as chairman of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) at the same time he concludes his
presidential tenure May 20, 2008.</P>
      <P>Chen made the promise during a an informal gathering with Taiwanese reporters
covering his visit to the Marshall Islands. Chen arrived in Majuro, the Marshall
Islands capital, Friday for a three-day visit to meet with heads of state of
Taiwan's six allies in the South Pacific.</P>
      <P>In response to inquiries focusing on an announcement prior to his trip that he
had decided to re-assume office as DPP chairman, the president said that he
"won't definitely dominate the state with party guidelines" after taking over
the chairmanship and that he will "absolutely withdraw from the DPP chairmanship
when he leaves the presidency next year."</P>
      <P>"There is no doubt that Frank Hsieh will double as DPP chairman" if he wins the
presidential election next year, Chen said, implying that he will not interfere
in his successor's administration after leaving power.</P>
      <P>"One country cannot have two presidents simultaneously, " he said, quoting
former U.S. President Bill Clinton, who made the comment during a meeting with
Chen in Taipei in February 2005.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the 2008 presidential election, Chen said the ruling party is faced
with an entirely different set of challenges than it encountered in 2000 and
2004. In those years, he explained, "the DPP was a strongly consolidated
political party."</P>
      <P>At that time, the enemies were all from the outside, but today, he went on,
"none of our enemies are on the outside but are inside ourselves,  " referring
to the party's internal conflicts and factionalism.</P>
      <P>Chen served as DPP chairman 2002-2004. In December 2004, he resigned to shoulder
responsibility for the DPP's failure to win a legislative majority.</P>

      <P>Chen said the decision to hold the third summit in Kaohsiung was made during the

    <HEADLINE>`I'm running for Taiwan's presidency': DPP candidate</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>"I'm running for the presidency of Taiwan, whose official title is the Republic
of China as enshrined in the country's Constitution," Frank Hsieh, the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) presidential candidate, said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks in a speech to an audience at the Rotary International's
Tatung club in Taipei a day after his opposition Kuomintang (KMT) rival Ma Ying-
jeou said Hsieh should answer the question of "for which country's presidency is
he running?" before proposing any debate between them.</P>
      <P>Ma posed the question after Hsieh challenged his KMT rival to a debate on the
nation's title and the two parties' separate referendum initiatives on the
country's U.N. membership bid. Ma also said that if a debate indeed takes place,
economic issues should be the first subject addressed.</P>
      <P>In response, Hsieh said Ma's question was nonsense. "I have on numerous
occasions said that as our Constitution has not yet been amended, the Republic
of China remains our country's title; but as Taiwan is actually independent,
it's plausible to say that I'm running for the presidency of Taiwan," Hsieh
argued.</P>
      <P>By posing such a question, Hsieh said, Ma was exploiting the abnormality in
Taiwan's national status to play a "war of words." In his view, Hsieh went on,
the real issues to be tackled today are what Taiwan's national title should be
and how the nation can secure its place in the international community.</P>
      <P>While inviting Ma to debate on the KMT-initiated referendum proposal that would
ask whether the government should apply for a return to the United Nations in
the name of the ROC, Hsieh said he asked Ma to first answer two questions --
"whether his definitions of the ROC today and the ROC before 1971 are the same,
and whether Ma sees the referendum as part of efforts to join the U.N. or just a
campaign tactic."</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he feels regret that Ma had so far not yet responded to either  of
his questions.  "Ma's non-reaction  proves  the plausibility of my inquisition,"
he claimed.</P>
      <P>Describing Taiwan's U.N. bid as an "international gambling game," Hsieh said it
is not just Taiwan's internal issue, but rather an issue of global concern.
Against this backdrop, Hsieh said, there are critical differences between the
implication of applying for U.N. membership under the name Taiwan and that of
applying for a return to the U.N. in the name of the ROC.</P>
      <P>"In the quest for a decent place on the international stage, it is imperative to
decide what our designation should be," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Consequently, he went on, the DPP-initiated referendum proposal to ask whether
the government should apply to join the U.N. under the name Taiwan is crucial.</P>
      <P>"If the DPP-proposed referendum succeeds by securing the required number of
votes in line with our Referendum Law provisions, the world will come to learn
that the people of Taiwan overwhelmingly aspire to be represented in the U.N.,"
Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>As the United Nations admits only sovereign states, Hsieh said Taiwan's
statehood would be self-evident by seeking to enter the body. The issue
remaining to be sorted out or debated would only be its title or designation.</P>
      <P>"We should seek a national consensus on this issue; otherwise, foreign countries
will be confused and thus become reluctant to lend their support," he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has unsuccessfully sought U.N. representation since 1993 when the KMT was
in power. Fourteen of the bids were filed under the title ROC and this year
marked the first time the application was presented under the name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Even though we failed again this year, we have drawn much more attention and
support this time around. Many foreign news outlets, opinion leaders and
parliamentarians have thrown support behind our bid," Hsieh noted.</P>
      <P>Through these latest efforts, Hsieh said, the world has come to understand that
the People's Republic of China does not represent Taiwan, which he said is a
stance shared by both Taiwan and the United States -- Taiwan's most important
political ally.</P>
      <P>Hsieh further said it is imperative for Taiwan to unequivocally spell out its
separate identity from China right now. "If we fail to continue seeking U.N.
representation, the world could be misled into accepting China's sovereignty
claim over Taiwan as shown in U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's earlier
statement about the issue, " he cautioned.</P>
      <P>By inviting Ma to debate on the U.N. bid issue, Hsieh continued, he is
delivering on his promise to cooperate with any individuals regardless of their
political stripe or preference.</P>
      <P>As both the DPP and the KMT have been collecting signatures in support of their
respective U.N. bid referendum initiatives to be held alongside the next
presidential election slated for March 22, 2008, Hsieh said he has called for an
open debate with Ma to let the public hear the reasoning behind each proposal
and to gauge public opinion on them.</P>
      <P>If a Hsieh-Ma debate on the issue takes place, Hsieh suggested, a public opinion
poll should be taken and the referendum initiative receiving less support should
be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he firmly believes that if 10 million Taiwan voters give "yes" votes
to the planned U.N. bid referendum, it would have enormous clout for Taiwan's
quest for a U.N. seat. "It would lead the world society to reflect upon why
Taiwan cannot join the U.N., " he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng claimed Saturday that southern Taiwan is
the "most important area of the island" and suggested that the image of that
region be reformed to "truly reflect the strategic importance"  to the country's
development.</P>
      <P>Wang said it is the southern area that houses the country's heavy industry,
which he described as the "fundamental infrastructure" that supports Taiwan's
economic development.</P>
      <P>Southern Taiwan is also the country's logistic, agricultural and fishery center,
the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) heavyweight further said, noting that those are
the resources that should be taken advantage of in efforts to develop the
region.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks in a lecture in Pingtung, southern Taiwan, to a young
leadership camp organized by the Pingtung New Youth Service Association.</P>
      <P>Wang also revealed a plan to write a book featuring his ideas and proposals
concerning what he described as "homeland replanning."</P>
      <P>He also claimed that it was "Taiwan's loss" that former KMT Chairman Lien Chan
was never elected to serve as president, referring to Lien's plan to construct
"six operational centers" in Taiwan. The proposal was brought up during Lien's
failed campaign for the presidency in 2000.</P>
      <P>Lien had proposed to build an international airport and a center of warehouses
in Kaohsiung, Wang said, claiming that if Lien had had the chance to realize his
economic  ideas,  Taiwan's economic development would have been "astonishing."</P>

      <P>A government offer of free influenza vaccine is safe and the elderly and young
children should get vaccinated as soon as possible, a Department of Health (DOH)
official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-yi, deputy director of the DOH Centers for Disease Control, said there
is no scientific evidence to prove that a minimal level of mercury in the flu
vaccine poses a health threat.</P>
      <P>Shih's words came amid reports that the mercury contained in the vaccines have
affected the willingness of people to take the shots. In the first week of the
free shot program that started Oct. 1, the ratio of two priority groups --
people over 65 years of age and those between two months and two years old --
dropped by 30 percent when compared with the same period of last year, according
to the reports.</P>
      <P>After pledges of safety by the DOH as well as experts, the ratio of young
children taking shots gradually rebounded in the past week, although the ratio
for the elderly taking shots had yet to recover.</P>
      <P>Shih said that free shots for the elderly have not risen, but have shown a
gradual decline in recent years and speculated that this might because the
public has let down its guard because there have been no major outbreaks in
recent years.</P>
      <P>Shih said the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the three
different strains, including the Solomon Islands strain of H1N1, the Wisconsin
strain of H3N2 and the strain B/Malaysia could result in influenza outbreaks in
the Northern Hemisphere, which prompted the DOH to purchase 2.69 million
vaccines.</P>
      <P>But he said the WHO has recently warned that there may be other mutant strains,
adding the when mutant stains strike, the elderly and the young will be mostly
affected. Experience in the United States has shown that for the elderly and the
young who have been vaccinated, the symptoms are milder than those who have not
been vaccinated.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan society can achieve higher goals by opening up linguistically and
culturally, and it's time for Taiwan and China to "start talking to each other",
one of the most respected Sinologist in Europe said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has achieved amazing things, including the peaceful democratic
transformation, but its society will be able to do much more if it opens up
linguistically and culturally, and understand what happens in the world today,
said Rudolph Wagner, a professor at Germany's Heidelberg University, in his
speech.</P>
      <P>The speech, titled "German Unification: Popular Culture, Maoist Students, and
the Socialist Disneyland, " was scheduled for last Saturday but was postponed
because of Typhoon Krosa. The speech was one of an international lecture series
organized by Lung Yingtai Cultural Foundation.</P>
      <P>Focusing on German unification in his speech, Wagner was asked about the Taiwan-
China situation in the question and answer session. He said Taiwan and China
should start talking to each other for a civilized  communication  rather  than
political  rhetorics  of nationalism.</P>
      <P>Commenting  on the "dignity" factor in Taiwan independence movement, Wagner said
that the sense of dignity does not neccessarily have to bundle with sovereignty
because Taiwan has won its dignity in its bloodless democratic transition and
economic growth.</P>
      <P>As for the Taiwan identity, he said that "the world just doesn't respect that
very much."</P>
      <P>Wagner said the Chinese government has been amazingly successful in managing its
economic development in recent years and has actually showed substantial amount
of restraint in the Taiwan issue.</P>
      <P>He also believed that China had pushed for hosting the 2008 Summer Olympics to
repress the internal hawkish military force which has been anxious to take
Taiwan by force. China knew very well that, in order to maintain the current
economic growth, peace in the next 15-20 years was a priority, Wagner claimed.</P>
      <P>With a Ph.D. from the University of Munich, Wagner has done extensive research
on Buddhism, Taoist philosophy, and contemporary Chinese politics and the media.
In 1992, he was awarded the Leibniz Prize, Europe's most prestigious prize in
the humanities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ex-president calls for end to `polarized bi-party system'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.13 (CNA)
10/13/07  23:05:01
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui said Saturday that Taiwan's party politics have
been "deformed" in a situation in which  politics  is dominated  by just  two
parties  --  the pro-independence  Democratic  Progressive  Party (DPP)  and the
pro-unification Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Such a "polarized bi-party system" poses a great threat to Taiwan's security and
future development, Lee warned while addressing a seminar on challenges and
obstacles to Taiwan's drive to become a normal country.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the polarized "independence vs. unification" bi-party
political situation has allowed the DPP and the KMT to easily  "manipulate"
elections  into  a bitter  duel  between pro-independence and pro-unification
forces.</P>
      <P>"Such practices have not only hindered rational debate on issues critical to
people's livelihoods and national development but have also deepened internal
division over national identity, " Lee lamented, adding that the scenario would
also provide a hotbed for China to drive wedges and exploit any gaps in local
society.</P>
      <P>So long as this "polarized bi-party system" exists, Lee said Taiwan will face
the perils of annexation by China.</P>
      <P>In the run-up to Taiwan's 2008 presidential election, Lee said, the candidate
favored by the Beijing leadership is already very clear.</P>
      <P>"If Beijing's 'favorite son' wins the election, they would get the chance of
cultivating an irreversible situation favorable for unification of the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait, " Lee warned, adding: "Should that be the case, Taiwan
will have a hard time escaping a "unification scheme" drafted by them.</P>
      <P>After the people of Taiwan were allowed to elect their head of state directly in
1996, Lee said China consistently racked on its brains to help its "favorite
sons" in Taiwan's previous three presidential  elections.  Thanks  to  growth
in Taiwan-centric consciousness, China's past schemes didn't succeed.</P>
      <P>Lee said he is worried that the current DPP administration's incompetence,
internal rifts over basic policy lines and other factors could lead to its
defeat in next year's presidential election, which would put Taiwan's future at
high risk.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Lee said seeking a way out of Taiwan's current "polarized
independence vs. unification bi-party" politics has become desperately urgent.</P>
      <P>In his view, Lee argued that Taiwan should strive to turn the existing polarized
bi-party system into a healthy bi-party system dominated by the two indigenous
parties --  the DPP and its "pan-green" ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU).</P>
      <P>Lee, who has been known as the TSU's spiritual leader, said he looks forward to
see the pro-unification KMT gradually peter out and fade away. At the same time,
he said, the TSU should gradually grows into a strong "Taiwan-centric third
force" that can compete with the DPP.</P>
      <P>Noting that the TSU adopts a social democratic policy line and is dedicated to
pursuing social justice, Lee said he hopes local voters can support the TSU in
the Jan. 12, 2008 legislative elections in which a new "single-member
constituency and two ballots" electoral system will be implemented.</P>
      <P>"By so doing, Taiwan-centric consciousness will become mainstream and pro-
independence voters will have a new choice other than the DPP," Lee said, adding
that a healthy bi-party system will be able to gradually take roots under such
circumstances.</P>

great things consists in doing little things well. He knows that great effects
are produced by small causes. He knows the evidence and reality of what cannot
be perceived by the senses. Thus he is enabled to enter into the world of ideas
and morals."</TEXT>

Sunday morning to go fishing around a coral reef islet, where the two presidents
jointly caught fish weighing 14 kg during the two-hour outing.</P>
      <P>It turned out that the Chen-Note team beat the rival team of Palauan President

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to ask for a deadline for flu vaccination BOO cooperation</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 14 (CNA)
10/14/07  16:31:23
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has decided to ask that a deadline be set for the signing of a contract
on a build, own, operate (BOO) project for the production of flu vaccines in
Taiwan with Dutch Pharmaceutical company Akzo Nobel, a Department of Health
(DOH) source said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The DOH Centers for Disease Control (CDC) chose Akzo Nobel in July 2006 as a
possible partner for talks on a BOO project, under which Akzo Nobel -- the
largest pharmaceutical company in the Netherlands -- would help Taiwan produce
flu vaccines domestically.</P>
      <P>Although such talks are nearly complete, a final contract has not been signed
between the two sides. According to the agreement as it stands, Akzo Nobel will
help Taiwan build a flu vaccine manufacturing plant in a biomedical industrial
park located in Chupei, northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, in March this year, Schering-Plough -- a worldwide, research-based
pharmaceutical company -- signed an agreement with Akzo Nobel to buy Organon
Biosciences, which is an Akzo Nobel department responsible for vaccine research
and development.</P>
      <P>As the acquisition deal has not yet been closed and related talks, particularly
on regulatory clearance procedures, are not expected to be completed by the
fourth quarter of this year, an Organon official told the CNA recently that
neither Organon, nor Akzo Nobel will be able to make any solid decision on the
BOO project with Taiwan at the moment.</P>
      <P>The Organon official said that Akzo Nobel and the CDC are still in discussions,
in particular  about the financial terms and conditions of the BOO project, but
at the moment the Dutch company cannot give Taiwan a timetable for the signing
of any contract regarding the vaccine cooperation BOO project.</P>
      <P>"The BOO project will require approval by Schering-Plough, " he pointed out.</P>
      <P>On this latest development, CDC officials said Taiwan cannot wait indefinitely
and may, as a result, opt to pursue a "Plan B."</P>
      <P>The options for a "Plan B" have not yet be set, but could include signing
contracts with another foreign vaccine maker to initiate a new BOO project;
helping Taiwan's local companies to develop flu vaccines; and striking advance
procurement agreements (APA) with foreign pharmaceutical companies to secure
sufficient quantities of flu vaccines, the officials said.</P>

      <P>Three Navy officials, including a rear admiral were punished for inappropriately
handling  classified documents, according to a statement issued by the Ministry
of National Defense Sunday.</P>
      <P>The statement confirmed a report carried by Sunday's United Daily News that
Commander Shen Jao-chun, a staff member of the Navy Command Headquarters in
Taipei, was reprimanded and removed from his current post for downloading
classified documents and processing them on his personal computer at home.</P>
      <P>His direct superior, Captain Hsiang Ching-tsung,  was also reprimanded and
removed for failing to learn of the matter and correct it.</P>
      <P>Rear Admiral Chu Tsung-rung, chief of the department at which the two officers
worked was spared a reprimand, but has been removed from his post as a
consequence.</P>
      <P>The terse statement quoted a report from the Navy Command Headquarters as saying
that the Navy, which bans accessing official documents on personal computers, is
taking the incident seriously and tightening up security procedures to prevent a
repetition of it.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News said the incident was detected "recently" by a "friendly
military unit" which found Shen processed classified military  documents  on his
personal computer against military regulations.</P>
      <P>Shen downloaded military documents without permit onto a USB disk and then
handled them on his personal computer. These documents were thereby stolen by
hackers who successfully broke into Shen's personal computer as he surfed the
Internet, said the United Daily News.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The debate over whether Taiwan's U.N. bid or the country's economy should take
center stage in the 2008 presidential  election  became a hot topic between the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Sunday.</P>
      <P>One day after DPP presidential candidate Frank Hsieh claimed that the U.N. bid
should take precedence over the economy because the people are not livestock and
need dignity more than they need to be further stuffed with food, DPP Legislator
Wang Tuoh urged KMT presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou Sunday to take up
Hsieh's challenge to debate the U.N. bid, which the lawmaker claims needs to be
addressed more urgently than the economy.</P>
      <P>Like the country's economy, the bid for U.N. membership is an issue no
presidential candidate can avoid, Wang said, adding that as both the DPP and KMT
have initiated their own proposals for a referendum to be held alongside the
presidential election in March, 2008, the two party's candidates should debate
the pros and cons of their particular proposals in public to avoid a failure of
both of them in the referendum due to a division between their supporters.</P>
      <P>Wang was referring to the DPP's proposal for the country to bid for U.N.
membership under the name of Taiwan in keeping with the party's push to
establish Taiwan's permanent independence, and the KMT's proposal to join the
U.N. under the name of the country's official title of the Republic of China, in
line with its advocacy of maintaining the political status quo.</P>
      <P>Noting that defense, diplomacy and ties with China will be the major challenges
facing the next president, Wang said the economy should be put on the back
burner for the time being.</P>
      <P>The KMT, in response, criticized Hsieh for likening people who desire for a
better life to livestock Sunday.</P>
      <P>"Mark my words, " KMT Spokesman Su Chun-ping cautioned Hsieh, "people are not
livestock, they deserve to prosper. Government leaders who failed to provide the
people with a better life should apologize and step down.</P>
      <P>He claimed that under the DPP's seven-year rule the country has lost NT$12
trillion due to economic decline, NT$6 trillion to high-profile economic crimes
involving senior government officials, and NT$900 billion to government sales of
state-owned assets at a loss, not to mention the losses caused by DPP
administration's pocketbook diplomacy and numerous grand but useless public
projects.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics to support his claims regarding the people's misery, Su said
that one person committed suicide every two hours in Taiwan in 2006; Kaohsiung
Harbor's worldwide ranking in terms of the volume of containers it handled is
set to declined to 8th this year, down from third in 2002; the starting salary
of college graduates now averages at NT$26,000 (US$797.9), lower than what it
was eight years ago;  and accumulated government debt has risen to NT$530,000
(US$16,265) per capita.</P>

Majuro, the capital of the Marshall Islands on Oct. 12, have cemented the
country's strategic partnership with countries in that region.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President to appeal district court ruling on classified materials</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  15 (CNA)
10/15/07  12:22:19
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will appeal a recent decision by the Taipei District
Court to reject his request for the return of classified documents seized in a
high profile "state affairs fund" embezzlement case, the Presidential Office
announced Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen's lawyers -- Chen Chuan-yueh and Hung Kuei-tsan -- are expected to announce
at a news conference at 5 p.m. the president's decision to appeal the decision
to the Taiwan High Court in order "to defend his legitimate rights,"
Presidential Office officials said.</P>
      <P>On Sept. 6, Chen petitioned the district court to return invoices, vouchers,
magnetic records, written testimony by concerned individuals, and data related
to six secret diplomatic missions being used by prosecutors as evidence in the
case. All the materials are now being held by the district court.</P>
      <P>The president made the request on the grounds that the materials had been re-
labeled as "strictly confidential" materials that should be kept secret
permanently after the Council of Grand Justices confirmed June 15 the
president's constitutional right to decide what is a state secret and his right
to refuse to disclose such information, also known as "state secret privilege, "
the officials said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the district court rejected Chen's request in a ruling issued Oct.
5, saying that the exercise of the president's "state secret privilege" should
still be made in line with the constitutional principle of balance of power and
should be subject to scrutiny.</P>
      <P>The court ruled that the process in which the materials were proclaimed as
"absolute secrets" involved "serious, obvious flaws" and should be regarded as
invalid.</P>
      <P>The court determined that Chen lacks any reason or legal basis to ask for the
return of the materials because the president's privilege to refuse to give
testimony and produce evidence should be exercised before, not after, the
testimony is given and the evidence submitted.</P>
      <P>On Chen's claim that the materials were seized by the prosecutors without a
warrant, the court noted that the seizure was carried out based on a warrant
issued by the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office.</P>
      <P>Further rebutting Chen's claim that the materials were being held without his
consent, the court said the invoices and vouchers were taken away with the
consent of the head of the Presidential Office's accounting department, because
the department, not Chen, was the keeper of the invoices and vouchers.</P>
      <P>Also, the data regarding the six secret diplomatic missions was submitted to the
prosecutors by presidential aide Lin Te-hsun after obtaining Chen's approval,
the court said.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Chen did not insist that the withheld materials were state
secrets when undergoing questioning by prosecutors last year, the court claimed
that the president's move to proclaim the materials as "absolute secrets" only
during the final stage of the trial was "aimed merely at covering up the
administrative negligence and even irregularities" of the defendants.</P>
      <P>The court added that the move, which was not intended to protect national
security or national interests, violates the State Secrets Protection Act and
should be considered unlawful.</P>
      <P>The prosecution named Chen as a "joint perpetrator" when it indicted first lady
Wu Shu-jen on corruption and forgery charges Nov. 3, 2006 after determining she
had used receipts provided by others to claim reimbursements totaling NT$14.8
million (US$450,000) from the president's "state affairs fund" between July 2002
and March 2006.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that none of the money went into his own pocket, claiming it was
necessary to use receipts from different individuals to muster the funds to
engage in secret diplomatic missions in certain  countries  because of the
confusing  and inconsistent accounting system governing expenditures by the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>However, the district court ruled Jan. 19 that the six diplomatic missions cited
by the president as having drawn on the state affairs fund were not secret as
the president claimed, and should be disclosed in court proceedings.</P>
      <P>In a press statement issued late Oct. 5, the Presidential Office said that since
the documents are now in the district court's possession, the district court is
not a suitable judicial organ to decide whether or not they should be returned
to the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>According to current law, Chen, his wife Wu Shu-jen, and the president's aides
Ma Yung-cheng, Lin Te-hsun and Chen Chen-hui can appeal the district court
ruling.</P>

      <P>Three Taipei city councilors called Monday for the establishment of a
comprehensive network of bicycle paths in the capital city, out of concern for
the safety and benefits of cyclists.</P>
      <P>Councilors Wang Chih-ping, Dai Hsi-chin and Chen Yu-mei of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) , made the call after they examined bike traffic around several
Mass Rapid Transport stations earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>After the city government began Sept. 1 to fine cyclists who illegally ride on
fast traffic lanes or on the sidewalk, they found that bike commuters have since
become the most vulnerable road users.</P>
      <P>On many road sections in the metropolis, Dai said, it is common to see cars
jostling motorbikes for road space,  forcing the motorbikes to crowd bicycles
off the road. To protect themselves, cyclists often have to risk being fined by
riding on the sidewalk, he noted.</P>
      <P>According to traffic police statistics, Wang indicated that since the beginning
of September, the police have so far ticketed 383 cyclists for running red
lights, 116 for riding in the fast lanes, 71 for riding on pedestrian crossings,
and 132 for riding against the traffic flow.</P>
      <P>On average, 24 tickets are issued per day, Wang said, indicating that the high
rate could mean the city has not had set aside enough road space for cyclists.</P>

      <P>A former commander of the 6th Army Corps in northern Taiwan has been indicted on
charges of corruption, Vice Minister of National Defense Ko Cheng-en confirmed
Monday.</P>
      <P>Questioned  by reporters about a front-page report on the indictment carried by
the local daily the China Times, Ko said the Ministry of National Defense
respects the military prosecutors' decision to ask the Military High Court to
impose a 16-year sentence on Lt. Gen. Cheng Shih-yu for embezzling NT$1.34
million in public funds.</P>
      <P>The sentence being sought for Cheng is the harshest ever for any ranking
military official in Taiwan charged with corruption. Cheng is also the highest-
ranking military officer to be indicted in recent years.</P>
      <P>Ko urged the public not to allow an "isolated case" to offset the contributions
made by the great majority of the armed forces' personnel.</P>
      <P>He also denied speculation that Cheng's prosecution might have something to do
with a power struggle among the top military brass.</P>
      <P>Cheng has been in custody since July 20 pending the completion of an
investigation into charges that he embezzled NT$1.34 million (US$41,090) of his
administrative funds between late 2006 and July this year while he served as
commander of the 6th Army Corps.</P>
      <P>According to the China Times report, the military prosecutors asked for a
16-year sentence rather than the minimum seven years in prison because he did
not confess to the crime and remained "unrepentant."</P>
      <P>Previous reports by other news media said that Cheng remitted NT$150,000 of his
administrative fund every month to a 39-year-old mistress while he served as

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that no death row convict has been executed
in Taiwan for nearly two years and that he has always wanted the death penalty
being phased out completely from the country.</P>
      <P>Talking to Mario Marazziti, the famous movie director and founder of the anti-
death penalty group the Community of Sant'Egidio, at the Presidential Office,
Chen said that due to barriers posed by divided public opinion, capital
punishment has not been abolished in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen said, he has made sure that the Ministry of Justice has
exercised great prudence in executing death row inmates and hopes to first
achieve a "zero execution record" before capital punishment is abolished once
and for all.</P>
      <P>As a result, he went on, no death row convict has been executed in Taiwan since
January 2006, adding that this can be seen as a positive response to the anti-
death penalty movement launched by groups around the world.</P>
      <P>He said it would be a great triumph for the world's anti-death penalty movement
if a motion -- initiated by the European Council to have capital punishment
abolished from the world completely -- is passed and adopted by the United
Nations General Assembly.</P>
      <P>The president said that so far, over 130 nations, or two-thirds of all U.N.
member countries, have ceased executing death row convicts or have abolished
capital punishment.</P>
      <P>Chen recalled that 20 years ago when he was a legislative aide, he had begun to
push for an abolition of the death penalty in Taiwan "because at that time, I
had already become aware that abolishing capital punishment was a global trend,
with one country on average ceasing executing death row convicts or abolishing
capital punishment each year."</P>
      <P>Ever since he was elected president in 2000, Chen said, he has stressed the
imperative of abolishing the death penalty and as a result, then-Minister of
Justice Chen Ding-nan proposed a draft for basic human rights, which included a
clause calling for the abolition of capital punishment.</P>
      <P>Chen quoted the results of a public opinion poll indicating that 80 percent of
adults in Taiwan oppose the abolition of the death penalty,  although  40
percent  would support  it as long as complementary and preventive policies are
worked out as additional measures.</P>
      <P>For his part, Marazziti said that although Taiwan is not a U.N. member, its
government's pushing for an abolition of the death penalty is tremendously
significant and will earn recognition and support from the rest of the world.</P>

      <P>A legislative caucus whip of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged
Chinese President Hu Jintao Monday to respect Taiwan's sovereign status.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wang Tuoh made the call at a press conference at the Legislative Yuan
in response to remarks by Hu concerning the Taiwan issue in his report at the
opening of the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in
Beijing earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Hu, who concurrently heads the CPC, said that Beijing will never waver on its
"one China" principles, nor will it give up efforts to seek peaceful unification
of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In his report, Hu also reaffirmed no change in Beijing's principle of
"entrusting hope to the Taiwanese people" for the goal of unification and no
compromise on Taiwan's separation movements.</P>
      <P>Hu also called for talks to end cross-strait hostility under the "one China"
policy.</P>
      <P>In response, Wang said the DPP respects Hu's "one China" overture since there is
indeed only one China in the world. Nevertheless, Wang went on, the DPP looks
forward to China's reciprocal respect for Taiwan's sovereign status.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan is an independent, sovereign state, Wang said Taiwan has
never belonged to the People's Republic of China nor been part of it.</P>
      <P>It is worthy of respect that China has begun to take the idea of "peace" as a
means of resolving disputes, Wang said, but cautioned that it is not acceptable
to take the ideas of "unification" or "one China" as a prerequisite for efforts
to hold cross-strait talks on resolving bilateral disputes.</P>
      <P>If China wants to "entrust its hope to Taiwanese people, " Wang suggested, it
should first withdraw the hundreds of missiles it has deployed  targeting
Taiwan  and help Taiwan obtain access to international organizations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey said Taiwan will not talk
about "unification" with the Chinese Communist regime.</P>
      <P>"We will never talk about unification or other things with a regime that
suppresses Tibet, kills its own people and supports the military junta of
Myanmar, " Shieh said, describing the attitude as "our insistence upon adopting

      <P>At least 402 students in Chiayi City's elementary and middle schools have been
infected by acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, health officials at the city
government said Monday.</P>
      <P>The officials at the Public Health Bureau under the city government said the
highly contagious enteroviral eye infection is most likely caused by
coxsackievirus type A24,  a variant of enterovirus.</P>
      <P>They warned that the disease could easily develop into an epidemic but urged the
public not to panic, because the eye infection can be prevented by frequent hand
washing and avoiding the use of shared towels.</P>
      <P>Those people who feel the urge to rub their eyes should do so with a cotton swab
or a Q-tip, instead of using their hands, they added.</P>
      <P>Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is characterized by sudden onset of painful,
swollen, red eyes, with conjunctival hemorrhaging and excessive tearing. The
disease has been noted throughout the tropical regions.</P>
      <P>According to medical doctors, no effective treatment is available for the

      <P>Taiwan's future must be determined by its people and Beijing's "one China"
principle is the prime barrier to cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges, the Cabinet-
level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said is a news release issued Monday.</P>
      <P>The MAC issued the press release after Chinese President Hu Jintao called for a
peace agreement based on the one-China principle earlier the same day during the
opening session of the Communist Party of China's 17th five-yearly Congress.</P>
      <P>Hu was quoted by AFP in a report from Beijing as saying, "On the basis of the
one-China principle, let us discuss a formal end to the state of hostility
between the two sides, reach a peace agreement, construct a framework for
peaceful development of cross-strait relations and thus usher in a new phase of
peaceful development."</P>
      <P>According to the MAC, Hu's insistence on using the "one China" principle to
develop peaceful cross-strait dealings is reflective of ignorance as to the
existing situation between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>If Beijing chooses to believe that Taiwan's people would accept its "one
country, two systems" unification scheme, China must be entirely ignorant as to
mainstream opinion in Taiwan, the MAC said, adding that Beijing is seeking to
create a justification for its anti-secession  law  against  Taiwan  by
presenting  Taiwan's democratization efforts as moves toward "de jure
independence."</P>
      <P>For Taiwan, China's institution of a democratic system is the cornerstone to
building peaceful relations and developing two-way exchanges between the two
sides, the MAC said.</P>
      <P>If China truly intends to contribute to the well-being of Taiwan's people, it
should swiftly remove all political barriers and artificial barriers to wrapping
up negotiations on the opening of direct cross-strait passenger and cargo
charter flight service and on allowing Chinese tourists to sightsee in Taiwan,
the MAC stated.</P>
      <P>If China fails to remove its many politically charged barriers to concluding
technical talks with Taiwan, it will be impossible for the two sides to move on
to negotiations over the establishment of full direct transport links and
construct a peaceful framework, the MAC statement noted.</P>
      <P>While expressing hope that China would embark on a democratic course as soon as
possible to catch up with worldwide moves toward democracy, freedom and human
rights, the MAC called on Beijing to forswear its "one China" framework, scrap
its anti-secession law, stop its bullying of Taiwan in the international
community and remove all of its missiles aimed at Taiwan.</P>
      <P>To end the state of hostility and build a genuine peace across the strait, China
should begin formal negotiations with Taiwan's popularly elected government
without any preconditions, the MAC sttement concluded.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian Monday described Frank Hsieh, the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) candidate for the March 22, 2008 presidential
election, as the "leading actor" in the electoral campaign, and stressed that he
is only playing an auxiliar role to help Hsieh on to victory.</P>
      <P>Chen made the comments during an inspection tour of the DPP headquarters -- the
first after the president accepted the party's chairmanship last Thursday prior
to his departure for the Marshall Islands later that same day for a visit. Chen
returned home Sunday evening from the Marshall Islands, where he took part in
the second summit between Taiwan and its South Pacific allies.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside rampant speculation that the president would guide Hsieh on how
to campaign and ask Hsieh to follow his policies once he took over as DPP
chairman, Chen said that Hsieh-Chen collaboration, rather than Chen-Hsieh
cooperation, remains the key to the DPP's electoral campaign in the few months
remaining before the Jan. 12 legislative and March 22 presidential elections.</P>
      <P>Chen asserted that there is a deep mutual understanding between Hsieh and
himself based on past long-term cooperation, and labeled Hsieh as the
"protagonist" in their pairing. "I am playing only a supporting role and looking
after the house for the party, " he explained.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that his assuming the DPP chairmanship is intended to mend
differences and forge unity within the party as the party also seeks to garner
public approval on two referendums concerning Taiwan's U.N. membership and
retrieve the main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) ill-gotten party assets, besides
securing victory in the upcoming elections.</P>
      <P>Chen announced that Yu Shyi-kun, his predecessor who stepped down from the DPP's
chairmanship last month, would serve as the party's "top advisor," and Su Tseng-
chang, vice presidential candidate, as its "top honorary advisor."</P>
      <P>Commenting on the DPP's partnership with the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) in
the run-up to the legislative election, Chen said that he has learned of the
TSU's preliminary stance and admitted that it too is a critical issue with which
the party must deal.</P>
      <P>Cho Jung-tai, deputy secretary-general at the Presidential Office who has been
appointed to replace Lin Chia-lung as DPP secretary general, said that steps
will be taken through party mechanisms to make arrangements with the TSU and
that a possible settlement might be made public within a week.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The leader of an anti-graft campaign told a trial court Monday that the Assembly
and Parade Law should be abolished because it infringes on the constitutional
rights of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shih Ming-teh, leader of tens of thousands of red-clad protesters who tried to
depose scandal-ridden President Chen Shui-bian late last year,  made the remarks
while defending himself and 15 other anti-graft leaders on the first day of a
trial at the Taipei District Court.</P>
      <P>The 16 defendants, who pleaded not guilty, were indicted on charges of violating
the Assembly and Parade Law on the Oct. 10 National Day last year when they led
tens of thousands of supporters to besiege the Presidential Palace in an attempt
to force the president to step down.</P>
      <P>Shih expressed strong disagreement with the prosecution's charge that he had
committed a crime by leading the protestors in a street parade. He contended
that it is the people's constitutional right to oppose corruption -- a right
recognized in the 2003 United Nations Convention Against Corruption.</P>
      <P>He said the protest parade ended peacefully and should be seen as having set a
"textbook example" of the proper conduct of mass demonstrations.</P>
      <P>Shih, who served as chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party between
1994 and 1996 before quitting the party in 2000, said that if found guilty by
the lower court, he will not appeal, but will serve his term in prison.</P>
      <P>Saying that he has fought for freedom, human rights and justice for the
Taiwanese people all his life, Shih expressed confidence that even if he is
found guilty, history and the Taiwan people will do him justice one day.</P>
      <P>Shih was imprisoned twice between 1962 and 1989 for a total of 25 years under
the Kuomintang's previous authoritarian regime. He has been described by
supporters as "Taiwan's Mandela."</P>
      <P>He initiated the "Million Voices Against Corruption" campaign in September last
year after a public prosecutor indicted first lady Wu Shu-jen on charges of
corruption and forgery and named President Chen as a "joint perpetrator."</P>
      <P>Although the president is protected by the Constitution from being tried while
he is in office, the trial of his wife and five other defendants, including two
former senior presidential aides and two Presidential Office officials, has
continued at the Taiwan District Court since Dec. 15 last year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President appeal to reclaim documents of 'state affairs fund' case</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.15 (CNA)
10/15/07  23:43:35
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's lawyer filed an appeal with the Taipei District Court
Monday for reclamation of a collection of documents and articles held by the
court in the probes of a "state affairs fund" misuse case, in which first lady
Wu Shu-jen is a defendant.</P>
      <P>Chen Chuan-yueh filed the appeal on behalf of President Chen after the district
court handed down a ruling Oct. 5 that rejected the president's request for the
return of the collection on the grounds that the president's labeling of the
collection as "strictly confidential" as illegal.</P>
      <P>According to the Council of Grand Justices (CGJ) Ruling No. 627 issued June 15,
the Taiwan High Court is obliged to form a special tribunal to deal with a
dispute between the president and the prosecution or a district court over the
exercise of the president's "state secrets privilege."</P>
      <P>A court official said the District Court will hand over the appeal to the High
Court as soon as possible to seek a solution to the dispute. In accordance with
the CGJ constitutionality ruling, the district court has temporarily suspended
trial of the "state affairs fund" case pending a ruling by the High Court on
whether the collection of documents should be returned to the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>In preparation for the president's appeal, the High Court already unveiled last
Monday the rosters of eight special tribunals qualified to handle the case.</P>
      <P>The High Court will decide by drawing lots which special tribunal will be
authorized to mete out a ruling on the appeal. In line with the CGJ
stipulations, each tribunal is composed of five judges, one of whom must have
served as chief judge for at least 10 years.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, the president's lawyer outlined several key
reasons for filing the appeal against the District Court ruling:</P>
      <P>-- In terms of the CGJ constitutionality rulings No. 328 and 419, the
president's "state secrets privilege" is beyond the scrutiny of the judicial
branch because its exercise involves military, diplomacy and national security
affairs.</P>
      <P>-- The CGJ ruling No. 627 handed down June 15 that confirms the president's
"state secrets privilege" does not empower a general court to examine the
president's proclamation of a document or a diplomatic mission as confidential
that should be kept secret. The practices or precedents set forth in the U.S.
Watergate case could not be employed in President Chen's case as the Watergate
case didn't involve any national security, diplomatic or defense interests.</P>
      <P>-- The CGJ No. 627 ruling clearly states that the president should be given the
opportunity to explain or give supplementary explanations whether national
security and interests are at stake in disclosure of the collection of documents
in question.</P>
      <P>-- Any dispute between the president and the judicial branch over exercise of
their respective powers should be dealt with by the CGJ, not the district court.</P>
      <P>-- The exercise of president's "state secrets privilege" does not restrict to
those prescribed in the Classified National Security Information Protection Act.</P>
      <P>The District Court obtained the collection of documents and articles from a
prosecutorial team that indicted first lady Wu Shu-jen and three former and
incumbent presidential aides last November  on charges of corruption  and
forgery for allegedly embezzling NT$14.8 million (US$450,000) from the "state
affairs fund, " a special  allowance  fund  set aside  for the president's
discretionary use for state affairs.</P>
      <P>The collection consists of invoices, vouchers, magnetic records, written
testimony by concerned individuals and data related to six secret diplomatic
projects from 2002 to last December.</P>
      <P>Chen asked for the return of the collection Sept. 6 on the grounds that the
collection were "strictly confidential" information under the protection of the
Classified National Security Information Protection Act and should be kept
secret permanently.</P>
      <P>The president said in his petition that the collection was labeled "strictly
confidential" in line with CGJ Ruling No. 627, which confirms the president's
constitutional right to decide what constitutes a state secret and his right to
refuse disclosure, also known as "state secrets privilege."</P>
      <P>In a news release issued Oct. 5, the Presidential Office said the District Court
has no power to deny the president's right to proclaim that the court-held
collection of documents are "strictly confidential" since the grand justices
have already confirmed the president's "state secrets privilege."</P>
      <P>Even if the exercise of the "state secrets privilege" should be subject to
judicial scrutiny, the news release said it should be conducted by a more
suitable judicial organ rather than the District Court.</P>
      <P>Regretting that the District Court made many biased allegation and judgments in
its ruling about the pending "state affairs fund" case, the press statement said
the District Court is by no means an appropriate agency to decide whether the
collection of documents in question should be returned to the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office further said that as the District Court has a vested
interest in the outcome of the ruling on the "ownership" of the collection, it
should not be permitted to issue a ruling on the case given the potential
conflict of interest.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office also rebutted the District Court's "false allegations"
that the president's move to proclaim the collection secret was merely aimed at
covering up the defendants' wrongdoings. Making such a premature judgment is in
obvious violation of the Criminal Procedure Law, which stipulates that all
defendants be considered innocent before a final ruling is handed down.</P>

      <P>The outbreak of pinkeye syndrome reveals that the personal hygiene habits of
Taiwanese people are not up to the standards of advanced countries like America
and Japan, Steve Kuo, director-general of Centers for Disease Control under the
Department of Health said Monday.</P>
      <P>The outbreak also implies that Taiwan should make greater efforts to prepare to
counter "more terrible" viruses than the one involved in this particular
disease, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Kuo made the remarks at a news conference held by opposition Kuomintang
legislators Kuo Su-chun and Hsieh Kuo-liang at the Legislative Yuan. Hsieh
complained that the Department of Health has not been able to control the spread
of pink-eye syndrome--a form of acute conjunctivitis--in real time.</P>
      <P>Hsieh pointed out that the syndrome started spreading throughout southern Taiwan
and Keelung City in northern Taiwan Oct. 4, but the CDC procrastinated its
sample collection and inspection activities until Oct. 8, and thus delayed its
confirmation of the presence of Coxsackie  A24  virus--the  culprit  responsible
for  of  the disease--until Oct. 11.</P>
      <P>Kuo replied that including pink-eye syndrome in the infectious disease system
would help improve the efficiency of epidemic disease prevention and cure.</P>
      <P>He estimated that it takes about three months to control the disease and at
least one month to cool down its spreading situation. He also added that over 10
thousand people have been infected with the disease.</P>
      <P>Kuo said the Ministry of Education will work together with DOH to prevent the
spread of the disease. Schools will enhance their efforts to educate students
about the disease, and teach students good hygiene habits.</P>
      <P>He called on the public to avoid sharing towels, hand-to-eye contact, and eye
medicine, and to wash their hands thoroughly before and after contact with their
eyes. He also reminded people to reduce the amount of time spent in public
places to reduce the odds of infection, and suggested that students infected
with the virus should temporarily stop going to schools to avoid contributing to
new infection clusters.</P>

      <P>The government is working to amend the existing pension system to meet the needs
of Taiwan's aging society, officials of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) said Monday.</P>
      <P>It is more and more obvious that the population of the country is aging,
particularly in light of an assessment that shows the percentage of young people
aged under 15 will decline from 18 percent in 2006 to 13 percent in 2016, and
further to 8 percent by 2051.</P>
      <P>Officials said the ratio of young kids to that of senior citizens, aged above
65, will change from 1:0.5 in 2006 to 1: 4.7 in 2051.</P>
      <P>They further said assessments show that the index of the graying of the country
will be 70 times greater in 2051, compared with the level in 1971.</P>
      <P>In its policy advice to the government, the CEPD suggested ways to deal with the
trend, which include extending the mandatory retirement age and allowing those
reaching that age the opportunity to continue working on a part-time basis.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the extension of the working age, the pension system should
also be adapted to meet the changing demographic trend, the CEPD said.</P>

      <P>The Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC) has revised downward next year's targeted number of foreign visits to
Taiwan by one million as the number of Japanese visitors to Taiwan is not
increasing at the anticipated rate, a bureau official announced Monday.</P>
      <P>Despite the reduced growth, the number of Japanese travelers to Taiwan still
grew by 2.23 percent so far this year, while that of Japanese visitors to South
Korea and Singapore showed negative growth, Bureau Director General Janice Lai
said.</P>
      <P>However, Lai admitted that it is difficult to reach this year's goal of 3.75
million foreign visits to Taiwan, particularly due to the lower than expected
number of Japanese tourists coming to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Japanese travelers to Taiwan make up one third of the country's total foreign
visitors, Lai said.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, as of September, the total number of foreign visits to Taiwan
has reached 2.7 million, up from the same period of last year. To reach this
year's target, the bureau needs additional 1.05 million foreign visits in the
remaining three months.</P>
      <P>The bureau has revised its plan aimed at boosting the development of local
tourism industry between 2007 and 2009, and now aims to realize annual growth of
seven percent, Lai noted.</P>
      <P>Under the revised plan, the bureau hopes to increase the number of foreign
visits to Taiwan to four million by 2008, and 4.25 million by 2009, Lai said,
adding that the plan does not include Chinese tourists who are currently not
allowed to travel directly to Taiwan from China.</P>
      <P>The plan is part of a tourism-boosting project launched by the Executive Yuan in
2002 with the aim of doubling foreign visits to Taiwan to 5 million by 2008.</P>
      <P>During the first eight months of this year, foreign visits to Taiwan from Hong
Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia all reported an increase, while the
number of U.S. visitors to Taiwan fell,  Lai said,  attributing  the increase to
many years of governmental efforts.</P>
      <P>The bureau's figures show that in recent years, the number of foreign visitors
arriving in Taiwan on a tourist visa has increased by 73 percent from 870,000 in
2000 to 1.51 million in 2006, Lai went on.</P>
      <P>Lai forecast that the number of visitors will further rise to 1.75 million next
year.</P>
      <P>However, in recent years, the number of foreign tourists with a business visa
has dropped, Lai said, pointing out that during the period between January-
September of this year,  the number of foreigners making business trips to
Taiwan posted a year-on-year decline of 2.38 percent.</P>
      <P>Lai also said she hopes that the Legislative Yuan will approve the bureau's
proposal to increase its budget next year by NT$1.1 billion (US$36 million) .
She added that NT$600 million of that would be used to enhance the international
profile of tourism in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kao-ching, secretary-general of the Travel Agents Association of R.O.C.,
Taiwan, for his part, urged the government to lift a ban on Chinese tourists to
Taiwan as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsu also called for an increase to the government's budget for
international marketing, which he claims could generate high returns.</P>
      <P>In addition, Hsu suggested the government grant visa-free access to visitors
from Thailand, train Korean-speaking tour guides, and increase the bi-
directional passenger rate of local charter flights to Japan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government lowers targeted number of tourist arrivals by 1 million</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  15 (CNA)
10/16/07  10:02:00

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC) has revised downward next year's targeted number of tourist arrivals to
Taiwan by one million as the number of Japanese visitors is not increasing at
the anticipated rate, a bureau official announced Monday.</P>
      <P>Despite the reduced growth, the number of Japanese travelers to Taiwan still
grew by 2.23 percent so far this year, while that of Japanese visitors to South
Korea and Singapore showed negative growth, Bureau Director General Janice Lai
said.</P>
      <P>However, Lai admitted that it is difficult to reach this year's goal of 3.75
million foreign visits to Taiwan, particularly due to the lower than expected
number of Japanese tourists coming to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Japanese travelers to Taiwan make up one third of the country's total foreign
visitors, Lai said.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, as of September, the total number of foreign visits to Taiwan
has reached 2.7 million, up from the same period of last year. To reach this
year's target, the bureau needs additional 1.05 million foreign visits in the
remaining three months.</P>
      <P>The bureau has revised its plan aimed at boosting the development of local
tourism industry between 2007 and 2009, and now aims to realize annual growth of
seven percent, Lai noted.</P>
      <P>Under the revised plan, the bureau hopes to increase the number of foreign
visits to Taiwan to four million by 2008, and 4.25 million by 2009, Lai said,
adding that the plan does not include Chinese tourists who are currently not
allowed to travel directly to Taiwan from China.</P>
      <P>The plan is part of a tourism-boosting project launched by the Executive Yuan in
2002 with the aim of doubling foreign visits to Taiwan to 5 million by 2008.</P>
      <P>During the first eight months of this year, foreign visits to Taiwan from Hong
Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia all reported an increase, while the
number of U.S. visitors to Taiwan fell,  Lai said,  attributing  the increase to
many years of governmental efforts.</P>
      <P>The bureau's figures show that in recent years, the number of foreign visitors
arriving in Taiwan on a tourist visa has increased by 73 percent from 870,000 in
2000 to 1.51 million in 2006, Lai went on.</P>
      <P>Lai forecast that the number of visitors will further rise to 1.75 million next
year.</P>
      <P>However, in recent years, the number of foreign tourists with a business visa
has dropped, Lai said, pointing out that during the period between January-
September of this year,  the number of foreigners making business trips to
Taiwan posted a year-on-year decline of 2.38 percent.</P>
      <P>Lai also said she hopes that the Legislative Yuan will approve the bureau's
proposal to increase its budget next year by NT$1.1 billion (US$36 million) .
She added that NT$600 million of that would be used to enhance the international
profile of tourism in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kao-ching, secretary-general of the Travel Agents Association of R.O.C.,
Taiwan, for his part, urged the government to lift a ban on Chinese tourists to
Taiwan as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsu also called for an increase to the government's budget for
international marketing, which he claims could generate high returns.</P>
      <P>In addition, Hsu suggested the government grant visa-free access to visitors
from Thailand, train Korean-speaking tour guides, and increase the bi-
directional passenger rate of local charter flights to Japan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Anti-graft leader wants Assembly and Parade Law abolished</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 15 (CNA)
10/16/07  10:03:07

    <TEXT>
      <P>The leader of an anti-graft campaign told a trial court Monday that the Assembly
and Parade Law should be abolished because it infringes on the constitutional
rights of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shih Ming-teh, leader of tens of thousands of red-clad protesters who tried to
depose scandal-ridden President Chen Shui-bian late last year,  made the remarks
while defending himself and 15 other anti-graft leaders on the first day of a
trial at the Taipei District Court.</P>
      <P>The 16 defendants, who pleaded not guilty, were indicted on charges of violating
the Assembly and Parade Law on the Oct. 10 National Day last year when they led
tens of thousands of supporters to besiege the Presidential Palace in an attempt
to force the president to step down.</P>
      <P>Shih expressed strong disagreement with the prosecution's charge that he had
committed a crime by leading the protestors in a street parade. He contended
that it is the people's constitutional right to oppose corruption -- a right
recognized in the 2003 United Nations Convention Against Corruption.</P>
      <P>He said the protest parade ended peacefully and should be seen as having set a
"textbook example" of the proper conduct of mass demonstrations.</P>
      <P>Shih, who served as chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party between
1994 and 1996 before quitting the party in 2000, said that if found guilty by
the lower court, he will not appeal, but will serve his term in prison.</P>
      <P>Saying that he has fought for freedom, human rights and justice for the
Taiwanese people all his life, Shih expressed confidence that even if he is
found guilty, history and the Taiwan people will do him justice one day.</P>
      <P>Shih was imprisoned twice between 1962 and 1989 for a total of 25 years under
the Kuomintang's previous authoritarian regime. He has been described by
supporters as "Taiwan's Mandela."</P>
      <P>He initiated the "Million Voices Against Corruption" campaign in September last
year after a public prosecutor indicted first lady Wu Shu-jen on charges of
corruption and forgery and named President Chen as a "joint perpetrator."</P>
      <P>Although the president is protected by the Constitution from being tried while
he is in office, the trial of his wife and five other defendants, including two
former senior presidential aides and two Presidential Office officials, has
continued at the Taiwan District Court since Dec. 15 last year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President appeal to reclaim documents of 'state affairs fund' case</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.15 (CNA)
10/16/07  10:05:37
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's lawyer filed an appeal with the Taipei District Court
Monday for reclamation of a collection of documents and articles held by the
court in the probes of a "state affairs fund" misuse case, in which first lady
Wu Shu-jen is a defendant.</P>
      <P>Chen Chuan-yueh filed the appeal on behalf of President Chen after the district
court handed down a ruling Oct. 5 that rejected the president's request for the
return of the collection on the grounds that the president's labeling of the
collection as "strictly confidential" as illegal.</P>
      <P>According to the Council of Grand Justices (CGJ) Ruling No. 627 issued June 15,
the Taiwan High Court is obliged to form a special tribunal to deal with a
dispute between the president and the prosecution or a district court over the
exercise of the president's "state secrets privilege."</P>
      <P>A court official said the District Court will hand over the appeal to the High
Court as soon as possible to seek a solution to the dispute. In accordance with
the CGJ constitutionality ruling, the district court has temporarily suspended
trial of the "state affairs fund" case pending a ruling by the High Court on
whether the collection of documents should be returned to the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>In preparation for the president's appeal, the High Court already unveiled last
Monday the rosters of eight special tribunals qualified to handle the case.</P>
      <P>The High Court will decide by drawing lots which special tribunal will be
authorized to mete out a ruling on the appeal. In line with the CGJ
stipulations, each tribunal is composed of five judges, one of whom must have
served as chief judge for at least 10 years.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, the president's lawyer outlined several key
reasons for filing the appeal against the District Court ruling:</P>
      <P>-- In terms of the CGJ constitutionality rulings No. 328 and 419, the
president's "state secrets privilege" is beyond the scrutiny of the judicial
branch because its exercise involves military, diplomacy and national security
affairs.</P>
      <P>-- The CGJ ruling No. 627 handed down June 15 that confirms the president's
"state secrets privilege" does not empower a general court to examine the
president's proclamation of a document or a diplomatic mission as confidential
that should be kept secret. The practices or precedents set forth in the U.S.
Watergate case could not be employed in President Chen's case as the Watergate
case didn't involve any national security, diplomatic or defense interests.</P>
      <P>-- The CGJ No. 627 ruling clearly states that the president should be given the
opportunity to explain or give supplementary explanations whether national
security and interests are at stake in disclosure of the collection of documents
in question.</P>
      <P>-- Any dispute between the president and the judicial branch over exercise of
their respective powers should be dealt with by the CGJ, not the district court.</P>
      <P>-- The exercise of president's "state secrets privilege" does not restrict to
those prescribed in the Classified National Security Information Protection Act.</P>
      <P>The District Court obtained the collection of documents and articles from a
prosecutorial team that indicted first lady Wu Shu-jen and three former and
incumbent presidential aides last November  on charges of corruption  and
forgery for allegedly embezzling NT$14.8 million (US$450,000) from the "state
affairs fund, " a special  allowance  fund  set aside  for the president's
discretionary use for state affairs.</P>
      <P>The collection consists of invoices, vouchers, magnetic records, written
testimony by concerned individuals and data related to six secret diplomatic
projects from 2002 to last December.</P>
      <P>Chen asked for the return of the collection Sept. 6 on the grounds that the
collection were "strictly confidential" information under the protection of the
Classified National Security Information Protection Act and should be kept
secret permanently.</P>
      <P>The president said in his petition that the collection was labeled "strictly
confidential" in line with CGJ Ruling No. 627, which confirms the president's
constitutional right to decide what constitutes a state secret and his right to
refuse disclosure, also known as "state secrets privilege."</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEPD acts to amend pension system to meet needs of aging society</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is working to amend the existing pension system to meet the needs
of Taiwan's aging society, officials of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) said Monday.</P>
      <P>It is more and more obvious that the population of the country is aging,
particularly in light of an assessment that shows the percentage of young people
aged under 15 will decline from 18 percent in 2006 to 13 percent in 2016, and
further to 8 percent by 2051.</P>
      <P>Officials said the ratio of young kids to that of senior citizens, aged above
65, will change from 1:0.5 in 2006 to 1: 4.7 in 2051.</P>
      <P>They further said assessments show that the index of the graying of the country
will be 70 times greater in 2051, compared with the level in 1971.</P>
      <P>In its policy advice to the government, the CEPD suggested ways to deal with the
trend, which include extending the mandatory retirement age and allowing those
reaching that age the opportunity to continue working on a part-time basis.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the extension of the working age, the pension system should
also be adapted to meet the changing demographic trend, the CEPD said.</P>

      <P>The upcoming round-the-nation torch relay to promote the country's bid to join
the United Nations is open to all political parties, ethnic groups and people of
all ages, Government Information Office (GIO) Minister Shieh Jhy-wey said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Opposition parties, including the Kuomintang, are welcome to participate in the
11-day event, Shieh said.</P>
      <P>The relay will kick off at 7 a.m. Oct. 24 in front of the Presidential Office on
Ketagalan Boulevard in downtown Taipei, with President Chen Shui-bian leading
the pack, Shieh said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Oct. 24 is of historic significance as the U.N. Charter entered into
force Oct. 24, 1945, Shieh said the GIO has picked the day to launch the torch
relay to send the world a clear message that the people of Taiwan want
representation in the world body.</P>
      <P>"We would also like to use the occasion to voice our protest against the U.N.
snub to our membership application, " Shieh said, adding that its denial of
Taiwan's access has violated its principle of membership universality and its
promise of safeguarding basic human rights.</P>
      <P>Shieh, Sports Affairs Council Chairman Yang Chung-ho and several outstanding
athletes jointly lighted a symbolic torch at a news conference Monday to promote
the event and invite people from all walks of life to attend.</P>
      <P>Yang said 17 athletes and celebrities will carry the torch through 25 counties
and cities around the country, including the outlying islands of Penghu, Kinmen
and Matsu.</P>
      <P>Besides pushing for the country's U.N. membership bid, Yang said the 11-day
torch relay is also aimed at encouraging people to take more exercise. The
1,200-km torch relay is expected to attract at least 100,000 participants, Yang
said, adding that those interested in the vent are welcome to take part in the
relay in the cities or townships at their convenience.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Shieh said the GIO will put up advertisements or commercials before
Oct. 24 to invite local citizens to organize teams to join the road run.</P>
      <P>The event is scheduled to conclude at 6: 30 p.m. Nov. 3 when the torch will
return to the Presidential Office plaza.</P>
      <P>Responding to press inquiries about the government's stance toward Chinese
President Hu Jintao's call for an end to cross-strait enmity and for the signing
of a peace agreement under its "one China" principle, Shieh said Taiwan will not
negotiate with a regime that kills its own people, suppresses Tibet and backs
Myanmar's military junta.</P>
      <P>Stressing that human rights and democracy are the foundation of the country,
Shieh said if the Beijing leadership really wants to entrust its hopes on the
people of Taiwan, it should listen to them and realize what price Taiwan people
have paid for human rights and democracy.</P>
      <P>While Taiwanese and Chinese people can stand together for democracy and human
rights, Shieh reiterated that Taiwan's government will never discuss peace,
unification or other issues with a regime that bullies and oppresses Tibet,
kills its own people and supports the military junta in Myanmar.</P>

      <P>Relevant authorities need to increase communication with the public on a

the country's bid to join the United Nations, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang said the authorities should try to make the public understand that the

Taiwan to be included in these organizations.</P>

      <P>However, the United Daily News reported Tuesday that an American teaching
English in Taiwan protested what he called the "dictatorial practice" of using
private mail as a promotional item of the ruling party after he discovered that
a letter he recently mailed to his fiancee in the United States was stamped with
the logo.</P>
      <P>The teacher, surnamed Talovich, said that the logo fails to represent his
@position on the issue and that stamping his mail without his consent infringed
upon his freedom of speech.</P>
      <P>In response, Chang said he thinks it is "very appropriate" for the authorities
to use the logo on mail since joining the United Nations is the mainstream
opinion among Taiwan's citizens and is also an official policy of the
government.</P>
      <P>Chang said he believes the authorities will evaluate public reaction to the
measure in deciding whether to carry on with it.</P>
      <P>Also Tuesday, at the request of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), Taiwan Post Co.
President Wu Min-you promised that the company will review the policy and
produce a report within a week.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the policy of stamping the logo on mail, which is scheduled to
continue until Dec. 31, was made by the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications and the company.</P>
      <P>Wu argued that there is nothing inappropriate about the policy as a majority of
the people in Taiwan support the U.N. bid, adding that the company has in the
past stamped other promotional logos on mail, such as the one promoting the
fight against the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the one promoting a campaign against
vote buying in 2004.</P>
      <P>Disagreeing with Wu, KMT Legislator Kuo Su-chun claimed the drive to apply for
U.N. membership under the name Taiwan is one initiated by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) to boost the party's 2008 presidential campaign, which
she said has nothing to do with the government's policy.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile KMT Legislators Shuai Hua-min and Wu Yu-shen said that Taiwan Post Co.
has no right to express any political positions on behalf of the people and that
the company's policy has violated the people's freedom of speech.</P>
      <P>The DPP has been pushing for a referendum to be held alongside the next
presidential election on whether to use the name Taiwan to join the United
Nations, while the KMT has been pushing for a referendum on the Republic of
China applying to return to the United Nations.</P>

      <P>Susan Chang, vice chairwoman of the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), will
lead a Taiwan insurance business delegation to attend the 14th annual conference
of the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) to be held in
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Oct. 16-19.</P>

Monday.</P>
      <P>Chang said that more than 500 delegates of financial supervisors from 90
countries will attend the IAIS annual conference this year. In addition,  160
representatives  of insurance  companies and international organizations will

conference, members of the association passed a resolution stating that the FSC
will host the three meetings slated for 2010 in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the FSC has been active in international activities. In July
2008, the FSC will host the annual meeting of the International insurance
Society for the first time.</P>
      <P>Established in 1994, the IAIS represents insurance regulators and supervisors in
some 180 jurisdictions. The IAIS issues global insurance principles,  standards
and guidance papers,  provides training and support on issues related to
insurance supervision, and organizes meetings and seminars for insurance
supervisors.</P>
      <P>The agenda of the 44th annual conference will feature international accounting
standards, education project for insurance supervisors, creating supervisory and
regulatory capacity in emerging markets, reinsurance, globalization, principle-

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung pledged Tuesday that the government will react
responsibly to any possible economic sanctions by China.</P>
      <P>However, Chang said he cannot reveal any more details in public because the
issue is one that concerns national security, stressing that no matter how China
suppresses Taiwan, relevant authorities in the government will make their utmost
efforts to protect the interests of the country's citizens.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks during an interpellation session in the Legislative
Yuan when he was asked whether the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
administration is properly prepared for a possible escalation in cross-Taiwan
Strait tensions and for possible moves by China to impose economic sanctions
against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the issue, Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R.L. Chen said that in the
event of China imposing economic sanctions, Taiwan should be able to find other
markets to replace China in light of the island's strong export momentum.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will set up a center to study the United
Nations Oct. 21 to help push for Taiwan's entry to the world organization,
director of MOFA's Department of International Organizations Lin Yung-lo said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the Taiwan New Century Foundation will be responsible for
planning the U.N. Study Center, which follows the establishment of the Asia-
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Study Center and the World Health
Organization (WHO) Study Center set up also by MOFA.</P>
      <P>There will be a seminar held at the inauguration ceremony for the U.N. Study
Center to discuss means of combining the efforts of the people of Taiwan in
pushing for the country's early entry to the United Nations, Lin added.</P>
      <P>Regarding Taiwan's achievements in promoting its entry to the U.N. under the
name Taiwan for the first time this year, Lin said the fact that the United
States did not speak unfavorably of Taiwan's U.N. bid at the just concluded U.N.
General Assembly boded well for Taiwan, while Taiwan's media campaign and the
support shown by its allies produced results close to the targets originally set
by the government, Lin said.</P>
      <P>As for next year's plans, Lin went on to say that the MOFA will pay special
attention to the attitudes of the United States, Japan and the European Union
toward Taiwan's WHO bid next year, and work to make them understand that
applying for U.N. or WHO membership under the name Taiwan is reflective of the
will of the majority of Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China failed to re-enter the United Nations in all of its
attempts since 1993 due to opposition from China, and this year it changed
tactics by applying for a seat under the name Taiwan, although that too failed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA asks Beijing ease international squeeze on Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing should quit trying to squeeze Taiwan out of the international community
if it truly wishes to display goodwill toward Taiwan, Wang Chien-yeh, spokesman
for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wang made the comments in a MOFA news conference following Chinese President Hu
Jintao's call for a cross-Taiwan Strait peace accord the day earlier during the
opening of the Communist Party of China's 17th Congress in Beijing.</P>
      <P>AFP quoted Hu as saying: "On the basis of the one-China principle, let us
discuss a formal end to the state of hostility between the two sides, reach a
peace agreement, construct a framework for the peaceful development of cross-
strait relations and thus usher in a new phase of peaceful development."</P>
      <P>The White House hailed Hu's remarks as a step forward in the resumption of
cross-strait negotiations.</P>
      <P>Although Hu's remarks sound softer this time around and are supposed to help
build positive ties between Taiwan and China, Wang rebutted that Beijing must
not make its "one-China" principle a precondition to the resumption of cross-
strait negotiations because Taiwan is an independent and sovereign democracy,
and its future must be determined by Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>If Beijing is really willing to show good faith to Taiwan, it should leave
greater diplomatic room for Taiwan in the international community instead of
applying a "zero-sum" rule and thereby upsetting cross-strait exchanges, Wang
said.</P>
      <P>The United  States has long been supportive  of reopening cross-strait
negotiations and hopes that Beijing will hold talks with Taiwan's popularly
elected government rather than opposition party leaders, he noted.</P>
      <P>Whether or not Taiwan and China are able to rekindle bilateral negotiations will
depend on China's ensuing actions, and the MOFA will continue closely watching
its follow-up moves after the close of the Chinese communists' 17th Congress, he
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of male victims of domestic violence is on the rise, with 7,000
incidents against men reported in the first half of the year, representing 21
percent of the total, according to statistics released by the Ministry of
Interior (MOI) Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The figures show that a total of 10,294 men fell victim to domestic violence in
2005, representing 17 percent of the total. In 2006, the number of male victims
soared to 11,763, comprising 18.5 percent of the total.</P>
      <P>Although these figures exhibit an increasing tendency for men to be victimized,
the vast majority -- 80 percent -- of domestic violence victims are women.</P>
      <P>MOI statistics also show that there has been a substantial increase in the
number of young boys suffering domestic abuse, with 4,300 cases reported against
male children in 2005, and 5,500 in 2006: an increase of 28 percent year-on-
year.</P>
      <P>According to National Taiwan University Professor Wang Li-jung, who was
commissioned by the MOI to study the issue, male victims were mostly  often
subject  to some form of mental  and emotional maltreatment rather than physical
abuse.</P>
      <P>An MOI spokesman said that since the government promulgated the Domestic
Violence Prevention Act in June, 1998, the ministry has also stepped up its
publicity efforts to encourage victims of domestic violence to seek professional
assistance.</P>
      <P>The spokesman added that the MOI has launched the round-the-clock 113 hotline
and helped local governments around the country establish domestic violence
prevention centers to provide assistance to victims in a timely manner.</P>
      <P>He encouraged male victims of domestic violence not to be embarrassed to admit
being victimized, and not to be shy about asking for help from every possible
source.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A minor planet newly discovered by the Lulin Observatory of National Central
University in Chungli, Taoyuan County, has been formally named Chiayi--the name
of the southern Taiwan county that houses the observatory,  NCU President Lee
Lou-chuang said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The observatory officially adopted the name Monday, after the International
Astronomical  Union's  Committee  on Small  Body Nomenclature approved an
application from the observatory to name the planet after Chiayi Sept. 26, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>Lee said the planet was so named in order to express gratitude to local
aboriginal people for their assistance to the observatory during the early
stages of its establishment.</P>
      <P>The planet, about 2.4 kilometers in diameter, was spotted between Mars and
Jupiter by Lulin Observatory Director Lin Hung-chin Oct. 25 in 2006, with great
assistance from Yie Chuan-chih, a student at the Sun Yet-sen University in
Guangzhou City in China.</P>
      <P>Lin said planet Chiayi's orbit brings it within 280 million kilometers of the
Sun and as far as 420 million kilometers distant. It takes 3.62 years for the
planet to complete its path around the Sun, Lin added.</P>
      <P>NCU Vice President Ip Wing-huen said the observatory started its "Lulin Sky
Survey" (LUSS), a systematic sky scouting project in March in 2006, and that
more than 450 minor planets have been discovered so far. For an observatory
using a telescope of one meter in diameter, that performance is rather
excellent, according to Ip.</P>
      <P>Ip said NCU's Graduate  Institute  of Astronomy  joins an international research
project, Pan-STARR, which is aimed at finding new small planets or comets in
order to establish the world's most thorough observatory system of astronomical
phenomena.</P>
      <P>The project  was organized  by University  of Hawaii with authorization of the
U.S. Department of State, Ip said, adding that Taiwan is the only Asian team in
the project, which has also been joined by university teams from America,
Germany, and Britain.</P>
      <P>The NCU will spend about NT$130 million (US$3.98 million) to purchase a new two-
meter telescope, which will be completed and installed in 2010 when the planet
will be best viewed from the observatory. The new telescope will be available
for public use, to view the planet and other astronomical phenomena, Lee said.</P>

      <P>A new type of oral vaccine developed by National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) in
the southern city of Tainan to protect fish against various viral infections
will be used in Red Sea waters off the coast of Saudi Arabia, a spokesman of the
university said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The announcement came after NCKU President Michael M. C. Lai signed a
cooperation agreement with DevCorp Chairman James Greenberg at a hotel in Taipei
earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Lai predicted that the agreement will generate a production value of
approximately NT$60 billion (US$1.8 billion).</P>
      <P>According to test results, the world-leading vaccine technology developed by the
university's biotechnology team can effectively lower the death rate of fish
fries and in turn reduce the use of antibiotics, Lai noted.</P>
      <P>The vaccine has also been successfully applied to production systems for
developing highly disease-resistant fish fries, Lai said, adding that the
success rate could surpass 80 percent.</P>
      <P>The vaccine has resolved the long-term bottleneck in the local fish aquaculture
industry and greatly enhanced the development of the industry, Lai continued.</P>
      <P>In the past, oral vaccines were often mixed with artificial feed for fish, which
according to members of the research team neither produced satisfactory results
nor could be used on fish fries.</P>
      <P>DevCorp, the founder and the operator of Saudi Arabia's Venture Development
Fund, has been actively promoting collaboration projects between Asia and the

principle prior to seeking to sign a peace agreement with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition, China must also abandon its "anti-secession law" and dismantle its
deployment of more than 900 missiles targeting Taiwan, Chen stressed.</P>
      <P>Chen put forth the conditions for signing of the cross-Taiwan Strait peace
agreement during his visit to Keelung, northern Taiwan, earlier in the day in

      <P>Taxi fares in Taipei City will be hiked beginning Nov.  1,  officials of the
Taipei city government's Department of Transportation said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Cab fares in neighboring Taipei County and Keelung City are also expected to
rise as taxi drivers in the two areas have traditionally followed the rates
adopted in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>The announcement came after the Taipei city government approved a proposal to
raise the city's cab fares at a meeting earlier in the day. The last adjustment
was made seven years ago.</P>
      <P>After the adjustment, the current night-time fare will apply around the clock,
while an additional NT$20 will be charged between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m., the
officials said.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, during the day-time period of Chinese New Year holidays, an
additional NT$20 will be added to the new regular fare per ride while during the
night-time period, an additional NT$40 will be charged, the officials explained.</P>
      <P>The adjustment does not involve changing fare meters and allows for the starting
fare to be raised to NT$70 for the first 1.25 kilometers, after which an

went on.</P>
      <P>An additional NT$5 will also be required for every 1 minute and 40 seconds of

      <P>In addition, the transportation department decided to cancel a NT$10 surcharge

      <P>The 13th cross-strait financial seminar opened in Taipei Tuesday, with the
number and level of participating Chinese financial officials among the highest
in years.</P>
      <P>The two-day symposium was jointly sponsored by Taipei-based Taipei Foundation of
Finance, Chung-Hwa Institute for Economic Research and Beijing-based Banking
Society of China.</P>
      <P>Ko Chen-en, chairman of the Chung-Hwa Institution for Economic Research, urged
the participants to share with each other the problems and challenges faced in
their respective financial markets.</P>
      <P>Yi Kang, assistant governor of the People's Bank of China and head of the
Chinese delegation, noted that between 1978 and 2006, China's gross domestic
product averaged growth of around 9.7 percent, which was considered a miracle by
other countries.</P>
      <P>The Chinese currency, the yuan, was pegged to the U.S. dollar between 1996 and
2005, but since July 21, 2005, has appreciated against the greenback by around
11 percent, Yi said.</P>
      <P>On the major problems faced by Chinese economy, Yi pointed to the sharp increase
in investment, the huge trade surplus, the high consumption of resources, and
serious pollution, all of which the Chinese government needs to address.</P>
      <P>Yi's 20-odd delegation included ranking officials of the People's Bank of China,
Import and Export Bank of China Vice President Su Zhong, Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China Vice President Li Xiaopeng as well as chiefs of other
financial institutes.</P>
      <P>Zhu Yunlai, a son of former Chinese Premier Zhu Ronggi, also came in his
capacity of the CEO of China International Financial Corp.</P>
      <P>Topics discussed Tuesday included Taiwan's current monetary policy, the central
bank's management strategy, and the currency policy options for China given the
current influx of capital.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Foundation of Finance said the seminar will also discuss issues
related to the reasons for the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves,
financing for the small-  and medium-sized enterprises, corporate governance of
commercial banks, solicitation of private equity funds, the capital market and
the underwriting business as well as insurance operators facing an aging society
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>After the seminar, the Chinese delegation is expected to call on Taiwan's major
financial institutions, including banking, securities, insurance operators,
before leaving Taiwan Oct. 23.</P>

      <P>Beijing's "one China" principle is the key barrier to forging a peace accord
across the Taiwan Strait, and Taiwan cannot accept political obstructions  to
open bilateral negotiations on such an accord, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks in response to a question by opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) lawmaker Tseng Tsahn-deng during a question-and-answer session at
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chinese President Hu Jintao called for a one China-oriented peace accord between
Taiwan and China, a formal end to the state of hostility between Taiwan and
China and the construction of a framework for the peaceful development of cross-
strait relations a day earlier at the opening of the Communist Party of China's
17th Congress in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's future is in the hands of its people and Beijing's "one China"
prerequisite goes against the so-called Taiwan-centric notion among the people,
Chang asserted to reporters outside the Legislative Yuan following the
legislative session.</P>
      <P>The premier lamented Beijing's insistence on the "one China" policy and argued
that taking such a politically charged position marks no departure from
Beijing's past stance and is not helpful to the improvement in cross-strait
ties.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Cheng Ming-tong read a press release to
reporters stating that "Beijing's adhesion to the 'one China' condition has
created an astounding political barrier to peace negotiations between the two
sides."</P>
      <P>"If Hu is really intent on forging peace across the strait, he must recognize
the historical and existential fact that Taiwan and China are separately ruled
and do not belong to one another, " Chen went on.</P>
      <P>He urged Beijing to forswear its "one China" precondition, scrap the anti-
secession law, stop bullying Taiwan in international society and remove all its
military units targeting Taiwan so as to begin formal negotiations with Taiwan's
popularly elected government on making peace across the strait.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng called Tuesday for governmental
permission for Taiwan's financial sector to invest in China.</P>
      <P>Wang issued the call while giving a speech titled "The New Legislative Yuan and
Taiwan's Future" during a seminar sponsored by the European Chamber of Commerce
Taipei.</P>
      <P>As it would be easier for Taiwan-based banks to break into the Chinese market
than into the Japanese or European markets, the government should allow local
banks and peripheral businesses to invest in China as part of their
globalization efforts, Wang said, voicing his belief that the issue could be
resolved in a piecemeal fashion by starting with signing memorandums of
understanding with Chinese counterparts.</P>
      <P>According to Wang,  Taiwan is facing a crunch as it has increasingly  been
pushed aside amid fierce  competition  from neighboring countries and hit hard
by a worsening economy at home.</P>
      <P>Taiwan ranked last among Asia's four little dragons in 2006 and 2007 in terms of
per-capita income, with Singapore's average income now double that of Taiwan, he
pointed out. In a further sign of bad news, the central and local governments
have collectively incurred financial debts of more than NT$4 trillion (US$123
billion) , he added.</P>
      <P>The government should devote greater energy to improving Taiwan's economy
instead of wasting time on politics, he said, suggesting the government lift
restrictions on China-bound investment and allow Chinese capital to invest in
the home market and open regular direct transportation links across the Taiwan
Strait, among others.</P>
      <P>Asked by reporters following the seminar when he would pay a visit to China,
Wang replied that it might be better to do so after the March 22, 2008
presidential election and that he would like to talk over the above-mentioned
issues with relevant Chinese officials.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged politicians across party lines Tuesday to take
part in an upcoming nationwide torch relay promoting the country's bid to join
the United Nations, which is set to begin Oct. 24 from Taipei.</P>
      <P>Describing the bid as a policy with support across party lines, and an
aspiration of the country's citizens, Chen said he hopes that all people will
participate in the event regardless of political affiliation.</P>
      <P>"There is only one Taiwan, and there is only one goal. I hope every one will
work together to achieve something big," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in response to reports that some local government chiefs
from the Kuomintang have refused to take part in the event.</P>
      <P>According to the relay route and itinerary released Monday by the Sports Affairs
Council, Chen will lead the first leg from Taipei City to Taipei County, after
the torch is ignited at 7 a.m. Oct. 24 on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The 1,200-km relay, which will cover all 25 counties and cities around the
country, is expected to take 11 days to complete.</P>
      <P>Local government chiefs and people's representatives have also been invited to
participate in the event.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has tried without success since 1993 to have the United Nations consider
the issue of its representation. It suffered a fresh setback in its quest for
representation in the world body last month as an item endorsed by 17 of
Taiwan's diplomatic allies asking the world body to address Taiwan's membership
application was excluded from the agenda of the 62nd session of the General
Assembly.</P>
      <P>With promotion of the U.N. bid being a main policy plank of the Democratic
Progressive Party administration, the Cabinet has decided to designate Oct. 24
-- the anniversary of the coming into force of the Charter of the United Nations
which is celebrated internationally as United Nations Day -- as "Taiwan United
Nations Day" and is pushing for a referendum on whether to apply to join the
United Nations under the name Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The National Immigration Agency (NIA) has vowed to protect the human rights of
illegal foreign immigrants detained at the agency's centers around the country
Tuesday amid reports that one of its officers was probed for abusing foreign
laborers in his charge.</P>
      <P>An agency spokesman said that the immigrants should and will be treated fairly.</P>
      <P>Describing the scandal as an isolated case, the NIA spokesman said that there is
no problem with the quality of the agency's staff and pledged that its staff
members will face judicial charges for any misconduct.</P>
      <P>The remarks came after Ma Yun-chie, an officer at the agency's detention center
in the central city of Taichung, allegedly abused his power and mistreated two
female foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>The scandal broke out after the victims filed a complaint.</P>
      <P>Upon learning  of the incident,  NIA Director Wu Chen-chi instructed his
officials to collect relevant evidence, the spokesman said. However, Ma refused
to cooperate and threatened to commit suicide, he went on.</P>
      <P>The agency later asked prosecutors in Taichung to investigate the scandal, the

      <P>The central Taiwan-based Acme Physical Dance Theater will celebrate its 10th
founding anniversary by performing the premiere of its new show "Pet" in
Taichung this week.</P>
      <P>Two performances will be staged at 7:30 p.m. Oct. 19 and 20 at Taichung City's
Chunashan Hall.</P>
      <P>Troupe founder and artistic director Shih Gee-tze told reporters that in the
show, the definition of "pet" has been expanded to cover many favored things in
life for different people, including rag dolls for little girls, motorbikes for
men obsessed with speed, name-brand clothing for rich women and drinking in a
bar after work.</P>
      <P>Shih said the show combines dance with music and drama, allowing the dancers,
singers and actors to interact with dogs, cats and other "pets" and to use their
body language to reflect various aspects of life for different people in a
humorous way.</P>
      <P>Acme Physical Dance Theater was established in June 1997 as the the first
professional modern dance troupe based in Taichung. Since 2000, the group has
been invited to perform in Malaysia, the United States, Australia, Russia and

      <P>Overseas visits are necessary for the president to strengthen ties with other
countries, and therefore so too are the costs of charter flights for such
visits, an official of Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The official made the remarks in response to questions from opposition
Kuomintang Legislator Lien Chiang-fu over the high cost of chartering planes for
President Chen Shui-bian's overseas trips and the effectiveness of Chen's visits
to foreign countries since his inauguration in 2000.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang, Chen has made 14 overseas visits, at a cost of NT$600
million (US$18.5 million) for charter flights during the last seven years.
Chiang blasted Chen for draining the government's coffers for nothing.</P>
      <P>The official explained that the government sets aside a budget each year for
international conferences and exchanges, and NT$160 million is included to cover
the costs of overseas visits by president, vice president, chiefs of five
government branches, and special presidential envoys.</P>
      <P>President Chen's chartering of planes for his overseas visits is in keeping with
standard government practice, the official went on, citing the example of ex-
premier Sun Yun-suan, who chartered a Boeing 747 to visit Central America in the
1980s, and former President Lee Teng-hui, who visited several countries using
charter planes.</P>
      <P>In consideration of Taiwan's increasingly limited development space in the
international community due to China's pressure tactics, overseas  visits by
Taiwan's  heads of states are imperative, especially given the number of foreign
visits made by Chinese leaders, the official stressed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) presidential candidate, Ma Ying-jeou,
suggested Monday that the two sides of Taiwan Strait begin talks on the basis of
the "one China, respective interpretations" consensus reached in 1992.</P>
      <P>The so-called "1992 Consensus" refers to an understanding the KMT claims to have
reached in Hong Kong that there's only one China but that both sides are free to
make their own interpretations of what "one China" actually means.</P>
      <P>"What we think of the 'one China' means the Republic of China, " Mai said.</P>
      <P>Ma suggested the two sides seek to end the state of hostility between them on
the basis of the consensus. However, he noted that is only an agreement on
maintaining peace across the strait, and "the future of Taiwan still has to be
decided by Taiwanese people."</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks in Taitung, southern Taiwan, in response to media inquiries
on Chinese President Hu Jintao's Monday proposal for a peace agreement between
the two sides on the basis of the "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>The former KMT Chairman said it has, for some time, been his idea that the two
side should sign a peace agreement to end the state of hostility between them,
and that the idea has been adopted by the KMT as a part of its party platform.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he regarded Hu's report as a gesture of goodwill, Ma said that
compared with Beijing's conducts in the past, he thinks the call for a peaceful
development of cross-strait relations is an "improvement."</P>

      <P>The long-term unemployment rate has dropped significantly,  although the labor
participation rates for the middle-aged and elderly need to be increased, a
Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The official made the remarks after the CLA compared employment statistics in
2006 released by 20 countries, including Japan, South Korea, Singapore, the
United States, Canada, Mexico and major European Union countries.</P>
      <P>The comparison is part of the council's efforts to further understand the
differences between Taiwan's labor situation and that of other countries, the
official noted.</P>
      <P>The ratio of job seekers who had not been employed for over one year in Taiwan's
total unemployment rate fell greatly from 17.3 percent in 2005 to 13.6 percent
in 2006, the official said.</P>
      <P>The ratio is lower than that of 13 out of the 20 nations, including Germany
(57.2 percent) , Italy (52.9 percent) and Portugal (51.8 percent), the official
went on.</P>
      <P>The labor participation rate for people aged between 55 and 64 was 41.5 percent
in Taiwan which, the official said, needs to be addressed although it is much
better than Italy's 33.4 percent.</P>
      <P>In the 1996-2006 period, Taiwan's labor force posted an average annual growth
rate of 1.2 percent, which is on a par with the rates of South Korea and the
United States, the official noted.</P>
      <P>The official added that the rate is much higher than that of Japan, which
reported negative growth, but far lower than that of Singapore (2.7 percent).</P>
      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate in 2006 recorded 3.9 percent, the third-lowest among
the 20 countries, the official said, noting that in the same year, South Korea's
unemployment rate was 3.4 percent, Japan's was 4.1 percent, Singapore's was 4.8
percent and that of the U.S. was 4.6 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the statistics, the male labor participation rate of the 20 nations
was roughly the same at around 70 percent, the official said.</P>
      <P>Italy and France reported low male labor participation rates of 60.6 percent and
62.7 percent, respectively, the official went on.</P>
      <P>Saying that there is an obvious difference in the female labor participation
forces of the 20 countries, the official noted that the lowest rates were
recorded in Italy and Mexico, with 37.9 percent and 40.7 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's female labor participation force amounted to 48.7 percent, which,
according to the official, is higher than Japan's 48.5 percent but lower than
the South Korea's 50.3 percent and Singapore's 54.3 percent.</P>

      <P>Taiwan Post Co. officials said Tuesday that those who do not wish their mail to
be stamped with a slogan promoting the country's bid to join the United Nations
can mark their envelopes as such and that their wishes will be respected.</P>
      <P>The officials said after a meeting that it will urgently request the Executive
Yuan to offer instructions as to whether to stop stamping the words "U.N. for
Taiwan" on mail.</P>
      <P>Until the Executive Yuan gives a clear instruction, members of the public who
refuse to allow their mail to be stamped with the slogan can mark their
envelopes to indicate this, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They added that the Post Office was following government policy and noted that
as a state-owned enterprise, they could not do otherwise.</P>
      <P>Since the start of this month, Taiwan Post Co. has stamped the "U.N. for Taiwan"
slogan on some domestic mail and international mail at random each day.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Post Co. President Wu Min-you said earlier Tuesday that the policy, which
is scheduled to continue until Dec. 31, was drawn up by the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications and the company.</P>
      <P>Wu argued that there is nothing inappropriate about the policy, claiming that a
majority of the people in Taiwan support the U.N. bid and adding that the
company has in the past stamped other promotional slogans on mail, such as one
promoting the fight against SARS during the outbreak of 2003 and another
promoting a campaign against vote buying in 2004.</P>
      <P>However, the United Daily News reported Tuesday that an American teacher of
English in Taiwan had protested what he described as the "dictatorial practice"
of using private mail as a promotional item for the ruling party after he
discovered that a letter he recently mailed to his fiancee in the United States
had been stamped with the slogan.</P>
      <P>The teacher, surnamed Talovich,  said the slogan fails to represent his position
on the issue and that stamping his mail without his consent "infringed upon his
freedom of speech."</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has been pushing for a referendum
on Taiwan's U.N. membership bid to be held alongside the presidential election
next year, and the slogan "U.N. for Taiwan, Peace Forever" has been omnipresent
recently on most government buildings.</P>

      <P>Foreign Minister James Huang said Tuesday that the public will not accept
China's "two-faced" tactics of offering peace overtures while squeezing Taiwan's
space in the international community.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks in response to Chinese President Hu Jintao's statement at
the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China a day earlier that
China will seek talks with Taiwan under the "one China" policy in the hope of
ending the hostility and signing a peace agreement between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Noting that although Hu made the remarks in a soft tone of voice full of
goodwill, Huang said he needed to remind the Taiwan people of what he described
as "Hu's real intention."</P>
      <P>When Hu proposed peace talks, he remained silent about the severe diplomatic war
between the two sides in the international community during the last several
decades, Huang went on.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, Hu said in his statement that China will "pin hope on the
Taiwanese people" for the goal of unification. Huang questioned whether Beijing
will continue its repression of Taiwan and its deprivation of the rights of the
Taiwan people to gain a reasonable position in the international community while
offering its peace overture.</P>
      <P>He cited the example of the recent world cyber games held in Seattle,  in which
Chinese participants  insulted  a Taiwanese competitor who unfurled a Republic
of China national flag on the winners podium after winning an award at the
games.</P>
      <P>Huang said that although he has noted Hu's softer tone toward Taiwan during the
recent years, Beijing's repression of Taiwan has never been lightened.</P>
      <P>He said that only when Beijing abandons  its "one China" principle, abrogates
its anti-secession law and dismantles the hundreds of missiles it has aimed at
Taiwan will there be peaceful talks and real peace between the two sides.</P>

      <P>Ruling and opposition lawmakers tentatively agreed Tuesday that if ballots
collected by the winner and the closest rival in future elections have a margin
of within 0.3 percent, a vote recount mechanism will be automatically activated.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng made the remarks after he convened a
coordination meeting on a draft amendment on the Public Officials Election and
Recall Law.</P>
      <P>He noted  that  the main opposition  Kuomintang's  (KMT's) legislative caucus
thinks the existing vote recount mechanism, which is activated by the Central
Election Commission, is not objective and that the 1 percent margin between the
rivals is too high.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers finally agreed to lower the gap to within 0.3 percent, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Laborious vote recounts have been conducted twice in recent years. In the 2004
presidential election, the KMT's Lien Chan filed two separate lawsuits in an
attempt to annual the election and the election result after he lost to
President Chen Shui-bian by 29,518 votes out of around 13 million ballots cast.
Lien collected 6,442,450 votes against Chen's 6,471,770. A lengthy vote recount
reduced the margin between the two to around 25,000 votes.</P>
      <P>The KMT's Kaohsiung mayoral candidate, Huang Chun-yin, also filed lawsuits
against his rival, Chen Chu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, after
losing the mayoral election Dec. 9, 2006 by a margin of 1,114 votes. Chen still
had the most ballots even after the recount.</P>

      <P>Tzou, a professor at the NTOU's Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, said
at a news conference in Taipei City that the enzyme's function was discovered by
research staff of NTOU's Center for Marine Bioscience and Biotechnology: an
inter-disciplinary team responsible for integrating the school's resources and
teaching faculty to conduct research.</P>
      <P>Liu Hsiou-mei, professor of the school's Institute of Marine Biology, is among
discoverers of the enzyme, Tzou said.</P>
      <P>The enzyme, derived from Thermoanaerobacterium sp. NTOU2, can be used to
decompose agricultural crops to produce biomass energy in the form of alcohol,
Tzou said, adding that the school is applying for patent rights for the
application of their research to industrial processes involving the enzyme.</P>
      <P>He estimated that it will take about one year for the center to confirm the
enzyme's chemical  activity  before it embarks on cooperative projects with
industry.</P>
      <P>Tzou said the center, which targeted its research to the application of enzymes
to the production of biomass energy, found that Kuishan Island has a rare
ecological system and enjoys unlimited marine resources.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) has officially launched its
newly developed energy saving vehicle, dubbed the Ecooter, designed to create a
driving trend in urban societies, an ITRI executive said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wang Han-ying, chief of the Intelligent Vehicle Section under the ITRI's
Mechanical and Systems Research Laboratories, said the design of the Ecooter is
an integrated representation of advanced card making and information
technologies developed by the ITRI.</P>
      <P>Wang said the most notable design aspect of the Ecooter is its diamond-shaped
four-wheel chasis system that allows the vehicle to make a 360-degree turn in a
radius of just 1.2 meters.</P>
      <P>A special self-leaning system prevents it from overturning when negotiating
curves, making it very nimble in confined city areas, Wang said, adding that the
small size of the vehicle -- it is designed to carry only the driver -- helps
increase its ease of parking.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Wang went on, the energy-saving vehicle uses electric power and is
non-polluting, while its energy consumption is only one-third that of
traditional vehicles.</P>
      <P>The ITRI will continue to develop automotive electric motors and energy-
intensive battery systems to be installed in the vehicle's wheels, in an effort
to simplify its construction, and will keep creating variant designs to
capitalize on its distinctive looks, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The ITRI plans to debut the Ecooter at the International Motorcycle Exhibition
to be held in Milan, Italy, in November, in order to seek cooperative projects
with international  vehicle manufacturers, Wang said.</P>

      <P>The 2007 Yingge International Ceramics Festival reached its climax Tuesday, with
two world-renowned ceramics masters from abroad completing massive works in a
ceramics park for public view.</P>
      <P>French sculptor Jacques Kaufmann and American ceramics artist Doug Casebeer both
used bricks for their creations, which shared a common theme of "family."
Kaufmann's work is titled "Sweet Home," while Casebeer's piece is called "Safe."</P>
      <P>Yingge township is well-known  in Taiwan for its ceramics technology and
production. The annual festival is intended by the Yingge Ceramics Museum to put
Yingge on the world map as a town that produces high-grade ceramics.</P>
      <P>The festival was originally scheduled to open Oct. 5, but the opening had to be
postponed to Oct. 13 because of Typhoon Krosa. The event will continue until
Oct. 21.</P>
      <P>Organizers said they set "Wind and Water Brings Good Luck" as the theme for the
2007 festival, but did not expect such a huge wind along with five days of
torrential rain, which they believe will bring luck to the town.</P>
      <P>They added that the series of activities planned for the festival is ideal for
the whole family and that the township government will provide free shuttle bus

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's FDI inflows hit record high for 2006</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Oct. 16 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's inward foreign direct investment (FDI) amounted to a record high of
US$7.42 billion for 2006, ranking sixth in South, East and Southeast Asia,
according to the World Investment Report 2007 released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan ranked behind only China, Hong Kong, Singapore, India and Thailand in the
region in terms of inward forward direct investment, according to the annual
report, which was published by the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD).</P>
      <P>Taiwan's inward foreign direct investment for 2006 marked an increase of 356
percent over the figure of US$1.62 billion for 2005 and an increase of 291
percent over the figure of US$1.89 billion for 2004.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's outward foreign direct investment totalled US$7.39 billion
for 2006, ranking the country fifth in the region behind Hong Kong, China, India
and Singapore. The amount marked an increase of 22.74 percent over the figure of
US$6.02 billion for 2005 and a rise of 3.56 percent over the figure of US$7.14
billion for 2004.</P>
      <P>For 2006, the total FDI inflows to South, East and Southeast Asia amounted to a
record high of US$200 billion, marking an increase of 19 percent over the
previous year's level.</P>
      <P>The report shows that Taiwan ranked 119th in the world in terms of the Inward
FDI Performance Index for 2006, while the country ranked 20th in terms of its
Inward FDI Potential Index for 2005 -- the most recent year for which data is
available.</P>
      <P>Based on these results, Taiwan was placed in the category of "below potential"
countries, which are defined as having high FDI potential but low FDI
performance.</P>
      <P>The Inward FDI Performance Index ranks countries according to the ratio of a
country's share of global FDI inflows to its share of global gross domestic
product (GDP).</P>
      <P>The Inward FDI Potential Index is an average of the values of 12 variables
expected to affect an economy's attractiveness to foreign investors.</P>
      <P>A senior economist at the UNCTAD told the Central News Agency that "below
potential" countries tend to be less dependent on FDI inflows in pursuing their
development goals.</P>
      <P>For example, the United States saw its Inward FDI Performance Index ranking
somewhere around 120th for three consecutive years to 2006, although it
maintained its top position in terms of its Inward FDI Potential Index for 2004
and 2005, the economist said.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan's Outward FDI Performance Index ranked 27th, 27th and 26th,
respectively, for the three years between 2004 to 2006, which may indicate that
Taiwan and its businesses tend to rely on outward FDI to enhance their
international competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Similarly, France ranked 87th, 78th and 74th, respectively, for the three years
between 2004 and 2006, while the country's Outward FDI Performance Index ranked
19th, 16th and 17th for the same three years, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to keep striving to improve press freedom: Cabinet spokesman</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Commenting on Taiwan's continuously improving ranking in terms of press freedom
among countries in the world, Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey said
Tuesday night that the administration will strive further to improve press
freedom in the country.</P>
      <P>Taiwan ranks first in Asian and 32nd in the world in terms of press freedom for
2007, according to the Worldwide Press Freedom Index 2007 released Tuesday by
the Paris-based Reporters without Borders.</P>
      <P>Taiwan ranked 43rd in the world in 2006 and 51st in 2005 in terms of press
freedom, according to the Reporters without Borders.</P>
      <P>Taiwan placed ahead of Japan, which ranked 37th in the world, and the United
States, which ranked 48th, in the 2007 report. China, meanwhile, ranked 163rd
overall in terms of press freedom.</P>
      <P>Welcoming Taiwan's higher ranking, Shieh, who also serves as the minister of the
Government Information Office, said this reflects the results of democratization
in Taiwan, where human rights, freedom of speech and press freedom have been
fully respected and protected.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's ranking of 32nd in the world in terms of press freedom represents the
pride of all Chinese communities in the world," Shieh claimed.</P>
      <P>He added, however, that there is still ample room for Taiwan to improve in this
regard and that the administration will not become complacent about progress in
Taiwan's world ranking in press freedom.</P>
      <P>He added that the government will work to continue to improve press freedom
while hoping that the international community will better perceive the progress
that Taiwan has made in the areas of democratization, freedom and human rights.</P>
      <P>In the Worldwide Press Freedom Index 2007, Iceland led the pack, followed by
Norway, Estonia, Slovakia, Belgium, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Ireland and
Portugal, in that order. Turkmenistan, North Korea and Eritrea placed at the
bottom of the list.</P>
      <P>Of the 20 countries ranked lowest among the 169 countries surveyed, seven are
located in Asia (Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Laos, Vietnam, China, Burma, and North
Korea) , five are in Africa (Ethiopia, Equatorial Guinea, Libya, Somalia and
Eritrea), four are in the Middle East (Syria, Iraq, Palestinian Territories and
Iran), three are former  Soviet republics  (Belarus,  Uzbekistan  and
Turkmenistan) , and one is in the Americas (Cuba), according to the report.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier asks for review on treatment of detained foreign laborers</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17 (CNA)
10/17/07  14:22:56
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Wednesday that he has asked for a complete review
of the way in which detained foreign laborers are treated following reports that
an officer of the National Immigration Agency (NIA) abused foreign laborers in a
detention center recently.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, Ma Yun-chie, an officer at the agency's detention
center in the central city of Taichung, allegedly abused his power and
mistreated several female foreign laborers earlier in the month.</P>
      <P>"The incident should not be taken lightly, nor should it be viewed as an
isolated case," the premier said, adding that "regardless of whether those who
are detained are victims of human smuggling rings or labor exploitation, they
should not be subject to inhumane treatment."</P>
      <P>He said the pursuit of human rights protection has been one of the major goals
of his administration, stressing that "the protection of the basic rights of
foreign laborers will be the same as that of citizens of the country."</P>
      <P>The premier said that he has asked the Ministry of the Interior, which oversees
the NIA, to get to the bottom of the alleged abuse incident and come up with
measures to prevent the same thing from happening again.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks in an Executive Yuan meeting during which he
listened to a report by the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) on the protection of
foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>He asked the CLA to accelerate its efforts to push for implementation of its
proposed measures of forming a direct hiring joint service center, improving the
mechanism for foreign laborers switching to new employers, establishing a data
base of foreign laborers changing employers, monitoring and punishing rogue
employers, and setting up a mechanism for assessing foreign laborer brokerage
agencies.</P>
      <P>He said that the Executive Yuan approved late last year a comprehensive action
plan that covers all forms of human trafficking and that it has asked relevant
government agencies to execute the plan.</P>
      <P>He urged the Ministry of the Interior to map out a draft bill on the prevention
of human trafficking so as to flesh out an overall strategy for preventing such
trafficking and for prosecuting traffickers in order to upgrade Taiwan's
international image.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan's efforts to combat human trafficking have been recognized
in the U.S. State Department's 2007 Trafficking in Persons report which was
released in June, adding, however, that there is still room for improvement.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been reinstated on the list of "Tier 2" countries in the report
because while the island's trafficking problems remain daunting, Taiwan
authorities showed clear progress in addressing trafficking for both sexual and
labor exploitation over the past year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was placed on the list of "Tier 1" countries in the 2003 and 2004 reports
but was downgraded to "Tier 2" in the 2005 report.</P>
      <P>In the 2006 report, Taiwan was placed on the "Tier 2 Watch List" for not fully
complying with the minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking.</P>
      <P>While governments that fully comply with the minimum standards for the
elimination of trafficking are placed in "Tier 1, " governments that are making
significant efforts to meet the minimum standards are placed in "Tier 2."</P>
      <P>Governments that do not fully comply with the minimum standards and are not
making significant efforts to do so are placed in "Tier 3" and may be subject to
certain sanctions.</P>

      <P>A civic group urged the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's)
presidential candidate, Frank Hsieh, Wednesday to stop pushing for a referendum
on the country's bid to join the United Nations under the name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Action Alliance Against U.N.-Bid Referendum called for Hsieh to instead come
up with a campaign platform which would include policies on reviving the sagging
domestic economy and improving the people's livelihood.</P>
      <P>Members of the alliance called for the DPP administration to put the funds that
would be used for holding a U.N.-bid referendum toward programs aimed at
improving the people's livelihood.</P>
      <P>Responding to Hsieh's remarks made recently that the U.N. bid should take
precedence over the economy "because the people are not animals and need dignity
more than they need to be further stuffed with food, " Wu Jung-yuan, a convener
of the alliance, asked Hsieh whether he is a human being or not. "Doesn't he
need to eat?"</P>
      <P>Wu said he believes that Hsieh made such a remark because he cannot handle or
refuses to face the fact that the DPP administration has caused Taiwan's
economic slump through its ineptitude and inefficiency.</P>
      <P>Wu asked Hsieh to stop using rhetoric and political slogans and to instead offer
an apology for making such an insulting remark to the Taiwan public, saying that
most of the Taiwan people are dignified, hardworking and diligent citizens who
do not deserve to be subjected to such verbal humiliation.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Veterans Affairs Commission (VAC) will open its homes for
veterans to the general public, sharing the resources with all needy senior
citizens around the country, VAC Minister Hu Chen-pu said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hu also revealed that the VAC is scheduled to open the facilities around the
island from Friday, when Taiwan will celebrate the Double Ninth Festival which
falls on the ninth day of the ninth month of the Chinese lunar calendar.</P>
      <P>The festival has been celebrated in Chinese society since ancient time as a way
of showing respect to the elderly.</P>
      <P>Hu made the announcement in his report concerning the opening of the VAC-run
nursing and health-care shelters exclusively for retired military personnel at a
meeting of the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The new measure, Hu noted, is part of the "Mega Warmth" welfare program that
former Premier Su Tseng-chang initiated last October.</P>
      <P>At a press conference following the meeting, Hu indicated that there are 18
homes for veterans around the country, which can accommodate 11,306 people in
all. At present, there are a total of 1,400 vacancies at those homes.</P>
      <P>Hu said it costs around NT$7,000 (US$214) per person per month to stay at the
veterans home.</P>
      <P>Hu speculated that the number of vacancies is expected to continue increasing as
the average age of the current inmates is between 81 and 82.</P>

      <P>China Investment Co. Ltd. -- China's state-controlled foreign exchange
investment company -- is not allowed to invest in Taiwan's stock market,
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Chen Ming-tong said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the capital held by the company is basically in the form of
sovereign wealth funds and that most countries around the world are cautious
about accepting such investment.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks during a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Home and Nations
Committee while commenting on statement made a day earlier in Beijing by China
Investment Chairman Lou Jiwei that the company's investment targets cover all
overseas markets, including Taiwan and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The company was established directly under China's State Council, or Cabinet,
last month to make use of the country's huge foreign exchange reserves, which
topped US$1.4 trillion as of the end of September. The capital managed by the
company is estimated at US$200 billion.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Lou's statement could be a "means of gaining publicity" and
could also have "political motives."</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Chinese capital is currently forbidden from being invested in
Taiwan according to the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of
the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, MAC officials said that no matter the
form of the investment, no capital from the company is permitted in Taiwan under
the existing circumstances.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  officials of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Investment Commission
said that even if the company files an application with the commission to invest
in Taiwan, the commission lacks any legal basis by which it could accept it.</P>

      <P>Starting with four couples and their families in 1996 who organized a classical

    <HEADLINE>2008 presidential race choice between Taiwan, China: president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17 (CNA)
10/17/07  18:39:58
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday that the 2008 presidential election will
be a choice between "Taiwan consciousness" and "the Great China mentality."</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the race will be a duel between the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) ticket of Frank Hsieh and Su Tseng-chang, who follow a
Taiwan-centric line, and the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) ticket of Ma Ying-jeou
and Vincent Siew, who abide by a one-China policy.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that the election will also be a competition between a combination
of a "five-star" former mayor and a "five-star" magistrate and a team featuring
only one "four-star" former mayor.</P>
      <P>"The DPP enjoys much better qualifications and more advantages than our rival.
I'm confident we will win the election as long as we fight in unity and
unselfishly for the goal, " Chen said while addressing the DPP's Central
Standing Committee immediately after he was inaugurated as the party's chairman.</P>
      <P>Chen outlined three major missions that he aims to achieve during his
chairmanship, which include helping the DPP win at least 50 legislative seats in
next year's legislative elections, helping the Hsieh-Su ticket win the 2008
presidential race, and ensuring the passage of the referendums on reclaiming the
KMT's ill-gotten assets and on applying to join the United Nations under the
name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although the DPP has collected 1.2 million signatures for its
referendum petition on the U.N. bid -- a number more than enough to make the
petition valid, the party hopes to continue the drive to obtain 2 million
signatures by the end of October.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the referendum, which is expected to be held alongside the
presidential election, is "definitely not intended" to boost the DPP's
presidential campaign but to "protect the country's sovereignty and the well-
being of its people."</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations, it is excluded from
international  organizations  such  as the World  Health Organization, the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and is also not allowed to sign
international treaties such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the
Sea and the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and
Natural Heritage, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>"As long as Taiwan is barred from the United Nations, Taiwan will continue to be
treated as a non-existent country, and Taiwan's people will remain second-class
citizens in the international community," he said.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that China is the main obstacle in Taiwan's bid to join the world
body, Chen said the most important meaning of the referendum will be to "say no"
to China's bullying.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLA to open direct employment service center for foreign workers</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) will open a direct employment joint services
center Jan. 1 next year as part of efforts to improve services for foreign
laborers and prevent their exploitation, CLA Minister Lu Tien-lin said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lu said the planned facility is the result of a CLA review of its foreign labor
force employment system.</P>
      <P>Lu made the announcement at a press conference following an Executive Yuan
meeting earlier in the day in which he said he drew up the strategy to protect
foreign workers from exploitation by human traffickers.</P>
      <P>Lu said that in the early stage of the employment center's operations, household
caregivers will be the first group of foreign laborers in Taiwan to make use of
the services on offer, which will include allowing them to renew their three-
year employment contracts with the same family without having to involve a labor
broker.</P>
      <P>The existing restrictions on foreign caregivers, including a ban on them
changing employers three times in two months and changing their workplace to a
different district, will also be relaxed in accordance with the opening of the
new services center.</P>
      <P>In the near future, Lu explained that under certain conditions and with the
agreement of old and new employers, foreign caregivers will be able to switch
employers directly, again without having to pay an exploitative labor broker.</P>
      <P>The new measures are expected to be implemented by the end of this year, Lu
noted.</P>
      <P>To prevent foreign laborers absconding to evade broker fees or exploitation, Lu
said the CLA will offer NT$100,000 (US$3,064) as reward for turning on runaway
workers, while imposing stricter punishments upon those who employ foreign
workers illegally, with maximum fines of NT$750,000 and a deduction of five
persons from the foreign laborer quota of the offending employer.</P>
      <P>According to the CLA, the planned joint services center will be equipped with
five branch offices, including the one in the Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport, whose mission will focus on offering consultancy services related to
foreign workers entering and leaving the country.</P>
      <P>In addition to improving services for foreign workers, the CLA will also
reinforce the existing screening system targeting labor brokerage companies, in
a drive to expose unscrupulous brokers, Lu said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei came under attack Wednesday for a steep increase
in his special allowance fund following the county's upgrading to the status of
quasi-special municipality.</P>
      <P>Quoting the 2008 budget plan presented by the Taipei county government,
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Lin Shu-fen noted at a news
conference that Chou's special allowance fund will increase to NT$200,000
(US$6,134.03) per month next year from the current NT$88,000.</P>
      <P>The new amount will be higher than that granted to many other senior government
officials, despite the fact that Chou's approval ratings are among the lowest in
the country, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin claimed that most of the extra funds allocated to the Taipei county
government following the county's status upgrade Oct. 1 will go straight into
Chou's pockets.</P>
      <P>Citing a recent Taipei District Court ruling in former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-
jeou's corruption case that special allowance funds for public officials are
considered subsidies in nature, Lin said the increase in Chou's special
allowance fund is tantamount to the Taipei magistrate giving himself a salary
raise of 227 percent.</P>
      <P>Ma was indicted in early February for allegedly embezzling NT$11.17 million from
his special mayoral allowance during his time in office between 1998-2006. He
was acquitted by the Taipei District Court Aug. 14.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that the Taipei magistrate's monthly special allowance of NT$200,000
is even higher than those of the vice president and the heads of the
Legislative, Executive, Control and Examination yuans, as well as those of the
heads of central government ministries.</P>
      <P>"Has the Taipei county government invested enough resources in education and
policing?" Lin asked, pointing out that many schools in the county have
deteriorating facilities. "If not, then why has the magistrate decided to first
increase his own special allowance fund?" she asked.</P>
      <P>In response to Lin's criticism, Chou pointed out at a news conference held later
the same day that the amount of his special allowance is prescribed by law and
in line with those of the mayors of Taiwan's two other special municipalities,
Taipei and Kaohsiung.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is facing the prospect of a block of high tariffs in the AFTA (ASEAN Free
Trade Area), but the Philippines could serve as its gateway to the Southeast
Asian market given further bilateral economic cooperation, officials from Taiwan
and Philippines said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese products will be put at a disadvantage in the AFTA market as tariffs
on all products within the 10 ASEAN member countries are to be completely
eliminated by the year 2015, said Berton Chiu, Director General of Taiwan's
Department of Investment Services, in a Philippines investment seminar.</P>
      <P>If Taiwanese businesses intend to make a breakthrough, setting up production
bases in Southeast Asian countries will be a must, and the Philippines is a good
place for investment, Chiu said.</P>
      <P>Having established a Taiwan-Philippines economic corridor linked by three
economic and export processing zones, Taiwan's closest neighbor in the South is
hoping to attract more investment from Taiwan. With that goal in mind, a
delegation of officials from Philippines Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) ,
Calabarzon Regional Development Council and Philippines Ecozone Association
(PHILEA) are visiting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Philippine government has been encouraging private sector businesses to
invest in its economic zones by offering incentives and assistance. Currently,
there are 132 special economic zones operating in the country, said Lilia de
Lima, Director General and chief executive of PEZA.</P>
      <P>"As of now, there are 40-50 Taiwanese businesses operating in ecozones in the
Philippines, including 18 in the Calabarzone, which comprised of five Luzon
provinces...Among Taiwanese companies, 14 are in the apparel sector, seven in
electronics sector while six are in textiles, " she said.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese companies, especially those in the food industry, are encouraged to
establish production bases in the Philippines and take advantage of the
Philippines' high-quality pool of labor, Lima added.</P>
      <P>The Philippines' infrastructure is probably not be as developed as others, but
it provides businesses, especially the electronics industry, with a better
turnaround time due to its proximity to Taiwan and strategic position in the
Asia Pacific region, she said.</P>
      <P>To strengthen  bilateral economic cooperation,  Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) Minister Chen Ruey-long will be leading a delegation to Manila for a
ministerial level meeting in November.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) is scheduled to arrange for elite
parachutists to land in front of the National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall
next month, Minister of National Defense Lee Tien-yu said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>But Lee said the exact date and the form of the performance has yet to be
fleshed out.</P>
      <P>Lee said the public anticipated watching the elite parachutists landing in the
square in front of the Presidential Office during the Double Ten National Day
celebrations, and were disappointed that those plans were aborted due to
inclement weather.</P>
      <P>"The MND has heeded the wishes of the public, and will arrange a performance to
deliver on its promise," Lee said.</P>
      <P>The MND wants to choose a landing place that will minimally interfere with the
public and has tentatively chosen the Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall, formerly
named Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, located near the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>But the square in front of memorial hall is not available until next month, so
the most likely date for the event will be some time in November, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee said that November will be very suitable for a parachute jump, but whether
the event will be held Nov. 3, when an islandwide torch relay to promote the
nation's membership bid in the United Nations is expected to conclude in Taipei,
he did not know. Lee only said that if that date is available, it will be held
at that time as it is a weekend.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the performance will be staged in conjunction with Taiwan's U.N.
bid campaign, Lee only said that "everyone should watch and see."</P>
      <P>Asked whether the parachutists will come down with the ROC's national flag or
whether they will carry the banner emblazoned with the nation's slogan for U.N.
bid, "U.N. for Taiwan, " Lee said that currently, the MND is planning to have
them jump with the national flag.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the MND said that the elite parachutists prepared for the National
Day celebration performance for some time, and that they were disappointed that
they were unable to strut their stuff due to weather conditions.</P>
      <P>The MND has planned a performance "in line with the public wishes," a spokesman
said, which he said has "nothing to do with the ongoing U.N. bid campaign."</P>
      <P>The MND protested a report by the United Daily News, which said that the
ministry has pushed for a parachutist performance to accommodate the torch relay
activities.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party is backing the torch relay, which will
start in Taipei Oct. 24, the day when the U.N. Charter was brought into effect
62 years ago. President Chen</P>
      <P>Shui-bian will run the first leg of the torch relay and the torch</P>

      <P>The newly announced performance has been planned to make up for the earlier

      <P>He said that in addition to the parachutist performance, there will also be a
military marching band performance and combat skill performance by the army,
marines and special forces.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that the performance, part of the MND campaign to raise the

of several politically-charged activities, such as the torch relay and bicycle
tour around the island to drum up support for the country's U.N. bid, which will
end Nov. 3.</P>
      <P>The spokesman reaffirmed that the military will remain neutral and will steer
clear of political activities, and urged the media not to engage in
inappropriate speculation.</P>
      <P>His remarks came after reports by the United Daily News, a local newspaper,

in 2002 and mapped out a plan to build up to 200 wind turbines in Taiwan and
Penghu by 2010. Seventy-seven of these windmills with a total capacity of
121,760 kilowatts are already in operation, while 35 units are currently under
construction.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Energy under the Ministry of Economic Affairs has set the target
of generating enough renewable energy to meet 10 percent of Taiwan's electricity
needs by 2010, with wind power making up 80 percent of the renewable energy.</P>
      <P>Experts say that Taiwan's coastal areas are ideal for the development of wind
power because they have strong northwesterly winds six months each year, with an
average wind speed of five to six meters per second.</P>
      <P>Taipower's long-term wind power development plant will build an additional 546
wind turbines between 2010 and 2020 in shallow waters off Taiwan's west coast
and Penghu, with a total capacity of 1,980 megawatts at an estimated cost of
NT$200 million each.</P>
      <P>Of the 546 windmills in total, 176 will be built off Penghu, and the electricity
generated by these units will be transmitted to Taiwan through a 40-km undersea
cable.</P>
      <P>The other 370 units will be established 10 to 15 km off the coast of Changhua
and Yunlin counties, according to Taipower.</P>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has designated Oct. 28 as a
"national endorsement day, " during which party heavyweights will hit the
streets to encourage the public to sign a petition indicating their support for
its campaign for a referendum on the country's U.N. membership bid, party
officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>DPP Deputy Secretary-General Lan Shih-tsung made the announcement at a news
conference following a weekly meeting of the party's Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>According to Lan, the DPP has collected more than 1.17 million signatures to
date in the first phase of the campaign. The party hopes to garner an additional
1 million signatures over the next 10 days as the second phase of the campaign.</P>
      <P>The DPP's local branches will set up 156 booths around the country to highlight
the importance of the second phase of the campaign, in hopes of gathering 2
million signatures by the end of this month so as to allow for the holding of a
referendum on the country's U.N. cause along with the March 22, 2008
presidential election.</P>
      <P>President  Chen  Shui-bian  and Frank  Hsieh,  the party's presidential

      <P>The funds for a publicity campaign for the country's bid to join the United
Nations mainly came from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and the
Government Information Office (GIO), the Cabinet's budget chief said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Chang-yao, minister of the Cabinet-level Directorate-General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), made the remarks at a Legislative Yuan budget
screening meeting.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers accused some
government agencies of illegally using their budgets to help the GIO carry out a
publicity drive in line with the ruling party concerning Taiwan's U.N.
membership bid.</P>
      <P>According to a local media report, the GIO had demanded various government
agencies each supply funds worth NT$2 million to help finance a "U.N. membership
for Taiwan" campaign in conjunction with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) -initiated U.N. bid referendum proposal.</P>
      <P>The DPP has been engaged in a campaign calling for a referendum, to be held
along with the March 22, 2008 presidential election, to gauge public opinion on
whether the country should seek U.N. membership in the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In response, Hsu said the media report was not correct, insisting that the funds
provided by various government agencies were mainly alloted to help the GIO
better promote various government policies as a whole.</P>
      <P>As to the U.N. bid publicity campaign, Hsu said the funds were primarily
provided by the MOFA and the GIO.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmaker Wong Chung-chun said at the legislative meeting that agencies
providing such funds have violated the Budget Law and questioned how the GIO
could use the budgets of other agencies to finance the U.N. bid publicity drive.</P>
      <P>According to KMT lawmaker Chen Chieh, officials at the Department of Industrial
Technology under the Ministry of Economic Affairs did not deny that the GIO had
issued a notification asking for NT$2 million in monetary handouts during an
earlier intepellation session.</P>
      <P>Chen suspected that other agencies must have encountered the same situation and
said it appeared to breach the Budget Law. He argued that such cases must be
directly handed over to prosecutors to probe whether any laws were broken.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsieh-yao, a lawmaker of the opposition People First Party (PFP) and the
director of the party's policy center, claimed that agencies, including the
Sports Affairs Council, Taiwan Power Company and Taiwan Post (formerly known as
Chunghwa Post), could be punished in accordance with the Referendum Law and
Public Officials Election and Recall Law for using state resources to help the
DPP.</P>
      <P>Chang made the comments during a PFP-sponsored public hearing in which officials
from the various agencies and institutes were also invited to elaborate on the
issue.</P>
      <P>Government agencies must maintain neutrality regarding a possible referendum
topic and they must not handle matters related to the topic as it is not yet an
established government policy, Chang said.</P>
      <P>He also recommended that the public ask for compensation from Taiwan Post in
compliance with the Civil Code, if their personal letters are stamped by the
company with a seal showing "U.N. for Taiwan."</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan Post Deputy General Manager Huang Shu-chien, the company was
only acting in the service of the government.</P>

      <P>Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) awarded a contract Wednesday for the construction of
20 more wind turbines in the third stage of its wind energy project.</P>
      <P>Star Energy Corp., a subsidiary of Taiwan Cogeneration Corp., won the contract
with a bid of NT$3.2 billion (US$98.05 million). It will build 14 wind turbines
for Taipower in Szuhu township of Yunlin County and another six in Taipei
County's Linkou township by June 2010.</P>
      <P>According to Taipower, each windmill will have the capacity to generate 2,000
watts of electricity per hour.</P>
      <P>Taipower officials said the company will put out to tender additional contracts
for the remaining 54 wind turbines of the third-stage project.</P>
      <P>Taipower, the sole electricity supplier in Taiwan, began to harness wind energy
in 2002 and mapped out a plan to build up to 200 wind turbines in Taiwan and
Penghu by 2010. Seventy-seven of these windmills with a total capacity of
121,760 kilowatts are already in operation, while 35 units are currently under
construction.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Energy under the Ministry of Economic Affairs has set the target
of generating enough renewable energy to meet 10 percent of Taiwan's electricity
needs by 2010, with wind power making up 80 percent of the renewable energy.</P>
      <P>Experts say that Taiwan's coastal areas are ideal for the development of wind
power because they have strong northwesterly winds six months each year, with an
average wind speed of five to six meters per second.</P>
      <P>Taipower's long-term wind power development plant will build an additional 546
wind turbines between 2010 and 2020 in shallow waters off Taiwan's west coast
and Penghu, with a total capacity of 1,980 megawatts at an estimated cost of
NT$200 million each.</P>
      <P>Of the 546 windmills in total, 176 will be built off Penghu, and the electricity
generated by these units will be transmitted to Taiwan through a 40-km undersea
cable.</P>
      <P>The other 370 units will be established 10 to 15 km off the coast of Changhua
and Yunlin counties, according to Taipower.</P>

year increase.</P>
      <P>Japan remained the top source of inbound foreign visitors, with Japanese
passport holders making more than 757,000 visits between January and August.
That number accounted for 31.5 percent of total tourist arrivals for the period,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>Chinese citizens, including Hong Kong and Macau residents, formed the second
largest national group, making more than with 467,000 visits to Taiwan during
the period and accounting for 20 percent of the total.</P>
      <P>The United States came in third, with 261,000-plus Americans visiting Taiwan
between January and August, good for an 11 percent share of the total.</P>
      <P>Compared with last year's figures, the number of visitors from Australia rose
18.8 percent, while the numbers of visitors from Malaysia and South Korea
increased 14.75 percent and 14.55 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Among Taiwan's major tourist sources, only visitors from Thailand registered a
double-digit decrease, falling 10.4 percent.</P>
      <P>The statistics also show that Hong Kong and Macau were the most popular first
stop for local outbound travelers, accounting for 47 percent; followed by Japan
at 14 percent and the United States at 7 percent. Both Hong Kong and Macau are
major transit hubs for Taiwanese passengers bound for China.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the opening of direct ferry services between the Taiwan-held outlying
islands of Kinmen and Matsu and three port cities -- Xiamen, Mawei and Quanzhou
-- in China's southeastern province of Fujian, Kinmen and Matsu have become
increasingly popular gateways for outbound and inbound passengers, with the
number of passengers who traveled to or from China via the two outlying islands
exceeding 538,000 for the eight-month period which represented a 25 percent
year-on-year growth.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday the increasing  labor force participation
rate among Taiwan women indicates  that the government's  efforts to encourage
women's entrepreneurship and employment are bearing fruit.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in the latest issue of his online newsletter, referring to
a recent media report which mentioned the labor force participation rate of
Taiwan women rose to a 10-year-high of 58.61 percent in August this year.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that back in 1996, there was a wide gap between the labor force
participation rates of men and women -- 71 percent versus 45 percent, mainly
because the country's overall employment and entrepreneurial environment was
very unfriendly to women.</P>
      <P>To address the problem, Chen said, his administration pushed through  several
pieces  of important  legislation  after his inauguration in 2000, including the
Gender Equality in Employment Act of 2002 and the Sexual Harassment Prevention
Act of 2006.</P>
      <P>In addition, the government cooperated with private businesses to provide pre-
vocational training for women between 2003 and 2006 and amended the Employment
Insurance Act to introduce an allowance for parents on unpaid leave to take care
of their children and a subsidy aimed at encouraging employers to establish
daycare facilities for their workers, Chen pointed out.</P>
      <P>The government has also been working to amend the Labor Insurance Statute to
increase maternity  payment from two months of an employee's salary to three
months, he added.</P>
      <P>On women's entrepreneurship, Chen noted that many women had difficulties
obtaining business startup mortgage loans from financial institutions in the
past because real estate was usually registered under the name of men.</P>
      <P>To improve the situation, the government has persuaded financial institutions to
accept the government as the guarantor of woman applicants for business startup
loans, launching a micro business startup loan program in 2003 and a small loan
program for female business starters in 2007, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Since  their  launch  in  2000,  courses  guiding  women's enterpreneurship have
drawn more than 17,000 participants, he added.</P>
      <P>The president said all these measures have helped boost women's labor force
participation, with the number of women in the work force increasing at an
average annual rate of 2.05 percent over the past decade, compared with an
average rate of 0.67 percent per year among men.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, women's labor force participation rate has seen a rise of 2.92
percentage points over the past 10 years, whereas that of men has decreased by
3.78 percentage points, according to Chen.</P>

Taiwan, to mark Taiwan's Cultural Day, which coincides with the establishment of
the Taiwan Cultural Association, which was founded by Taiwan's democratic
movement vanguard Chiang Wei-shui in 1921.</P>

stressed.</P>
      <P>During a series of celebrations at the time, members of Taiwan's cultural sector

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) imposed a temporary ban on apple imports from
France Thursday in the wake of the discovery of codling moth larvae in a recent
shipment.</P>
      <P>According to officials at the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection
and Quarantine, the codling moth larvae were found Tuesday in a shipment
containing 1,029 crates of Gala apples. The bureau has ordered that the shipment
be destroyed or returned to the exporting country.</P>
      <P>The officials said the bureau has notified the French authorities to suspend
apple exports to Taiwan until the authorities identify the cause of the
infestation and take measures to improve the situation.</P>
      <P>As to the shipments that are on their way to Taiwan, the bureau will conduct a
comprehensive inspection on them after their arrival to ensure the safety of the
country's agricultural production environment, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The incident marked the first time that codling moth larvae have been discovered
in apple imports from Europe, they said.</P>
      <P>In 2006, Taiwan imported 586 metric tons of apples from France, accounting for
only 0.5 percent of the country's total apple imports, according to the COA.</P>
      <P>Taiwan consumes around 115,000 metric tons of apples annually, relying on
imports to meet more than 90 percent of demand.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) will meet next week to discuss the way in
which to hand out ballots in next year's legislative elections, CEC Secretary-
General Teng Tien-yu said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Teng noted that as a referendum on two proposals will be held in conjunction
with the Jan. 12 legislative elections, the CEC will discuss whether to hand out
the two ballots -- one for the legislative elections and the other for the two
referendum proposals -- simultaneously or separately.</P>
      <P>He was referring to the referendum proposal initiated by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) to retrieve what it calls the "ill-gotten" assets
amassed by the Kuomintang (KMT) during its five decades of rule, and the
proposal initiated by the KMT against corruption.</P>
      <P>If the two ballots are handed out separately, the voters will first receive the
ballot for the legislative elections and then receive the referendum ballot only
after casting the first ballot. This method was used in the 2004 presidential
election in which a referendum was simultaneously held.</P>
      <P>If the two ballots are handed out at the same time, the voters will cast the
ballots in separate boxes.</P>
      <P>In response to reports Thursday by the Taipei-based United Daily News that the
CEC will discuss at the Oct. 26 meeting whether to use the format of handing out
two ballots simultaneously in next year's presidential election, Teng said that
the commission will mainly discuss whether to use the format in the legislative
elections.</P>
      <P>"The format decided upon in the meeting will not necessarily be applied to the
March 22 presidential election in 2008," Teng said, noting that two separate
referendum proposals -- one initiated by the DPP on the country applying to join
the United Nations under the name Taiwan and the other initiated by the KMT on
the country applying to return to the world body under its official name, the
Republic of China -- are also expected to be held alongside the presidential
election.</P>
      <P>According to the United Daily News reports, if the CEC decides to hand out two
ballots simultaneously in the presidential election, this will help boost the
turnout rate and the chances of the U.N. bid proposal by the DPP being passed.
The proposal will also help galvanize support for the ruling party in the
presidential election, according to the reports.</P>
      <P>Under the current Referendum Law, a proposal will be considered passed if the
referendum turnout rate exceeds half of all eligible voters and if 50 percent of
those who cast ballots vote in favor of the proposal.</P>
      <P>In the 2004 presidential election, two proposals initiated by President Chen and
put to a referendum -- one on purchasing more missiles to counter the military
threat from China, and the other on engaging in dialogue with China -- failed to
pass partly because not all eligible voters turned out to vote and partly
because many of those who voted in the election refused to claim referendum
ballots and walked out the polls directly. Although 90 percent of those who cast
ballots in the referendum voted in favor of the proposals, the referendum
turnout rate was only 45 percent of all eligible voters.</P>

      <P>The government is working on crafting policies to better promote the yacht
building industry, aiming to make Taiwan rank among the world's top four mega
yacht making countries, an official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The government projects that the output value of yacht building will be NT$19.5
billion (US$596.33) by 2015, and will also strive to help at least one local
firm rank among the world's four leading firms by then, the official of the
Council for Economic Planning and Development said.</P>
      <P>Citing a report released in January by ShowBoats International, a yacht
publication, the official said the world's mega yacht market will continue
growing. He added that many of Taiwan's 31 yacht making firms have already
shifted from building traditional yachts to super yachts to seize further
business opportunities.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the output value of Taiwan's yacht building industry
for 2006 was NT$7.48 billion, up 4.8 percent from 2005's figure of NT$7.14
billion. That number was 16.5 percent of general shipping industry' output value
at NT$43.52 billion for 2006, which marked a 10.3 percent growth from the
previous year's NT$39.46 billion.</P>
      <P>The official said the worldwide yacht market is worth about US$40 billion per
year, with America enjoying 49 percent of the market.</P>
      <P>The official pointed out that Taiwan ranked seventh in yacht building in the
world, and first in Asia in 2006, in terms of yacht building orders.</P>
      <P>Plans under consideration include improving infrastructure for industry
clusters, developing related industries, training yacht design personnel,
building laboratories to test ship functions, and holding international yacht
exhibitions.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications will also make amendments  to
current legal regulations,  integrate inspection bureaus, and simplify
inspection processes to provide a smoother operating legal environment for the
industry, the official went on.</P>

      <P>Chang said the move is aimed at helping the underprivileged elderly to get
appropriate service and medical care, moving Taiwan toward the goal of becoming
a "just" society.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks  when he presided  over the inauguration of a day-

Executive Yuan Secretary-General Chen Chin-jun, Veterans Affairs Commission
(VAC) Chairman Hu Cheng-pu and legislators from across the party spectrum.</P>

      <P>Local newspaper China Times has reported that the 18 veterans homes will be able
to provide nearly 1,500 beds for the day-care service. The monthly expenses for
daily transportation and three meals per day will cost around NT$7,000 (US$212)

      <P>New Zealand has agreed to allow imports of Taiwanese lychees, in a breakthrough

      <P>The meeting closed Monday in New Zealand, said Vice Economic Affairs Minister
Fadah Hsieh, who led aTaiwan delegation that attended the meeting.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said Taiwanese lychees will be exported to New Zealand after the country

      <P>He said the two countries also reached consensus in other aspects, including
bilateral exchanges and cooperation in technology, digital  content,
biotechnology  industry  and venture capital investment.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, Taiwan is still waiting for New Zealand's reply to a
Taiwanese proposal at the meeting on holding regular bilateral education
meetings and cooperation on controlled drugs.</P>
      <P>As to New Zealand's concerns on Taiwan's quota and tariff regulations on imports

      <P>The quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) is planning to sponsor a
training workshop for people interested in taking part in cross-Taiwan Strait
negotiation, SEF sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The SEF -- founded in 1990 as an intermediary body authorized by the government
to handle exchanges across the Taiwan Strait to meet rising demand since Taiwan
began allowing its people to travel to mainland China in 1987 to visit relatives
-- will sponsor the three-day workshop Nov. 30-Dec. 2 at a location on
Yangmingshan in suburban Taipei during which lectures and lessons will be given
about negotiation skills and theory, said SEF officials.</P>
      <P>Over the past 16 years, the SEF has engaged in 26 rounds of negotiations and
talks with its Beijing counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS), culminating with two high-profile meetings in 1993 and
1998 between then-SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu and ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan. Both
Koo and Wang had passed away.</P>
      <P>The SEF has also managed to sign four pacts with ARATS, including an agreement
on the norms of SEF-ARATS interactions and meetings.</P>
      <P>SEF officials said that although official cross-strait meetings, or SEF-ARATS
meetings, were suspended in recent years due to political factors, members of
the foundation have not been sitting idle.</P>
      <P>Lecturers at the first SEF workshop are expected to include You Ying-lung, SEF
vice chairman and secretary-general; Shi Huei-yow, director of the National
Security Bureau; and Chang Jung-feng, vice president of the Chung-Hua
Institution for Economic Research, the officials said.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian is expected to pray this weekend in the southern city
of Tainan for success in promoting Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations,
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The prayers are being organized by the Presbyterian Church of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a speech, the president will share his expectations for and the meaning of a
DPP-initiated referendum on applying for U.N. membership under the name Taiwan,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>In addition to praying for the success of the U.N. bid, participants will also
pray for smooth presidential and legislative elections next year and for clean
campaigns during the run-up to the elections, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has tried without success since 1993 to have the United Nations consider
the issue of its representation. It suffered a fresh setback in its quest for
representation in the world body last month as an item endorsed by 17 of
Taiwan's diplomatic allies asking the world body to address Taiwan's membership
application was excluded from the agenda of the 62nd session of the General
Assembly.</P>
      <P>With promotion of the U.N. bid the main policy plank of the DPP administration,
the Cabinet has designated Oct. 24 -- the anniversary of the coming into force
of the Charter of the United Nations which is celebrated internationally as
United Nations Day -- as "Taiwan United Nations Day" and will kickstart a 11-day
nationwide torch relay on that day to promote the bid.</P>
      <P>The DPP is also pushing for a referendum on whether to apply to join the United
Nations under the name Taiwan, which is expected to be held alongside the March
2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The party aims to collect 2 million signatures by the end of this month for the
referendum petition, in the hope that the number can be recognized as a Guinness
World Record.</P>

      <P>The National Airborne Service Corps under the Ministry of Interior called off a
fire-fighting operation on the outlying island of Kinmen using helicopters
Thursday, as the fire was dying down and being kept under control by local
firemen.</P>
      <P>The fire broke out around 2 p.m. Wednesday near the coast at Kuningtou, a
battlefield in October 1949, and quickly spread to grassland and windbreak trees
nearby under the force of northeasterly winds.</P>
      <P>The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was speculation that it might have
been caused by farmers burning out weeds or by a discarded cigarette butt.</P>
      <P>Firemen were advised by military authorities not to enter the area to fight the
flames because it is seeded with an estimated 1,000 landmines.</P>
      <P>Local people said the heat of the fire had set off more than 10 landmines. The
explosions could be heard kilometers away from Chincheng township, seat of the

      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) has ruled out the possibility of joining a
Chinese delegation to attend an international weather meeting, a CWB official
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>CWB Director-General Hsin Chiang-lin made the remarks after his Chinese
counterpart, Zheng Guoguang, mentioned during a recent interview with a Hong
Kong daily that he once proposed to Taiwan that CWB officials join Chinese
delegations for participation in international weather symposiums.</P>
      <P>Zheng also suggested that Hsin could serve as deputy leader of Chinese
delegations.</P>
      <P>However, Hsin noted that previous exchanges between Taiwanese and Chinese
weather officials have only focused on technical problems and have not involved
political issues.</P>
      <P>According  to Hsin,  Taiwanese  and Chinese  meteorological institutions take
turns organizing seminars and invite weather officials from both sides to
exchange ideas at the seminars as consultants.</P>
      <P>Hsin said he took part in a seminar organized in China last year but canceled
his trip to attend the event again this year due to a typhoon.</P>
      <P>Hsin Tsai-chin, deputy director-general of the CWB who also participates in many
seminars held in China, noted that experts on both side of the Taiwan Strait
specialize in different areas of weather forecasting.</P>
      <P>As a result, it is necessary to have exchanges between Taiwanese and Chinese
experts, he said, giving the example that during the northeasterly monsoon
season, Taiwan needs weather data from China, while during typhoon season, China
needs data from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In terms of earthquake information, Hsin Tsai-chin said Taiwan can learn from
China's earthquake forecasts,  which have been developed over three decades,
while China can learn from Taiwan's earthquake prevention measures.</P>

      <P>A new vacuum coating technology for nano-silver particles has been developed by
the Kaohsiung-based Metal Industries Research and Development Center (MIRDC),
enabling a 99.99 percent bacteriostatic effect on coated tableware and cookware,
center researchers said Thursday.</P>
      <P>They noted that the center started its research and development project on the
nano-silver vacuum coating process in 2003 and that after four years, finally
came up with a new solution that is able to equally plate the surface with high
hardness coating and nano-silver particles.</P>
      <P>After testing, the nano-silver coating proved effective in reducing the number
of bacteria it comes in contact with, giving a 99.99 percent kill rate for
escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus -- two common pathogens, they added.</P>
      <P>According to MIRDC, the technology can be applied to various products such as
tableware, cookware, bathroom accessories and household appliances.</P>

      <P>The picking up by indigenous people of fallen trees and waste wood in forests
where indigenous people have their traditional homelands is legally acceptable,
officials from the Council of Indigenous Peoples (CIP) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The CIP, in association with the Council of Agriculture (COA) , gazetted the
administration rule Thursday at a news conference concerning the legitimacy of
the rights to their traditional areas by the Atayal tribespeople living in two
mountainous villages in Chienshih township of the northern county of Hsinchu.</P>
      <P>With the publication of the rule, it is now legal for Atayal people living in
Chienshih township's Yufeng village and Hsiuluan village to pick up and keep
fallen trunks, waste wood and all other crops or produce from the forests in
their neighborhood, an area of about 37,000 hectares, said CIP Minister Icyang
Parod.</P>
      <P>It is not only significant in terms of returning native areas to the indigenous
people, it is partly an effort realizing President Chen Shui-bian's ideal and
promise to the aborigines to develop a "partnership" between the Democratic
Progressive Party administration and the country's indigenous people, Parod
said.</P>
      <P>He said Yufeng and Hsiuluan villages were first selected as locations  to
implement the "return traditional  areas to the indigenous people" program
because as recently as six months ago, an Atayal resident in Smangus -- the most
remote and deep-mountain Atayal area on the border of Hsinchu County and eastern
Yilan County -- was charged and convicted of theft for picking up a fallen trunk
in the forest near his home.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the news conference, COA Vice Minister Lee Chien-chuan
expressed hope that related regulations will be hammered out soon so that all
indigenous people in the country can be protected by the regulations and enjoy
legal access to natural products in their neighborhoods.</P>
      <P>Chienshi rural township head Tseng Hsiao-chung, Yufeng village chief Chen Jung-
kuang, Hsiuluan village chief You You-lien and several dozen village people
traveled from the mountains to Taipei to witness the publication of the rule.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will welcome negotiations with China so long as Beijing forswears its
"one China" framework and sets no preconditions to any talks, a Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairman Chen Ming-tong made the remarks during an interpellation session at
the Legislative Yuan in response to Chinese President Hu Jintao's call for a
peace agreement based on the "one China" principle two days earlier during the
opening session of the Communist Party of China's ongoing annual national
congress.</P>
      <P>Chen said it is impossible for the Taiwan government to ink any agreement under
the "one China" framework, which he described as "an act of surrender."</P>
      <P>Soon after Hu was sworn in as China's president, President Chen Shui-bian
proposed the idea of establishing such a framework for peaceful development of
cross-strait relations in January 2003, Chen Ming-tong noted.</P>
      <P>However, there was no response from Beijing, he said, adding that five years
passed before Hu's recent call and still he insists that Taiwan accept the "one
China" framework.</P>
      <P>To show sincerity,  Beijing  should scrap the "one China" framework, abolish its
anti-secession law, stop squeezing Taiwan out of the international community,
and remove missiles deployed along its southeastern coast targeting Taiwan, he
went on.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MAC officials described the "one China" principle as the greatest
barrier to the development of cross-strait relations, not the political basis on
which peaceful development of cross-strait relations can be built, as Hu claimed
in his address.</P>
      <P>Beijing should change its rigid mentality with regard to its policies towards
Taiwan and face the fact that Taiwan is not a part of China, the officials
continued.</P>
      <P>If China is sincere in its claim that it wants to benefit the people of Taiwan,
it should rule out unrealistic political barriers, the officials said.</P>
      <P>China should collaborate with Taiwan to complete negotiations on the cross-
strait cargo and passenger charter flights issue and on allowing Chinese
tourists to visit Taiwan based on the existing consensus reached between both
sides, the officials added.</P>

      <P>The results of a recent survey of foreign tourists to Kaohsiung City show that
the municipal government needs to do more to promote the city's special
characteristics to attract more visitors from abroad, City Councilor Lien Li-
chien said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks while revealing the results of the survey conducted by
National University of Kaohsiung on foreign visitors to the southern port city
between October and December last year.</P>
      <P>A total of 303 foreigners were surveyed, including 28 percent from Japan, 20
percent from Hong Kong, Macau or China, and 26 percent from Western countries.
In the survey, 73 percent of the respondents answered "no" when asked whether
they had a favorite scenic spot or attraction in Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that this finding illustrates that the city has failed to make a
lasting impression on most foreign visitors, Lin called for the municipal
government to work harder to "package and sell" its special attractions.</P>
      <P>Among the 27 percent percent of respondents who said they had a favorite tourist
attraction in the city, 32.4 percent mentioned Liouho Night Market, 31.1 percent
mentioned Ruey Fong Night Market, 15.5 percent cited the coastal Chijin
district, and 9 percent mentioned Lotus Lake.</P>
      <P>As to activities engaged in during their stay in Kaohsiung City, 44.8 percent of
the respondents mentioned shopping, 32.8 percent mentioned visiting night
markets, and 26.9 percent mentioned visiting historical sites or places of
cultural interest.</P>
      <P>Lin expressed the hope that the municipal government will work harder to promote
the city's top attractions and unique qualities and take steps to cater more to
foreign tourists' needs.</P>
      <P>"Only by taking such steps to boost tourism can Kaohsiung City increase its
visibility in the international community," Lin said.</P>

      <P>The Fisheries Administration will stick to its guns and will not issue export
permits to two fishing vessels belonging to Koo Kuan-min, a former senior
adviser to President Chen Shui-bian, administration Director Hsieh Ta-wen said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks after Taipei-based the China Times daily cited Wang Pai-
chi, a former head of the Taiwan Expatriate Association in the Marshall Islands,
as saying that the pro-independence tycoon had sold two of his old vessels to a
Chinese fishing company.</P>
      <P>Wang said that Koo, who runs Koo Fishing Co. in the South Pacific Nation, had
possessed seven licenses for large purse seiners but sold the two ships along
with the licenses to the Chinese company and built two new ones, thinking that
he could use his political clout in Taiwan to apply for new licenses.</P>
      <P>But as the Solomon Islands-based Forum Fisheries Agency, an organization set up
to provide fisheries management and development advice and services to member
countries, will not consent to the issuance of a new licence, the Fisheries
Administration under the Council of Agriculture will not issue an export permit.
Koo has appealed the decision to the Executive Yuan three times, the reports
said.</P>
      <P>"The Fisheries Administration will explain to the Appeals Review Committee under
the Executive Yuan that its decision is based on legitimacy reasons," Hsieh
said.</P>
      <P>He noted that the administration  published guidelines  on construction permits
and licence issuance for fishing vessels June 29, 2005, which state that the
ships already under construction should be completed, while those yet to be
built will be bound to the new regulations.</P>
      <P>The Fisheries Administration instructed all shipyards to report their ongoing
construction at that time and the administration sent officials to double-check
six months after that date, at which point Koo's ships were not being
constructed.</P>
      <P>In addition, the international community has imposed stricter regulations on
fishing, especially for migratory fish, and major fishery organizations have
regulated the number of fishing vessels, requiring that the construction of new
vessels must get a green light from regional fishery organizations in advance.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said Koo appealed to the Executive Yuan in October last year and again in
May this year, and was told to "turn the case over to the relevant authorities,
who will deal with the matter according to the law."</P>
      <P>Noting that Koo ignored the advice and appealed a third time this August, Hsieh
said the administration is determined to uphold its stance.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Koo called a news conference Thursday in an attempt to defend himself
after the China Times report cited Wang as saying that Koo had not only sold the
two ships to the Chinese company but had also acted as a broker, allowing the
company to buy a tuna cannery in the Marshall Islands, which is scheduled to
open next month.</P>
      <P>The plant is expected to provide 500 jobs to the island nation of 50,000 people,
which will have a major impact on Taiwan's diplomatic front, the reports also
quoted Wang as saying.</P>
      <P>Koo admitted that he did sell ships to the Chinese company, which he described
as an act of business that has nothing to do with his loyalty to Taiwan. He
denied categorically that he brokered the tuna cannery deal.</P>
      <P>He said he "will sell vessels and sell fish, but will by no means sell out
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>He also expressed anger that his new ships -- two 1,200-ton deep-sea purse

      <P>The democratic movement will be successful in its push to overthrow the 43-year-
old tyranny in Myanmar, and Taiwan can show its support by reviewing its
investments in the country, a visiting Myanmarese opposition representative said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Unless Asian countries,  including Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore, stop
investing in Myanmar, U.S. economic sanctions on Myanmar's military junta will
not work because Myanmar economy remains stable, said Nyo Ohn Myint, the Global
Burma Campaign coordinator of the National League for Democracy (NLD), the main
opposition in Myanmar.</P>
      <P>Myint made the appeal at a Taipei conference, titled "Beyond Rangoon: Burma's
yesterday,  today and tomorrow,  " which was co-sponsored by Taiwang's ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan Thinktank.</P>
      <P>Myint, who prefers to refer to his homeland as Burma rather than Myanmar -- the
name coined by the military junta -- said foreign investment in the country has
not been helping the people. Myanmar does not have an open market economy as
most of the companies were controlled by junta generals, he said, which means
that most of the money goes to their pockets instead of to the people.</P>
      <P>Taiwan can do more to support democracy in Myanmar, he said. Taiwan, especially
the DPP which brought an end to the Kuomintang's (KMT's) long-time authoritative
regime, can offer the benefits of its experience in democratic transition to the
NLD, which Myint believed "will collapse within two years even if it wins the
power tomorrow" due to a lack of democratic experience.</P>
      <P>"We will win pretty soon. This is the final push, " said Bangkok-based Myint,
whose older brother was declared missing during recent   demonstration   in
Yangoon.   The   college professor-turned-activist  said  the most encouraging
sign for Myanmar's democratic movement is the participation of the younger
generation.</P>
      <P>"Before, these young men only heard about the 1988 demonstration and crackdown.
But now they have experienced what it was like, " he said of the junta's recent
crackdown  and killing of unarmed demonstrators and monks.</P>
      <P>Myint pointed out that the "China factor" has played an important role in the
military junta's hardline stance because the junta received financial, military
and political support from China, which also has a veto as a permanent member of
the U.N. Security Council.</P>
      <P>Local professors also called on the Taiwanese government to do more to support
Myanmar democracy. Once the Refugee Act is passed in the Legislative Yuan,
Taiwan will be able to offer political asylum to Myanmarese dissidents, said
Shih Cheng-feng, a professor at Tamkang University.</P>
      <P>However, Soochow University professor Wu Chih-chung questioned the actual impact
of reducing foreign investment in Myanmar on the junta because it will probably
just "bring the junta closer to China."</P>

      <P>Corporate governance in Taiwan has progressed due to improvements in accounting,
financial reporting and the courts' handling of insider trading, an analyst of
CLSA Ltd., a leading independent equity broker in Asia, said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Peter Sutton, head of the research section of CLSA, made the remarks in a speech
delivered at the invitation of U.S. Chamber of Commerce about corporate
governance in Taiwan and other Asian countries.</P>
      <P>According to the 2007 report recently released by the Asian Corporate Governance
Association, Hong Kong has replaced Singapore as the best area in Asia in terms
of corporate governance due to its efforts to protect shareholders' rights, an
issue on which Singapore has taken less action, while Taiwan advanced from fifth
place in 2005 to fourth, thanks to improved regulations and enforcement.</P>
      <P>Sutton noted that although Taiwan made some progress in corporate governance,
there is still much room for local companies to improve, including in the
protection of shareholders, the publication of employees' dividends, the
independence of governing authorities and the allocation of corporate bonds.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's government should be encouraged to address the issue of greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions by plugging into the international carbon trading scheme and
leveraging its status as a non-Kyoto Protocol signatory, a visiting Britain
energy consultant said in an interview with the CNA.</P>
      <P>"Your government can decide how far and how fast you want to go [in dealing with
GHG emissions]. Taiwan can take part in the international trading instruments,
trade for allowances of carbon dioxide and manage those on its own, " said Liz
Bossley, chief executive of Consilience Energy Advisory Group (CEAG) , a U.K.
consultancy specializing in oil, gas, power, coal, weather and emissions trading
issues.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is not a signatory of the Kyoto Protocol, a United Nations framework
setting mandatory emission limitations for the reduction of atmospheric
greenhouse gases because participation is limited to U.N. signatories. In some
ways, that framework has isolated Taiwan's efforts from the global effort,
Bossley said, but it has also provided Taiwan with an opportunity to "observe
and avoid errors."</P>
      <P>Taiwan will be able to take the best of both world, said Bossley, who was
invited to visit Taiwan by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>Emissions trading, she said, is an administrative approach to controlling
pollution by providing economic incentives to achieve reductions in the emission
of pollutants. The market reached 30 billion Euros this year alone, she said.</P>
      <P>Under current directives of the U.N. and European Union (EU) , Taiwan, as a
third party, is allowed to trade emission allowances with anyone, Bossley said.</P>
      <P>Bossley, a former emissions allowance trader, said Taiwan's government is
encouraged to first educate the people on the impact of climate change and
explain to citizens what the problem is before measuring the sources of GHG
emissions.</P>
      <P>"Since your industry is very concentrated, that will not be difficult to do. And
finally your policy can be formulated and implemented, " she said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian called on the media to exercise restraint in covering
the news of a Taiwanese mafia leader who died abroad but whose body was returned
to Taiwan for burial Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen said it would not provide a good example for the younger generation if
domestic television channels incessantly report on the funeral of Chen Chi-li,
the former leader of Taiwan's notorious "Bamboo Union" underworld syndicate, how
his followers worshipped him, and the scale of the procession in which the
ringleader's body was escorted from the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport,
upon the arrival of his coffin from Hong Kong, to Neihu, Taipei City for a
funeral.</P>
      <P>The president said that TV stations covered the return of the body of Chen Chi-
li, with SNGs and repeated live broadcasts, as though the late "Bamboo Union"
ringleader were a head of state.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) officials also called for
Taiwan's media outlets not to cover Chen Chi-li as if he was a folk hero.</P>
      <P>The body of Chen Chi-li -- who was first cast into the international spotlight
in 1985 when he was hired by a military intelligence head to kill a dissident
ethnic Chinese writer in California -- will temporarily rest at a location in
Neihu until a formal funeral slated for early November.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese judge gave Chen Chi-li six years' imprisonment for his involvement
in that crime. He later fled to Cambodia in the early 90s after being charged
for further organized crime activities.</P>
      <P>The gang leader then took up residence in Phnom Penh and became an active player
among Taiwan businessmen operating in Cambodia. Although Taipei authorities had
tried to have him extradited to Taiwan, their efforts were frustrated by the
lack of an extradition treaty between Taiwan and Cambodia.</P>
      <P>He died recently at a hospital in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>CIB officials urged "Bamboo Union" members and funeral organizers to stick to
their promises to the police that during the funeral period, no members of the
"Bamboo Union" or any other underworld rings would converge to challenge law
enforcement authorities, that no teenagers or children should take part in
funeral affairs, and that no type of uniform would be worn.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, CIB officials said that more than 600 policemen and policewomen were
mobilized Thursday to collect evidence to be used later in the arrest of any
gang members appearing on wanted lists.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Media watchdog groups call for improvement in local news quality</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The quality of local news and journalists' rights to cover events irrespective
of the political leanings of their employers should be improved, even though
progress has been made in terms of Taiwan's press freedom, executives of several
media watchdog organizations said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The groups made the call after the Paris-based Reporters Without Borders
released its global survey on press freedom for 2007 two days earlier in which
Taiwan ranked first in Asia and 32nd in the world, up 11 places from last year.</P>
      <P>Lu Shih-hsiang, director of the Foundation for the Advancement of Media
Excellence, said the survey covered the period between the second half of 2006
and the first half of 2007.</P>
      <P>During that period, Taiwan media focused their reports on corruption scandals
involving President Chen Shui-bian, his family and his aides, which led
Reporters Without Borders to conclude that media coverage in Taiwan is becoming
more diverse.</P>
      <P>However, Lu noted that an anti-corruption campaign began in Taiwan Sept. 16 last
year during which a CtiTV reporter was harassed by "red-clad" demonstrators
demanding that Chen step down for his alleged involvement in several scandals.</P>
      <P>"The harassment  incident indicates that Taiwan's political tension was
obstructing local reporters," Lu said.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that Taiwan has been making progress in the annual press freedom
survey, moving from 61st place in 2003 to this year's 32nd place. However, he
added, news quality in the country needs to be greatly improved.</P>
      <P>Lu further said that local media need to work particularly hard to win the
public's trust.</P>
      <P>Describing Taiwan media as having a serious ideology problem, obviously favoring
certain political parties in their news reports and being too commercialized, Lu
urged local news media to strive to meet professional standards.</P>
      <P>Connie Lin, chairwoman of the Broadcasting Development Fund (BFD), said Taiwan's
journalists enjoy so much freedom that they "do not even know the boundaries of
freedom."</P>
      <P>Noting that the content of local news stories is often superficial, Lin said
Taiwanese news media completely fail to objectively analyze current events and
fulfill their "gatekeeper" role.</P>
      <P>"As a result, Taiwan's high ranking in the press freedom index is not something
that should be celebrated," she said.</P>
      <P>Lin urged local media to engage in self-reflection to see whether Taiwan's high
ranking can be translated into higher professional standards."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, she went on, "local reporters should also ask themselves if what they
are doing now is what they wanted to do as journalists before they entered the
profession."</P>
      <P>Lin attributed Taiwan's high ranking to the fact that no reporters are
imprisoned in the country and that government agencies seldom launch raids on
the offices of local media outlets. Still, the high ranking does not represent
the whole picture of Taiwan's media, she said.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsiao-yi, president of the Association of Taiwan Journalists, for her part,
said that the news environment in Taiwan is comparatively free compared with
that of some other countries.</P>
      <P>However, she pointed out that there is still room for improvement in Taiwanese
reporters' rights to cover events, which she said can be illustrated by Yu Shyi-
kun's announcement of a boycott of reporters at the China Times at the end of
last year when he was chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Chen also cited the recent example of the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) refusing to allow a Liberty Times reporter to enter a
screening meeting to cover the event.</P>

      <P>Kuo Su-chun, a legislative caucus whip of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT),
sued Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, several ranking officials and seven local
government chiefs Thursday for what she called their illegal push for a
signature drive led by the ruling party in pursuit of Taiwan's U.N. cause.</P>
      <P>Kuo filed the lawsuit on behalf of the caucus with the Taipei Prosecutors Office
against Chang,  Deputy Finance Minister Lee Ruey-tsang and Yunlin County
Magistrate Su Chih-feng, Chiayi County Magistrate Chen Ming-wen, Tainan County
Magistrate Su Huan-chi, Tainan City Mayor Hsu Tian-tsair, Kaohsiung County
Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing, Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu and Pingtung County
Magistrate Tsao Chi-hung on charges of document forgery and hindrance of
freedom.</P>
      <P>In a written statement, Kuo accused Chang of using his position as the nation's
top administrative chief to ask several agencies under the Executive Yuan to
transfer some of their budgetary funds to help the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) with its signature drive for a U.N. membership bid referendum.</P>
      <P>The KMT legislative caucus demanded that prosecutors look into whether Chang has
broken relevant  laws by asking that local government chiefs and official
agencies fall in line with the DPP's campaign.</P>
      <P>Lee was charged with unlawfully demanding that subordinate departments cooperate
in the DPP's signature drive and that their staffers sign their names to the
U.N. bid petition.</P>
      <P>In addition, Sports Affairs Council Chairman Yang Chung-ho is being sued for
breach of trust and embezzlement for allegedly allocating NT$100 million
(US$3.07 million) from the council's budget to fund a planned DPP torch relay,
slated for Oct. 24, to bolster Taiwan's U.N. cause.</P>
      <P>The seven local government chiefs, all DPP members, were accused of forging
documents and hindering freedom by requiring that township delegates secretly
use the personal seals of elderly villagers to stamp the DPP's U.N. bid
referendum petitions when making cash gifts to them on the occassion of an
annual festival in honor of senior citizens.</P>

      <P>Lawmakers and civic group representatives paid a visit Thursday to Justice
Minister Shih Mao-lin and called for stepped up surveillance and reformatory
treatment of sexual assault criminals.</P>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker Yang Lee-huan and Taiwan Coalition
Against Violence representative Chang Chin-li made the request to Shih to better
protect women's and children's safety.</P>
      <P>According to Yang and Chang, the Justice Ministry has fallen short of working
out a comprehensive oversight and reformatory program for this kind of criminals
who are prone to reoffend.</P>
      <P>Chang blamed relevant government agencies, including the Justice Ministry, for
failing to earmark more funds to serve that end and questioned why the ministry
is not more intent on pursuing the matter.</P>
      <P>Shih rebutted Chang's accusation and argued that his ministry has always
attached a great importance to the issue, pointing out that relevant agencies
and establishments -- such as medical and aftercare facilities -- must also
collaborate in the effort.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, the Ministry of Justice contributes some 29 percent of its
annual budget to nationwide reformatory programs per year, a level which is well
ahead of those appropriated for prosecution.</P>
      <P>Shih, however, promised to staff 450 reformatory positions in three years to
better deal with complications arising from a manpower squeeze in the field.</P>

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung denied Friday allegations by the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) that the Cabinet has misappropriated government funds to finance
activities promoting a ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) -backed U.N.
bid referendum petition.</P>
      <P>Chang said the Cabinet has "not spent even a dime" on activities related to the
referendum, although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Government
Information Office have drawn on their budgets to support activities designed to
promote the government's policy of bidding to join the United Nations under the
name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Calling the allegations "100 percent untrue, " Chang challenged the KMT to
present substantive evidence to support their claims.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the KMT has recently sued Chang for breach of trust
and corruption for allegedly instructing agencies under the Cabinet to
appropriate funds from other parts of their budgets to sponsor activities
promoting the DPP-initiated referendum petition.</P>
      <P>The caucus has also filed a separate law suit against Chang and seven local
government chiefs for forgery and obstruction of freedom, demanding that
prosecutors investigate whether Chang had instructed the local government chiefs
to take advantage of their positions to help collect signatures for the DPP's
petition for the U.N. bid referendum.</P>
      <P>The DPP wants the referendum to be held alongside the March 2008 presidential
election and aims to collect 2 million signatures by the end of this month for
the referendum petition.</P>
      <P>With promotion of the U.N. bid being the main policy plank of the DPP
administration, the Cabinet has organized various activities for the purpose,
including designating Oct. 24 -- the anniversary of the coming  into force of
the U.N.  Charter  which is celebrated internationally as United Nations Day --
as "Taiwan United Nations Day" and kickstarting a 11-day nationwide torch relay
on that day.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEC remains open on ballot format</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 19 (CNA)
10/19/07  15:08:31
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) will remain open on the ballot format
issue concerning next year's legislative and presidential elections, CEC
Chairman Masa J.S. Chang said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the CEC members are scheduled to meet Oct. 26 to discuss the way
in which ballots should be handed out in the Jan. 12 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>As a referendum on two proposals will be held in conjunction with the
legislative elections, the CEC will discuss whether to hand out the two ballots
-- one for the legislative elections and the other for the two referendum
proposals -- simultaneously or separately, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>Chang was referring to the referendum proposal initiated by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to retrieve what it calls the "ill-gotten"
assets amassed by the Kuomintang (KMT) during its five decades of rule, and the
proposal initiated by the opposition KMT against corruption.</P>
      <P>If the two ballots are handed out separately, the voters will first receive the
ballot for the legislative elections and then receive the referendum ballot only
after casting the first ballot. This method was used in the 2004 presidential
election in which a referendum was simultaneously held.</P>
      <P>If the two ballots are handed out at the same time, the voters will cast the
ballots in separate boxes.</P>
      <P>Chang said that after the Jan. 12 legislative elections are held, the CEC will
use the elections as a reference in deciding which ballot format to adopt for
the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Two referendum proposals -- one initiated by the DPP on the nation's applying to
join the United Nations under the name Taiwan and the other initiated by the KMT
on the country applying to return to the world body under its official name, the
Republic of China -- are also expected to be held in tandem with the
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of the KMT Central Policy
Committee, said that if the CEC insists on adopting the "one shot" format of
handing out two ballots simultaneously in next year's presidential election, the
KMT will ask all counties and cities under the "pan-blue alliance, " namely the
KMT, the People's First Party and the New Party, to boycott the ballot format.</P>
      <P>Tseng said the "pan-blue alliance" favors the "two step" format of handing out
the two ballots  separately  in the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Kuo Su-chun, a whip of the KMT legislative caucus, asked the CEC to first allay
people's concerns about the "one shot" ballot format before making its final
decision for the next presidential election.</P>
      <P>Included among the concerns about the "one shot" ballot format are that people
might smuggle ballots out of the polling stations, that the voting process might
be too time-consuming and lead to long queues at polling stations, that voters
might unwittingly cast both ballots into one box, which could affect the
election results, and that counting the votes in the presidential election would
take longer to complete.</P>
      <P>According to a United Daily News report Thursday, if the CEC decides to hand out
two ballots simultaneously in the presidential election, this will help boost
the turnout rate and the chances of the U.N. bid proposal by the DPP being
passed. The proposal will also help galvanize support for the ruling party in
the presidential election, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Under the current Referendum Law, a proposal will be considered passed if the
referendum turnout rate exceeds half of all eligible voters and if 50 percent of
those who cast ballots vote in favor of the proposal.</P>
      <P>In the 2004 presidential election, two proposals initiated by President Chen and
put to a referendum -- one on purchasing more missiles to counter the military
threat from China, and the other on engaging in dialogue with China -- failed to
pass because many of those who voted in the election refused to cast referendum
ballots.</P>
      <P>Although 90 percent of those who cast ballots in the referendum voted in favor
of the proposals, the referendum turnout rate was only 45 percent of all
eligible voters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No peace accord possible under 'one China' framework: president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 19 (CNA)
10/19/07  15:39:58

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has again rejected Beijing's  "one China" principle as
the precondition  for the establishment of a cross-Taiwan Strait peace accord,
saying any agreements signed under such a principle would mean surrender for
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during an interview with the New York Times, which took
place Thursday in Taipei, during which he was asked to comment on a recent peace
overture by Chinese President Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>During Monday's meeting of the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China, Hu called for the formation of a framework for peaceful development of
cross-strait relations "on the basis of the one China principle, " which has
been characterized as a proposal for a cross-strait peace agreement.</P>
      <P>Chen told the paper that although Taiwan has always welcomed the idea of signing
a peace accord with China, the country opposes any preconditions or framework
being set and any conclusions being reached prior to discussing an agreement,
according to the transcript of the interview released Friday by the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>"We are even more opposed to missile threats or the use of non-peaceful means or
military force to coerce any party into signing a peace accord," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Chen outlined the three conditions that would need to be
met before the two sides could start any discussion on the proposed accord.</P>
      <P>They are namely that China openly renounce the use of force against Taiwan, that
China repeal its Anti-Secession Law against Taiwan, and that China give up the
notion of the "one China" framework, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that Taiwan is a country independent of China and that accepting
the "one China" principle "would spell the end of Taiwan as an independent,
sovereign country."</P>
      <P>On the country's plan to hold a referendum on applying to join the United
Nations under the name Taiwan, which has met strong opposition from the United
States, Chen reiterated that holding such a referendum does not involve changing
the country's official name or violating his "four noes" pledges to the United
States.</P>
      <P>The president said that although the referendum will be of no help to Taiwan's
bid to become a U.N. member, it remains the most direct and democratic way for
the country's 23 million people to express to the world their strong aspiration
for U.N. membership.</P>
      <P>"The point is that we want our collective voice to be heard by the whole world.
The 23 million people of Taiwan will not be silenced just because of China's
military intimidation, its missiles pointed at use, its coercion and its
threats," he said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, joining the United Nations would boost Taiwan's economy,
because the country could then hold talks freely with countries around the world
for the signing of free trade agreements and take part in all organizations
under the U.N. umbrella, including the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two lawmakers of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged relevant
authorities Friday to act through diplomatic channels to press the ruling junta
of Myanmar to release at once Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, whom it has
held under house arrest for years.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsiao Bi-khim, who commands the DPP's department of international
affairs, and Legislator Huang Sue-ying made the call at a press conference they
jointly held at the Legislative Yuan with Nyo Ohn Myint, a former spokesman for
Aung San Suu Kyi.</P>
      <P>Both Hsiao and Huang also called on the government to support the democratic
movement in Myanmar, also known as Burma.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Hsiao blasted China, a powerful ally of Myanmar in the Asia-
Pacific region, for "holding the candle to the devil" by ignoring the junta's
brutal repression of democratic activists and monks through armed crackdown,
arbitrary detentions and killings.</P>
      <P>Nyo Ohn Myint revealed that the military junta's recent crackdown on peaceful
pro-democracy marches led by monks on the streets of Myanmar is believed to have
resulted in the death of more than 200 monks, while another 5,000 have been
arrested and 2,000 more are missing.</P>
      <P>Although the bloody crackdown has brought scrutiny and concern from
international society, the autocratic rulers of Myanmar continue to suppress
human rights and murder pro-democracy activists and monks.</P>
      <P>Without the international community's censure, the military junta would have
killed and prosecuted even more peaceful democracy aspirants, Nyo Ohn Myint
said. Calling for the Taiwanese people and their legislature to support the
efforts of the people of Myanmar seeking democracy, he named Taiwan, a
democratic country which has also suffered under autocratic rule in the past, as
a model for his country in its fight for democracy.</P>
      <P>Nyo Ohn Myint also mentioned that although there have been envoys dispatched by
the United Nations to negotiate an end to the inhumane crackdown on the
democratic movement in Myanmar, they have all failed to bring even a glimmer of
peace to the country.</P>
      <P>He was informed that Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the ongoing non-violent
movement for democracy in Myanmar, has been very much saddened by the bloody
military crackdown on peaceful demonstrators. The military continues to accuse
the peace activist of seeking to "destroy the country's unity," Nyo Ohn Myint
said.</P>
      <P>Based in Thailand, Nyo Ohn Myint now serves as the Global Burma Campaign
coordinator of the National League for Democracy (NLD), the main opposition in
Myanmar.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China's seeking talks with Taiwan under the "one China" policy is unacceptable
to Taiwan, a ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) official in charge of
international affairs said Friday.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Bi-khim, a DPP legislator recently appointed by President Chen Shui-bian
to head the party's International Affairs Department after Chen assumed the DPP
chairmanship, said Taiwan has long supported both peaceful dialogue across the
Taiwan Strait and the notion that the two sides should be free to seek their own
separate development paths in peace.</P>
      <P>Peaceful interaction, however, presupposes that cross-strait dialogue takes
place under the principles of justice and dignity, Hsiao said, adding that
Taiwan cannot accept a cross-strait dialogue under a "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>Hsiao made the remarks in a press conference held at the Legislative Yuan in
response to Chinese President Hu Jintao's statement at the 17th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China Oct. 15 that China will seek talks with
Taiwan under the "one China" principle in hopes of ending the hostilities
between the two sides and signing a bilateral peace agreement.</P>
      <P>Stressing that there can be no peace without justice, Hsiao said any cross-
strait pact or agreement signed between the two sides should first be discussed
under circumstances in which the dignity of the Taiwan people is fully respected
and that Taiwan's identity is fully acknowledged.</P>
      <P>She said the "one China" policy denies the rights of the Taiwan people to make
the choice of their own free will.</P>
      <P>Noting that some Taiwanese individuals and political parties have accepted the
"one China" policy unconditionally, which she said made her feel extremely
distressed, Hsiao called on China to forsake the military intimidation of Taiwan
and to drop the "one China" policy as a prerequisite for resuming cross-strait
dialogue.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu expressed concern Friday that a new electoral system
set to be implemented during the upcoming  legislative  elections  could
squeeze  the political participation of Taiwanese women.</P>
      <P>However, despite such concerns, the good news is that half of the at-large
legislative seats will be reserved for women under the new system, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Lu raised the issue during a conference on gender mainstreaming held in central
Taichung County, referring to the single-member constituency, two-vote system
that will be implemented for the first time during the January 2008 legislative
elections.</P>
      <P>Also starting in the next legislative elections, the number of seats to be up
for grabs will be halved to 113 from the current 225.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that currently, 268 members of city and county councils around Taiwan
are women.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile only 25 out of the total of 319 township and village chiefs are women,
and two of 23 local government chiefs in Taiwan are women, Lu said, urging the
authorities concerned to work to increase the representation of women in
politics.</P>
      <P>Despite the low rate of participation by women in politics, the high
socioeconomic status of Taiwanese women has received much international
recognition, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Citing a global report on the issue, Lu said the socioeconomic status of
Taiwan's women ranks 19th highest among 193 countries surveyed, with Norway's
first, the United States' 12th, Japan's 44th and South Korea's 60th.</P>
      <P>Over the past 30 years, Taiwanese women have become more and more financially
independent, which shows that the era of gender equality has arrived in the
country, according to Lu.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER) raised its forecast
Friday for Taiwan's economic growth for 2007 to 4.55 percent, 0.29 percentage
points higher than that forecast by the think tank in July.</P>
      <P>The rosier growth forecast for 2007 is based on the expectation that the
domestic economy will expand in the second half of the year at a rate on a par
with that posted in the first half year, said Wang Li-jung, director of the CIER
Forecast Center.</P>
      <P>Wang said the growth posted in the first half year -- a benefit of the steady
recovery of the world market and brisk economic performance at home -- was
better than expected. In the first six months of this year, consumption in the
private sector expanded 3.4 percent over the year-earlier level, while
investment in the private business sector grew 4.46 percent, a growth rate much
higher than that posted in the government and official sectors.</P>
      <P>CIER researchers forecast that Taiwan's overall economic growth will top 4.52
percent in the fourth quarter, with consumption and investment in the private
sector growing at a rate slightly slower than that posted in Q3, while two-way
trade is expected to perform better in Q4, according to Wang.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Peng Su-ling, a deputy researcher with the CIER Forecast Center, said
the center chose to adjust upward the 2007 economic growth forecast to 4.55
percent mainly as a result of better-than-expected domestic investment in Q2.</P>
      <P>In Q2, Peng said, local investment in capital goods soared by 20 percent, with
investment in semiconductor and TFT-LCD flat panel manufacturing industries
leading the list.</P>
      <P>CIER researchers also forecast an economic growth rate of 4.41 percent for the
nation in 2008, slightly lower than the 2007 level.</P>
      <P>They forecast that private sector consumption in 2008 will advance 2.91 percent
over the 2007 level and that domestic investment will grow 4.94 percent, but the
export trade in 2008 will slow a bit compared to 2007, mainly as a result of
lower demand in the world market, while the import trade will be better than in
2007, due to greater demands in the domestic market.</P>
      <P>The researchers forecast that the consumer price index in Taiwan will rise 1.98
percent in 2008.</P>

      <P>China is no longer a cheap labor manufacturing base it used to be, Chiang Pin-
kung, vice chairman of Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the 2007 Forum on Cross-Strait Industrial Cooperation and
Development held in Kunshan, Jiangsu province, Chiang said most Taiwanese
investors in China's coastal areas are facing labor shortage problems.</P>
      <P>Chiang noted that Beijing's economic development policy now places greater
emphasis on China's central, western and northeastern areas and that authorities
have become more selective in approving investments from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As a result, Taiwanese businessmen who plan to set up a labor-intensive
manufactory in China's coastal areas are facing a higher investment threshold
and limited maneuvering room, he said.</P>
      <P>Chiang added that Taiwanese investors in China are also facing rising production
costs and difficulties acquiring materials for their factories.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the labor shortage is coupled with the problem of rising
wages, with the average monthly wage for a worker in a Taiwanese-invested
factory now surpassing US$200.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang, Taiwanese investors looking to survive in business are left
with two alternatives: moving their production bases to China's inland areas or
to the north, or transforming their businesses to technology-intensive or
service industries.</P>
      <P>The annual forum, organized by the Kunshan city government and the Association
of Taiwan Businessmen in Kunshan, is in its seventh year.  More  than 300
people,  including  some 100 academics, industrialists and politicians from
Taiwan, are taking part in two days of discussions.</P>

      <P>A planned torch relay scheduled to kick off in the capital city Oct. 24 is
illegal under the Assembly and Parade Law, Taipei city government spokesman Yang
Hsiao-tung said Friday.</P>
      <P>Yang made the statement in response to a written request by the Cabinet-level
Sports Affairs Council (SAC) -- the organizer of the round-the-nation torch
relay aimed at promoting the country's bid to join the United Nations -- that
executive city officials participate in the first leg of the relay from Taipei
City to Taipei County.</P>
      <P>The 1,200-km torch relay, which is planned to cover all 25 cities and counties
around the country, is expected to take 11 days to complete, according to SAC.</P>
      <P>In a letter to the Taipei city government, the SAC also asked for city police's
assistance in maintaining traffic order during the run.</P>
      <P>In response, Yang criticized the central government, the sponsor of the U.N.-bid
torch relay, for having never put its plan to occupy Taipei road space to the
city government for approval and for failing to apply for the right to hold a
march in Taipei as required by law.</P>
      <P>Without the city government's permission, the planned run will be "obviously an
illegal activity, " Yang said. In this regard, he went on, it is not the
obligation of city officials to take part in the relay, nor the duty of the
city's law-enforcing authorities to police the "illegal activity."</P>
      <P>If the central government insists on carrying out the torch relay in Taipei, the
city government will charge it for violating the Assembly and Parade Law, the
Statute for Road Traffic Management and Punishment and the Constitution, Yang
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin of the opposition Kuomintang reiterated at
the city council earlier in the day his support for Taiwan's U.N. bid, while he
described joining the U.N. as a universal goal. However, he underlined that he
supports seeking a U.N. seat under the name "Republic of China."</P>
      <P>The "China" seat in the United Nations was taken over by the People's Republic
of China at the expense of the Republic of China in 1971. Taiwan has tried
without success since 1993 to have the United Nations consider the issue of its
representation.</P>
      <P>With promotion of the U.N. bid being a main policy plank of the Democratic
Progressive Party administration, the Cabinet decided to designated Oct. 24 --
the anniversary of the coming into force of the Charter of the United Nations,
which is celebrated internationally as United Nations Day -- as "Taiwan United
Nations Day" and is pushing for a referendum on whether to apply to join the
world body under the name "Taiwan."</P>

      <P>The government has unveiled a comprehensive project to care for the elderly in
view of the rapid graying of the population, the Ministry of the Interior (MOI)
said Friday, the nation's Senior Citizen's Day.</P>
      <P>MOI officials noted that the ratio of the elderly accounted for 10 percent of
the total population in 2006, which is why the government has mapped out the
10-year, long-term care project.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Lee Yi-yang recently said that the Executive Yuan has approved
the project to invest more than NT$81.7 billion (US$2.47 billion) in the decade
between 2007 and 2016 for the long-term care project.</P>
      <P>The comprehensive project will see the integration of services for the elderly
currently provided by a variety of government agencies, as well as the addition
of new services.</P>
      <P>MOI officials said that depending on the financial situation and the
preparations of the cities and counties, various services under the project will
kick off in November at the earliest.</P>
      <P>The new services include family care services, meaning that incapacitated elders
can be sent to qualified families for care, and the government will provide
subsidies based on the degree of the incapacity.</P>
      <P>The other services are in-home rehabilitation if the elders cannot be delivered
to a medical institution, and transportation services for the seriously
incapacitated.</P>
      <P>Government subsidies will also be expanded to cover medium-income households in
addition to low- and lower-income households, although the amount of the
subsidies will vary based on the category to which the households belong.</P>
      <P>The government  will provide full subsidies  to low-income families, 90 percent
subsidies to lower-income families and 60 percent to medium-income families.</P>
      <P>The government will also extend subsidies to medium-income families to improve
the mobility of elders under their care, such as the purchase of wheelchairs.</P>
      <P>But meal service will be confined to low- and lower-income families, with the
maximum subsidy providing for one meal per person.</P>
      <P>To ease the burden on family caregivers, the government will also launch a "take
a break service, " but only for those who have cared for elders for more than a
month are eligible to apply, and those who have already hired foreign caregiver
will be ineligible for the subsidies.</P>

      <P>Explaining what the European Union (EU) is to adults is difficult enough, let
alone explaining it to children, but there is no better way to introduce the EU
to children in Taiwan than with a picture book, an EU official in Taiwan said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking to a group of kindergarten children at the Taipei Public Library, Guy
Ledoux, head of the European Economic and Trade Office (EETO) in Taiwan,
described the EU as "a big family of 27 children with different habits, but they
have to obey the same rules."</P>
      <P>Ledoux and French Institute in Taiwan Director Jean-Claude Poimbeouf were among
a group of European representatives who launched an exhibition featuring the
children's picture book "Petits Europeens (Little Europeans)", by French
illustrator Nicole Lambert.</P>
      <P>In 60 boards with texts in Chinese, Taiwan citizens will be able to explore the
work of Lambert, an illustrator best known for her devotion to children's
picture books.</P>
      <P>"I hope that many children from Taiwan will visit the exhibition and will learn
more about Europe. I hope that when they grow up and become students, some will
come and study in Europe and see for themselves the great diversity of European
countries and enjoy the various landscape, food and tradition, " Ledoux said.</P>
      <P>The book tried to introduce background information, stories and traditions of
the 27 EU member states to children around the world. The educational effort is
part of a series of events the EETO has organized to help the people of Taiwan
understand more about Europe, and to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the EU.</P>
      <P>The EETO will organize  a European  Film Festival  in 12 universities later this

      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) launched a program Friday to
help unemployed young people find jobs amid high unemployment rates among new
graduates.</P>
      <P>Many young people in Taiwan cannot find jobs after they graduate, CLA Chairman
Lu Tien-lin noted, adding that the current youth unemployment rate is 11.6
percent, which is three times Taiwan's overall unemployment rate.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a CLA survey, 60-70 percent of local young people
who responded to the survey said that they had trouble finding their first job,
Lu noted</P>
      <P>The survey also found that up to 40 percent of local companies polled have shut
out first-time job seekers, Lu went on.</P>
      <P>In an effort to help local young people, Lu said that the CLA has allocated
NT$250 million (US$7.6 million) for the job-training program, which will be
implemented in three phases over the next 18 months.</P>
      <P>People under the age of 29, with a bachelor's or master's degree, are qualified

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should follow the global trend and abolish the death penalty, human
rights advocates said at a film festival  screening  death penalty-related
movies from various countries.</P>
      <P>"The government always said death penalties were imposed in the name of the
people, which means each and every one of us played a role in the execution of
death row inmates. But did we really authorize the government to do that for us?
" said Kao Yong-cheng, a lawyer who represented Human Rights Protection
Committee of the Taipei Bar Association on the sidelines of the second "Murder
by Numbers" film festival.</P>
      <P>The festival, which was organized by Taiwan Alliance to End the Death Penalty
(TAEDP) , screened nine documentary films from Italy, France, Sweden, Denmark,
India and the U.S., which all focused on the issue of death penalty.</P>
      <P>There is a global trend to abolish the death penalty, said Italian director
Mario Marazziti, whose film "Thou Shall Not Kill" is being screened. He noted
that the death penalty has been abolished in more than 90 countries, and that
there are 43 countries where there has not been a single execution in the past
10 years.</P>
      <P>One of the films,  "Un Abolistionniste: Robert Badinter, " documents the life
story of Badinter, a high-profile French criminal lawyer, university professor
and politician known for his struggle against the death penalty. The death
penalty was abolished when Badinter served as Minister of Justice in 1981.</P>
      <P>It took France almost 200 years to abolish the death penalty, showing that how
difficult it is to tackle the issue,  said Jean-Claude Poimbeouf, director of
French Institute in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The penalty has always been a political issue, which is why it will take
political measures to deal with the issue, Poimbeouf said, adding that most
Taiwanese political leaders have a background in the practice of law and that
they should reconsider abolishing the ultimate punishment given their expertise
in both politics and law.</P>
      <P>Most people think that crime rates will increase once the penalty is abolished,
but  this  idea  is false,  said  Go Yu-ling, Secretary-General of Taiwan
International Workers' Association. In fact, surveys in various countries showed
that crime rates did not rise after the abolition of the death penalty.</P>
      <P>The festival, which was previously held in 2004, has been relatively successful,
having doubled its viewership, said TAEDP executive director Lin Hsin-yi. The
films are being shown in Kaohsiung this week after having been first shown in
Taipei last week.</P>

      <P>The Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) has launched a four-year program aimed at expanding the global reach of
Taiwan's white light emitting diode (LED) industry, an IDB official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Under the program the IDB will establish testing standards for the industry,
help promote investment,  increase international cooperation and provide
training courses, the official noted.</P>
      <P>Describing LED lights as eco-friendly and energy-saving, the official said that
the new technology can be applied in a wide range of areas and its production
value is continuing to grow.</P>
      <P>According to the official, Taiwan's white LED industry has a complete supply
chain and generates an annual output of US$1.4 billion, which accounts for 23
percent of the global market.</P>
      <P>The bureau has commissioned the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI)
to implement the program, the official went on, adding that the ITRI will help
local manufacturers develop core technologies in an effort to enhance the
competitiveness of their products.</P>
      <P>In addition, the bureau will help form an industrial alliance to promote the
integration of industrial chains, which the official said will provide a boost
to Taiwan's LED industry.</P>
      <P>The industry has been granted a subsidy of over NT$150 million (US$4.6 million)
from the MOEA, the official added.</P>
      <P>Without the establishment of uniform testing standards and regulations at home,
the official said that it is necessary to take part in relevant international
events to understand global trends in this regard and to learn from other
countries' experience.</P>
      <P>The official pointed out that a number of Japanese companies have already set up
factories in Taiwan, and their cooperation with local manufacturers is
beneficial to enhancing the quality for Taiwan's LED products.</P>

      <P>A planned round-the-country torch relay promoting Taiwan's bid to join the
United Nations is a "national sports event, " rather than a "political activity
" as it is described by the Taipei city government, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chang said it is not up to the city government to decide whether or not the
relay run scheduled to kick off in Taipei Oct. 24 is a political event and
therefore regulated by the Assembly and Parade Law.</P>
      <P>Activities cannot be defined as political simply because they draw the
participation of politicians, according to Chang.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks during an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan
in response to opposition Kuomintang Legislator Hsu Shao-ping's questioning of
the city government's defining of the U.N. bid torch relay earlier in the day as
an "illegal activity" due to the organizer's failure to apply for the local
government's approval.</P>
      <P>Earlier, city government spokesman Yang Hsiao-tung said the city government has
formally informed the Sports Affairs Council (SAC) , the organizer of the torch
relay at the instruction of the Cabinet, that it will charge the central
government for violating the laws if it insists on carrying out the run in the
capital city.</P>
      <P>In response to Hsu's question, SAC Minister Yang Chung-ho pointed out that over
the past half-century, road runs have been regarded as sports events aimed at
boosting the health of the people. Therefore, they are not governed by the
Assembly and Parade Law, he said.</P>
      <P>The national torch relay, part of the Cabinet's effort to promote the U.N. bid
under the name Taiwan, is planned to pass through all 25 cities and counties
around the country in 11 days, according to the SAC.</P>

      <P>The International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) provides an online checklist
allowing the public to carry out quick  self-examination  on the risk  of
osteoporosis,  Taiwan Osteoporosis Association President Sung Yung-kuei said
Friday.</P>
      <P>The list provides questions relating to 19 risk factors for osteoporosis, a
disease characterized by low bone mass leading to increased susceptibility to
fractures, Sung said.</P>
      <P>Family history of osteoporosis, low body weight, old age, smoking, excess
alcohol, menopause and personal clinical history including bone fractures and
use of corticosteroide tablets, are all crucial factors for the disease, Sung
said.</P>
      <P>Sung suggested that people consult a doctor if they are in a high-risk group
according to the check list.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of a national health survey conducted by the Department of
Health, Sung said women are three times more likely to develop the disease than
men, though men can still suffer from osteoporosis.</P>
      <P>More than 70 percent of women over 50 who received osteoporosis tests at three
Taiwanese hospitals were found to be in the high-risk group for the disease,
Sung said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Orthopedic Association President Chen Wen-cho, suggested that people
under 30 take more exercise, get more exposure to the sun and have a balanced
diet rich in calcium in order to defend against developing osteoporosis in later
life.</P>
      <P>The same efforts by people over 30 will only slow down the speed of loss of bone
mass, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen called on osteoporosis patients to keep taking prescribed medicine for at
least two to three years.</P>
      <P>Osteoporosis patients tend to quit medication sooner than that because it causes
gastrointestinal discomfort, but the possibility of hip fractures increases if
patients do not complete their course of treatment, Chen said.</P>

      <P>The fishermen said the Fisheries Administration has instructed that their
vessels be fitted with voyage data recorders (VDRs) to show their mileage as a
basis for receiving subsidies for fuel oil.</P>
      <P>However, a lot of the boats operating out of Penghu are set-net operations and
cannot stop their engines while operating at a set spot, which means they
consume more fuel oil than a simple VDR would indicate.</P>

      <P>The fishermen also complained about a Fisheries Administration's plan for a set

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Friday that Taiwan has no plans to and will
absolutely not "develop, produce, or acquire" nuclear, biological or chemical

      <P>Chang made the remarks while fielding questions from opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Legislator Su Chi at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Su quoted a ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislator whom he refused

      <P>Su claimed that many high-ranking officials of the National Security Bureau have

      <P>The National Security Council also once secretly invited a former defense

      <P>In response, Chang said that despite the threat posed by hundreds of Chinese

the transfer of power in 2000, Chang said, adding that the military is no longer

      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Friday that the government would undermine the
rights of Taipei citizens by choosing a busy place and time to sponsor a torch
relay aimed at touting the government's desire to join the United Nations under
the name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hau's words came after the city government informed the Sports Affairs  Council
(SAC)  that  permission  for  its  planned round-the-country torch relay has not
been applied for as it should have been, according to the Assembly and Parade
Law.</P>
      <P>The torch relay is set to kick off Oct. 24, the day the U.N. charter came into
force 62 years ago, in the square in front of the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Hau displayed the SAC's letter dated Oct. 12 to the city government, which asks
the city government to arrange for officials to attend the torch relay ceremony
and accompany the torch on the run. It was followed with letters dated Oct. 17
and Oct. 18, saying the SAC will sponsor the torch relay and a cycling activity
in the square in front of the Presidential Office, asking the city government
not to approve the site for the use of other events and asking the city
government to provide traffic control assistance.</P>
      <P>Hau said the SAC only said it will sponsor activities but had not applied to
stage the activities, which shows no respect to the local government.</P>
      <P>Asked  if the central  government  can apply under urgent circumstances -- since

      <P>China has exposed its true colors by hijacking three U.S.-based Internet search
engines,  Government Information Office (GIO) Minister Shieh Jhy-wey said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Shieh was responding to foreign wire service reports that Chinese Internet users
trying to search on Google, Yahoo and Microsoft Web sites have been directed to
the Chinese-owned search engine Baidu since the U.S. Congress awarded Tibet's
exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama with Congressional Gold Medal Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the reports,  the hijacking might be China's retaliation for
Washington's awarding of the Dalai Lama and U.S. President George W. Bush's
appearance in public with the respected Tibetan spiritual leader</P>
      <P>While China has long been notorious for its totalitarian control of its people,
Shieh said it is nevertheless unthinkable that the Beijing leadership has dared
to so shamelessly, unequivocally and brazenly tampered with the free flow of
information by redirecting all traffic from the three powerful search engines.</P>
      <P>The move also exposes China's duplicity in its so-called "peace overture"
delivered in Chinese President Hu Jintao's speech at the 17th National Congress
of the Communist Party of China earlier this week that called for an end to
cross-Taiwan Strait enmity and for the signing of a cross-strait peace
agreement, Shieh said.</P>
      <P>The search engine redirects and the recent blocking of such popular
entertainment Web sites as YouTube and Live.com further explain why China is
placed at the bottom seventh in the Worldwide Press Freedom Index 2007 released
Tuesday by the Paris-based Reporters without Borders, Shieh added.</P>
      <P>According to an AFP report, Google has confirmed the blocking of its Chinese
search engine and Microsoft said it was looking into the matter.</P>
      <P>"It seems like China is fed up with the US, so as a way to fight back, they
redirected virtually all search traffic from Google, Yahoo and Microsoft to
Baidu, the Chinese based search engine, " analysts Danny Sullivan and Barry
Schwartz wrote at Search Engine Roundtable, a Web site focusing on Internet
search.</P>
      <P>The authors said it was not clear exactly how or why the searches were being
redirected, but China is known for tightly controlling the Internet and using a
variety of filters to screen out search results for issues relating to
dissidents or the 72-year-old  Tibetan spiritual leader.</P>
      <P>"Some have accused Baidu of hijacking the traffic, but we think it's likely that
China is upset with the US over the award it granted to the Dalai Lama and is
retaliating by hurting US-based search engines," Sullivan and Schwartz said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government urged to subsidize HPV vaccination against cervical cancer</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The private Health, Welfare and Environment Foundation  urged the government
Saturday to subsidize  human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination to encourage local
women to receive the immunization to protect themselves against cervical cancer.</P>
      <P>Releasing the results of a survey conducted Oct. 2-4 on 935 adult women in the
Taipei and Kaohisung areas, foundation officials pointed out that 88 percent of
the respondents think the government should subsidize the cost of HPV
inoculation and that 91 percent think the government should increase its budget
for cervical cancer prevention and control.</P>
      <P>If the inoculation is partially subsidized by the government, 58.9 percent of
the respondents said they will have themselves and their daughters immunized,
and if the inoculation is fully subsidized by government, 77.8 percent said they
will do so, according to the survey results.</P>
      <P>Asked to rate the government's performance on cervical cancer prevention and
control on a 10-point scale, the respondents gave it an average score of 5.9.</P>
      <P>On the respondents' perception on cervical cancer, the survey found that 41
percent were unaware of the seriousness of the disease, and 42 percent were not
worried about becoming a victim of the disease.</P>
      <P>Although approximately 80 percent of the respondents knew the government
subsidizes Pap smear screening for cervical cancer, only 66 percent have
received the tests over the past three years, the results show.</P>
      <P>Yu Shan-lin, a research fellow at the Academia Sinica's Genomics Research
Center, pointed out that around 5,500 new cervical cancer cases are recorded in
Taiwan each year, with the number of fatalities registering around 800 per year.</P>
      <P>Although  the HPV vaccines have been proven effective  in preventing the cancer,
the inoculation rate among local women has remained low since the vaccines hit
the Taiwan market last year, mainly because of the high price, Yu said.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, if the government subsidizes the cost of HPV
inoculation, more women will be encouraged to receive the shots, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Torch relay snub shows mayor's 'pettiness': spokesman</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin's intolerance of a planned torch relay to underline
the country's resolve to seek U.N. membership reveals his 'pettiness and lack of
breadth of view,' Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Shieh made the remarks a day after Hau accused the central government of
violating the Assembly and Parade Law by failing to apply for a permit for its
U.N. bid torch relay set to kick off Oct. 24,  which is observed  worldwide  as
United Nations  Day in commemoration of the entry into force of the U.N. Charter
on that date in 1945.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the torch relay is a political event, Hau, a stalwart of the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT), said the city government will not allow the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) -led central government to ignore the
municipal authority and skip the permit application procedures.</P>
      <P>In response, Shieh said the upcoming round-the-nation torch relay is a sports
event for which prior approval by local governments is not required under the
Assembly and Parade Law.</P>
      <P>Shieh reminded Hau that most of the DPP-controlled city and county governments
didn't require that KMT presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou apply for prior
approval when he embarked on a round-the-Taiwan bicycle tour in May to drum up
support for his electoral bid.</P>
      <P>"Most of the DPP-controlled local governments regarded Ma's cycling tour as a
sports event and exempted him from the permit requirement, " Shieh said, adding
that all those city and county governments even actively provided assistance
with traffic control along the roads that Ma passed along.</P>
      <P>Comparing their treatment of Ma and the Taipei city government's refusal to
offer any assistance with maintenance of traffic order on the grounds that the
torch relay is illegal, Shieh said that "one can easily tell who is being
petty."</P>
      <P>According to the schedule unveiled by the Sports Affairs Council (SAC) , the
relay will kick off at 7 a.m. Oct. 24 in front of the Presidential Office on
Ketagalan Boulevard in downtown Taipei, with President Chen Shui-bian leading
the pack.</P>
      <P>Seventeen athletes and celebrities will carry the torch through 25 counties and
cities around the country, including the outlying islands of Penghu, Kinmen and
Matsu, Shieh said, adding that the 11-day event is also aimed at encouraging
local people to get more exercise.</P>
      <P>The 1,200-km relay is scheduled to conclude at 6: 30 p.m. Nov. 3 when the torch
is slated to return to the Presidential Office plaza.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was forced out of the United Nations in 1971 when Beijing took over the
"China" seat at its expense. Since 1993, the country has tried without success
to have the U.N. General Assembly consider the issue of its representation in
the world body.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian insisted Saturday that the nationwide torch relay set
to begin next week to promote Taiwan's U.N. bid is "definitely lawful, " urging
the public to actively take part in the event.</P>
      <P>Chen said that joining the United Nations is a goal shared by Taiwan's 23
million people and that the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) should not try to block
the relay.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks during a trip to the southern county of Tainan.</P>
      <P>The 1,200-km relay organized by the Sports Affairs Council, which will cover all
25 counties and cities around the country and is expected to take 11 days to
complete, is scheduled to begin Oct. 24 from Taipei City.</P>
      <P>The president is expected to lead the first leg from Taipei City to Taipei
County, after the torch is lit at 7 a.m. that day on Ketagalan Boulevard in
front of the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>However, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin, a stalwart of the KMT, claimed Friday that
the event is a "political activity" for which a public assembly permit from the
city government is required. He said that holding the activity without a permit
is unlawful.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen said the KMT should not adopt a "double standard, " and he
dared the city government "to come crack down on the event if it wants to."</P>
      <P>Noting that KMT presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou previously made a nationwide
cycling tour to drum up support for his campaign and that the party itself is
pushing for a referendum on the restoration of the country's U.N. membership,
Chen said the KMT should not try to prevent others from holding a road running
event or try to obstruct the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) drive
for a referendum on applying to join the United Nations under the name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that Ma's cycling tour stopped in a number of counties and
cities held by the DPP and that the governments of these localities did not
insist that Ma apply for a permit, adding that they even actively helped out by
dispatching police to maintain order and assist with traffic control at events
held during the tour.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) vice presidential candidate said Saturday
that although a cross-Taiwan Strait common market is a "goal" that cannot be
achieved at this point in time, such a market nevertheless represents a
"protective shield for Taiwan's future."</P>
      <P>Vincent Siew, who served as chairman of the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic
Research before being nominated as the KMT's vice presidential candidate in June
this year, made the remarks in a speech delivered in Taipei at a training camp
for executive members of the National Women's League of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>In the speech, Siew defended his "cross-strait common market" idea which he has
promoted for over half a decade. The idea of the cross-strait  common market has
been criticized by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's)
presidential candidate Frank Hsieh who has said that such a "one China market"
would threaten Taiwan's existence.</P>
      <P>Siew said that amid the economic "globalization and regional integration"
trends, all countries around the world, except Taiwan, want to grab a share of
the immense China market.</P>
      <P>Because of political considerations, Siew claimed, the DPP-led government has
refused to seek business opportunities in China, which he described as a key
resource for Taiwan to maintain its vitality.</P>
      <P>"It is not only stupid but also suicidal behavior," he claimed.</P>
      <P>"We need the Chinese market, " Siew said, arguing that Taiwan and China share a
common interest in increased economic exchanges.</P>
      <P>Siew also mentioned that when he initiated the cross-strait common market idea
in 2001, he won then President Chen's support.</P>
      <P>However,  Siew continued,  after  he became  the KMT vice presidential candidate
for the 2008 election, both Chen and the DPP's presidential candidate began to
"distort" the idea by referring to it as a "one China market."</P>
      <P>According to Siew, Hsieh has even expressed that although he supports the
proposal for the two sides to engage in economic cooperation, he opposes the
formation of a "cross-strait common market" which he has said would lead to
Taiwan being flooded with cheap Chinese laborers and agricultural products</P>
      <P>Siew criticized Hsieh's argument, calling it "blind" and saying this line of
reasoning is like "turning the right into wrong."</P>
      <P>Siew said his common market idea was formed on the model of the European Union,
and its antecedent, the European Common Market. Under his proposed cross-strait
common market, the two sides would "exist equally, without either side's
sovereignty being consumed," he noted, adding that he knows of no European
country that has been "wiped away" after joining the EU.</P>
      <P>"A common market means that everybody can share the benefits generated by
increased economic activity," Siew stressed.</P>
      <P>Eventually, he continued, after a common market is formed, there will be free
exchanges of personnel,  capital, technology and products, but such exchanges
can only be achieved through constant negotiations and the construction of a
"firewall" to protect the interests of each individual member of the common
market.</P>
      <P>Siew noted that although it is now still too early to form a cross-strait common
market, it is an aspiration and long-term goal that can serve as a framework for
peace between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP urged to recruit '11 foes' to run in tough constituencies</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Legislator Lee Wen-chung of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
suggested Saturday that the party invite all "11 foes" to represent the party in
tough constituencies in the legislative elections slated for early next year.</P>
      <P>The "11 foes" are mavericks who are either incumbent or former DPP legislators.
They got the name after being panned by hardcore supporters of the DPP-led "pan-
green camp" as "traitors of Taiwan" during the hotly contested legislative
primaries early this year for allegedly befriending pro-unification media and
echoing the views of the "pan-blue" alliance" led by the main opposition
Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>All 11, including Lee himself, failed to get nominated as DPP candidates for the
coming legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks following media reports that President Chen Shui-bian has
lobbied Lo Wen-jia, a protege of the president and a former DPP legislator, to
represent the DPP in Taipei's Daan constituency, which has traditionally been a
stronghold of the "pan-blue alliance."</P>
      <P>The reports also said that since the president took over the helm of the party
early this month, he has begun to review a controversial "blitz" campaign
strategy for the legislative elections endorsed by former DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-
kun, who based the strategy on that of the young professional "assassin"
candidates recruited by then Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi in 2005
to beat veteran rivals and score a landslide victory in general elections in
Japan that year.</P>
      <P>Although the reports stated the president's invitation to Lo, one of the "11
foes," was meant as a gesture of reconciliation, Lee said the president must
also consider procedural justice, now that the DPP legislative candidate in the
Daan constituency has been produced in the party's primary.</P>
      <P>He said that soliciting one individual to run is "of little significance,"
suggesting that the party invite all</P>
      <P>"11 foes" to fight for the party in tough constituencies.</P>
      <P>"If the president thinks that these people are suitable candidates and
coordinates them for the tough elections, they can score victory with blitz
warfare," Lee claimed.</P>
      <P>Former Legislator Lin Chou-shui, also one of the "11 foes," said that "only Lo
himself can answer if the invitation to run is meant to clear his name."</P>
      <P>For himself, Lin said that he wants a rest and to write a book, adding that he
has many things to occupy his time and that no one has contacted him about
running in the elections.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Shen Fa-huei, another of the "foes," said that he was approached
earlier to run in one tough constituency but that he declined the invitation
because he thinks problems still exist within the party, including the
"merciless bashing of the 11 foes."</P>
      <P>The other "foes" are former Legislators Duan Yi-kang and Shen Fu-hsiung, and
incumbent Legislators Hung Chi-chang, Tsai Chi-chang, Lin Shu-shan, Julian Kuo
and Cheng Yun-peng. Shen quit the DPP recently.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian rejected Saturday a claim by an opposition legislator
that Taiwan has recently launched a nuclear weapon development program.</P>
      <P>Chen said he guarantees that "there is no nuclear missile in Taiwan" and that
the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration "is not going to develop
any nuclear missiles."</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during a trip to the southern county of Tainan, in

recently ordered the Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology, a
subordinate unit of the Ministry of National Defense's Armaments Bureau, to

      <P>Su claimed he overheard the information from a heavyweight DPP legislator who
disagreed with the president's move.</P>
      <P>Dismissing Su's claim as a "complete lie, " Chen criticized Su for paying no
regard to national security and national interests by making up such a
"sensational" story.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, developing nuclear weapons was an idea held by the former KMT
government 20 years ago, and it is totally senseless for Su to imagine it to be

      <P>Gaining U.N. membership would allow Taiwan to include its 12 nominations on the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World

      <P>U.N. membership is a prerequisite for a country to nominate its natural and
cultural heritage sites for inclusion on UNESCO's World Heritage List because
only signatories to the State Parties of the World Heritage Convention are
allowed to submit nominations, CCA Chairwoman Wong Chin-chu said.</P>
      <P>"Lack of U.N. membership limits Taiwan's international space not only in
politics but also in terms of cultural exchanges and cultural heritage

      <P>A group of international scholars and experts were commissioned by the CCA in

The list they came up with includes 12 sites around the island, and it can be

      <P>Wong urged the people of Taiwan and the presidential candidates of the

      <P>The 12 sites are Fort San Domingo in Tamsui and surrounding historical

      <P>Electromagnetic wave-free environment advocates urged the Taiwan High-Speed Rail
Corp.(THSR) Saturday to attach "electromagnetic wave-free carriages" to their
trains to ensure the safety of people with cardiac pacemakers.</P>
      <P>Members of the Taiwan Electromagnetic Wave Hazard Prevention and Control League
made the call at a press conference they held at the high-speed railway's
Zuoying Station in the southern port city of Kaoshiung.</P>
      <P>Chiu Chien-fang, an executive member of the civil organization's Yulin branch,
said that volunteers of the organization had examined 65 high-speed train
carriages over the past several months for the presence of electromagnetic
waves.</P>
      <P>According to the data collected, electromagnetic waves of an intensity of
between 10,000 milliwatts (uW) per square meter and 100,000 uW/sq.m were
detected in the train carriages examined, or an average intensity of 60,000
uW/sq.m, Chiu said, adding that the results lead them to believe that the train
carriages are equipped with repeaters for microwave transmissions.</P>
      <P>Chiu also noted that volunteers of the organization also examined trains
operated by the Taiwan Railway Administration and public buses and that no
electromagnetic waves were detected.</P>
      <P>During the press conference, Chiu and her colleagues examined the Zuoying
Station with an electromagnetic wave detector. The device revealed the presence
of electromagnetic waves with an intensity of between 3,000 uW/sq.m and 10,000
uW/sq.m at different spots in the station.</P>
      <P>According to Chiu, people with serious diseases, elderly people, pregnant women,
and people with pacemakers are at risk of acquiring certain disorders if exposed
to excessive levels of electromagnetic radiation.</P>
      <P>In response,  Environmental Protection Administration  (EPA) officials
responsible for air quality protection and noise control said in Taipei that the
average intensity of electromagnetic waves detected by Chiu's group on high-
speed train carriages is far below the maximum acceptable safety level of 9
million uW/sq.m suggested by the EPA.</P>
      <P>The officials further said that it has not yet been determined whether
electromagnetic radiation poses a risk to human health and that the World Health
Organization is still conducting studies with experts in over 20 countries
around the world.</P>
      <P>The officials did point out, however, that the Germany-based International
Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection has suggested that the maximum
safe level of electromagnetic radiation be set at below 9 million uW/sq.m.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that he "will not rule out the
possibility of making changes" concerning who will represent the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the legislative elections slated for
January.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks amid reports that he has persuaded Luo Wen-jia, a
former legislator who also once served as chairman of the Council for Hakka
Affairs, to run in the Daan constituency of Taipei City, which has traditionally
been a stronghold of the "pan-blue alliance" led by the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Luo, after being hand-picked by the president, will replace Kao Chia-yu, a
former aide of Luo who has been recruited for her fresh image under former DPP
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, according to the reports.</P>
      <P>Luo, considered a maverick within the party for his outspoken attitude, failed
to get nominated as a DPP candidate for the coming legislative elections mainly
because he was panned as one of the "11 foes," or "traitors of Taiwan," by DPP
hardcore supporters in the hotly contested primaries earlier this year.</P>
      <P>The president noted that what makes the DPP valuable is that the party
"tolerates and respects" different views, saying that it is not a "one-man
party" or a party with "a uniform voice."</P>
      <P>"Remarks made by Luo before may not be agreeable to some party members, but he
made them for my sake and the sake of the party and Taiwan," the president said.</P>
      <P>Chen further said that since taking over the helm of the party early this week,
he has tried to work to make the party more cohesive, adding that he will work
to "retrieve all those whom the party has lost."</P>
      <P>He stressed that former DPP Chairman Yu's "blitz" campaign strategy patterned
after that of the young professional "assassin" candidates recruited by then
Japanese Prime Minister Juinchiro Koizumi in 2005 to beat veteran rivals in
general elections that year has its merits, but "for the sake of victory, I'm
not ruling out the possibility of making changes."</P>
      <P>"However, since the nomination of DPP candidates for all the constituencies has
been completed, I'll make only minimal changes in a few constituencies, if I do
in fact make any changes," he added.</P>
      <P>He said that Luo is willing to run in the tough constituency, and the party
should "welcome him" for his devotion to the party and the country.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Luo said in his blog Saturday that after days of deliberations, he is
now willing to run in the Daan constituency. He also urged party members to look
at "different views" as "assets," rather than as "liabilities."</P>
      <P>Kao, the DPP nominee for the Daan constituency, said in a statement issued
Saturday in her blog that she "cannot and will not withdraw from the elections"
and that she has yet to receive any information regarding candidate changes.</P>
      <P>Kao said that she was nominated through a democratic and legitimate process and
that she will not give up lightly her pledge to win for the party in the
constituency.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Ching-an, the main opposition Kuomintang's candidate running in
the Daan constituency, claimed that the recruitment of Luo reveals President
Chen's "political scheme" and an attempt to placate the "11 foes," among whom
are included 10 other former or incumbent legislators who lost in the DPP's
legislative primaries.</P>
      <P>Noting that Luo mentioned that his participation is aimed at "changing the
political atmosphere and values," Lee said that in fact, the president should

Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on retrieving what it claims are the "ill-
gotten assets" amassed by the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) during its five
decades of rule, and the other initiated by the KMT on opposition to corruption
-- will be put to a vote alongside the Jan. 12 legislative elections.</P>

the debates and presentations is estimated at NT$15 million (US$454,500).</P>
      <P>Those who want to take part in the debates should apply to the CEC to raise
funds to campaign for their cause although those who represent the opposition
side in the debates should solicit over 1, 651 signatures prior to application,
they added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's crude birth rate dropped to a new low of 8.6 childbirths per 1,000
people for the first nine months of this year, according to statistics released
by the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) Saturday.</P>
      <P>The crude birth rate (CBR) of a population refers to the number of childbirths
per 1,000 people per year.</P>
      <P>The MOI statistics show that there were a total of 146,517 childbirths in Taiwan
between January and September, which translates into a crude birth rate of 8.6,
down 0.04 percent from the figure for the same period the previous year.</P>
      <P>By area, Taipei County registered the highest number of births for the period at
23,148, followed by Taipei City at 15,300 and Taoyuan City at 13,900.</P>
      <P>In terms of the crude birth rate, Hsinchu County and Hsinchu City occupied the
top two spots,  with the former registering 9.2 childbirths per 1,000 people and
the latter posting nine births per 1,000. Keelung City registered the lowest
birth rate at 5.4 per 1,000.</P>
      <P>The MOI report also shows a marginal 0.3 percent increase in the ratio of babies
born out of wedlock. During the nine-month period, babies born out of wedlock
accounted for 4.5 percent of total childbirths.</P>
      <P>As to the nationality of mothers, 5.5 percent of new babies were born to foreign
mothers, while 4.9 percent were born to mothers from China, Hong Kong or Macau.
The combined figure of these two categories  of mothers marks a 1.6 percent
decrease from the year-earlier level, which conforms with a downward trend in
the number of new babies born to non-Taiwanese mothers in recent years, MOI
officials said.</P>
      <P>The MOI statistics further show that the outlying islands of Matsu and Kinmen
had the highest  ratios of babies  born to non-Taiwanese mothers in the first
nine months of the year, with 21.18 percent of new babies in Matsu born to
foreign or Chinese mothers  and 19.21 percent  of new babies in Kinmen born to
non-Taiwanese mothers.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan proper, Miaoli County had the highest ratio of new babies born to non-
Taiwanese mothers at 15.75 percent, according to the MOI tallies.</P>

    <TEXT>Former Legislator Lee Wen-chung of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
suggested Saturday that the party invite all "11 foes" to represent the party in
tough constituencies in the legislative elections slated for early next year.

The "11 foes" are mavericks who are either incumbent or former DPP legislators.
They got the name after being panned by hardcore supporters of the DPP-led "pan-
green camp" as "traitors of Taiwan" during the hotly contested legislative
primaries early this year for allegedly befriending pro-unification media and
echoing the views of the "pan-blue" alliance" led by the main opposition
Kuomintang.

Only four, including Lee himself, out of the "11 foes" were nominated as DPP
candidates for the coming legislative elections.

Lee made the remarks following media reports that President Chen Shui-bian has
lobbied Lo Wen-jia, a protege of the president and one of the "11 foes" who
failed to get nominated, to represent the DPP in Taipei's Daan constituency,
which has traditionally been a stronghold of the "pan-blue alliance."

The reports also said that since the president took over the helm of the party
early this month, he has begun to review a controversial "blitz" campaign
strategy for the legislative elections endorsed by former DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-
kun, who based the strategy on that of the young professional "assassin"
candidates recruited by then Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi in 2005
to beat veteran rivals and score a landslide victory in general elections in
Japan that year.

Although the reports stated the president's invitation to Luo, one of the "11
foes" who failed to get nominated in the primary, was meant as a gesture of
reconciliation, Lee said the president must also consider procedural justice,
now that the DPP legislative candidate in the Daan constituency has been
produced in the party's primary.

He said that soliciting one individual to run is "of little significance,"
suggesting that the party invite all

"11 foes" to fight for the party in tough constituencies.

"If the president thinks that these people are suitable candidates and
coordinates them for the tough elections, they can score victory with blitz
warfare," Lee claimed.

Former Legislator Lin Chou-shui, also one of the "11 foes" who failed to get
nominated, said that "only Lo himself can answer if the invitation to run is
meant to clear his name."

For himself, Lin said that he wants a rest and to write a book, adding that he
has many things to occupy his time and that no one has contacted him about
running in the elections.

DPP Legislator Shen Fa-huei, another of the "foes" who failed in the primary,
said that he was approached earlier to run in one tough constituency but that he
declined the invitation because he thinks problems still exist within the party,
including the "merciless bashing of the 11 foes."

The other "foes" are former Legislators Duan Yi-kang and Shen Fu-hsiung, and
incumbent Legislators Hung Chi-chang, Tsai Chi-chang, Lin Shu-shan, Julian Kuo
and Cheng Yun-peng. Shen quit the DPP recently.

In addition to Lee, Duan, Kuo and Tsai were also nominated to represent the
party to run in the Jan. 12 legislative elections.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>U.N. bid referendum will push U.S. to change attitude: president</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that Taiwan will stand a better chance of
persuading the United States to support  its bid to join the United  Nations  if
the ruling party-initiated U.N. bid referendum proposal gets passed.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while attending a prayer service at the Eastgate
Presbyterian Church in the southern city of Tainan. The prayer service was held
to beg for God's blessing for the country's quest for U.N. membership.</P>
      <P>Noting that insisting on Taiwan's separate identity and pursuing social justice
have been his fundamental policy values, Chen said the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) -proposed referendum on whether to join the United
Nations under the name Taiwan to be held alongside the presidential election
March 22, 2008 is fleshed out in line with the Taiwan-centric vision of the
Taiwanese identity.</P>
      <P>Despite U.S. concerns over the referendum proposal, Chen said he will not waver
in the campaign for its holding because it is the right path that Taiwan must
pursue. "So long as we have confidence in Taiwan, its people and democracy, we
will succeed eventually, " he added.</P>
      <P>When the country's first-ever referendum was held alongside the 2004
presidential election, Chen recalled that the opposition camp pulled out all the
stops to boycott. Still, some 7 million voters cast ballots in the referendum on
issues regarding the country's defense buildup. This time around,  Chen said,
even the main opposition Kuomintang is pushing for a referendum on whether the
country should re-join the U.N. under its official title "Republic of China."</P>
      <P>All these developments prove progress in Taiwan's democratic development, Chen
said, adding he firmly believes that the passage of the DPP-initiated U.N. bid
referendum will be very helpful to lobby U.S. support for the cause.</P>
      <P>As of Friday, Chen said, the DPP referendum initiative had collected 1.38
million endorsement signatures and the number is expected to reach the 2 million
target by the end of this month.</P>
      <P>If 8 million eligible voters cast "yes" ballots next year to have the referendum
pass its high legal threshold, Chen said he is convinced that the ratio of
American people supportive of Taiwan's U.N. bid will increase from the current
55 percent to 70 percent.</P>
      <P>Should that be the case, Chen said, U.S. Congress and the White House will feel
the pinch of the American public opinion and eventually change its attitude and
lend support behind Taiwan's U.N. bid.</P>

      <P>The plan to replace certain candidates recruited  under a "blitz" campaign
strategy  for the coming legislative election with more promising hopefuls is
still in the works, a ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) official said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsieh Hsin-ni, who concurrently heads the DPP's information and
publicity department, made the remarks after reports about changes in the
party's nomination strategies drew backlash from a "blitz" candidate.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, former DPP Legislator Luo Wen-jia and veteran Taipei
City Councilor Chou Po-ya may be drafted to run for regional legislative seats
in two constituencies  dominated by well-honed opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
machine -- Taipei's Daan and Wenshan districts.</P>
      <P>The reports said Luo, who had been one of the DPP's most promising political
stars before losing his bid for the Taipei County magistrateship in late 2005,
and Chou, a three-term city councilor, will replace two little-known "blitz"
candidates, Kao Chia-yu and Yang Tzu-hsuan, respectively, in the Jan. 12, 2008
legislative election.</P>
      <P>Kao and Yang  were  nominated  to run in the two  tough constituencies under the
"blitz" campaign program patterned after former Japanese Prime Minister
Junichiro Koizumi's successful 2005 campaign  strategy in which a hit squad of
glamorous  female professionals  were recruited to run against certain political
veterans who opposed Koizumi's postal system reform plan.</P>
      <P>Kao, a former aides of Luo, told a press conference Saturday that she "cannot
and will not withdraw from the elections" since she was nominated through
democratic and legitimate process.</P>
      <P>In response, Hsieh said many grassroots campaign aides have been pushing the
party central to adjust its "blitz" campaign strategy.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Hsieh said, the party headquarters has begun soliciting
opinions from various quarters. While all DPP members and supporters want the
party to field candidates most likely to succeed, Hsieh said the party must
follow set procedures in replacing candidates.</P>
      <P>The replacement plan is still in the works and has yet to be completed, Hsieh
said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Luo, who used to be President Chen Shui-bian's right-hand man,
said in his blog Saturday that after several days of deliberation, he is willing
to run in the Daan constituency.</P>
      <P>As Luo is a DPP candidate for at-large legislative seat, he must first give up
that candidacy before he can join the race for a regional legislative seat.</P>
      <P>Also Saturday, President Chen who doubles as DPP chairman admitted that the
party may change some candidates ahead of the January legislative election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chen: U.N. bid referendum will lead U.S. to review 'one China' policy</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian continued to push for the referendum on Taiwan's bid to
join the United Nations under the name Taiwan Sunday, saying that a vote on the
U.N. bid will generate at least four major influences, including a re-evaluation
of the "one China" policy by the United States.</P>
      <P>Under the influence of the Taiwan U.N.-bid referendum, Chen calculated that
Washington will review the "one China" policy it has followed for decades in
favor of the People's Republic of China and consider whether the United States
should politically recognize both China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while speaking at an event marking the sixth anniversary
of the "Taiwan Heart Association" established in 2001 by Vice President Annette
Lu to champion Taiwan's distinctive identity.</P>
      <P>The president said he believes that the passage of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP)-initiated U.N. bid referendum will be very helpful in
terms of winning U.S. support for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under the influence of the U.N.-bid referendum, Chen also claimed that the DPP
presidential ticket of Frank Hsieh and Su Tseng-chang will definitely be elected
in the 2008 presidential election as Taiwan's next president and vice president.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the U.N.-bid  referendum,  he added,  the pro-unification
opposition  Kuomintang (KMT)  will increasingly "localize" itself and probably
change its name to the "Taiwan KMT."</P>
      <P>Given a successful referendum on the U.N. bid, Chen claimed that China will no
longer insist on the "one China" prerequisite for cross-strait negotiations,
which will be conducive to the signing of a genuine bilateral peace accord.</P>
      <P>The DPP-proposed referendum on whether to join the United Nations under the name
Taiwan is slated to be held alongside the presidential election March 22, 2008.</P>
      <P>As of Friday, according to Chen, the DPP referendum initiative had collected
1.38 million endorsement signatures. That number is expected to reach the 2
million target by the end of this month.</P>
      <P>If 8 million eligible voters cast "yes" ballots next year, Chen said he is
convinced that the ratio of American people supportive of Taiwan's U.N. bid will
increase from the current 55 percent to 70 percent.</P>
      <P>Should that be the case, Chen said, the U.S. Congress and the White House will
feel the pinch of the American public opinion and eventually change their
attitudes and lend support to Taiwan's U.N. bid.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 62 percent of adults in Taiwan say they will consider driving less in
the face of skyrocketing oil prices, according to the results of a public
opinion poll conducted by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC) released Sunday.</P>
      <P>Should the price of petroleum at the pump rise to over NT$30 (US$0.92) per
litre, but not exceed NT$35 per litre, 81.5 percent of the car owners say they
will drive their own private vehicles less frequently, the poll found.</P>
      <P>Should the price of petroleum at the pump rise to over NT$35 per litre, but not
exceed NT$40, 95.2 percent of the car owners say they will definitely use their
own cars less often.</P>
      <P>A total of 65.5 percent of the car owners in the southern port city of Kaohsiung
say their will consider driving their own cars less in the face of soaring oil
prices, topping all citizens in other areas around the country in this regard.</P>
      <P>By comparison, 62.5 percent of car owners in Taiwan province (excluding the
Taipei and Kaohsiung metropolitan areas) and 55.8 percent of car owners in
Taipei City say they will use their own cars less in the face of soaring oil
prices.</P>
      <P>Given increasing costs, some 22.5 percent of respondents say they will use
public transportation systems instead of their private vehicles, an increase of
3.9 percentage points over a similar poll conducted in 2004, MOTC officials
said.</P>
      <P>However, 77.5 percent of car owners will not opt for public transportation
systems, citing reasons including living too far away from train or bus stations
(24.3 percent) ; such systems being too time consuming (16.8 percent) ; and low
mobilization efficiency (14.9 percent).</P>
      <P>The poll also found that owning and using a private car costs owners, on
average, NT$6,484 per month, NT$34 less than in 2005.</P>
      <P>Of the NT$6,484 outlay, NT$2,943 was spent on fuel, NT$1,021 on maintenance, and
NT$803 on parking. The remaining went to insurance, taxes, car washes and and
miscellaneous costs, in that order, according to MOTC officials.</P>
      <P>The MOTC randomly selected 20,000 out of 5.5 million private cars registered in
the country for the poll, which has a 1 percent margin of error.</P>

      <P>The total value of Hsinchu Science Park exports in the first three-quarters of
the year amounted to NT$471.62 billion  (US$14.16  billion) ,  an increase  of
11.27 percent year-on-year,  according  to statistics  released  by the park
administration Sunday.</P>
      <P>In September, the overall value of the park's exports amounted to NT$60.75
billion, an increase of 12.6 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>However, the figure represented a decline of 2.13 percent compared with the
previous month's level due to an across the board decline in exports from the
park, including integrated circuits (IC), computers  and peripherals,
information  technology,  precision machinery and biotech industries.</P>
      <P>Among  the six major  industries  in the park,  only the optoelectronics sector

      <P>The number of businesses operating in the three major science parks around
Taiwan has topped 600, with combined turnover reaching NT$1.23 trillion
(US$36.85 billion) in the first eight months of this year, the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>As of the end of August, the number of businesses operating in Taiwan's three
major science parks -- Hsinchu Science Park, Central Taiwan Science Park, and
Southern Taiwan Science Park -- totaled 607, 21 more than the year-earlier
level, according to DGBAS tallies.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the combined turnover of the three major science parks reached
NT$1.23 trillion during the January-August period, posting an 11.6 percent
growth compared with the level of the same period of 2006.</P>
      <P>At the end of August, a total of 184,506 people (excluding alien workers) worked
in the three facilities, compared to 169,981 people posted in August 2006. Of
the total, 119,480 were working in companies housed in the Hsinchu Science Park
located in the northern county of Hsinchu.</P>
      <P>In terms of business turnover, the Hsinchu Science Park -- which has long been
known as Taiwan's "Silicon Valley" -- commanded NT$737.3 billion, or 60.2
percent of the combined business turnover of the three facilities in the first
eight months of this year, followed by NT$331.3 billion by the Southern Taiwan
Science Park, and NT$156.5 billion by the Central Taiwan Science Park, DGBAS
officials noted.</P>
      <P>They added that although the turnover of the Central Taiwan Science Park was the
lowest, it marked a whopping annual growth of 54.7 percent.</P>
      <P>By industry,  they  pointed  out,  the integrated  circuit manufacturing is the
largest industry in the three facilities, commanding NT$634.6 billion, or 51.8
percent of the total turnover in the eight-month period, up 6.7 percent over the
year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>The opto-electronics industry was the second-largest business operation in the

period, marking an increase of 23.2 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>In the first eight months of this year, the three science parks posted combined
exports of NT$721.8  billion,  up 9.3 percent year-on-year. The figure

      <P>A Taipei city councilor called on health authorities Sunday to investigate the
marketing of two water products by their manufacturer, who claims they contain
healing energy.</P>
      <P>Councilor Chou Wei-you, accompanied by former legislator Tuan Yi-kang, told a
press conference at the Taipei City Council that a Miaoli County-based biotech
company owned by Rich Tsai, 48, has hired medical doctors to inject "energized"
isotonic saline solution for patients at NT$8,000 (US$245) per bottle.</P>
      <P>According to Chou, Tsai would buy saline solution from the market at about NT$35
per bottle and then place the bottles in a tank for three months to have the
solution "energized" by a special meteorite.</P>
      <P>Tsai would make a huge profit by asking patients to pay NT$8,000 for a bottle of
the "energized" saline solution, and each patient is also required to pay NT$250
to the doctor who administers the injection.</P>
      <P>Chou said that, knowing that the intrusive treatment could cause him trouble,
Tsai would ask the patients to sign three documents declaring that they
requested the doctors to acquire the saline solution for them, that they asked
the doctors to administer the injections, and that they forgo their legal rights
pertaining to the treatment.</P>
      <P>The press conference Sunday was the second held by Chou and Tuan in four days to
urge health authorities to take action against Tsai and his energy water
products. On Oct. 17, they accused Taipei Agricultural Products Marketing Co.
for selling "Naipo energy water" for Tsai's company which claimed that the water
could cure cancer patients.</P>
      <P>Taipei Agricultural Products Marketing Co., which is 40 percent owned by the
Taipei city government, responded immediately by pulling all Naipo water
products from its 13 stores. Its stores had sold the energy water at NT$200 per
bottle, while the actual cost was only NT$4.</P>
      <P>Tsai has claimed that he has a special ability to have the water energized
through lightening by a meteorite he found 30 years ago, and that he has
acquired clairvoyance through the rock.</P>
      <P>He has also claimed that he is applying for patents for his water products from
the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health under the Taipei city government and the Maioli County
Public Health Bureau have both begun to probe whether Tsai and his company have
violated the health law for claiming exaggerated therapeutic effects of Naipo
water products.</P>

      <P>The Council of the Indigenous Peoples, eyeing the great economic potential of
Taiwan's spa industry, will offer a series of training courses from Oct. 22 for
indigenous people to help them work for or run spa businesses, a council
spokesman said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The project was made after the Industrial Technology Research Institute put
forward a report stating that in 2008, the output value of the spa industry is
expected to reach NT$63 billion, of which, spa derivative products accounting
for NT$30 billion.</P>
      <P>According to the report, in 2003, the industry's output -- comprised of the
value of hot spring hotels and resorts, spa operations, hot springs development
and agriculture -- stood at NT$19.9 billion, the spokesman said, adding that
most hot springs in the country are located in indigenous preservation areas.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that the training classes will be held for nine days in the
Chipen hot spring area in Taitung, eastern Taiwan and in the Taian hot spring
area in the northern county of Miaoli, respectively.</P>
      <P>He added the training courses will be offered free of charge exclusively for
indigenous people and a total of 20 trainees who perform best will have an
opportunity to travel to Japan for advanced study in December.</P>
      <P>The program aims at training participants to deal with both practical and
theoretical aspects of spa industry operations, the spokesman said, adding that
the main appeal of the program is to help trainees acquire the necessary
experience to be successful in spa industry management and operations in a short
period of time and allow them to contribute in the industry in the short term.</P>

      <P>The Cloud Gate Dance Theater of Taiwan again enchanted its audience Saturday,
with a performance of "Wild Cursive" at the National Arts Center in downtown
Ottawa rousing the spectators to a standing ovation lasting five minutes.</P>
      <P>Among other dignitaries watching the performance were Canadian Governor General
Michaelle Jean and her family members. She is de facto head of state serving as
representative of the British Crown, who is also Canada's head of state.</P>
      <P>At the end of the performance, Jean went to the backstage and congratulated Lin
Hwai-min, founder and choreographer of Cloud Gate, and his dancers on their
successful performance.</P>
      <P>Taiwan representative  in Canada David Tawei Lee hosted a reception to enable
Canadian artists and friends, as well as local Chinese community leaders, to
meet with members of Cloud Gate, widely considered as Asia's leading
contemporary dance troupe.</P>
      <P>"Wild Cursive," a lyrical dance with its ideas inspired by Chinese calligraphy,
is the final chapter of a trilogy. Lin created the first part in 2001. To
perform in the show, all dancers must be trained in martial arts, chi kung,
ballet, meditation and Chinese opera movements.</P>
      <P>On a white stage, streams of white paper cascade onto the floor with black ink
pouring from above, seeping onto the paper slowly and almost invisibly.</P>
      <P>The ink feathers and spreads in abstract patterns true to the spirit of chance
as set forth in I-Ching -- the Book of Changes -- creating a kind of "set in
progress" art installation.</P>
      <P>Against and between the layers of paper, the dancers' fluid movement echoes the
serpentine and meandering lines of the ink, underscored by their breathing,
organic vocals and foot stamps as well as a natural soundscape.</P>
      <P>Ottawa was the final leg of Cloud Gate's month-long tour of seven North American
cities that began Sept. 20. The tour took the group to Montreal, Quebec City,

    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition lawmaker's proposal to withhold the budget for the development of
weaponry is nothing other than a means of conceding Taiwan to China, President
Chen Shui-bian said Sunday.</P>
      <P>In response to Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Su Chi's proposal to cut the Ministry
of National Defense's budget for the development of Syongfong II-E missile
system, the president said while visiting a temple in downtown Taipei that Su
made the proposal as if he were not a citizen of the country, but someone eager
to yield the island to China.</P>
      <P>As if it were not bad enough for the country's defense to scuttle the
government's budget for arms purchase from the United States, Chen said that the
opposition, mainly the KMT and the People First Party (PFP) , in the legislature
are trying to cut the Defense MInistry's budget for development of Syongfong
II-E, a missile system needed for the country to defend itself.</P>
      <P>Those who advocate this idea are people who support Beijing's "one China"
principle and nurture the idea of reuniting with China, Chen claimed, urging the
public to guard against them.</P>
      <P>At issue is Su's call, carried in a Sunday newspaper, for the opposition parties
in the legislature to put on hold the Defense Ministry's request for NT$3.8
billion (US$116.54 million) for the mass production of the Syongfong II-E
missiles until the KMT controls the government in next presidential election.</P>
      <P>Noting that Su had "falsely" claimed last week that he had ordered the
development of nuclear weapons, Chen said the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party has advocated a nuclear-free Taiwan ever since its founding in 1986, and
he himself had help exposed the KMT administration's scheme to develop nuclear
weapons twenty years ago.</P>
      <P>In order to show Su's lack of credibility, Chen said that the lawmaker had
claimed in 1992 in his capacity as the chief of the Mainland Affairs Council
under the KMT administration that Taiwan and China had agreed to disagree on
what means "one China", but it was denied afterward by Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's
then-chief negotiator with China.</P>
      <P>As of Sunday, both the KMT and the PFP legislative caucuses seemed to be
hesitant about embracing Su's proposal.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kuo Shu-chun, secretary of the KMT caucus said KMT lawmakers will
consider Su's proposal seriously, adding that there are causes for Su's concerns
that President Chen might use the Syongfong II-E missile, which Su claimed to be
an offensive weapon capable of reaching Shanghai, to engineer an incident across
the Taiwan Strait before the March 22, 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>An anonymous PFP lawmaker said his party opposed the Defense Ministry's NT$340
billion arms purchase budget because the prices Washington charged were
obviously too high, but the NT$3.8 billion budget for the Syongfong II-Es is not
excessive and its cancellation might open his party to public criticism.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou traveled to Taiwan's
southernmost county, Pingtung, Sunday to take part in a ritual event
commemorating the spirit of the Hakka militia "Yimin" whose fidelity and bravery
raised them to the status of divinities some 200 years ago.</P>
      <P>Ma joined some 1,500 Hakka people in a food offering ritual, where he hiked 6
kilometers in Pingtung's Chutien township, carrying two large baskets of food
with a carrying pole across his shoulders.</P>
      <P>In the company of Lee Yung-teh, chairman of the Cabinet-level Hakka Affairs
Council, Chiu Yi-ying, deputy chairwoman of the council, and Tsai Hao, an
independent legislative candidate, Ma finished the "meal offering" hike in
somewhat more than one hour.</P>
      <P>Ma, who addressed everybody in the Pingtung Hakka village in his newly-acquired
Hakka dialect, said he feels honored to have the opportunity to take part in the
Hakka "meal offering" hiking event and is overwhelmed with the spirit
demonstrated by the Hakka people when it comes to commemorating their ancestors.</P>
      <P>The KMT presidential candidate said it was the sixth time that he has taken part
in Hakka "Yimin" activities, adding that he presided over five Yimin festivals
during his stint as Taipei Mayor in the past.</P>
      <P>Topping all Hakka activities is the annual Yimin Festival, which is routinely
observed in Taiwan in every July of the Chinese calendar.</P>
      <P>The "meal offering" hiking was part of a series of Hakka activities to
commemorate their ancestors. The festival originated in the Hsinchu area,
northern Taiwan, to commemorate the late 18th century Hakka militia who
sacrificed their lives to protect their homelands. Hakka men and women secretly
carried meals to the Yimins -- members of the Hakka militia -- so that the armed
volunteers could dedicate themselves to protecting the Hakka people's homeland.</P>
      <P>In late 18th century Taiwan, Hakka settlers from mainland China suffered greatly
from murdering and looting rebel forces. When the ruling Ching Dynasty was
unable to put an end to the insurrection, some 1,300 Hakka volunteers in the
Hsinchu area formed the "Yimin army" to protect their settlements.</P>
      <P>The rebellion was quelled by the joint operations of Ching troops and the Hakka
militia, with severe casualties suffered by the Hakka volunteers. To commemorate
the dead, Hakka families in the region erected a shrine in Hsinpu, Hsinchu in
1790 and the Yimin spirits have been worshipped as local deities ever since.</P>
      <P>The "Yimin beliefs" were so powerful and influential that they were introduced

      <P>The magistrate of the Taipei County, which has been upgraded to the status as a
quasi-municipality on Oct. 1, unlike the chief of a real municipality, doesn't
not has the power to promote police officers in that county the National Police
Agency said Sunday.</P>
      <P>As a quasi-municipality, The agency said in a statement, Taipei County may
increase its budget and the number of its staff members to that of a
municipality, but its chief does not have the power to promote police officers
which remains within the authority of the National Police Agency.</P>
      <P>The statement was issued two days after Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei promoted
140 middle-rank police officers in Taipei County in defiance of opposition from
the Ministry of the Civil Service which was in charge with the employment,
discharge and promotion of the country's civil servants.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Civil Service said the chief of a quasi-municipality does
not have such power although the payments of these police officers are financed
by his government, and any promotions made in this way would be invalid.</P>
      <P>Chou who went on a visit to Singapore Saturday vowed to promote another groups
of police officers after he comes back from Singapore, arguing that he should
have the same power as his counterparts in the municipalities of Taipei and
Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Taipei County, with a population of 3.76 million, is the first of 18 counties in
the country to be upgraded to the status of a quasi-municipality, thanks to a

    <HEADLINE>Defense minister denies U.S. selling Taiwan Tomahawk cruise missiles</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Defense Minister Lee Tien-yu denied categorically a daily newspaper report
Monday that the United States might agree to sell cutting-edge BGM-109 Tomahawk
cruise missiles to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Lee said he had no knowledge about
the allegation published by the Taipei-based China Times Monday that the U.S.
government might consider selling the all-weather submarine or ship-launched
land-attack BGM-109 Tomahawk missile to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The China Times reported that in a bid to discourage Taiwan from continuing
putting money into the research and development of its own land attack cruise
missile, the Hsiung Feng-2E -- the latest version of Taiwan's domestically
developed missile -- the U.S. military authorities might consider selling
Tomahawks to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The proposed sale is aimed at forcing Taiwan to abandon the NT$34.6 billion
(US$1.06 billion) project to develop and mass produce Hsiung Feng-2E missiles,
the daily claimed.</P>
      <P>Lee said the United States has not sold BGM-109 Tomahawk missiles to any other
country.</P>
      <P>He added sarcastically that he is "grateful" that some media outlet has "made
such an excellent arrangement" for Taiwan's military to beef up its defense
capability.</P>
      <P>The Hsiung Feng-2E missile was not showcased during the military display on
Double Ten National Day Oct. 10 because, according to the Ministry of National
Defense, it is still in the development stage.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Military not producing 'blackout bombs': MND official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Ministry of National Defense (MND) official confirmed Monday that Taiwan has
conducted research on graphite bombs, but added that the ministry has no plans
to produce them.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Wu Wei-jung, director of the MND
Armament Bureau, said the research on the non-lethal graphBte  bombs  --
capable  of  disabling  electrical  power infrastructure -- is not aimed at
offense, but is part of a study to find out how serious the damage could be if a
big city like Taipei were to be attacked with graphite bombs, also known as
"blackout bombs."</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks in response to an inquiry by opposition Kuomintang
Legislator Lee Ching-hua, who quoted the United Daily News as reporting Sunday
that the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology -- Taiwan's top arms
research unit --  will begin developing the submunitions at a cost of up to
NT$500 million (US$15.34 million), from next year.</P>
      <P>Should war break out, the bombs would be carried by Hsiung Feng-2E cruise
missiles and used to paralyze the power systems of China's southeastern coastal
cities, according to the report. The bombs work by sprinkling a cloud of
chemically treated carbon fiber over power supplies, causing them to short-
circuit without killing people, it reported.</P>
      <P>Wu said these submunitions were used for the first time in May 1999 as part of
Operation Allied Force strikes against Serbia. Following these attacks, lights
went out over 70 percent of the country.</P>
      <P>Wu stressed that to date, the MND has no plans to produce the graphite bombs,
since their effects are largely confined to targeted electrical power
facilities, with minimal risk of collateral damage.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng said Monday that the county government will not
help in making arrangements for the upcoming U.N. bid torch relay's stop on the
outlying island.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks in response to the recent call by the Sports Affairs
Council for local governments to actively assist in the staging of the round-
the-island torch relay set to kick off Oct. 24 on United Nations Day.</P>
      <P>Calling the U.N. bid torch relay an "election scheme" initiated by the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-led central government with the aim of
winning votes for the party's candidate in next year's presidential election,
Lee stressed that "Kinmen will not dance to that tune."</P>
      <P>Lee said that the decision to not assist in making arrangements for the relay
stop on Kinmen was made after careful deliberation and was not an "act of
impulse."</P>
      <P>Furthermore, many Kinmen residents have expressed their anger at the idea of
holding an event aimed at moving Taiwan down the road torward formal
independence, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>Lee further said that the central government has not come up with a
comprehensive plan for Kinmen's future and that many of the promises made to
Kinmen residents by President Chen Shui-bian have not been fulfilled, including
his promise to make Kinmen into a special administrative region.</P>
      <P>"I've come to realize that all such promises have been made simply because of
election considerations," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Citing the example of DPP presiential candidate Frank Hsieh's promise to ease
restrictions on capital inflows from China and the Mainland Affairs Council
chief's response that such a policy is impossible for the time being, Lee
claimed all such promises are simply "election schemes" in the same way that the
U.N.-bid torch relay is.</P>
      <P>On whether he is concerned that failure to accomodate the torch relay stop in
Kinmen might lead to reprisals from the central government, Lee said that if the
central government were to punish local governments for not taking part in the
relay, it would be just like "punishing the will of the people." adding that
"Only a contemptible government does that."</P>
      <P>The U.N.-bid torch relay is set to kick off at 7 a.m. Tuesday in front of the
Presidential Office on Ketagalan Boulevard in downtown Taipei, with President
Chen leading the pack. Seventeen athletes and celebrities will carry the torch
through 25 counties and cities around the country, including the outlying
islands of Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu. The 1,200-km relay is scheduled to conclude
at 6: 30 p.m. Nov. 3 when the torch is slated to return to the Presidential
office plaza.</P>

nationwide U.N. bid torch relay as scheduled Wednesday, despite outlying Kinmen
County's refusal to collaborate on the event, SAC Deputy Minister Lee Kao-hsiang
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee Kao-hsiang made the remarks after Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng announced
earlier the same day that the county government will not cooperate with the
central government in the torch relay, on the grounds that it is simply an
election gambit to win ballots in next year's Jan.  12 legislative  elections

will not affect the smooth holding of the event, he added.</P>
      <P>The nationwide torch relay is scheduled to begin from Ketagalan Boulevard in
front of the Presidential Office Oct. 24 and will pass through 25 cities and
counties, including the outlying islands of Kinmen, Penghu and Matsu, before
concluding Nov. 3.</P>

      <P>More junior high school students than senior high students in Taipei suffer from
serious stress, according to the results of survey released Monday by the Taipei
City Department of Health.</P>
      <P>The survey on mental health in young students was conducted by the department
earlier in the month among 543 students of a city junior high school and 1,060
students of a city senior high school. Both schools have curricula that are
test-oriented.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 30 percent of the junior high respondents described
themselves as suffering from serious stress, while 28 percent of the senior high
respondents reported serious stress.</P>
      <P>The two figures are both higher than the 20 percent of working people who suffer
serious stress, according to Kao-Wei-chun, the department  official  responsible
for medical care and health management.</P>
      <P>Pressure on students' pursuing higher education at a premium school is widely
believed to be the major source of their stress, according to Kao, who also
assessed that the number of Taipei high school students suffering stress this
year will pose a growth of more than 21,000 over the 2004 figure.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Finance Minister Ho Chih-chin defended Monday the propriety of a Ministry of
Finance (MOF) decision to fund the publicity campaign for the country's bid to
join the United Nations, claiming that such funding "benefits the overall
publicity" of the administrative policy.</P>
      <P>Ho made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan, where several main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) legislators grilled him and other MOF officials over
allegations of excessive government funding for the publicity campaign for the
country's bid to join the U.N. under the name Taiwan and a U.N.-bid referendum
initiated by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The heads of the Central Deposit Insurance Corp., the Bank of Taiwan, the Land
Bank of Taiwan and the Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp. responded that they have
channeled NT$2.5 million (US$76,687) to the Government Information Office (GIO)
to help finance the U.N. bid publicity drive. The executive of the Export-Import
Bank of Republic of China,  meanwhile,  said the bank gave NT$500,000
(US$15,337) to finance the cause.</P>
      <P>According to KMT Legislator Lee Chi-chu, however, the MOF also provided the GIO
with NT$3 million.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Fai Hung-tai accused the MOF of breaching the Budget Law by
misusing its budget.</P>
      <P>Rebutting Fai's accusation, Hsieh Fu-teng, director of the MOF Department of
Accounting, said the allocation was not "misuse." Instead, he said, it can be
digested as regular administrative spending.</P>
      <P>Responding to the KMT lawmakers' accusation, DPP Legislator Lin Wen-lang said
there is nothing wrong with government agencies helping the Executive Yuan to
raise Taiwan's international publicity and competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Once Taiwan's international competitiveness is increased, foreign funds will
naturally flow into the country, which will in turn benefit all members of the
public, Lin claimed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Defense Minister Lee Tien-yu decided to scrap the military's "loving hug" policy
Monday after rebuffing a lawmaker's request to give him a hug at the
legislature.</P>
      <P>Lee made the decision on the spot during an interpellation session at the
Legislative Yuan's National Defense Committee, despite having defended the
policy earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Speaking with reporters prior to the interpellation session, Lee said the
policy, implemented Oct. 1 at basic training camps for enlisted personnel, had
proven effective in terms of alleviating recruits' feelings of separation and
estrangement in their new environment.</P>
      <P>Lee claimed that a great majority of enlisted personnel are happy with  the
policy  and that  only a minority  have  expressed dissatisfaction with it,
adding that he will make adjustments to the policy.</P>
      <P>Under the policy, squad leaders are required to hug each new recruit under his
command and utter the words "brother, I will take care of you, " to which the
recruit must respond by saying, "leader, I respect and love you."</P>
      <P>Lee defended the practice as effective in helping recruits overcome their
feelings of fear and unease with their new boot camp environment.</P>
      <P>During the interpellation  session,  Legislator Lin Yu-fang questioned the
appropriateness of the practice which, the lawmaker claimed, makes many people
feel uncomfortable.</P>
      <P>To make his point,  the lawmaker asked that the minister demonstrate the "loving
hug" by embracing a general who accompanied him to the interpellation session.
The minister refused.</P>
      <P>Keeping the pressure on him, Legislator Lee Ching-hua offered to give the
minister a hug, to which the minister responded by saying that "we are not that
close." He then agreed to scrap the policy altogether.</P>

      <P>The 2007 International Workshop on Emergence Response and Rescue opened Monday
in Taipei for two days of discussions to share experiences on emergency relief
and disaster management and to step up international cooperation in preparation
for future operations.</P>
      <P>The two-day confab, held at the National Rescue Command Center under the
Cabinet, will hear seven lectures, including three by guest speakers from
Canada.</P>
      <P>Timothy P. Armstrong, leader of the Vancouver Urban Search and Rescue Team,
explained the organization and training of his team, which rescued 119 flood
victims in five days of rescue efforts in early September 2005 in areas around
New Orleans, Louisiana, which were devastated by Hurricane Katrina.</P>
      <P>Stephen Svensson discussed his experience in New Orleans as a member of
Vancouver's Urban Search and Rescue team, while Murray S. Day, director of the
Emergency Management Division of the Justice Institute of British Columbia,
talked about Canada's emergency response management system.</P>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Lee Yi-yang awarded citations to 25 people for the
roles they played in search and rescue missions during the past year. Among them
was Chen Hou-chuan, an orthopedist of Taichung Hospital and medical team leader
of Taiwan International Health Action.</P>
      <P>Lee cited statistics showing that from 2002 until the end of September this
year, the National Rescue Command Center conducted 2,414 operations in response
to emergency situations around Taiwan and helped 11,553 people in distress.</P>
      <P>He said that since the National Fire Agency under the Ministry of the Interior
was given the responsibility of managing the National Rescue Command Center, the
center's air rescue abilities have increased considerably,  with the number of
people rescued by helicopter rising by an average of 86 percent per month.</P>

      <P>The Taipei city police commissioner said Monday he will address the
controversial round-the-nation torch relay related to Taiwan's U.N. bid in a
"modest and proper" manner when the event kicks off Wednesday in the capital
city.</P>
      <P>Wang Cho-chun made the remarks in response to questions delivered by city
councilors at the city council.</P>
      <P>How Wang deals with the event, a source of tension between the central
government and the city administration, has become an issue of speculation among
the concerned parties because both the mayor of the city and director-general of
the National Police Agency (NPA) under the Ministry of the Interior are his
superiors.</P>
      <P>Wang said that he will respect the city government's decision to treat the
upcoming relay run as a "political activity, " which was ruled "illegal" after
the organizer, the central government, failed to apply for the city government's
approval under the Assembly and Parade Law which governs such activities.</P>
      <P>Wang indicated that NPA Director-General Hou Yu-ih had called and told him that
the agency considers the upcoming relay run to be a "sporting event."</P>
      <P>No matter whether the planned activity is a sporting event or a march regulated
in the Assembly and Parade Law, Wang said that a traffic maintenance plan is
required for every kind of public activity taking place on the roadways of the
capital city to allow the traffic division to prepare for disruptions.</P>
      <P>Regarding President Chen Shui-bian's decision to take part in the Wednesday
relay run as the first torch holder, Wang said it's the duty of the police to
protect the president in outdoor activities.</P>
      <P>However, if any actions undertaken at the event are deemed to break the Assembly
and Parade Law during the run through the city, Wang said the police will
enforce the law and order the gathering to disband.</P>
      <P>So far, the police commissioner added, his department has not yet outlined a
complete traffic deployment plan for the U.N.-bid torch relay, which is due to
set off 7: 00 a.m. Wednesday from the Presidential Office square in downtown
Taipei and will include the participation of high ranking government officials,
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party presidential candidate, Frank Hsieh, and
his running-mate Su Tseng-chang.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is keen to leverage strong development in its information and
communication technology (ICT) industry to turn the local WiMAX industry into
one of the best in the world, said developers and officials at an international
WiMAX conference Monday.</P>
      <P>The M-Taiwan WiMAX Application Laboratory (MTWAL) recently became the first
application lab to be selected by the WiMAX Forum, according to an announcement
by forum president Ron Resnick at the 2007 WiMAX Forum Taipei Showcase and
Conference.</P>
      <P>The forum is being held in Taipei Oct. 22-23, with 76 companies from all over
the world participating. The MTWAL was established at the Industrial Technology
Research Institute (ITRI)  campus in Hsinshu.</P>
      <P>MTWAL, established to provide an environment in which to create innovative WiMAX
applications, was already in operation ahead of the announcement, with seven
companies and universities testing their applications at the campus, including
Korean company IntroMobile's "NetMirror", Israeli company NDS's "WiMAX TV" and
Rock Mobile's "Mobility Karaoke".</P>
      <P>WiMax, the Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access, is a
telecommunications technology designed to provide wireless data over long
distances in a variety of ways. The WiMax Forum was formed in June 2001 to
promote standardization and interoperability.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  government  has put in a great  deal of effort establishing  the WiMAX
network  over the last three  years, investing over US$664 million (NT$21.8
billion) -- the second highest level of investment in the industry worldwide,
Minister of Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) Minister Chen Ruey-long said,
adding that the MOEA estimates that the total output value of the industry will
reach NT$128 billion.</P>
      <P>In addition to the MTWAL, a WiMAX Forum Certification Laboratory will be
established in Taiwan in November.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the laboratories and showcase couldn't have come to Taiwan
at a better time, said ITRI President Johnsee Lee, who claimed that "this is a
historical opportunity to witness the rapid growth of the WiMAX technology and
applications."</P>
      <P>Lee said Taiwan, which has been recognized by the global WiMAX community as a
leader in the WiMAX ecosystem, finds itself well positioned in the critical
period from 2007-2008, when the industry is expected to take off.</P>
      <P>The showcase features demonstrations by the latest WiMAX system and chipset
vendors, and firsthand insights into emerging end-to-end solutions.</P>

10/22/07  21:39:20

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court revoked Monday a Taipei District Court ruling that
rejected President Chen Shui-bian's request for reclamation of a collection of
documents and articles held by the court in the probes of a "state affairs fund"
misuse case.</P>
      <P>The High Court demanded that the District Court re-examine its previous ruling
and make a new judgment.</P>
      <P>It further said President Chen can appeal again if he disagrees with the
District Court's new ruling.</P>
      <P>The lawyers of President Chen and four defendants in the case -- first lady Wu
Shu-jen and three of Chen's former and incumbent aides -- appealed to the High
Court Oct. 15 after the District Court turned down the presidential request for
the return of the collection in a ruling issued Oct. 5.</P>
      <P>The District Court based its rejection on the grounds that the president's
proclamation of the collection fo documents as "strictly confidential" is
illegal.</P>
      <P>According to the Council of Grand Justices (CGJ) Ruling No. 627 issued June 15,
President Chen is entitled to appeal to the Taiwan High Court over disputes with
the district court or prosecution concerning the exercise of his "state secrets
privilege."</P>
      <P>As the four defendants in the "state affairs fund" case do not have the right to
appeal the District Court ruling on the ownership of the collection of
documents, the High Court ruling said they should not appeal again over the
case.</P>
      <P>The District Court obtained the collection of documents and articles from a
prosecutorial team that indicted the first lady and three other defendants last
November on charges of corruption and forgery for allegedly embezzling NT$14.8
million (US$450,000) from the "state affairs fund, " a special allowance fund
set aside for the president's discretionary use for official purposes. Chen was
named as a "joint perpetrator" in the case, but he was not indicted because of
his immunity from prosecution as prescribed in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The collection consists of invoices, vouchers, magnetic records, written
testimony by concerned individuals and data related to six secret diplomatic
projects from 2002 to last December.</P>
      <P>In line with the CGJ stipulations, the High Court organized a special five-
member tribunal led by a senior chief judge to deal with the president's appeal.</P>
      <P>The president's lawyers have outlined several key reasons for filing the appeal
against the District Court ruling:</P>
      <P>-- In terms of the CGJ constitutionality rulings No. 328 and 419, the
president's "state secrets privilege" is beyond the scrutiny of the judicial
branch because its exercise involves military, diplomacy and national security
affairs.</P>
      <P>-- The CGJ ruling No. 627 handed down June 15 that confirms the president's
"state secrets privilege" does not empower a regular court to examine the
president's proclamation of a document or a diplomatic mission as confidential
that should be kept secret. The practices or precedents set forth in the U.S.
Watergate case could not be employed in President Chen's case as the Watergate
case didn't involve any national security, diplomatic or defense interests.</P>
      <P>-- The CGJ No. 627 ruling clearly states that the president should be given the
opportunity to explain or give supplementary explanations whether national
security and interests are at stake in disclosure of the collection of documents
in question.</P>
      <P>-- Any dispute between the president and the judicial branch over exercise of
their respective powers should be dealt with by the CGJ, not the district court.</P>
      <P>-- The exercise of president's "state secrets privilege" does not restrict to
those prescribed in the Classified National Security Information Protection Act.</P>
      <P>Chen asked for the return of the collection Sept. 6 on the grounds that the
collection were "strictly confidential" information under the protection of the
Classified National Security Information Protection Act and should be kept
secret permanently.</P>
      <P>The president said in his petition that the collection was labeled "strictly
confidential" in line with CGJ Ruling No. 627, which confirms the president's
constitutional right to decide what constitutes a state secret and his right to
refuse disclosure, also known as "state secrets privilege."</P>

      <P>The rivers under the water regulation projects launched by the Soil and Water
Conservation Bureau and the Forestry Bureau under the Council of Agriculture
(COA) over past decades have mostly worsened the situation regarding the
preservation of water and soil, Lai claimed, saying the country remains under
the threat of floods and landslides.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics, the lawmaker said that around 340,000 hectares of original
forest on the island -- an area equivalent to three Yushan national parks -- has
been cleared for agricultural or economic development purposes.</P>
      <P>The deforestation has destroyed local soil and water balances, causing further
landslides where the so-called river regulation projects were carried out, Lai
claimed.</P>
      <P>The legislator suggested that the government focus on land restoration and
review whether or not to allow farming in mountainous areas. She also suggested
that this year's budgets, totalling NT$1.7 billion (US$52.11 million) , be
eliminated for the two COA bureaus, thereby effectively bringing an end to water
regulation and flood control measures, which she described as biologically
detrimental.</P>
      <P>In response, COA Minister Su Jia-chyuan said he agreed with Lai's opinions and
that his council hopes to take further steps to reforest mountainous areas.</P>
      <P>Regarding planned construction projects to regulate river flow, Su said that
what has to be done, must be done, but the COA will review the plans and make
necessary improvements in flood-control planning and operations.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's average labor participation rate for the first nine months reached
58.24 percent, the highest level in nearly 10 years, while the average jobless
rate hit an almost seven-year low of 3.92 percent for the same period,
government tallies showed Monday.</P>
      <P>According  to statistics  made public by the Cabinet-level Directorate General
of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) , Taiwan's average labor
participation rate for the period of January - September this year showed a 0.39
percentage point growth over the previous year's level.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials attributed the rise to more women entering the workplace thanks
to their higher educational levels.</P>
      <P>An average 10.28 million workers were employed each month during the first nine
months of this year, a jump of 195,000, or a 1.94 percent growth, compared to
the year-earlier figure, DGBAS tallies indicated. The figures are taken as a
reflection of steady recovery in Taiwan's job market, DGBAS officials said.</P>
      <P>The country's unemployment rate in September stood at 3.99 percent -- the
equivalent of 429,000 jobless workers -- down 13,000 positions, or 0.1
percentage points, from August.</P>
      <P>But the September jobless rate for university graduates and those with higher
academic diplomas climbed to 4.97 percent -- the highest level in nearly one
year, according to DGBAS statistics. The ratios for senior high school graduates
and those who have only a junior high school or elementary school certificate
stand at 4.49 percent and 2.91 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Last month, some 10.74 million workers were employed across the country, a
decrease of 56,000 month to month, but a noticeable increase of 166,000
positions, or 1.57 percent, over the same month in 2006.</P>

      <P>Police have seized 20,000 counterfeit items of Calvin Klein underwear from a
warehouse in Tainan County, a police spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that officers from the Intellectual Property Rights Police
Team raided the warehouse last week after taking into custody a man in Taipei,
identified by the surname Chen, for selling counterfeit Calvin Klein underwear
through the Internet.</P>
      <P>Chen confessed that all the pirated items he sold online at discount prices came
China, and that he bought the goods from a warehouse in Yungkang township in
Tainan County. He has been referred to the Taipei Prosecutors' Office.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, members of the IPR police team searched the
warehouse and confiscated such a wide array of unopened boxes containing various
sizes of the Chinese contraband that made the warehouse look like a distribution
center.</P>
      <P>The spokesman quoted experts in the retail underwear market as saying that if
sold through the Internet, the 20,000 items of clothing would have resulted in
NT$10 million (US$306,410) in losses to Calvin Klein Co.</P>

      <P>The Internet of the future will present as many opportunities as challenges, all
of which will definitely go beyond anything he imagined in the 1970s, a U.S.
Internet pioneer said in a keynote speech delivered during a conference in
Taipei Monday.</P>
      <P>In the future, one will be seeing a lot of Internet-enabled devices, one will be
buying clothes for oneself in the virtual world with real world cash, and
communicating with the Mars via Internet, said Vint Cerf, an American computer
scientist regarded as one of the founding fathers of the Internet, in the speech
titled "Tracking the Internet into the 21st Century".</P>
      <P>At the same time, the vice president and chief Internet Evangelist of Google
also told thousands of conference attendees that the development of the Internet
faces enormous challenges, including intellectual rights, the semantic web --
also called Web 3.0 -- preserving interpretive programs, operating systems and
hardware.</P>
      <P>With the rapid development of communications technology, such as RFID (Radio-
frequency identification), devices such as refrigerators, picture frames,
telephones, automobiles and clothing will all be Internet-enabled and
dramatically change one's life, he said.</P>
      <P>"You could get e-mail or SMS (Short message service) from your refrigerator, "
he said.</P>
      <P>The best aspect of the future Internet is that it will involve the exploration
of a completely different mode of advertising in which "everything is decided by
the users -- whether they want to watch [the advertisement], what they want to
watch. They will not be forced to watch them," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No major impact on local market if Chinese garments allowed in:MOEA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R. C. Chen said Monday that local textile
industry and related businesses will not sustain major impact if the government
decides to allow Chinese garment imports.</P>
      <P>Chen gave his assurances amid reports that the Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT)
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will hold a cross-agency meeting
Tuesday to weigh whether to permit 54 Chinese garment and low-end textile
products, including men's suits, coats and ladies' dresses, to enter Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the government will not "create an opening for the sake of
opening, " Chen said that the government's top concern when making a decision in
this regard is whether such a move will affect the domestic industry and related
businesses.</P>
      <P>It has been reported that the European Chamber of Commerce Taipei and the
American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei are paying close attention to the matter
as they have long expected such an opening.</P>
      <P>BOFT Deputy Director-General Hsu Chun-fang said later the same day that the
bureau must follow due process before deciding whether to open the domestic
market to Chinese products.</P>
      <P>An opening can only be made if no major negative impact is likely to happen,
either with regards to national security or businesses at home, she explained,
and gave assurance that the BOFT will grant its go-ahead only after it fully
explores opinions within the local textile industry.</P>
      <P>"The BOFT will not okay the opening unless local industry approves of the
measure," she stressed.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's textile industry has increasingly shifted towards the manufacture of
high-tech and high value-added products, the importation of low-end Chinese
goods is not expected to deal a heavy blow to the domestic market, she opined,
adding that if any damage is done in this regard, anti-dumping or other
defensive mechanisms authorized under the World Trade Organization's framework
can be applied to address the ensuing complications.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court revoked Monday a Taipei District Court ruling that
rejected President Chen Shui-bian's request for reclamation of a collection of
documents and articles held by the court in the probes of a "state affairs fund"
misuse case.</P>
      <P>The High Court said the District Court should first determine whether President
Chen Shui-bian himself or the Presidential Office secretary-general is
authorized to make such a request under the Presidential Office organization
law.</P>
      <P>As the status or identity of the applicant is closely related with the laws to
be used in the case, the High Court ruling said the District Court should not
have made a judgment on the Chen's request before it had deliberated whether
Chen has the right to make such a request in the first place.</P>
      <P>If Chen is not the suitable applicant, the High Court ruling said the District
Court just needs to turn down the request and need not bother to check whether
Chen is eligible to proclaim the documents as "strictly confidential" in terms
of his "state secret privilege."</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the High Court revoked the District Court's previous
ruling and demanded the District court mete out a new judgment. or</P>
      <P>The lawyers of President Chen and four defendants in the case -- first lady Wu
Shu-jen and three of Chen's former and incumbent aides -- appealed to the High
Court Oct. 15 after the District Court turned down the presidential request for
the return of the collection in a ruling issued Oct. 5.</P>
      <P>The District Court based its rejection on the grounds that the president's
proclamation of the collection fo documents as "strictly confidential" is
illegal.</P>
      <P>According to the Council of Grand Justices (CGJ) Ruling No. 627 issued June 15,
President Chen is entitled to appeal to the Taiwan High Court over disputes with
the district court or prosecution concerning the exercise of his "state secrets
privilege."</P>
      <P>As the four defendants in the "state affairs fund" case do not have the right to
appeal the District Court ruling on the ownership of the collection of
documents, the High Court ruling said they should not appeal again over the
case.</P>
      <P>The District Court obtained the collection of documents and articles from a
prosecutorial team that indicted the first lady and three other defendants last
November on charges of corruption and forgery for allegedly embezzling NT$14.8
million (US$450,000) from the "state affairs fund, " a special allowance fund
set aside for the president's discretionary use for official purposes. Chen was
named as a "joint perpetrator" in the case, but he was not indicted because of
his immunity from prosecution as prescribed in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The collection consists of invoices, vouchers, magnetic records, written
testimony by concerned individuals and data related to six secret diplomatic
projects from 2002 to last December.</P>
      <P>In line with the CGJ stipulations, the High Court organized a special five-
member tribunal led by a senior chief judge to deal with the president's appeal.</P>
      <P>The president's lawyers have outlined several key reasons for filing the appeal
against the District Court ruling:</P>
      <P>-- In terms of the CGJ constitutionality rulings No. 328 and 419, the
president's "state secrets privilege" is beyond the scrutiny of the judicial
branch because its exercise involves military, diplomacy and national security
affairs.</P>
      <P>-- The CGJ ruling No. 627 handed down June 15 that confirms the president's
"state secrets privilege" does not empower a regular court to examine the
president's proclamation of a document or a diplomatic mission as confidential
that should be kept secret. The practices or precedents set forth in the U.S.
Watergate case could not be employed in President Chen's case as the Watergate
case didn't involve any national security, diplomatic or defense interests.</P>
      <P>-- The CGJ No. 627 ruling clearly states that the president should be given the
opportunity to explain or give supplementary explanations whether national
security and interests are at stake in disclosure of the collection of documents
in question.</P>
      <P>-- Any dispute between the president and the judicial branch over exercise of
their respective powers should be dealt with by the CGJ, not the district court.</P>
      <P>-- The exercise of president's "state secrets privilege" does not restrict to
those prescribed in the Classified National Security Information Protection Act.</P>
      <P>Chen asked for the return of the collection Sept. 6 on the grounds that the
collection were "strictly confidential" information under the protection of the
Classified National Security Information Protection Act and should be kept
secret permanently.</P>
      <P>The president said in his petition that the collection was labeled "strictly
confidential" in line with CGJ Ruling No. 627, which confirms the president's
constitutional right to decide what constitutes a state secret and his right to
refuse disclosure, also known as "state secrets privilege."</P>

    <HEADLINE>District Court ruling on 'state affairs fund' documents revoked</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.22  (CNA)
10/23/07  10:54:02
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court revoked Monday a Taipei District Court ruling that
rejected President Chen Shui-bian's request to reclaim a collection of documents
and articles held by the court in the probes of a "state affairs fund" misuse
case.</P>
      <P>The High Court said the District Court should first determine whether President
Chen Shui-bian himself or the Presidential Office secretary-general is
authorized to make such a request under the Presidential Office organization
law.</P>
      <P>As the laws to be used in the case depends on the status or identity of the
applicant, the High Court ruling said the District Court should not have made a
judgment on the Chen's request before it had deliberated whether Chen has the
right to make such a request in the first place.</P>
      <P>If Chen is not the suitable applicant, the High Court ruling said the District
Court just needs to turn down the request and need not bother to check whether
Chen is eligible to proclaim the documents as "strictly confidential" in terms
of his "state secret privilege."</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the High Court revoked the District Court's previous
ruling and demanded the District court mete out a new judgment.</P>
      <P>The lawyers of President Chen and four defendants in the case -- first lady Wu
Shu-jen and three of Chen's former and incumbent aides -- appealed to the High
Court Oct. 15 after the District Court turned down the presidential request for
the return of the collection in a ruling issued Oct. 5.</P>
      <P>The District Court based its rejection on the grounds that the president's
proclamation of the collection fo documents as "strictly confidential" is
illegal.</P>
      <P>According to the Council of Grand Justices (CGJ) Ruling No. 627 issued June 15,
President Chen is entitled to appeal to the Taiwan High Court over disputes with
the district court or prosecution concerning the exercise of his "state secrets
privilege."</P>
      <P>As the four defendants in the "state affairs fund" case do not have the right to
appeal the District Court ruling on the ownership of the collection of
documents, the High Court ruling said they should not appeal again over the
case.</P>
      <P>The District Court obtained the collection of documents and articles from a
prosecutorial team that indicted the first lady and three other defendants last
November on charges of corruption and forgery for allegedly embezzling NT$14.8
million (US$450,000) from the "state affairs fund, " a special allowance fund
set aside for the president's discretionary use for official purposes. Chen was
named as a "joint perpetrator" in the case, but he was not indicted because of
his immunity from prosecution as prescribed in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The collection consists of invoices, vouchers, magnetic records, written
testimony by concerned individuals and data related to six secret diplomatic
projects from 2002 to last December.</P>
      <P>In line with the CGJ stipulations, the High Court organized a special five-
member tribunal led by a senior chief judge to deal with the president's appeal.</P>
      <P>The president's lawyers have outlined several key reasons for filing the appeal
against the District Court ruling:</P>
      <P>-- In terms of the CGJ constitutionality rulings No. 328 and 419, the
president's "state secrets privilege" is beyond the scrutiny of the judicial
branch because its exercise involves military, diplomacy and national security
affairs.</P>
      <P>-- The CGJ ruling No. 627 handed down June 15 that confirms the president's
"state secrets privilege" does not empower a regular court to examine the
president's proclamation of a document or a diplomatic mission as confidential
that should be kept secret. The practices or precedents set forth in the U.S.
Watergate case could not be employed in President Chen's case as the Watergate
case didn't involve any national security, diplomatic or defense interests.</P>
      <P>-- The CGJ No. 627 ruling clearly states that the president should be given the
opportunity to explain or give supplementary explanations whether national
security and interests are at stake in disclosure of the collection of documents
in question.</P>
      <P>-- Any dispute between the president and the judicial branch over exercise of
their respective powers should be dealt with by the CGJ, not the district court.</P>
      <P>-- The exercise of president's "state secrets privilege" does not restrict to
those prescribed in the Classified National Security Information Protection Act.</P>
      <P>Chen asked for the return of the collection Sept. 6 on the grounds that the
collection were "strictly confidential" information under the protection of the
Classified National Security Information Protection Act and should be kept
secret permanently.</P>
      <P>The president said in his petition that the collection was labeled "strictly
confidential" in line with CGJ Ruling No. 627, which confirms the president's
constitutional right to decide what constitutes a state secret and his right to
refuse disclosure, also known as "state secrets privilege."</P>

      <P>The Taipei city government has approved a parade and public assembly application
by the organizers of a nationwide U.N. bid torch relay slated to kick off Oct.
24 in the city, officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The application was filed Monday afternoon by the Chinese Taipei Road Running
Association (CTRRA) on behalf of the Sports Affairs Council (SAC), according to
Huang Ching-fu, chief of the Taipei City Police Department's Peace Preservation
Division.</P>
      <P>Although it is usually required that such an application be filed at least six
days beforehand, the department nevertheless gave favorable consideration to the
case and granted the permit Monday night for the holding of the event, Huang
said.</P>
      <P>As the event will not include any rallies, the organizers are not required to
apply for a right-of-way permit from the city government or put forth any
traffic control plans, he said, adding that the department will dispatch police
to maintain order and assist with traffic control along the way, he said.</P>
      <P>Over the previous few days, the city government and the SAC had been engaged in
a dispute over whether the torch relay -- intended to promote the country's bid
to join the United Nations -- is a "political activity" or a "sports event."</P>
      <P>The SAC, which considered the torch relay a "sports event, " only notified the
city government of its plan to hold the activity without applying for any parade
or public assembly permit.</P>
      <P>However, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin insisted that the event is a "political
activity" for which a permit from the city government is required. He said that
holding the activity without a permit would be unlawful.</P>
      <P>Also Tuesday, SAC Deputy Chairman Lee Kao-hsiang said that the council still
defines the torch delay as a sports event and that it asked the CTRRA to help
file the application in order to try to end the dispute.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, CTRRA Deputy Secretary-General Ho Li-chiung explained that the
association is not a co-organizer of the torch relay but is only assisting the
SAC with recruiting athletes to run in the activity.</P>
      <P>According to Ho, the application for the parade and public assembly permit for
the torch relay has set a precedent, because no permit has ever been required
for any of the road running events that the association has held in the past.</P>
      <P>The 1,200-km relay, which will cover all 25 counties and cities around the
country, is expected to take 11 days to complete.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian is expected to run the opening leg, after the torch is
lit at 7 a.m. Oct. 24 on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that it would be a dereliction of duty on
his part if he were to fail to push for the country's bid for U.N. membership
under the name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks during an interview with Happy Radio based in the
southern Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>"The push for joining the world body is the mission and the responsibility of
the nation's leader and a way to propel Taiwan onto the world stage," the
president said.</P>
      <P>"If I cannot take care of the name of the country," and let it be "replaced or

unseating the People's Republic of China and Mongolia from the world body, Chen
claimed.</P>
      <P>The president said he is confident that a DPP-initiated proposal will be passed
when it is put to a vote alongside the presidential election in March 22, 2008.</P>
      <P>He estimated that over 8 million people will turn out and cast ballots in favor
of the proposal, which he said will "mark the public consensus on the U.N. bid."</P>
      <P>Under the current Referendum Law, a proposal will be considered passed if the
referendum turnout rate exceeds half of all eligible voters and if 50 percent of
those who cast ballots vote in favor of the proposal.</P>
      <P>In the 2004 presidential election, two proposals initiated by President Chen
were put to a referendum -- one on purchasing more missiles to counter the
military threat from China, and the other on engaging in dialogue with China --
failed to pass. Although 90 percent of those who cast ballots in the referendum
voted in favor of the proposals, the referendum turnout rate was only 45 percent
of all eligible voters.</P>
      <P>The president also talked about the campaign strategy for the coming
presidential election, reiterating that his cooperation with Frank Hsieh, the
DPP's presidential candidate, will ensure victory for the party in the election.
Chen assumed the chairmanship of the party last week.</P>

      <P>A nationwide torch relay promoting the country's bid to join the United Nations
is scheduled to begin Wednesday in Taipei City, with President Chen Shui-bian
running the opening leg, Sports Affairs Council (SAC) officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>After the torch is lit Wednesday morning, the president will run along the
Ketagelan Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office to Jingfu Gate at the
boulevard's cross section with Zhongshan South Road, according to SAC Deputy
Chairman Lee Kao-hsiang.</P>
      <P>Running behind Chen will be a team comprised of Vice President Annette Lu,
athlete representatives who will run in the relay as well as Cabinet members and
citizens who have volunteered to take part, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Upon arrival at Jingfu Gate, the president will pass on the torch to several
athletes who will carry on with the run along Zhongshan South Road, Zhongxiao
East Road, Academia Road and Nankang Road to Hsichih, Taipei County, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The 1,200 km relay, covering 25 counties and cities around the country, is set
to be completed in 11 days, with the torch expected back in Taipei City Nov. 3,
according to the itinerary released by the SAC.</P>
      <P>Also Tuesday,  ruling  Democratic  Progressive  Party (DPP) Secretary-General
Cho Jung-tai urged the public to take an active part in the event regardless of
their political, ethnic or religious backgrounds to show their support for the
U.N. bid.</P>
      <P>Senior executives and staff members of the party will also participate in the
event, Cho said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP presidential candidate Frank Hsieh, who only recently recovered
from a leg injury, will join the opening run at a point located 200 meters in
front of Jingfu Gate, according to Hsieh's campaign aides.</P>
      <P>The torch relay is one of the largest-scale events organized by the DPP
administration to promote its bid to apply to join the United Nations under the
name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Not wishing to let the DPP dominate the issue, the opposition Kuomintang will
Wednesday launch a nationwide cycling tour to promote the party's drive calling
for the restoration of the Republic of China's membership in the United Nations.</P>

      <P>The World Health Organization (WHO) should resume direct engagement with Taiwan
to prevent the appearance of any holes in the global epidemic control network,
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) urged in a press release Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The MOFA made the appeal after the WHO's International Food Safety Authorities
Network (INFOSAN) skipped Taiwan and instead asked China to inform Taiwan of the
contamination of an outbound shipment of green corn from Thailand in September
that resulted in a 10-day delay in Taiwan receiving the information.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time that the WHO has failed to engage Taiwan directly.</P>
      <P>"We protest the WHO's snub and urge the international community to face squarely
the flaw of Taiwan's  exclusion  from  the International Health Regulations
(IHR) mechanism and hammer out a remedy by resuming direct contact with Taiwan,
" the MOFA said in the press statement.</P>
      <P>The ministry also condemned China for repeatedly putting pressure on the WHO to
refrain from direct engagement with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Dismissing as a "sheer lie" China's claims that Taiwan is part of the People's
Republic of China and that its IHR implementation covers Taiwan, the ministry
said the Thai green corn case clearly indicates that China does not care about
the Taiwan people's health at all.</P>
      <P>The fact that China didn't inform Taiwan of the contamination of the Thai green
corn until 10 days after it received the notice from the INFOSAN Sept. 12 is yet
further proof of China's lack of concern for the health rights of the people of
Taiwan, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>Besides instructing Taiwan's representative office in Geneva to lodge a formal
protest with the WHO over the incident, the ministry also called on the world
health regulatory body to address the problems resulting from its failure to
include Taiwan in its IHR disease and epidemic control mechanism simply because
of China's opposition.</P>
      <P>Under Beijing's pressure, the WHO secretly signed a memorandum of understanding
with China in 2005 under which the WHO agrees to avoid direct engagement with
Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Massive quantities of locally grown vegetables will enter the market at the
beginning of November to help ease weeks of high vegetable prices, Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Vegetable prices in local market have risen due to crop damages caused by
Typhoon Krosa which hit Taiwan earlier this month.</P>
      <P>In order to minimize the typhoon's impact on vegetable prices, the government
has continued releasing frozen, cold stored, and imported vegetable stocks to
provide a stable supply and meet market demand, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang suggested consumers buy root stocks instead of leafy vegetables before
locally grown vegetables enter the market in early November.</P>
      <P>Council of Agriculture (COA) Chairman Su Jia-chyuan said the COA will craft
measures to lower vegetable wholesale prices to less than NT$50 (US$1.53) per kg
within one week while it continues providing frozen and important vegetables to
the market.</P>
      <P>A spokesman of the Taipei Agricultural Products Marketing Co. said wholesale
price in Taipei area for Tuesday was NT$50.91 per kg, which was cheaper than
Monday's figure of NT$52.6.</P>
      <P>Autumn is the harvest period for most vegetables, the spokesman said, adding
that the wholesale market's vegetable quantity for Tuesday reached 1,052 tons,
with the prices of some vegetables, such as water spinach, celery, okra, and
loofah showing an obvious decline.</P>

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Tuesday that there should be "effective
management" of medical professionals relocating to China, saying that relevant
laws and regulations should address the issue.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks when fielding questions in the Legislative Yuan
amid reports that Chang Kung Memorial Hospital, a national-level hospital, will
open a branch in Xiamen in southeastern China's Fujian province next month.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that the guiding principle will be safeguarding the health of the
Taiwanese people, saying that the Department of Health (DOH) should learn more
about how much medical equipment and how many professionals of Chang Kung
hospital will be relocating to China.</P>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) , the nation's China policy charting agency,
should also map out a policy to help manage the issue, the premier said.</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Hou Sheng-mou said that out of humanitarian concern, medical
professionals need not to seek prior approval from the government to relocate to
China.</P>
      <P>But he said  that  the distribution  of Taiwan's  medical professionals and the
habits of Taiwan people seeking medical treatment should not be affected.</P>
      <P>"A massive relocation of medical professionals may impact medical quality, " he
noted, adding that the DOH will discuss the matter with the MAC.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairman Chen Ming-tong said that if Taiwan can produce an oversupply of
medical doctors, then there will be no problem with a number of them going to
China or anywhere else.</P>
      <P>But if the supply falls short of demand, then the health of Taiwan people should
be given a priority, Chen added.</P>
      <P>He said that this is not about national security, but the health of Taiwan's
people.</P>
      <P>The question is how many medical professionals will relocate and whether there
will be an impact on the quality of medical care, adding that "if there is no
impact, then there will be no regulation. But if there is, of course, there will
be regulation, " adding that this is the gist of the government's China policy

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that the presidential poll early next year
is extremely critical to Taiwan's future because it will present voters with an
option between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in an exclusive  interview  with a Kaohsiung-based radio
station.</P>
      <P>Expressing his strong belief that a "Taiwan-centric" identity will trounce the
"greater China" notion in the March 22 presidential election, Chen said that
although Taiwan is small in size, it is capable of providing protection for the
many Taiwanese businessmen with operations in China.</P>
      <P>Chen accused Vincent Siew, vice presidential candidate of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) on the party's ticket with former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, of
forswearing a pro-Taiwan stance by promoting a cross-Taiwan Strait common
market.</P>
      <P>Such a one-China oriented common market would endanger Taiwan's economic
lifeline, he said, arguing that the economic integration of Taiwan and China
would lead to the political unification of the two sides.</P>
      <P>The coming presidential election will present a choice between Taiwan and China,
Chen said, urging the public to enthusiastically take part in the round-the-
nation torch relay for Taiwan's U.N. membership bid that will kick off Wednesday
and run through Nov. 3.</P>
      <P>The president also elaborated on his doubling as chairman of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), and described his role in the next
presidential poll as that of an auxiliary helping Frank Hsieh, the DPP's

      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of Health Tuesday
blasted Beijing's delay in informing Taiwan of an outbreak of food contamination
involving Thailand-grown baby corn, calling such behavior "bullying."</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director General Shih Wen-yi denounced China as a "bully" in response
to media inquiries following news reports disclosing the delay. China said it
was informed by the World Health Organization (WHO) Sept. 12 that the baby corn
exported by Thailand's PDI Trading Co. were suspected of having been
contaminated by Shigella bacteria, which can affect the human digestion system.</P>
      <P>However, instead of informing Taiwan of the suspected outbreak directly, the WHO
requested that China convey the intelligence to Taiwan. It has been revealed
that Beijing did not do so until Sept. 21, when it sent afax to the CDC to
inform them of the matter, according to the reports.</P>
      <P>Under International Health Regulations passed in 2005 by the World Health
Assembly, the WHO's decision-making body, Shih said that the global group is
obliged to convey to its "focal points" messages concerning disease outbreaks,
toxic chemical substances, and the shipment of toxic organic substances, such as
bacteria-contaminated baby corn.</P>
      <P>China is one of the WHO's focal points but Taiwan is not, because China claimed
it is capable of caring for the health of the Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>Shih complained that this is the reason why the WHO failed to inform Taiwan
directly of the alleged contamination immediately following initial reports, and
that this delay placed the health of the Taiwanese people under threat.</P>
      <P>Shih pointed to China's responses to periodic reports of cases of human H5N1
avian influenza infection as examples of its reluctance to pass on information
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Each time, an hour or two before Beijing held a press conference to announce a
new outbreak of the deadly avian flu, the CDC would receive a written message
from its Chinese counterpart, Shih said, noting that the content of the written
messages did not differ from those Beijing provided to the media, and that these
messages "didn't help the country's quarantine efforts at all."</P>
      <P>"That is the way China takes care of the Taiwanese people, " Shih complained.</P>
      <P>According to the CDC, it has proved that the problematic baby corn were not
shipped to Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The passage of a referendum on applying to join the United Nations under the
name Taiwan will encourage the country's diplomatic allies to provide stronger
support for its U.N. bid, Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Huang said the government has opted to use the name Taiwan because the country's
official name, the Republic of China, is acceptable only by its diplomatic
allies, but not by international organizations and countries with no diplomatic
ties with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government has been striving to expand the country's foreign
relations, Huang said it is possible that the passage of the referendum could
help the country establish formal ties with more countries.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks during an interpellation session in the Legislative Yuan,
when asked if the passage of the referendum would scare off the country's
diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>While the country has tried since 1993 to have the United Nations consider the
issue of its representation, this year for the first time it applied to join the
world body under the name Taiwan. However, as on previous occasions, the issue
of Taiwan's membership application was excluded from the agenda of the 62nd
session of the General Assembly.</P>
      <P>Determined to continue the drive, the DPP is pushing for a referendum on whether
to apply to join the United Nations under the name Taiwan, which is expected to
be held alongside the March 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The United States has expressed strong opposition to the planned referendum on
the grounds that the apparent pursuit of a name change in the referendum makes
it appear to be a step towards changing the cross-Taiwan Strait status quo.</P>
      <P>Calling the referendum initiative a "needlessly provocative action, " U.S.
officials have warned that such moves could scare away potential friends who

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang condemned  China Tuesday for its
pressuring  the World Health Organization (WHO) to refrain from engaging Taiwan
directly.</P>
      <P>Huang issued the condemnation after the WHO failed to inform Taiwan directly of
the suspected contamination of an outbound shipment of green corn from Thailand
last month and instead passed the message first to China, which resulted in a
10-day delay in Taiwan receiving the information.</P>
      <P>Noting that China's delay in informing Taiwan of the possible contamination of
the Thai green corn is further proof of its lack of concern  of Taiwan  people's
health  rights,  Huang said the international  community should face squarely to
the flaw and injustice of Taiwan's exclusion from the WHO-sponsored
International Health Regulation (IHR) mechanism.</P>
      <P>According  to Ministry  of Foreign Affairs spokesman  Wang Chien-yeh, the WHO's
International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) informed all of its
member countries Sept. 12 of suspected bacteria contamination of a shipment of
green corn exported by a Thai trading company.</P>
      <P>Because of China's obstruction, Taiwan has been shut out of the WHO after it
lost its U.N. seat in 1971. In the past, the WHO used to inform Taiwan of
important global health and disease information via the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) under its Cabinet-level Department of Health. But this time
around, the WHO skipped such a direct communications channel and instead asked
China's CDC to inform its Taiwanese counterpart. The Chinese authorities didn't
inform Taiwan's CDC until Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>"The WHO owes Taiwan an explanation why it didn't directly inform Taiwan of the
suspected Thai green corn contamination, " Wang said, adding that the WHO's
abrupt change in its communication mode has left a gap in its global disease and
epidemic prevention and control network.</P>
      <P>Lin Yung-lo, director of the MOFA's Department of International Organizations,
said the ministry  has directed  the country's representative office in Geneva
to lodge a protest with the WHO. However, he said, the WHO has so far not made
any response to Taiwan's protest.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lin said the MOFA has also informed Taiwan's diplomatic allies and
other important countries around the world, including the United States, the
European Union and Japan, of the latest development in the WHO handling of
issues regarding Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin said the MOFA has reminded major world powers that the WHO's arbitrary
placement of its communication channel with Taiwan under its dialogue mechanism
with China implies that "Taiwan is part of China", a claim that does not conform
with their basic stance or policy toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the wake of this incident, Lin said the MOFA will continue monitoring
developments in China's and WHO's dealing with Taiwan and will step up
consultations with major world power on relevant issues.</P>
      <P>Under China's pressure, the WHO secretly signed a memorandum of understanding
with China in 2005 under which the WHO promises to refrain from direct
engagement with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to MOFA officials, the WHO's failure to engage Taiwan directly
violates the spirit of the IHR which took effect June 15, 2007 to lay out a new
framework to better manage its collective defenses against acute public health
risks and contribute  to enhancing  national,  regional and international
public health security.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is not a WHO member, it has voluntarily abided by all IHR
requirements. Moreover, Lin said, major countries, such as the United States,
Japan and many EU member states, have promised to offer Taiwan meaningful
participation in IHR activities.</P>

      <P>However, the newspaper stated that China had delayed informing Taiwan for 10
days, and even then failed to provide complete information to Taiwan's health
authorities.</P>
      <P>Lo said China intentionally blocked the communication channel between Taiwan and
the WHO and deliberately delayed relaying the information, providing obvious
evidence that China is not trustworthy on health issues and possesses neither
the right nor the capability to protect the health and safety of Taiwan's
people.</P>
      <P>The TSU might respond by initiating a campaign urging each Taiwanese citizen to
write a letter to the WHO denouncing China's deception, Lo went on.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU opposes imports of China-made garments</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) threatened Tuesday to block the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) if it fails to swiftly apply the brakes to a
plan to allow imports of garments made in China to enter the domestic market.</P>
      <P>TSU legislative caucus whip Lo Chih-ming issued the warning at a Legislative
Yuan news conference.</P>
      <P>According to Lo, the TSU is firmly opposed to such an opening and will not rule
out the possibility of mobilizing workers from the domestic textile industry to
seal off and paralyze the MOEA, and to demand that Minister Steve R. L. Chen
step down should the ministry refuse to scrap the plan.</P>
      <P>The livelihoods of more than 100,000 local workers would be hit hard if the MOEA
bows to foreign pressure and approves the opening, Lo said.</P>
      <P>It has been reported that the European Chamber of Commerce Taipei and the
American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei are very concerned about the issue as
they have long expected such an opening.</P>
      <P>TSU lawmaker Liao Pen-yen urged the MOEA to rein in those expectations and
argued that they would freeze the ministry's budget or take other actions to
frustrate the opening.</P>
      <P>According to TSU lawmaker Lin Chih-chia,  Taiwan's textile industry would be
extinguished if garments manufactured in China are allowed to enter the home
market. "Taiwan's traditional industry has had enough, " he complained, pointing
to the local shoe-making and toweling sectors which have been squeezed out of
the business due to large amounts of Chinese imports in the home market.</P>
      <P>Chen said a day earlier that his ministry would not rashly approve the opening
before the opinions of local industry are fully vetted. The government's top
concern in reaching a decision on an opening is whether or not it will
negatively impact local industry, he said.</P>
      <P>Echoing Chen's remarks, officials of the MOEA's Bureau of Foreign Trade said
that the domestic textile sector is not expected to be majorly impacted as it
has succeeded  in shifting toward the manufacture of high-tech and value-added
goods.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of National Defence (MND) has announced that it will ask boot camp
squad leaders to welcome new recruits with a handshake rather than giving them a
hug.</P>
      <P>The announcement came Monday after several legislators questioned Defense
Minister Lee Tien-yu about the military's "loving hug" policy during an
interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan's National Defense Committee
earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Lee first defended the policy as aimed at soothing the new soldiers' feelings of
unease in the new environment, but later promised to scrap the policy.</P>
      <P>According to a press release issued by the MND later in the day, the ministry
said it had conducted a careful assessment before implementing the "loving hug"
policy Oct. 1.</P>
      <P>The press release said that most of the new recruits accepted the "loving hug",
while only "a handful" were "not used to being hugged" or were "too shy for
hugging" as some media reported.</P>
      <P>As a result, the ministry has decided to replace the "loving hug" policy with a
handshake starting Monday, the press release concluded.</P>

      <P>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has announced that two
products manufactured in Taiwan, a bicycle and a children's gymnastic balance
beam, should be recalled due to safety concerns, Taiwan's Consumer Protection
Commission Council (CPCC) said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the CPCC,  the U.S.  Consumer Product Safety Commission issued the
notice to Taiwan's representative office in the U.S. Oct. 18, saying that some
2,400 "Kidnastics Balance Beams", manufactured in Taiwan, have been recalled due
to its violation of lead paint standards,  while 45 "Rocky Mountain-Solo
Bicycles" fabricated in Taiwan have been recalled due to a possible fall hazard
to consumers as its head tube can become detached from the rest of the frame.</P>
      <P>The children's gymnastic balance beam, measuring 72-inches x 4- inches x
1/2-inch with a blue vinyl cover, has a yellow Kidnastics logo printed on its

      <P>The number of people suffering from acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis -- known
locally as pink eye disease -- in the southern city of Chiayi, the area of
Taiwan worst-hit by the outbreak, is declining, Chiayi City Director of Health
Sun Shu-jung said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A total of 157 elementary and junior high school students in the city were
reported to be infected as of Tuesday. The number marks a significant drop in
comparison with the peak of the outbreak recorded Oct. 5 with 477 cases, Sun
said.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the drop in the number of new patients, Sun added, a Department of
Health order to submit daily reports on the outbreak has been lifted from the
city.</P>
      <P>In addition to Chiayi City, other affected areas include Taipei city and county,
as well as Yunlin and Chiayi counties.</P>
      <P>Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is characterized by sudden onset of painful,
swollen, red eyes, with conjunctival hemorrhaging and excessive tearing. The
disease has been noted throughout tropical regions.</P>

      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will launch a round-the-nation bicycle tour
Wednesday in downtown Taipei to solicit public support for its bid to have
Taiwan return to the United Nations under the name "Republic of China, " a KMT
spokeswoman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lai Su-ju, the director of the KMT's department of cultural and information
affairs made the announcement at a press conference on the activity, which she
noted will be held simultaneously with the National Sports Council-sponsored
torch relay promoting the U.N. bid under the name "Taiwan, " and will follow a
route similar to the government's event.</P>
      <P>Lai said the KMT will try to avoid clashes with the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party when the two separate runs are underway because the main goal
of the bike tour is to publicize their belief that "people in the country are
suffering economic hardship."</P>
      <P>At the press conference the KMT unveiled the theme, "Fighting for People's
Livelihood, " for its round-Taiwan bicycle tour by having a five-year-old  girl
riding on a bicycle  appear at the press conference, spelling out the lines:
"All prices have been hiked! I already carry debts before I can go to work."</P>
      <P>KMT Culture and Communications Committee Chairman Yang Tu said he hopes the
planned bike tour will awaken the ruling party from its dreams of a successful
U.N. bid to the reality that people around island are suffering because the
country's economy has worsened over the past seven years.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT, the party's presidential candidate, former KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou, will lead the tour when it kicks off at the National Taiwan Democracy
Memorial Hall, formerly known as Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Lai stressed the tour will take place on roads outlined by the police, and that
the KMT will also advise the participants to refrain from coming into conflict
with those joining the government's torch relay.</P>

      <P>The 2007 Taiwan Coffee Festival is being held in Gukeng township,  Yunlin
County,  with various coffee-related activities and entertainment programs.</P>
      <P>The annual festival, now in its fifth year, opened Oct. 13 and will run for
three weeks until Nov. 4. The event, sponsored by the Yunlin county government
and organized by the Gukeng township administration, is intended to promote and
market Gukeng's chief agricultural product -- coffee.</P>
      <P>Farmers in Gukeng have been growing coffee for more than three centuries, but
few people are aware of Taiwanese coffee, as most of the beans are exported.</P>
      <P>In recent years, as a result of changing lifestyles, coffee drinking has become
more popular in Taiwan, and in 2003, the Gukeng township head saw an opportunity
to revive the local economy and launched the annual coffee festival.</P>
      <P>Main events in the 2007 festival include an evaluation of locally produced
coffee beans by international experts, a demonstration by baristi and culinary
school students to produce their best free pour art, a coffee bean roasting
contest and a weekend coffee bean market.</P>
      <P>On weekends during the festival, visitors are entertained with live music
performances while they sip a cup of genuine Taiwanese coffee in one of Gukeng's
coffee shops.</P>
      <P>There are also two exhibitions, allowing visitors to view and buy local
agricultural products and handicrafts made by prison inmates.</P>
      <P>A group wedding will take place along Gukeng's two-kilometer "green tunnel" Oct.
27 to wed 150 couples from Yunlin County.</P>

      <P>A total of 40 ICDF long-term volunteers for overseas service have just completed
a six-week training program to help them adjust to their overseas lives and will
soon depart for various developing countries to serve in a number of different
fields.</P>

impoverished countries, is entering its 11th year of sending volunteers overseas
and has already sent 263 volunteers abroad, including both long-term and short-

      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Steve R.L. Chen's participation in a torch relay
promoting the country's bid to join the United Nations shows Chen's support of

      <P>Chen and Minister of Finance Ho Chih-chin said at the Legislative Yuan that same
day that they will take part in the government's round-the-nation U.N.  bid
torch relay scheduled to begin the following day in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Responding to opposition Kuomintang Legislator Lee Chia-chin's questions on the
justification of the two ministers' participation, Chang said the Executive
Yuan has approved  Cabinet members' participation in the activity as long as it
is during their personal time.</P>
      <P>Replying to Lee's challenge that Chen should spend more time improving Taiwan's
economy instead of taking part in the torch relay, Chang claimed that the
government's bid to join the United Nations is "closely related" to the economy.</P>
      <P>He explained that the Republic of China's withdrawal from the U.N. in 1971
resulted in its dropping out of international financial organizations like the
World Bank,  thus losing many business opportunities.</P>

      <P>The Bureau of Foreign Trade under the Ministry of Economic Affairs has decided
to postpone a decision on whether to permit imports of 54 items of China-made
garments, a trade official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu Hsin-hua,  deputy  director  of the  bureau,  said  an inter-ministry
meeting scheduled  for that day to review the restrictions on imports of these
garments had been canceled.</P>
      <P>Wu said no decision on the issue will be taken until the various concerned
sectors, not the least the apparel industry, have been fully consulted.</P>
      <P>Wu said his bureau decided to cancel the meeting late Monday after the
disclosure of the meeting's discussion had drawn strong protests from apparel
associations and opposition lawmakers, who threatened to stage a demonstration
if the government allows imports of Chinese garments.</P>
      <P>As is usual with imports of any Chinese products, Wu said, the imports were
requested by local businessmen and the issue was referred to the meeting, which
is hosted by the Bureau of Foreign Trade every month to review and discuss the
country's trade policy.</P>
      <P>Of the 54 items of apparel, including coats, women's apparel, overcoats and
shirts, most are made of cotton or wool, which are seldom produced in Taiwan,
and their imports would serve the interests of consumers although it might have
negative impact on a few local producers, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has thus far approved the imports of 309 items of Chinese-made textile
products, among which 41 percent were approved without any conditions and 59
percent were approved on the condition that they are made with Taiwan-produced
materials, Wu said, adding that the 54 items of clothing that were to have been
discussed Tuesday fall into the latter category.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government and the private sector are expected to invest approximately US$3
billion in developing WiMAX technology in Taiwan by 2012, an analyst from a
local research institute said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The forecast came as the 2007 WiMAX Forum Taipei Showcase and Conference, the
first of its kind in the world, was taking place in Taipei Oct. 22-23.</P>
      <P>The event, organized by the WiMAX Forum and the Industrial Technology Research
Institute (ITRI), attracted 76 local and foreign firms.</P>
      <P>Founded in June 2001, the Portland, Oregon-based WiMAX Forum has 460 members,
most of which are operators, as well as component and equipment companies.</P>
      <P>WiMAX, or Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access, is a new wireless
communication technology that allows users to surf the Internet even when they
are moving at high speed.</P>
      <P>According to research conducted by the Market Intelligence Center (MIC) of the
government-funded Institute for Information Industry, the global WiMAX market is
expected to generate a total production value of US$75.5 billion by 2012.</P>
      <P>Under a "Mobile-Taiwan" project launched by the government in 2003, the research
predicts, the total output value of the WiMAX Customer Premises Equipment (CPE)
shipment volume will amount to US$159 million this year, up 604 percent from
last year's US$22.6 million.</P>
      <P>Chang Chi, a senior industry analyst at the MIC, estimated that the total amount
of investment for establishing WiMAX networks in the world is likely to reach
US$4.8 billion between 2007 and 2008.</P>
      <P>In the next six years, Chang predicted, half of the world's 500 telecom
operators will invest in the establishment of WiMAX base stations.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, with the assistance of various government projects,
Taiwanese telecom operators have already acquired a global competitive edge in
the development of the WiMAX industry supply chain.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is expected to become a hub for researching, developing and
producing WiMAX equipment, product certification will remain one of the major
costs for local telecom operators, Chang went on.</P>
      <P>If a WiMAX testing and certification center could be set up in Taiwan, Chang
said, it would greatly reduce Taiwanese operators' costs and the time it takes
them to launch WiMAX products on the market.</P>

      <P>A round-the-nation torch relay to drum up support for the country's bid to join
the United Nation under the name Taiwan kicked off Wednesday, with President
Chen Shui-bian leading the pack.</P>
      <P>President  Chen passed the torch to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh after completing the opening leg from
the Presidential Office plaza to Jingfu Gate at the intersection of Ketagalan
Boulevard and Zhongshan S. Road in downtown Taipei to symbolize passing on the
mission and legacy.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered before the start of the road run, Chen said the tradition
of lighting a torch came from the ancient Olympics in Greece. Noting that the
flame symbolizes peace, rationality and continuity, Chen said the U.N. bid torch
relay is aimed at showing the world the 23 million Taiwan people's aspiration to
have their country represented in the United Nations in the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Road run participants  began to gather  in front  of the Presidential Office at
6 a.m. Following a flag-raising ceremony, a dancer lit the torch on the main
cauldron amid festive music and dancing at 6: 35 a.m.</P>
      <P>President Chen arrived at 6: 48 a.m. and signed his name on a giant billboard
bearing the Chinese characters  expressing the country's quest for U.N.
membership. He then lit the torch in his hand and the torches kept by other
bearers were also lit in turn.</P>
      <P>The road run kicked-start at 7 a.m. President Chen led the 450-meter leg from
the Presidential Office plaza to Jingfu Gate and many senior officials,
including Vice President Annette Lu, Vice Premier Chiou I-jen, many Cabinet
members and DPP department chiefs, also join the road running event.</P>
      <P>Chen passed the torch to Hsieh after arriving at Jingfu Gate. The large crowd of
runners continued running along Zhongshan S. Road, Zhongxiao E. Road to Hsitzu
Railway Station in Taipei County. The 1,200-km relay, which will cover all 25
counties and cities around the country, is expected to take 11 days to complete.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Trade officials postpone decision on imports of Chinese garments</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Bureau of Foreign Trade under the Ministry of Economic Affairs has decided
to postpone a decision on whether to permit imports of 54 items of China-made
garments, a trade official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu Hsin-hua,  deputy  director  of the  bureau,  said  an inter-ministry
meeting scheduled  for that day to review the restrictions on imports of these
garments had been canceled.</P>
      <P>Wu said no decision on the issue will be taken until the various concerned
sectors, not the least the apparel industry, have been fully consulted.</P>
      <P>Wu said his bureau decided to cancel the meeting late Monday after the
disclosure of the meeting's discussion had drawn strong protests from apparel
associations and opposition lawmakers, who threatened to stage a demonstration
if the government allows imports of Chinese garments.</P>
      <P>As is usual with imports of any Chinese products, Wu said, the imports were
requested by local businessmen and the issue was referred to the meeting, which
is hosted by the Bureau of Foreign Trade every month to review and discuss the
country's trade policy.</P>
      <P>Of the 54 items of apparel, including coats, women's apparel, overcoats and
shirts, most are made of cotton or wool, which are seldom produced in Taiwan,
and their imports would serve the interests of consumers although it might have
negative impact on a few local producers, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has thus far approved the imports of 309 items of Chinese-made textile
products, among which 41 percent were approved without any conditions and 59
percent were approved on the condition that they are made with Taiwan-produced
materials, Wu said, adding that the 54 items of clothing that were to have been
discussed Tuesday fall into the latter category.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to invest US$3 billion in WiMAX by 2012: ITRI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 23 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government and the private sector are expected to invest approximately US$3
billion in developing WiMAX technology in Taiwan by 2012, an analyst from a
local research institute said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The forecast came as the 2007 WiMAX Forum Taipei Showcase and Conference, the
first of its kind in the world, was taking place in Taipei Oct. 22-23.</P>
      <P>The event, organized by the WiMAX Forum and the Industrial Technology Research
Institute (ITRI), attracted 76 local and foreign firms.</P>
      <P>Founded in June 2001, the Portland, Oregon-based WiMAX Forum has 460 members,
most of which are operators, as well as component and equipment companies.</P>
      <P>WiMAX, or Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access, is a new wireless
communication technology that allows users to surf the Internet even when they
are moving at high speed.</P>
      <P>According to research conducted by the Market Intelligence Center (MIC) of the
government-funded Institute for Information Industry, the global WiMAX market is
expected to generate a total production value of US$75.5 billion by 2012.</P>
      <P>Under a "Mobile-Taiwan" project launched by the government in 2003, the research
predicts, the total output value of the WiMAX Customer Premises Equipment (CPE)
shipment volume will amount to US$159 million this year, up 604 percent from
last year's US$22.6 million.</P>
      <P>Chang Chi, a senior industry analyst at the MIC, estimated that the total amount
of investment for establishing WiMAX networks in the world is likely to reach
US$4.8 billion between 2007 and 2008.</P>
      <P>In the next six years, Chang predicted, half of the world's 500 telecom
operators will invest in the establishment of WiMAX base stations.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, with the assistance of various government projects,
Taiwanese telecom operators have already acquired a global competitive edge in
the development of the WiMAX industry supply chain.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is expected to become a hub for researching, developing and
producing WiMAX equipment, product certification will remain one of the major
costs for local telecom operators, Chang went on.</P>
      <P>If a WiMAX testing and certification center could be set up in Taiwan, Chang
said, it would greatly reduce Taiwanese operators' costs and the time it takes
them to launch WiMAX products on the market.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) will integrate Taiwan's
electronics, photovoltaic, solar energy and broadband communications shows into
a single big exhibition  next  year to improve  efficiency  and boost  the
competitiveness of domestic firms.</P>
      <P>A TAITRA official said the just-concluded Taipei International Electronics
Autumn Show, the Taiwan International Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Show
and the Taiwan International Photovoltaic Forum and Exhibition which were staged
simultaneously earlier this month attracted 70,000 visitors from home and
abroad, an increase of 10 percent over last year.</P>
      <P>The majority of the buyers came from Asia and the United States, while those
from the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia and Latin America also
registered an increase, the official said.</P>
      <P>According to TAITRA statistics, the joint organization of these three shows
produced on-the-spot trade opportunities worth US$2.2 billion.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by the notable increase in the number of foreign buyers attending the
joint shows, TAITRA decided to add a broadband communications show to next
year's joint exhibition, for which many local and foreign firms have already
booked exhibition booths, the official added.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the Taipei International Electronics Autumn Show, the
Taiwan International RFID Show and the Broadband Communications Show will be
held simultaneously in October next year at the Taipei World Trade Center's

      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) launched a nationwide cycling tour in Taipei
City Wednesday to drum up support for its push for a referendum on the country's
return to the United Nations under the name Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The event coincided with a nationwide torch relay organized by the Sports
Affairs  Council (SAC)  to promote  the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration's goal of having the country join the United Nations under the
name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The opening ride was headed by KMT presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou, who led
a team of cyclists that set off from the National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall
along Xinyi Road to the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall.</P>
      <P>A similar activity led by Ma's running mate, Vincent Siew, was expected to take
place in Hsichih, Taipei County, before another one scheduled for Keelung City
later in the day.</P>
      <P>The cycling tour is scheduled to visit the country's 25 counties and cities in
11 days, following a route similar to the SAC-organized torch relay.</P>
      <P>KMT officials said the referendum on the country's return to the United Nations
and the DPP-initiated referendum on applying to join the United  Nations  under
the name Taiwan  are two opposing referendums, with the KMT calling for the
maintenance of the status quo and the DPP one calling for a declaration of
Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the KMT-initiated referendum provides a better and more
flexible solution than the DPP's, because if the KMT-backed referendum is
passed, the government will be authorized to adopt an appropriate method at an
appropriate time to push for the country's return to the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Predicting  that the DPP-backed referendum will lead to a diplomatic setback for
Taiwan, Ma claimed that the DPP hopes to take advantage of the situation to
incite a "sad sentiment" among the party's supporters to boost the party's
presidential campaign and divert the public's attention away from the
incompetence  and corruption of the DPP administration.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reiterated Wednesday that Taiwan and China are two
separate nations located on either side of the Taiwan Strait and that Taiwan has
never been a province of China.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of a round-the-island torch relay aimed at drumming up
support for the nation's bid to join the United Nations under the name Taiwan,
Chen claimed that the U.N. bid is the mainstream opinion of the Taiwan public
and an aspiration to uphold Taiwan's sovereignty and status.</P>
      <P>"Today's torch relay is also a move protesting against China's ceaseless
suppression  and  merciless  containment  of Taiwan, particularly when it comes
to the 2008 Olympic Games," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president said that while international support is an important force
helping Taiwan enter the U.N., esprit de corps demonstrated by the Taiwan people
themselves is even more vital.</P>
      <P>He called for the public to "say out loud" their pursuit of peace, democracy and
compassion, saying that the people's support and response to the bid is the
greatest energy that can light up the fire of the "Taiwan U.N. bid."</P>
      <P>He added that the torch relay is aimed at showing the world Taiwan's aspiration
to be represented in the United Nations under the name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen kicked off the torch relay by running the opening leg of the event from the

Chinese characters that translate as "All People's Torch Relay to Advance into
the United Nations". He then lit his torch and torches held by other bearers
were also lit.</P>
      <P>Chen led the first 450-meter leg from the Presidential Office plaza to the
Jingfu Gate at the intersection of Ketagalan Boulevard and Zhongshan South Road
in downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>Many senior officials, including Vice President Annette Lu, Vice Premier Chiou
I-jen, the entire Cabinet and DPP department chiefs also joined the first lap of
the run.</P>
      <P>Chen passed the torch to Hsieh after arriving at the Jingfu Gate where Hsieh's
running mate Su Tseng-chang and an army of young DPP members, as well as a crowd
of road run supporters, were waiting for the arrival of the torch.</P>
      <P>Hsieh then led the pack from Jingfu Gate to the Chang Jung-fa Foundation
Building, which formerly housed the main opposition Kuomintang's headquarters.</P>
      <P>At the conclusion of the short second leg of the run, Hsieh, who has just
recovered from an ankle sprain, said that despite continuing pain in his leg,
his heart felt happy seeing so many people taking part in the event.</P>
      <P>"Even though my leg injury has not yet fully recovered, I insisted on joining
the run. Everybody has to do something for our country,  including  for our
country's  goal of securing U.N. membership, " Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the torch relay is an expression of Taiwan's national will to enter
the international community under its own name, Hsieh said he, like many other
people, was very happy to get up early in the morning to warm up for the road
run.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the run should not be just a brief episode and should instead be
a national campaign, Hsieh said he looks forward to seeing people at home and
abroad do their parts and contribute to the country's quest for U.N.
representation.</P>
      <P>"Although our road to the United Nations is bumpy and rugged and probably
studded with potholes and pain, I'm convinced that our pursuit will definitely
have a happy ending," Hsieh added.</P>
      <P>Afterwards, the pack continued running along Zhongshan South Road and Zhongxiao
East Road to the Hsitzu Railway Station in Taipei County. The 1,200-km relay,

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) has instructed that a probe be conducted into
reports of a Chinese doctor coming to Taiwan to solicit local patients seeking
liver transplants in China, a DOH official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hsueh Jui-yuan, director of the DOH Bureau of Medical Affairs, was responding to
reports by the Taipei-based Liberty Times that Zhu Zhijun, director of the organ
transplant center of Tianjin First Central Hospital, came to Taiwan in March and
conducted assessments in the company of two Taiwanese doctors on liver disease
patients waiting to travel to China to get transplants. The Tianjin hospital is
touted as the biggest liver transplant center in Asia.</P>
      <P>Hsueh said the DOH has instructed the Taipei city government Department of
Health to conduct a thorough probe into the matter.</P>
      <P>If it is confirmed that Zhu came to Taiwan under the cover of medical exchanges
but instead conducted assessments on liver disease patients, he could be subject
to a prison term of between six months and five years if he ever decides to
return to Taiwan because he did not inform the DOH about his intentions in

government.</P>
      <P>Hsueh said that if Taiwanese doctors helped Zhu solicit patients and are found
to have bought or sold organs, they could be disciplined for violation of
medical ethics and have their licenses to practise revoked.</P>
      <P>The organization that invited Zhu to come to Taiwan will be dealt with according
to the Statute Governing the Relations Between the people of the Taiwan Area and
the Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>Hsueh also said Zhu has visited Taiwan at least twice, and he asked Taipei DOH
to learn more details.</P>
      <P>According to Hsueh, the standards of Taiwan's organ transplants are on par with
"those of the world, " and safer than those done in China.</P>
      <P>More than 7,000 people in Taiwan are awaiting organ transplants, but he lamented
that only around 100 people donate organs each year, creating a serious
imbalance between supply and demand.</P>

      <P>The Coast Guard Administration (CGA) has recently dispatched its powerful
second-generation coastal patrol ship the Pao Hsing to the outlying island of
Matsu to flex the country's maritime muscles against illegal Chinese poachers.</P>
      <P>Since its arrival at Matsu Oct. 18, the 600-ton vessel has demonstrated its
determination to crack down on illegal Chinese fishermen who have repeatedly
entered Republic of China territorial waters  to poach  in waters  near Matsu
with  dynamite  and resource-depleting iron-hulled boats.</P>
      <P>Pao Hsing officers have stopped and searched three intruding Chinese fishing
boats, all from Fujian Province, confiscating 200 baskets of fishing gear,
according to Yao Chou-dien, chief of the CGA operations in the Matsu area.</P>
      <P>Over the past week, the vessel has also driven 13 Chinese iron-hulled boats out
of Matsu waters, Yao added.</P>
      <P>Yao disclosed that the Pao Hsing will conduct sweeping operations in Matsu
waters in an effort to safeguard Taiwan's maritime security as well as protect
fishery resources in that area.</P>
      <P>Matsu is located nearer to China's Fujian Province than to Taiwan proper.</P>

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou pledged Wednesday to
push for financial liberalization if he is elected in the March 2008 election.</P>
      <P>Making the remarks during a seminar with the National Federation of Bank
Employee Unions, Ma claimed that financial reforms being promoted  by the ruling
Democratic  Progressive  Party  (DPP) administration are unjust because mergers
of financial institutions only benefit a small minority of business groups.</P>
      <P>The DPP administration's closed-door policy has also restricted the overseas
development of the financial sector and threatens the sector's survival, Ma
claimed.</P>
      <P>He alleged that under the DPP's leadership, government-owned banks have been
forced to sponsor the publicity campaign for the bid to join the United Nations,
while personnel appointments of the banks have become tools for political
tradeoffs.</P>
      <P>Ma promised that if he is elected, he will respect the market mechanism in
pushing for mergers of financial institutions, work to normalize cross-Taiwan

    <TEXT>
      <P>The nation's top tourism official said Wednesday that the targeted number of
foreign visits to Taiwan for next year is set at 4 million because Chinese
tourists are not included.</P>
      <P>Janice Lai, director-general of the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications, denied that the bureau is falling short of
its targeted foreign visits.</P>
      <P>Lai said that if Chinese tourists -- who are not allowed to travel directly to
Taiwan from China -- were allowed to enter Taiwan, the number of visits would
definitely increase.</P>
      <P>She  noted  that  when  the  Executive  Yuan  launched  a tourism-boosting
project in 2002 to double the number of foreign visitors to Taiwan to 5 million
by 2008, it had Chinese tourists coming to Taiwan as the basis for the figure.</P>
      <P>But she noted that the cross-Taiwan Strait issue cannot be unilaterally decided
by Taiwan, so that the Tourism Bureau has "pragmatically revised" the number
downward to 4 million for 2008.</P>
      <P>She said the two sides of the strait have completed talks on the technical
aspects of opening up Taiwan to Chinese tourists, but added that the problem
lies with the political aspect, with Beijing insisting on the precondition that
Taiwan must recognize its "one China" principle before it will allow its people
to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If Chinese tourists are excluded from next year's projections, the Tourism
Bureau is aiming at an average annual growth of 7 percent, or 4 million visits
in 2008, and 4.25 million by 2009, Lai said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has urged the Geneva-based World Health Organization (WHO) to directly
inform Taiwan of information on food safety rather than notifying Taiwan of the
subject via China, Lyushun Shen, director of the Taipei Cultural and Economic
Office in Geneva, said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's call came in response to a delay by China, which was asked by the WHO
Sept.  12 to alert Taiwan  to a batch of Thailand-produced baby corn imports
contaminated with shigella -- a bacterium that can cause an infectious foodborne
disease. China did not pass on the information to Taiwan until Sept. 21, Shen
said.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, Taiwan customs officials found that the contaminated baby corn had
not been imported to Taiwan, according to Shen.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Cultural and Economic Office in Geneva, on behalf of the Taiwan
government, wrote to the WHO to express displeasure over its decision to warn
Taiwan of dangerous imports via China, Shen went on.</P>
      <P>During the past two years, the WHO has directly informed Taiwan of food safety
information instead of relying on China to inform Taiwan, Shen said, speculating

said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Dr. Kung Hsiang-chih, who presides over the Mouse Mutagenesis Program Core

      <P>Kung said the 23 human chromosomes -- the string like cellular structures that
contain genes and other DNA sequences -- are made up of millions of chemical
subunits called bases.</P>
      <P>Chromosomes play a critical role in human health, Kung said, adding that some

      <P>Wholesale vegetable prices are expected to fall to NT$50 (US$1.53) per kilogram
by the end of this week, Council of Agriculture (COA) Chairman Su Jia-chyuan
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In response to inquires by lawmakers at the Legislative Yuan on increasing
prices of necessities that has raised public outcry, Su said that post-typhoon
farmland rehabilitation has been carried out for weeks and harvest time is
approaching.</P>
      <P>If prices do not drop this week, it will mean something has gone wrong with the
rehabilitation, Su said, adding that the COA will try to resolve such problems
if they occur.</P>
      <P>Underlining that it is the COA's duty to stabilize the market by offering
abundant supplies while caring for farmers interests, Su said that if the
council fails in promoting farmland rehabilitation, he will shoulder  the
responsibility  and accept  that he is incompetent.</P>
      <P>COA Director of Agriculture and Food Agency Huang Yu-tsai also said he is
confident that vegetable prices will drop by the end of the week, attributing
the wave of price hikes to typhoon damage over the past two months.</P>
      <P>Huang said supplies of green leafy vegetables are growing but added that the
market is still short of Chinese cabbage, white radish, tomatoes and sweet
peppers because it takes longer to restore these crops.</P>
      <P>According to the Taipei Agricultural Products Marketing Co., the wholesale
vegetable price in the Taipei area for Tuesday was NT$50.91 per kilo, cheaper

      <P>Taiwan looks forward to launching its own domestically developed satellites with
locally made launch vehicles by 2010, the head of the National Science Council
(NSC) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, NSC Chairman Chen Chien-jen
confirmed that the council has been striving to make progress in the research
and development of satellite launch vehicles in the hope that Taiwan will be
able to venture into space with its own satellites launched with its own launch
vehicles in less than three years.</P>
      <P>Chen also solicited vital support from the legislators for financial aid to
facilitate a launch vehicle R&amp;D project.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  opposition  Kuomintang  Legislator  Lai Shyh-bao expressed concern
at the legislative session that Taiwan's weather satellite FORMOSAT-3 is having
trouble functioning, while the revenue generated by FORMOSAT-2 is not cost-
efficient.</P>
      <P>Chen confirmed that one of the six micro-satellites of FORMOSAT-3 has lost
contact and two micro-satellites appear to have lost function, but he added that
"it's no big deal."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen supported his argument by confirming that despite partial
malfunction, FORMOSAT-3 has been working effectively in offering constant
observation data on the stratospheric temperature gradient over Antarctica,
providing valuable temperature and humidity information to the Central Weather
Bureau and other agencies.</P>
      <P>FORMOSAT-3 is supposed to collect information from 1,800 "points of observation,
" Chen said, adding that due to the malfunctions, FORMOSAT-3 has been monitoring
weather conditions by collecting information from 1,600 points, fulfilling 90
percent of its duties.</P>
      <P>On concern that FORMOSA-2 is not cost-efficient, the NSC chief said FORMOSAT-2
is a scientific research satellite that is not designed to be a money-making
venture.</P>
      <P>Instead, he said, FORMOSAT-2, which also observes the global weather conditions
through GPS signals, offers valuable information and pre-warnings about the
potential of mudslides on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The FORMOSAT-2 warning system has significantly helped the government and the
people prevent or lessen damage caused by mudslides, he claimed.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Wednesday that the exclusion of Taiwan from the
United Nations has denied Taiwan access to important international  information
and has seriously impeded the country's overall development.</P>
      <P>Delivering a speech at Yuan Ze University in Taoyuan County, Lu noted that
Taiwan cannot become a signatory of many international treaties because it is
not a member of the United Nations, but said that the country is nevertheless
required to abide by these treaties.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, Taiwan cannot determine its own fate at many crossroads in
history and the people of Taiwan are often victims of international treaties
that they cannot participate in.</P>
      <P>Lu divided the history of the Republic of China into four phases: the Republic
of China in China, the Republic of China's move to Taiwan, the Republic of China
on Taiwan, and the Republic of China as Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lu said the mistaken decision by the late President Chiang Kai-shek to have the
ROC withdraw from the United Nations in 1971 was responsible for the predicament
faced by Taiwan today.</P>
      <P>While the country has tried since 1993 to get the United Nations to consider the
issue of its representation, this year marks the first time it has applied to
join the world body under the name Taiwan. However, as on previous occasions,
the issue of Taiwan's membership application was excluded from the agenda of the
62nd session of the General Assembly.</P>

      <P>The Fisheries Agency under the Council of Agriculture (COA) is scheduled to
reopen Oct. 29 at its new headquarters in the southern port city of Kaohsiung
after having completed its relocation from Taipei to the south two days ago, COA
Vice Minister Lee Chien-chuan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The agency is the first government unit to relocate to southern Taiwan from the
north after the issue of the relocation of government agencies was brought up
earlier this year as part of efforts to balance the development of the north and
south of the country.</P>
      <P>At a press conference following a routine Executive Yuan meeting, Lee said the
new Fisheries Agency will be situated in the Ocean-Going Fisheries Development
Center located in Kaohsiung's Chienchen Fishing Port complex.</P>
      <P>To maintain services to fishery operators in the north of the country, Lee said,
the agency will set up a northern Taiwan branch office in the near future,
adding that the Executive Yuan has adopted a draft amendment to the agency's
organic regulations approving the planned facility's establishment.</P>
      <P>Under the draft bill, the Kaohsiung-based Taiwan Area Fishery Radio Station will
be transformed into the agency's internal organ from an outpost unit, with its
functions expanded to cover the integration of fishery communication systems
around the country, the construction of a complete fishing boat monitoring
mechanism, the implementation of dynamic management of the nation's fishery
sector and the maintenance of the safety of fishing boats in operation,
according to Lee.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Medical University Hospital (TMUH) has successfully used new techniques
to excise uterine fibroids during a cesarean section delivery, the director of
the TMUH Obstetrics and Gynecology Department announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The excised fibroid weighed 3.8 kg, making it bigger and heavier than the baby,
who weighed only about 2.8 kg, said Liu Wei-min.</P>
      <P>Liu said the patient was diagnosed in March with a uterine fibroid 30 cm long,
which at first misled him to estimating the patient as being in her 25th week of
pregnancy.</P>
      <P>Liu said he first delivered the baby, ligated the uterine arteries to prevent
massive hemorrhage, which is very likely to happen to a pregnant woman during
the operation, and then removed the fibroid. The patient's womb was stitched
back to its normal size at the end of the operation, Liu added.</P>
      <P>Traditional treatment for pregnant women with uterine fibroids requires a wait
for more than six months after the birth before surgery,  in order to avoid
massive hemorrhage  and imperfect stitching, Liu said, adding that the
traditional treatment not only wastes medical resources but also causes fatigue
for the patient.</P>
      <P>The new technique  does not affect  the patient's  future pregnancies or
deliveries and removes the necessity of doing a second operation, Liu said.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, about one-third of women over 30 can have uterine fibroids,
and about 0.05 percent to 5 precent of women might have fibroids during
pregnancy.</P>
      <P>A fibroid that poses no threat to the fetus can be taken care of after delivery,
but one that is considered dangerous to the fetus or which causes anemia for the
patient should be removed before pregnancy, Liu said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday that Taiwan is not dragging its feet but
is "moving forward at a galloping speed of 300 kph."</P>
      <P>The president was referring to the speed of the high speed train when he
attended a ceremony sponsored by the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC),
builder of the bullet train, to express appreciation for those who took part in
planning and constructing the railway. The day was chosen because the northern
and southern parts of the original rail system in western Taiwan were connected
Oct. 24, 1908.</P>
      <P>The president also used the occasion to tout Frank Hsieh, presidential candidate
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, and to pan Hsieh's rival, Ma Ying-
jeou of the main opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Chen said that during Hsieh's term as premier between 2005 and 2006, he helped
bail out the cash-strapped THSRC to enable it to complete the 345-km railway
linking Taipei in the north and Kaohsiung in the south.</P>
      <P>He touted Hsieh's resolve, saying that the high speed railway is a major
development project and that if Hsieh had chosen to keep his distance and leave
the financial problem to the THSRC, the public would not be able to enjoy the
convenience of the system today.</P>
      <P>"The public will return justice to Hsieh, " he predicted, referring to Hsieh's
controversial use of government-affiliated foundations to bail out the THSRC.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that people have recently been saying that "Taiwan is dragging its
feet, " but he claimed that if they have the opportunity to board the bullet
train, they will witness Taiwan's progress and development.</P>
      <P>He said that conducting smear campaigns and "belittling Taiwan" will not be "a
boost to oneself, " an apparent oblique reference to Ma.</P>
      <P>Chen urged a "gentlemen's battle" in the 2008 presidential election and asked
that "all trading of barbs" be ended.</P>
      <P>He also described THSRC Chairwoman Nita Ing as an "iron lady, " praising her
resilience and saying that she was only criticized because she once was a
"member of his advisory group."</P>
      <P>The multimillion-dollar high speed railway system is Taiwan's first
infrastructure project built under the BOT (build-operate-transfer) formula in
which private investors build the system and will return control of the project
to the government after a specified period of operation.</P>
      <P>Hsieh helped the cash-strapped THSRC over financial difficulties by instructing
two government-affiliated foundations -- the China Aviation Development Fund
(CADF) and the China Technical Consultant Inc. (CTCI) -- to invest NT$7.5
billion in the project in 2005.</P>
      <P>The THSRC was able to resolve its financial problems after the government
bailout.</P>
      <P>According to THSRC tallies, the company's founders (or original shareholders)
hold a 28.52 percent stake,  the government and state-owned enterprises jointly
control an 11.89 percent stake, foreign institutional investors hold a 3.34
percent stake, other institutional shareholders -- including the CADF and the
CTCI - control a 41.25 percent stake and individual investors have a 15 percent
stake.</P>

      <P>The investigation authorities have resorted to wiretapping in 24,700 cases in
the first nine months of this year, Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The cases, 70 percent of which involved drug-related criminal activities,
include those handled by the Coast Guard Administration, the Bureau of
Investigation,  the National  Police Agency and prosecutors, Shih said.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks during a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Judiciary
Committee when he was asked to comment on a claim by a political commentator on
a TV talk show that 4 million people are currently being wiretapped by the
authorities.</P>
      <P>Shih said he had no idea where the commentator got his figure from, but he
pointed out that the Supreme Prosecutors Office has established  a complete
monitoring  mechanism  to prevent the authorities from abusing their authority
to wiretap.</P>
      <P>On the cases handled by the Bureau of Investigation, bureau Director Yeh Sheng-
mao said the bureau carried out 49,000 wiretapping missions during the first
nine months of this year.</P>
      <P>Yeh explained that as the authorities are required to renew their applications
for wiretapping every month, many of the reported taps were actually simply
extensions of existing wiretaps.</P>
      <P>The number of cases in which wiretapping is still going on totals 5,500,
according to Yeh.</P>

      <P>Police seized 600 pairs of counterfeit sports shoes and 300 sports shirts
imported from China and arrested a suspect surnamed  Lai in a raid in central
Taiwan,  Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) officials reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The officials said they were patrolling the Internet when they came across a Web
site selling brand-name sports shoes at one-third of the normal price.</P>
      <P>They contacted police in Taichung County who investigated the matter and raided
two warehouses where they discovered the counterfeit Puma, Adidas and Nike
sports shoes and shirts in Taiping and Wufeng villages in Taichung county.</P>
      <P>Lai told police he got acquainted with a counterfeit ring in Guangzhou in
southeastern China three years ago and began to collaborate with them. They ran
ads on an overseas Web site to evade police detection.</P>
      <P>He said the counterfeit products were imported at a price of between NT$200 and
NT$300 (US$6.06-US$9.09) but sold for between NT$1,000 and NT$2,000.</P>
      <P>He admitted that he had sold nearly 10,000 items, but claimed to have a monthly
income of between just NT$20,000 and NT$30,000, with the lion's share of the

      <P>The 2007 Terry Fox Run for cancer research is slated to kick off Nov. 11 at the
Taipei City Hall plaza, an event organizer announced Wednesday at a news
conference.</P>
      <P>The event is now entering its 13th year in Taiwan and is aimed at raising public
awareness of the importance of cancer prevention and treatment, according to
Liang Yung-fei, chief of the Taipei Sports Office under the Taipei City
Department of Education.</P>
      <P>Noting that he lost 10 kg through jogging and keeps healthy by maintaining good
exercise habits, Lian said he knows a lot about the benefits of running.</P>
      <P>He added that Chang Gung Memorial Hospital donates 40,000 T-shirts to be used
for the event every year and that this year the hospital held the 10th Terry Fox
Cancer Research Symposium Oct. 6 in the hope of incorporating the concept of
exercise into cancer prevention practice.</P>
      <P>On the same occasion, liver transplant recipient Hu Yu-wang also advocated
physical exercise to keep healthy, saying that he relapsed repeatedly during the
initial period after surgery, but through exercising, his health has improved
and is now almost back to normal.</P>
      <P>In addition to the road run, the city government will also set up a consultation
booth and hold a series of activities and performances, while giving away a
variety of gifts through lot-drawing to promote knowledge of cancer prevention.</P>
      <P>The Terry Fox Run is an international charity event supporting cancer research
that was launched by Canadian cancer activist Terry Fox, who was an outstanding
athlete before being diagnosed with osteogenic sarcoma, a rare bone cancer, at
the age of 18.</P>
      <P>Fox had his right leg amputated and was so moved by the suffering of cancer
patients he saw while he was in the hospital that he decided to run across
Canada to raise money for cancer research. He died aged just 23.</P>
      <P>To date, more than US$400 million has been raised worldwide for cancer research
in Fox's name through the annual Terry Fox Run.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, who is also chairman of the ruling Democratic

parties on defense budget cuts.</P>
      <P>Chen made the appeal at a meeting of the DPP's Central Executive Committee after
the opposition parties recently slashed the whole research and development
budget for the military to develop the country's own advanced weapons.</P>
      <P>Chen instructed the DPP legislative caucus to endeavor to have the budget
reinstated. He said if this does not happen, he will ask for a public debate

      <P>Noting that Beijing had deployed some 200 missiles targeting Taiwan by 2000 when
he became president, Chen said the number of missiles has now increased to 988.
China's military spending has seen double-digit growth during the past 18 years

      <P>However, he went on, Taiwan's arms purchase plan and several military projects

    <TEXT>
      <P>Rather than the traditional linear method of production, consumption and
recycling, a different approach that makes products economically successful,
healthy for users and supportive for the environment and future generations is
making its mark, visiting German professor Michael Braungart said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Braungart, a chemistry professor and entrepreneur, is scheduled to conduct two
workshops on the "Cradle to Cradle Design" idea during his stay in Taiwan, which
is being organized by the German Culture Center.</P>
      <P>"Instead of being less bad, we can be good, " is how Braungart sums up his
concept, on which he collaborated with U.S. architect William McDonough and
which calls for the transformation of human industry through ecologically
intelligent design.</P>
      <P>Braungart's idea is a "wake-up call" to mankind, said German Culture Center
Director Jurgen Gerbig.</P>
      <P>The design advocates two types of products that can be conducted safely, either
as "products for consumption," into biological systems or as "products for
service, " into technical systems for future product generations.</P>
      <P>Products can be used, recycled, and used again without losing any material
quality in the "cradle to cradle cycle, " he said. It's called "cradle to
cradle" because the whole process is different from the traditional product
cycle of "cradle to grave."</P>
      <P>"The design is not all about the environment. It's first about human rights, "
said the former environmental protection activist, who added that "it's not
about overpopulation or the ethical problem unlike what former U.S. Vice
President Al Gore has said."</P>
      <P>What the world has been doing is reducing greenhouse gas emissions and
advocating recycling, but this is like "asking you to beat your children less
often, " according to Braungart.</P>
      <P>There are more than 600 products with zero pollution on the market using the
design process, Braungart said. An international congress and exhibition will be
held in Frankfurt, Germany Nov. 12-14, 2008, showcasing 2,000-3,000 "cradle to
cradle" products.</P>

      <P>A ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislator Wednesday urged residents
of Hualien, in eastern Taiwan, to each post a letter to the government
commission evaluating the environmental impact of construction of the proposed
Suao-Hualien freeway.</P>
      <P>Lu Po-chi, representing Hualien County, launched the "one man, one letter"
campaign in the eastern county earlier in the day, calling on locals to convey
their urgent need for the long planned new road and to push the commission
affiliated with the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) to give the
green light to the project on the basis of "humanitarian concerns."</P>
      <P>Lu said the EPA environmental evaluation commission is scheduled to review a
report on the environmental impact of the planned Suao-Hualien freeway on the
first day of November. He will take part in that meeting, at which he will
propose a plan to build the controversial freeway in several stages, Lu added.</P>
      <P>Citing a report by Minister of Transportation and Communications Tsai Duei to
the legislative Committee on Transportation in April, Lu indicated that the
existing Suao-Hualien highway -- the only road connecting Hualien and Taitung in
eastern Taiwan with the north -- was severed 84 times during the years 1994 -
2006, and caused many fatal motor accidents.</P>
      <P>Additionally, in the 2001-2006 period, 133 traffic accidents occurred on the
highway built along a cliff on the northeastern coast, causing 142 deaths and 38
injuries, the report showed.</P>
      <P>"Road safety is the most humble request and wish of Hualien residents, " the
lawmaker said, underlining the importance of a "safe and reliable" Suao-Hualien
freeway to Hualien's citizens.</P>
      <P>Under regulations governing the environmental impact study, construction of the
planned Suao-Hualien freeway, which won a construction  permit from the Ministry
of Transportation  and Communications Dec. 27, 2002, cannot take place before
the EPA completes its review of the environmental analysis.</P>

      <P>A total of 57 Halloween toys or 65.5 percent of the 87 samples inspected by the
Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection were found to have substandard
Chinese labels, an economic official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang Cheng-huei, deputy director of the bureau under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, said the bureau collected 87 samples from department stores and toy
shops such as Toys 'R' Us for safety inspection. Of those toys, 69 were made in
China, 12 were made in Taiwan, while the others gave no indication of their
origins.</P>
      <P>The bureau proceeded to inspect the products' flammability, heavy metals
concentrations, hazardous sharp points, small detachable parts, and Chinese
labels, and discovered that two samples failed flammability tests, one failed a
sharp point test, and three used substandard packing materials.</P>
      <P>Wang explained that packaging for toys should be of a certain thickness to
prevent accidents when children play with the materials. He added that ropes or
cords attached to toys should not be longer than 30 cm in order to safeguard
children from becoming entangled.</P>
      <P>The bureau has already asked the companies concerned to remove toys which failed
the flammability, hazardous sharp point, and packing bag thickness tests, and to
improve Chinese labels within a specific time limit, the official said. He added
that parents should be aware of such hazards when choosing Halloween toys for
their kids.</P>

      <P>Mutual funds issued by Taiwan-based securities investment and trust companies
will be permitted to invest in Chinese stocks, the Executive Yuan decided
Wednesday during its weekly meeting.</P>
      <P>The first-ever opening allows mutual funds issued by local securities investment
and trust companies to invest in Chinese stocks as well as the China-
incorporated "red-chip" and "H" shares issued by Hong Kong-based Chinese
enterprises on the Hong Kong and Macau bourses up to a level of 0.4 percent and
10 percent, respectively, of their overall net asset values -- the same cap set
for offshore funds on sales in Taiwan since Jan. 31, 2005.</P>
      <P>The opening will allow Taiwan-issued mutual funds to compete with foreign-issued
mutual funds on an equal footing -- removing the cause of a longstanding
complaint of local securities investment and trust companies which were
previously banned from investing in the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses or in
China's red-chip stocks listed on the Hong Kong and Macau stock markets.</P>
      <P>Vicky Hsiao, secretary-general of the Securities Investment Trust &amp;
Consulting Association (SITCA) of the ROC, hailed the government's removal of
the ban as a long-expected boon for the domestic sector and called for a wider
opening.</P>
      <P>Differential treatment in the past has put Taiwanese companies at a great
disadvantage in courting clients and has hardly been effective in warding off
capital outflows or helping local companies upgrade their operations, she said.</P>
      <P>On the contrary, the opening will help the government better manage securities
and investment companies and collect more taxes from them, she said, adding that
the domestic mutual fund sector cannot exclude China if it hopes to be more
competitive in global markets.</P>
      <P>According to SITCA estimates, as much as NT$40 billion (US$1.23 billion) worth
of investment capital managed by some 15 so-called "China-concept" or "greater
China" local mutual funds will be permitted to enter the Chinese bourse and
purchase "red-chip" and "H" shares listed on the Hong Kong and Macao stock
markets.</P>
      <P>However, local fund managers said they would not rush to rashly allocate further
funds to the purchase of Chinese or Hong Kong stocks out of fear that these
markets might undergo a downward correction after reaching historic highs in
recent months.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government to continue investigations of political assassinations</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  24 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday that the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) administration will continue investigating political assassinations
that occurred during Taiwan's infamous martial law era.</P>
      <P>At a meeting of the DPP's Central Executive Committee, Chen, who also serves as
DPP's chairman, stressed that the government will continue the investigations
into several high-profile murder cases during the Kuomintang's (KMT's)
authoritarian rule in response to popular demands for a true historical account
and transitional justice.</P>
      <P>Chen was referring to the murders of Chinese-American writer Henry Liu, Chen
Wen-cheng, and members of Lin I-hsiung's family -- all members of the pro-
democracy elite or critics of then-president Chiang Ching-kuo -- during the
1980s. Lin was a former DPP chairman.</P>
      <P>Recently, an action movie star, Jimmy Wang, revealed in an interview that a KMT
official once tried to hire him to assassinate another former DPP chairman, Hsu
Hsin-liang, when Hsu fled to the United  States to evade the KMT's crackdown  on
pro-democracy activists. Wang said he did not carry out the murder as he did not
obtain a written contract from the KMT.</P>
      <P>The assassination of Liu was carried out by members of Taiwan's underworld
Bamboo Union gang, including its spiritual leader Chen Chi-li, who was released
after being imprisoned for the murder for six years. In 1996, he fled to
Cambodia to evade imprisonment for participating in organized crime. Chen Chi-li
died recently in Hong Kong and his corpse was sent back to Taiwan last week.</P>
      <P>The news of Chen Chi-li's death and his funeral in Taipei were featured in the
headlines of some local media outlets, for which they were criticized by
President Chen, who expressed discontent that anyone in the media would treat
Chen Chi-li as a hero.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is a country ruled by law, President Chen said his
administration will never allow collusion between political parties  and gangs
nor provocation  by gangsters  against the government.</P>
      <P>In consideration  of the  approaching  of legislative  and presidential
elections early next year, Chen asked the Cabinet and law enforcement
authorities to step up its crackdown on organized crime to provide the people
with a peaceful living environment.</P>

launched by the Cabinet- level National Youth Commission (NYC) , hailing it as
an effective means to present Taiwan's beauty and uniqueness to the youth, both

      <P>According to Chang, it is worthwhile for the government to further develop the
program as it has enjoyed initial success after being initiated two years ago.</P>
      <P>The program will not only help foreign and local youth come to know Taiwan's
culture and nature in depth, but could also help promote related businesses,
Chang said, adding that the program is of great importance in selling Taiwan's
tourism both at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>The premier gave his full backing to the program and asked relevant agencies,

      <P>The fullest moon of this year will appear Friday night, astronomers in Taipei
pointed out Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Astronomers at the Taipei Astronomical Museum said the moon will become full at
12:52 p.m. Oct. 26, and that at 8 p.m. members of the public will be able to
look east at a 35-degree angle to view the fullest moon of 2007. At that time
the Moon will reach the closest point of its orbit around Earth.</P>
      <P>They explained that Friday's moon will be 14 percent larger than the smallest
full moon of this year, seen April 3 when the moon was farthest from Earth.</P>
      <P>The full moon this Friday is also expected to be 30 percent brighter than lesser
full moons seen earlier in the year.</P>
      <P>The average distance between the Earth and the Moon is 382,500 km. According to
astronomers, the distance varies because the moon travels around Earth in an
elliptical orbit. At perigee -- the closest point -- the moon is approximately
360,000 km from Earth. At apogee -- its farthest point from Earth --  the
distance is approximately 405,000 km.</P>

      <P>The 2007 Taipei Innovative Textile Application Show (TITAS) opened at the Taipei
World Trade Center Wednesday, with 350 Taiwan and foreign suppliers showcasing
their latest innovative, functional textile products in 650 booths.</P>
      <P>The annual exhibition -- Taiwan's foremost textile trade show -- is jointly
organized by two semi-official organizations: the Taiwan External Trade
Development Council and the Taiwan Textile Federation (TTF).</P>
      <P>The show last year attracted more than 18,000 buyers from 44 countries,
including 2,113 buyers from abroad.</P>
      <P>The 2007 exhibition will run for three days until Oct. 26 alongside the annual
meeting of the International Apparel Federation (IAF), which focuses on the
theme "Asia -- from a global production base to an emerging consumer market."</P>
      <P>The meeting has brought together hundreds of apparel suppliers from around the
world and is expected to create many business opportunities for exhibitors at
the TITAS show.</P>
      <P>The current IAF membership includes apparel associations from 32 countries
representing over 150,000 companies that provide products and services to the
apparel industry.</P>
      <P>The range of products on display at the exhibition include yarns, fabrics,
functional textile products,  apparel accessories and peripheral products, with
many Taiwanese exhibitors presenting their newly developed, innovative textile
products.</P>
      <P>Organizers said the 2007 TITAS show continues to stress not only the
functionality of the products, but also their fashionableness.</P>
      <P>They said that Taiwan's functional textile suppliers will use the opportunity to
form partnerships with international buyers and provide them with full package
services.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is among the world's leading suppliers of functional textiles. The TTF
and Taiwan's major manufacturers have developed a Taiwanese functional textiles
certification and labeling system to help consumers identify guaranteed quality
products. The label has been registered in Taiwan, the United States, the
European Union, Japan and China.</P>
      <P>Currently there are 13 categories within Taiwan's functional textile
certification system: wrinkle-free textiles, oil-repellent textiles,  water-
repellent  textiles,  flame-resistant  textiles, anti-static textiles, far-
infrared textiles, moisture-absorbing and quick-drying  textiles,  stain-release
textiles,  sun-protective textiles, electromagnetic-shielding textiles,
breathable-waterproof textiles, anti-bacterial textiles for medical use and

    <HEADLINE>Hog prices expected to gradually rebound: COA</HEADLINE>

10/24/07  22:13:04

    <TEXT>
      <P>Local hog prices will gradually rebound later this year, a Council of
Agriculture (COA) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chu Ching-cheng, a COA division chief in charge of livestock industry affairs,
made the remarks after a ruling party lawmaker urged the government to pay heed
to the plight of local pig farmers who face a slump in hog prices and
skyrocketing prices for feed corn.</P>
      <P>Speaking in a news conference at the Legislative Yuan, Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Legislator Yen Wen-chang said the average hog price has dropped from
NT$6,124 (US$188) per kilogram to NT$5,013 in the past two months, while the
price for feed corn more than doubled to NT$ 5.5 per kilogram. At these prices,
farmers are set to lose NT$3,000 in production costs for each pig raised for
sale, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Should this situation continue, about 60 percent of pig farmers in central and
southern Taiwan would be forced to shut down their operations by the end of this
year, and related business, including restaurants, food processing and feed
factories, would be seriously affected, Yen warned.</P>
      <P>He also voiced his suspicion that a vested interest involving importers might be
behind the soaring feed prices and urged the government to look into the case
and fully address the issue.</P>
      <P>Yen  suggested  that  the government  purchase  substandard agricultural goods
and provide them for local hog farmers to feed their animals. The practice will
help resolve a glut of some farming products while offsetting the impact of
falling hog prices, he added.</P>
      <P>In response, Chu said the COA has drawn up a long-term strategy to deal with the
issue, and it is expected to help push up hog prices by the middle of next year.
The state-run Taiwan Sugar Corporation has shown a willingness to release its
stock of corn to help hog farmers tackle their feed cost problems, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Domestic fowl breeders urged to be inoculated against avian flu</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) urged domestic  fowl breeders and medical
care professionals  to be vaccinated against avian influenza as the two high
risk groups seem to be reluctant to receive inoculation, a senior CDC official
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics, CDC Deputy Director-General Shih Wen-yi said the vaccination
rate among the elderly, aged 65 and above, has reached 36.5 percent so far this
year -- a decline of 5 percent compared with the level of the same period last
year.</P>
      <P>Senior citizens, children aged between six months and two years of age,
professional fowl breeders, and health care professionals are entitled to
receive vaccinations against avian flu free of charge.</P>
      <P>However, Shih said that only 20 percent of professional fowl breeders in the
country have received the vaccination so far this year -- an obvious drop
compared with the 60 percent rate in the same period last year -- while the
vaccination rate among medical and health care personnel was 67 percent, lower
than the 90 percent rate recorded in 2006.</P>
      <P>The CDC has found that most professional fowl breeders were not fully aware of
the threat posed by avian flu, and that low inoculation  rates among medical
personnel  were due to local governments appropriating those vaccine stocks for
use with the elderly and infants, Shih said.</P>

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung announced Wednesday that Oct. 24 will be designated as
"U.N. Day" for Taiwan to further highlight the country's desire to enter the
world body.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, it is both mainstream public opinion and an established
government policy that the country should pursue full U.N. membership under the
name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>To further underscore this cause and raise public understanding of its
importance, the Executive Yuan decided to set Oct. 24 as "U.N. Day" in Taiwan
because the day has been observed worldwide as U.N. Day in commemoration of the
entry into force of the U.N. Charter on Oct. 24, 1945, he explained.</P>
      <P>Earlier the same day, President Chen Shui-bian kicked off a round-the-nation
torch relay in front of the Presidential Office. The torch will pass through 25
cities and counties, including the outlying islands of Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu,
before returning to Taipei Nov. 3 to muster greater public approval for Taiwan's
U.N. membership bid.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has been engaged in a signature
drive and hopes to collect over 2 million signatures endorsing its petition for
a referendum on whether the country should join the U.N. under the name Taiwan,
which the DPP hopes to hold alongside the March 22, 2008 presidential election.</P>

      <P>A round-the-nation torch relay initiated by the government to solicit support
for the country's bid to join the United Nations under the name Taiwan arrived
on the Taiwan-held outlying island of Kinmen Wednesday, the closest it will get
to China.</P>
      <P>The torch was escorted by a Sports Affairs Council (SAC) official and four
athletes of the Chinese Taipei Road Running Association (CTRRA) to Kinmen after
President Chen Shui-bian led government officials and members of the public at
the start of the relay in downtown Taipei early that morning.</P>
      <P>After arriving on Kinmen by plane, the torch carriers were joined by only around
10 members of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , as Kinmen is a
stronghold of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), which does not support the
DPP's U.N. bid referendum idea.</P>
      <P>Welcoming the torch, Chen Tsang-chiang, head of the DPP's Kinmen chapter, said
it is the common aspiration of the Taiwanese people to join the international
community.</P>
      <P>However, he described the KMT's campaign to promote the country's
U.N.-membership bid under the country's national title, the Republic of China,
as not workable because he said it would mean that the People's Republic of
China would have to give up its seat in the world body to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said that only the DPP's campaign to push for the country's U.N. bid under
the name Taiwan will succeed and called on Kinmen County citizens to support the
government's bid.</P>
      <P>Despite the Kinmen county government's refusal to cooperate in organizing the
event, the four CTRRA runners ran around the entire island.</P>
      <P>When the torch reached the Cihhu dike at Guningtou, there was only 10 km between
the torch and the Chinese coastal city of Xiamen, marking the closest the torch
will get to China.</P>

      <P>China should respect the continued existence  of the Republic  of China  and
recognize  Taiwan's international status to pave the way for the signing of a
peace agreement between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, the head of a quasi-
official intermediary body said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hung Chi-chang, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), made the
appeal at a seminar held on the Taiwan-held outlying island of Kinmen to mark
the sixth anniversary of the opening of direct shipping services between Kinmen
and three port cities in China's southeastern province of Fujian -- Xiamen,
Mawei and Quanzhou.</P>
      <P>Hung said he welcomes Chinese President Hu Jintao's call for an end to cross-
strait enmity and the signing of a bilateral peace agreement under the principle
of "one China" to ensure lasting peace in the Taiwan Strait. Hu issued his call
in a speech delivered at the just-concluded annual congress of the Communist
Party of China in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's leadership also aspires to forge a stable framework to
maintain cross-strait peace, Hung said such a goal can be realized only through
bilateral talks on an equal footing.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Hung said, China should not insist on its "one China"
principle and should instead recognize Taiwan's proper status -- a political
entity that exercises sovereignty over Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu. Such a
recognition also means China's respect for the uninterrupted existence of the
ROC, he added. Should that be the case, he said, the two sides will be able to
sit down to talk on the possibility of singing a peace agreement.</P>
      <P>The seminar brought together some 100 scholars and experts from both sides of
the Taiwan Strait to swap opinions and views on cross-strait matters of mutual
concern.</P>

      <P>China should respect the continued existence  of the Republic  of China  and
recognize  Taiwan's international status to pave the way for the signing of a
peace agreement between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, the head of a quasi-
official intermediary body said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hung Chi-chang, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), made the
appeal at a seminar held on the Taiwan-held outlying island of Kinmen to mark
the sixth anniversary of the opening of direct shipping services between Kinmen
and three port cities in China's southeastern province of Fujian -- Xiamen,
Mawei and Quanzhou.</P>
      <P>Hung said he welcomes Chinese President Hu Jintao's call for an end to cross-
strait enmity and the signing of a bilateral peace agreement under the principle
of "one China" to ensure lasting peace in the Taiwan Strait. Hu issued his call
in a speech delivered at the just-concluded annual congress of the Communist
Party of China in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's leadership also aspires to forge a stable framework to
maintain cross-strait peace, Hung said such a goal can be realized only through
bilateral talks on an equal footing.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Hung said, China should not insist on its "one China"
principle and should instead recognize Taiwan's proper status -- a political
entity that exercises sovereignty over Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu. Such a
recognition also means China's respect for the uninterrupted existence of the
ROC, he added. Should that be the case, he said, the two sides will be able to
sit down to talk on the possibility of singing a peace agreement.</P>
      <P>The seminar brought together some 100 scholars and experts from both sides of
the Taiwan Strait to swap opinions and views on cross-strait matters of mutual
concern.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Hog prices expected to gradually rebound: COA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Local hog prices will gradually rebound later this year, a Council of
Agriculture (COA) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chu Ching-cheng, a COA division chief in charge of livestock industry affairs,
made the remarks after a ruling party lawmaker urged the government to pay heed
to the plight of local pig farmers who face a slump in hog prices and
skyrocketing prices for feed corn.</P>
      <P>Speaking in a news conference at the Legislative Yuan, Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Legislator Yen Wen-chang said the average hog price has dropped from
NT$6,124 (US$188) per kilogram to NT$5,013 in the past two months, while the
price for feed corn more than doubled to NT$ 5.5 per kilogram. At these prices,
farmers are set to lose NT$3,000 in production costs for each pig raised for
sale, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Should this situation continue, about 60 percent of pig farmers in central and
southern Taiwan would be forced to shut down their operations by the end of this
year, and related business, including restaurants, food processing and feed
factories, would be seriously affected, Yen warned.</P>
      <P>He also voiced his suspicion that a vested interest involving importers might be
behind the soaring feed prices and urged the government to look into the case
and fully address the issue.</P>
      <P>Yen  suggested  that  the government  purchase  substandard agricultural goods
and provide them for local hog farmers to feed their animals. The practice will
help resolve a glut of some farming products while offsetting the impact of
falling hog prices, he added.</P>
      <P>In response, Chu said the COA has drawn up a long-term strategy to deal with the
issue, and it is expected to help push up hog prices by the middle of next year.
The state-run Taiwan Sugar Corporation has shown a willingness to release its
stock of corn to help hog farmers tackle their feed cost problems, he added.</P>

      <P>The 2007 Taipei Innovative Textile Application Show (TITAS) opened at the Taipei
World Trade Center Wednesday, with 350 Taiwan and foreign suppliers showcasing
their latest innovative, functional textile products in 650 booths.</P>
      <P>The annual exhibition -- Taiwan's foremost textile trade show -- is jointly
organized by two semi-official organizations: the Taiwan External Trade
Development Council and the Taiwan Textile Federation (TTF).</P>
      <P>The show last year attracted more than 18,000 buyers from 44 countries,
including 2,113 buyers from abroad.</P>
      <P>The 2007 exhibition will run for three days until Oct. 26 alongside the annual
meeting of the International Apparel Federation (IAF), which focuses on the
theme "Asia -- from a global production base to an emerging consumer market."</P>
      <P>The meeting has brought together hundreds of apparel suppliers from around the
world and is expected to create many business opportunities for exhibitors at
the TITAS show.</P>
      <P>The current IAF membership includes apparel associations from 32 countries
representing over 150,000 companies that provide products and services to the
apparel industry.</P>
      <P>The range of products on display at the exhibition include yarns, fabrics,
functional textile products,  apparel accessories and peripheral products, with
many Taiwanese exhibitors presenting their newly developed, innovative textile
products.</P>
      <P>Organizers said the 2007 TITAS show continues to stress not only the
functionality of the products, but also their fashionableness.</P>
      <P>They said that Taiwan's functional textile suppliers will use the opportunity to
form partnerships with international buyers and provide them with full package
services.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is among the world's leading suppliers of functional textiles. The TTF
and Taiwan's major manufacturers have developed a Taiwanese functional textiles
certification and labeling system to help consumers identify guaranteed quality
products. The label has been registered in Taiwan, the United States, the
European Union, Japan and China.</P>
      <P>Currently there are 13 categories within Taiwan's functional textile
certification system: wrinkle-free textiles, oil-repellent textiles,  water-
repellent  textiles,  flame-resistant  textiles, anti-static textiles, far-
infrared textiles, moisture-absorbing and quick-drying  textiles,  stain-release
textiles,  sun-protective textiles, electromagnetic-shielding textiles,
breathable-waterproof textiles, anti-bacterial textiles for medical use and
anti-bacterial textiles for apparel and home use.</P>

      <P>The fullest moon of this year will appear Friday night, astronomers in Taipei
pointed out Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Astronomers at the Taipei Astronomical Museum said the moon will become full at
12:52 p.m. Oct. 26, and that at 8 p.m. members of the public will be able to
look east at a 35-degree angle to view the fullest moon of 2007. At that time
the Moon will reach the closest point of its orbit around Earth.</P>
      <P>They explained that Friday's moon will be 14 percent larger than the smallest
full moon of this year, seen April 3 when the moon was farthest from Earth.</P>
      <P>The full moon this Friday is also expected to be 30 percent brighter than lesser
full moons seen earlier in the year.</P>
      <P>The average distance between the Earth and the Moon is 382,500 km. According to
astronomers, the distance varies because the moon travels around Earth in an
elliptical orbit. At perigee -- the closest point -- the moon is approximately
360,000 km from Earth. At apogee -- its farthest point from Earth --  the
distance is approximately 405,000 km.</P>

      <P>The passenger flow of the Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) amounted to
111.84 million for the first eight months of this year, down a marginal 0.2
percent over the same period of last year, according to a report released
Wednesday by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC).</P>
      <P>The figure compared with a sharp decrease of 23.3 percent in domestic air
passenger volume for the eight months to August, which indicates that the
domestic airline industry has suffered much greater impact than the traditional
railway services since the launch of the high-speed railway early this year,
MOTC officials said.</P>
      <P>For the January-August period, the TRA's daily passenger flow averaged 460,000,
with each passenger traveling an average 53.9 km, down 3.9 percent compared with
56.1 km recorded during the same period of last year, the report shows.</P>
      <P>While 72.2 percent of the passengers traveled short distances -- no more than 50
km -- middle-distance passengers (those traveling 50 km -199 km) and long-
distance passengers (those traveling more than 200 km) accounted for 23.2
percent and 4.6 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>The figures mark a rise of 1.1 percentage points year-on-year in the ratio of
short-distance passengers but a fall of 0.7 percentage points and 0.4 percentage
points in the ratios of middle-distance passengers and long-distance passengers,
respectively.</P>
      <P>The changes indicate that the launch of the high-speed railway has impacted the
middle-to-long-distance services of the TRA but not the short-distance services,
the report said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the report went on, the inauguration of the Peiyi Freeway linking
Taipei and the northeastern county of Yilan has resulted in a decrease in the
rail passenger flow to Yilan.</P>
      <P>For the first eight months of this year, there was a decrease of 12 percent to
14.8 percent in the number of passengers alighting at major stations in Yilan,
including Chiaohsi, Yilan, Lotung and Suao, according to the report.</P>

      <P>A program to help 5-year-old children from underprivileged families with their
pre-school education will benefit 106,000 people rather than the original
estimate of 81,000, an education official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chuang Kuo-jung, secretary-general of the Ministry of Education (MOE), made the
remarks one day after a meeting with local government officials to confirm the
exact number of families eligible for the government subsidies. The meeting was
called after local governments found that the number of applications for the
subsidies was greater than expected.</P>
      <P>Chuang estimated the total cost of the subsidies will amount to at least NT$2.4
billion (US$72.72 million) per year.</P>
      <P>He said the subsidy program was devised because the ministry wanted to lessen
the burden on underprivileged families, the thinking being that the parents of 5
-year-olds are mostly aged around 30, have not been in the workforce for long
and have comparatively low incomes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP, KMT trade barbs over voting format</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  25 (CNA)
10/25/07  14:29:05

    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislative caucus whip of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said
Thursday that the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is insulting the Taiwan
people by saying that the adoption of a "one-stage" voting format will result in
chaos.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Wang Tuoh also suggested printing the presidential candidates and
referendum proposals on one ballot "so that the KMT will have no reason to
object."</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks one day after 18 mayors and magistrates from the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" led by the KMT issued a joint statement that if
votes on referendum proposals are held alongside the January legislative and
March presidential elections next year, they will follow the previous "two-
stage" voting format to ensure the smooth operation of the elections.</P>
      <P>"Two-stage" voting format refers to voters receiving presidential election and
referendum ballots separately. After casting their presidential ballot in one
box, voters will receive a referendum ballot to cast in another box. This method
was used in the 2004 presidential election, but many voters chose to leave the
polling stations after casting their presidential ballots, without bothering to
vote on a referendum held at the same time.</P>
      <P>Under the "one-stage" format, two ballots -- presidential and referendum ballots
-- are handed out at the same time and voters then cast the two ballots in
separate boxes. This format is generally considered to boost the participation
rate.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the act of the "pan-blue" local chiefs is tantamount to publicly
splitting the country.</P>
      <P>The remarks that a "one-stage" formula will create chaos or disturbance is also
"an intimidation of the Taiwan people and a slight on their judgment," he
continued.</P>
      <P>The KMT's rhetoric has no basis in either theory or practice, Wang said,
pointing out that the KMT is just worried that a DPP-initiated referendum
proposal on U.N. membership under the name Taiwan will be passed if there is a
high participation rate.</P>
      <P>The KMT is hoping the rate will be less than half of the eligible voters so that
the proposal will fail, Wang said, adding that this is also the hope of the
Communist Party of China, so that it can continue to oppress Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The request by the `pan-blue' city and county chiefs is dancing to China's
tune," Wang alleged.</P>
      <P>Under the Referendum Law, a proposal will be considered passed if the referendum
participation rate exceeds half of all eligible voters and if 50 percent of
those who cast ballots vote in favor of the proposal.</P>
      <P>In the 2004 presidential election, two proposals initiated by President Chen
Shui-bian and put to a referendum -- one on purchasing more missiles to counter
the military threat from China, and the other on engaging in dialogue with China
-- failed because although 90 percent of those who cast ballots in the
referendum voted in favor of the proposals, the participation rate was only 45
percent of all eligible voters.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma Ying-jeou, the KMT's presidential candidate, came to the defense
of the 18 pan-blue local chiefs, saying that ensuring the smooth operation of
the elections is their duty.</P>
      <P>In addition, the KMT's proposal on a referendum on the return to the United
Nations under its official name the Republic of China will also be put to a
vote, but the KMT has no intention of boycotting or confronting the central
government, he continued.</P>
      <P>He noted that in the 2004 presidential election when the first national
referendum was held, local election commissions suggested to the Central
Election Commission (CEC) that the "one-stage" format would create problems and
requested a separate handout of the ballots, a proposal the CEC accepted.</P>
      <P>The CEC is scheduled to meet Friday to discuss the two voting formats. It is
widely expected that the "one-stage" format will be adopted.</P>

      <P>Military exchanges between the United States and China should not impede

      <P>According to the reports, Washington and Beijing are expected to sign an

their respective defense chiefs. A similar hotline has been in place between
senior Taiwanese and U.S. defense officials since 2002.</P>
      <P>Asked about the ministry's stance on Gates' planned visit at a regular MOFA news

      <P>"As is usual,  we will closely monitor  Washington-Beijing exchanges, including
Gates' upcoming trip to China, " Yeh said, adding that the MOFA would also ask
the U.S. not to waver in its security commitment to Taiwan because of its

      <P>Thirty-one percent of bicycle helmets recently surveyed by the Consumers'
Foundation are below standard, according to the results of the survey released
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The survey of 29 locally available bicycle helmets found that six carried
substandard labels, three had chin straps that broke easily and one contained no
inspection label at all.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a survey by the Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection (BSMI)
on the inspection labels of 363 bicycle helmets found 14 to be below standard.</P>
      <P>Foundation and bureau officials advised consumers to select products bearing
labels to indicate that they have passed inspection by the BSMI when shopping
for bicycle helmets.</P>
      <P>Also, consumers should replace helmets that have suffered any impact or are
damaged, they said.</P>
      <P>Results of a study conducted last year by the Taipei Medical University for the
Bureau of Health Promotion show that between 1999 and 2002, an average 3,700
people were injured every year while riding a bicycle.</P>
      <P>Minor cuts and bone fractures accounted for the majority of the injuries, with
the death rate for bicycle accidents registering between 3 percent and 5
percent, according to the results.</P>

bicycle and that one person died in a bicycle accident every two days on average

    <HEADLINE>Former president to drum up support for TSU legislative candidates</HEADLINE>

      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui will attend an evening rally in the southern port
city of Kaohsiung Friday to drum up support for candidates of the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) in the coming legislative elections, TSU Chairman Huang
Kun-hui said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks as he accompanied three TSU legislative candidates to a
temple to pray for victory in the January elections.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that faced with the new "single-member constituency, two votes"
electoral system and a streamlined legislature, which is generally considered to
favor the major parties over the smaller ones, the TSU expects a tough battle to
ensure its continued existence.</P>
      <P>The TSU will hold four rallies around the country in the hope of "rekindling the
passion for the TSU," he said.</P>
      <P>He urged the public to vote for TSU candidates for three reasons, claiming that
the party is the only party in the legislature that guards the interests of the
Taiwan people, that the party can serve as a crucial force between the two main
rival parties and that it can play a middle-to-left role that takes care of the
underprivileged.</P>
      <P>He admitted that the party has recently met with figures from the private
sector, including business tycoon Winston Wang, chairman of the Grace THW Group,
to exchange views on how to join hands with a so-called "third force" to
solidify the "indigenous" political parties.</P>
      <P>He noted that Lee, the "spiritual leader" of the TSU, has repeatedly said that
the political landscape in Taiwan should move from pro-independence  vs.  pro-
unification to two "indigenous" parties.</P>
      <P>In addition to the DPP, there should be another "indigenous" party, Huang quoted
Lee as saying.</P>
      <P>Huang also said there are eight out of 73 regional constituencies in which both
the DPP and the TSU have fielded candidates.</P>
      <P>He said the DPP and the TSU must coordinate and field only one candidate in
these constituencies to avoid letting the KMT benefit by playing off one party
against the other.</P>
      <P>He proposed coordination between the two parties and said that if that fails,
public opinion polls should have the final say on who should run.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that local governments have no say in the
voting format for the coming legislative and presidential elections.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks one day after 18 mayors and magistrates from the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" led by the main opposition Kuomintang issued a
joint statement that if votes on referendum proposals are held alongside the
January legislative and March presidential elections next year, they will follow
the previous "two-stage" voting format "to ensure the smooth operation of the
elections."</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out, however, that the Central Election Commission, which will meet
Friday to discuss whether to adopt the "one-stage" or "two-stage" voting formats
for the coming elections, will not be considering local but national elections.</P>
      <P>"Local governments have no power to decide the format, " Chen said, adding that
if cities and counties fail to follow the voting format passed by the CEC, then
it will be a "one country, two systems" situation.</P>
      <P>The CEC, comprised mostly of pro-DPP members, is widely expected to pass the
"one-stage" voting format.</P>
      <P>A referendum proposal initiated by the DPP to retrieve ill-gotten assets amassed
by the KMT during its five decades of rule of Taiwan and another one initiated
by the KMT on opposing corruption will be put to a vote in conjunction with the
legislative election.</P>
      <P>The DPP also plans another referendum on a proposal to bid for U.N. membership
under the name Taiwan to be held in tandem with the presidential election, while
the KMT plans a referendum on a proposal to return to the world body under its
official name, the Republic of China, or any other "pragmatic name" on the same
date.</P>
      <P>The "two-stage" voting format refers to voters receiving presidential election
and referendum ballots separately. After casting their presidential ballot in
one box, voters will receive a referendum ballot to cast in another box. This
method was used in the 2004 presidential election, but many voters chose to
leave the polling stations after casting their presidential ballots, without
bothering to vote on a referendum held at the same time.</P>
      <P>Under the "one-stage" format, two ballots -- presidential and referendum ballots
-- are handed out at the same time and voters then cast the two ballots in
separate boxes. This format is generally considered to boost the participation
rate.</P>
      <P>Under the Referendum Law, a proposal will be considered passed if the referendum
participation rate exceeds half of all eligible voters and if 50 percent of
those who cast ballots vote in favor of the proposal.</P>
      <P>In the 2004 presidential election, two proposals initiated by President Chen
Shui-bian and put to a referendum -- one on purchasing more missiles to counter
the military threat from China, and the other on engaging in dialogue with China
-- failed because although 90 percent of those who cast ballots in the
referendum voted in favor of the proposals, the participation rate was only 45
percent of all eligible voters.</P>

      <P>Export orders received by local companies during the first three quarters of
this year amounted to US$250.7 billion, marking a 14.78 percent growth over the
same period of last year, a Ministry of Economic Affairs official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Of the figure, US$66.12 billion comprised orders from Hong Kong, which included
those from China, up 20.05 percent over last year, said Huang Ji-shih, director-
general of the MOEA's Department of Statistics.</P>
      <P>He added that US$61.86 billion was made up of orders from America, representing
an annual growth rate of 5.81 percent, and US$44.76 billion was for orders from
Europe, an increase of 26.04 percent from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>Export orders received in September above amounted to US$30.92 billion, setting
a single-month high and marking an increase of 16.1 percent over last year. Of
this figure, orders from Hong Kong, including those from China, reached US$8.46
billion, higher than the US$7.56 billion from America, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, industrial production for September decreased 4.44 percent from
August but increased 8.13 percent over the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>Of the total, manufacturing production gained 9 percent over last year and
water, electric power and gas increased by 2.77 percent, while mining and
quarrying decreased 10.45 percent and construction decreased 7.21 percent.</P>
      <P>Manufacturing production for the third quarter had an annual growth rate of
11.39 percent, which was the highest rate for the past three years, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Increasing demand from European and Asian markets for consumer electronic
products,   laptops,   flat  panels,   wireless telecommunications and
petrochemical raw materials stimulated the growth of manufacturing production,
Huang said.</P>
      <P>He added that 25.36 percent of firms surveyed are optimistic that export orders
received in October will increase, while 50.34 percent said the situation will
remain unchanged and 24.3 percent said orders will drop.</P>
      <P>The MOEA predicted that manufacturing production and export orders will continue
to grow throughout the fourth quarter and that orders received through the whole
year will amount to US$340 billion, up 13 percent from last year's US$299.3
billion, Huang said.</P>

      <P>A new autoimmune treatment for brain tumors has been developed by the Taichung-
based China Medical University Hospital (CMUH) , with a superior survival rate
of 85.8 percent, hospital sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>CMUH Neurosurgery Department Director Cho Der-yang explained that the new
therapy employs dendritic cells extracted from a patient's blood to fight
malignant gliomas cells in the brain -- both to minimize side effects and
increase the chances of survival.</P>
      <P>Cho further explained that the dendritic cells extracted are first cultivated in
vitro along with malignant gliomas cells, a process that induces dendritic cells
to better understand their enemy and trigger the immune mechanism against this
type of tumor cell.</P>
      <P>The "educated" dendritic cells are then injected back into the patient to
stimulate his human T-lymphocytes, which will then turn on the remaining brain
tumor cells or malignant gliomas cells.</P>
      <P>"A single course of treatment takes six months and 10 injections of cultivated
dendritic cells," Cho added.</P>
      <P>In previous clinical experiments, among the 21 volunteers with malignant
gliomas, 18 survived the observation period of up to 32 months and only three
died during the course, representing a three-year survival rate of 85.8 percent.</P>

      <P>A civic group urged the government Thursday to set aside eateries for the
jobless so that those who are unemployed can live and look for jobs with
dignity.</P>
      <P>Su Tseng, who heads a human rights promotion group for the jobless, suggested
that the government open up restaurants for the jobless on a trial basis on
college campuses or in government agencies in Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Government-funded vocational service agencies could give free coupons to the
jobless for two meals a day in the eateries on weekends, and give cash at
Chinese New Year, Su said.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that those who are unemployed for more than a year and those
with a monthly income of less than 60 percent of the basic wage of NT$17,280
(US$523) would be eligible for the free coupons, although they would also need
to take vocational training courses.</P>
      <P>Su pointed out that tallies released by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics show that the number of those who were jobless for
more than a year totaled 55,000 in 2006.</P>
      <P>If there are three members in a family, then the government would need to spend
around NT$4 billion a year on the project, or NT$2 billion if practiced in

    <TEXT>
      <P>A ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislator said Thursday that lack
of U.N. membership has hampered Taiwan's normal development in many sectors,
including agricultural and fishery development.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Wu Ming-min called on the government and people at a news
conference to press home DPP-initiated efforts to seek membership of the United
Nations under the name Taiwan, claiming that the lack of U.N. membership has
barred Taiwan's agricultural and fishery products from entering the world
market.</P>
      <P>Wu said Taiwan's agricultural products, including eels, rice, organic tea, star
fruit and bellfruit, have been successful in the world market because of their
quality. These products are so hotly sought after that they are counterfeited by
Chinese traders and sold at high prices on the world market, Wu added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan producers, unfortunately, have been unable to clarify and reclaim their
names due to the fact that Taiwan has been routinely excluded from the world
stage, according to Wu.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the news conference, Chang Ching-jung, executive director of
the Farmers' Association in Tashu, in southern Kaohsiung County, said the fact
that Taiwan is excluded from the U.N. is not only a sad thing for Taiwan
citizens, particularly when they travel abroad, it has also impeded Taiwan's
agricultural products from being sold worldwide.</P>
      <P>Chen You-ching, executive director of the Taiwan Provincial Fishermen's
Association, said that Taiwan-produced fishery products are of world-class
quality, while the equipment and facilities of Taiwan-based ocean-going fishing
boats are generally advanced, with total catches amount ranking one of the
world's highest. However, he claimed, "because Taiwan is not a U.N. member, "
its fishing sector cannot join international fishery organizations and its
catches are unfairly restricted.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that these problems would be solved if Taiwan were able to join the

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that Asia's rise as a major textile and
apparel market means both opportunities and challenges for these industries,
which he said is an issue worth in-depth study.</P>
      <P>For the 1990-2004 period, the world's trade volume in textiles and apparel rose
by 50 percent, with the increase in Asia's purchasing power being the main
driving force, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>The textile industry is also a pillar of Taiwan's economy, has created numerous
jobs and has contributed greatly to the nation's economic progress, Chen said.</P>
      <P>In tandem  with Taiwan's  technological  development,  Chen continued, more than
one-third of the country's textile manufacturers are now engaging in the
development of "functional textiles" and are receiving widespread recognition in
the international market.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's textile manufacturers  are also seeking industrial upgrades, expanding
their global presence, trying to work out a product differentiation strategy and
developing high value-added textiles to enhance their competitiveness, he said.</P>
      <P>According to the president, the situation has greatly boosted the stock prices
of many textile companies, with shares of Formosa Chemicals and Fibre Corp., Far
Eastern Textile Ltd. and Makalot Industrial Co. having become hot picks among
investors.</P>
      <P>He predicted that with the arrival of the irresistible global wave calling for
environmental protection, eco-friendly textiles will inevitably become a
mainstream product of the industry.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while addressing the opening of the 23rd annual
meeting of the International Apparel Federation (IAF) in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The two-day IAF World Apparel Convention 2007 focuses on the theme "Asia -- from
a global production base to an emerging consumer market" and is being held
alongside the Taipei Innovative Textile Application Show.</P>
      <P>Founded in 1972, the IAF is a global association open to entrepreneurs and
executives from the apparel chain worldwide. Its membership includes national
clothing associations and companies whose core businesses are sourcing, design,
development, manufacturing, distribution or retailing of apparel and related
products.</P>
      <P>The IAF's membership now includes apparel associations from 32 countries

      <P>The National Communications Commission (NCC) advised parents Thursday on how to
cope with the opening of adult programs in cable TV by ensuring that children
are denied access to profanity and sexually explicit programs.</P>
      <P>Defending their licensing of a cable TV system to provide free pornographic
programs on basic cable TV broadcasting, as the Apple Daily reported Thursday,
NCC officials clarified that opening the airwaves to programs with sexual
content on cable TV presupposes that such programs cannot be viewed without
proper equipment, that the equipment will be subject to strict control by
adults, and that such program will be shown only late at night.</P>
      <P>To access to adult programs on basic cable TV broadcasting, the subscribers need
not to pay extra, save for the installation of a special cable box.</P>
      <P>NCC officials said that the opening is being made in accordance with regulations
stipulated in 2000 that TV programs in Taiwan be divided into four categories:
suitable for all audiences, parental protection recommended for children under
6, parental accompaniment recommended for youths aged 6-18, and restricted.</P>
      <P>NCC officials said the Rainbow Channel and Look TV are already operating adult
programs on two cable TV channels in accordance with government regulations.</P>
      <P>In addition, they said, in order to protect children and teenagers from viewing
adult-oriented content TV programs, the government in 2003 demanded that cable
operators improve the control mechanisms by asking subscribers to install an
analog decoder with a digital address requiring a secret access code.</P>
      <P>The NCC, established less than two years ago, is Taiwan's highest media
regulator.</P>

      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R. L. Chen said Thursday that his ministry
has decided to temporarily halt a plan to allow China-made garments to enter
Taiwan due to the negative response from the domestic industry.</P>
      <P>Chen made the comments to reporters while accompanying President Chen Shui-bian
to attend an international garment conference and workshop in Taipei.</P>
      <P>According to the minister, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has decided
not to authorize a planned opening to China-made garments to enter Taiwan as a
result of negative reactions from the local industry.</P>
      <P>The MOEA will continue working to forge a consensus with local garment makers
although it has decided not to allow the opening at the moment out of a fear
that it might deal a heavy blow to related businesses at home, the minister
said, adding that his ministry's top concern is that the local sector must
remain intact in the wake of such a move.</P>
      <P>The minister said that after consulting and exchanging viewpoints with local
industry representatives, the MOEA's Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) has
postponed a meeting, originally slated to be held Tuesday to discuss the opening
to 54 items of Chinese manufacture in an effort to assuage their grave concerns.
He added that the domestic industry has great reservations about such an opening
at this time.</P>
      <P>Steve R. L. Chen also denied a media report that the BOFT delayed the Tuesday

      <P>A shipment of frozen white shrimp imported from China in June has been found to
contain Enrofloxacin, an illicit antibiotic in animal husbandry and fish
farming, with much of the shipment believed to have been sold to consumers, a
Department of Health (DOH) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Cheng Huei-wen, director-general of the DOH's Bureau of Food Sanitation, said
the problematic 20-ton shrimp shipmen was imported by a local company in Taoyuan
County. The bureau has requested that the Taoyuan County government investigate
the whereabouts of this lot of shrimp and ask sellers to recall the remaining
ones.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the drug is used in humans as a bacteriostat. It has no serious
impact  to human  health  though  it might cause gastrointestinal discomfort,
allergies or crystaluria.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture prohibits the use of the drug in raising animal and
fish farming in order to prevent drug resistance from arising in humans after
eating foods containing drug residues over a long period, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The DOH banned imports of frozen shrimp from China beginning Aug. 22 after
discovering that seven lots of shrimp from China contained a carcinogenic drug,
Cheng said, adding that shrimp imported from China before that date may still be

national treasure."</P>
      <P>Tainung No. 71 is also called Yi Chuan Aromatic Rice. It is a mixed breed
between Japan's Kinuhikari variety and Taiwan's Taikeng No. 4 in memory of Dr.
Guo Yi-cuan, a research fellow at the Agricultural Research Institute of the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture who developed the hybrid variety after
devoting nearly his whole life to rice research and development.</P>
      <P>Several other brands, including Lanli and Shan Shui, have Taikeng No. 9 rice --
also a mixed breed -- in their packages. This variety was developed in 1982 by
Taichung District Agricultural Improvement Station and received its name in
1993. It has remained popular on the domestic market because of its chewiness.</P>
      <P>Other rice varieties in Shan Shui's rice series include the 2004 and 2005
champion rice, Taikeng No. 2, which is ideal when consumed as fried rice; Tainan
No. 11, a new variety named in November 2004; and Tainung No. 71.</P>
      <P>Hsin Nung rice is made of Taikeng No. 16 -- a high-quality hybrid developed from
Taikeng No. 2 and Tainung No. 67 in 1996 by researchers in Hualien -- while
Langchiao rice will present an organic rice made with Taiken No. 16.</P>
      <P>Chingchuang rice will tout the Kaohsiung No. 145 variety, which was selected as
one of 10 top rice brands in a national competition earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Also on display and for sale are Meinung rice, which won second place in a
national rice competition in 2004, Chihshan rice produced in Tainan County's
Liuchia township, and rice grown in the Szuchung Creek Hot Spring area of
Pingtung County.</P>

      <P>Officials from Taiwan and the European Union have agreed to have experts from
both sides carry on talks regarding automobile trade-related issues.</P>
      <P>Both sides arrived at the consensus Wednesday at an annual Taiwan-EU trade
consultative conference held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Vice Economic Minister Fadah Hsieh led the negotiations along with Karl
Falkenberg, deputy director-general of external trade division of the European
Commission -- the executive arm of the European Union.</P>
      <P>The EU side expects the Taiwanese government to ease restrictions governing  the
energy efficiency  of vehicles and the uniform certification criteria for
automobiles and components.</P>
      <P>The EU also hopes that Taiwan will exempt imported European vehicles from being
branded with engine numbers.</P>
      <P>European auto makers regard the branding policy as a technical trade barrier and
have expressed concerns about the issue many times as they have great confidence
in their anti-theft systems and complain that the application of such a policy
would increase their production costs.</P>
      <P>Starting this year, new cars in Taiwan are required to be imprinted with their
engine numbers as part of the government's efforts to prevent vehicle theft.</P>
      <P>Taiwan might accept that each European car company can choose one type of
vehicle to be excluded from the compulsory policy for one year on a trial basis.</P>
      <P>If that type of vehicle's anti-theft system proves effective, then in the
following year, European vehicles using the same anti-theft system could be
exempted from the branding policy.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan agrees to allow European car makers to be conditionally freed of the
policy, it should also apply the same treatment to car makers from other
countries according to World Trade Organization (WTO) regulations.</P>

      <P>"While the domestic floral consumption leaves a lot to be desired, I'm proud to

exports next year, showing the robust development and competitiveness of
Taiwan's floriculture industry, " said Lee Chien-chuan at the press conference

      <P>Taiwan's Phalaenopsis Orchids, which are commonly known as Butterfly Orchids,
have been especially popular as one of the world's two Butterfly Orchids
varieties come from Taiwan, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Led by the orchid-growing industry, floriculture has been an unsung hero of
Taiwan's agriculture, he said. From 1985 to the present, market output has
increased from NT$9.5 billion to NT$12.5 billion and exports have increased from
US$9.5 million to US$77 million, he said.</P>
      <P>Visitors will be able to see for themselves what Taiwan has to offer in the 2007
TIFE, which will be held in Exhibition Hall I of the Taipei World Trade Center
from Oct. 31-Nov. 4, alongside an exhibition of foreign floriculture products
from Australia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Japan and the Netherlands.</P>

      <P>The vice chairman of the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) was
sentenced by Taipei District Court Thursday to an 11-year jail term for
embezzlement of corporate funds.</P>
      <P>Chang Chun-hung, one of the founders of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party,
was accused of embezzling most of the corporate assets of a private
telecommunications company several years ago while acting as the company's
chairman. He was given the prison sentence Thursday by a panel of judges on
charges of fraud and violating the Business Accounting Law and Securities
Transaction Law.</P>
      <P>Responding to the sentence, officials of the SEF -- founded in 1990 as an
intermediary body authorized by the government to handle exchanges across the
Taiwan Strait given greater demands for such services since Taiwan began
allowing its people to travel to mainland China in 1987 to visit relatives --
said the foundation respects the judicial decision.</P>
      <P>SEF officials also said that the case has nothing to do with SEF affairs and
that the SEF will come to a decision regarding Chang's future with the
organization after a comprehensive assessment of whether Chang's conviction will
have an adverse impact on his acting as aboard member of the foundation.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that he is willing to take part in any
events sponsored by the opposition "pan-blue alliance" to spotlight Taiwan's
U.N. cause.</P>
      <P>"I would like to participate  in any 'pan-blue' sponsored activities to
underline the country's bid to enter the United Nations in the name of Taiwan,
no matter whether a jogging or bike tour, " Chen said, adding that because full
U.N. membership is the common desire of the people of all walks of life in
Taiwan and an issue free from political affiliation concerns.</P>
      <P>"It is impossible to join the United Nations under the name of the Republic of
China, " he insisted, urging the "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT)
and the People First Party to stop daydreaming.</P>
      <P>Chen kicked off a round-the-nation torch rely in front of the Presidential
Office Wednesday, which critics claim is part of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) efforts to drum up support for its proposal to put
the issue whether the country should pursue U.N. membership under the name
Taiwan to a referendum alongside the March 22, 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he was deeply touched  seeing  the public enthusiastically  take
part in the activity,  and extended an invitation to Ma Ying-jeou, the main
opposition KMT's presidential candidate, and other KMT heavyweights to take part
in the torch relay that is slated to wrap up Nov. 3 after passing through 25
cities and counties, including outlying islands of Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the DPP has, as of Oct. 24, collected 1.65 million signatures

    <HEADLINE>Taipei County promotes 140 police officers amid controversy</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 25 (CNA)
10/25/07  22:05:30
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei promoted 140 of the northern county's middle-
ranking police officers Thursday, defying repeated central government warnings
that the head of a quasi-municipality lacks the authority to advance the ranks
of policemen serving in the constituency.</P>
      <P>Chou presided over the promotion ceremony in which he presented the higher rank
-- designated by the insignia of two stripes and three stars -- to the county's
140 two-stripes-two-stars police officers.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the county's Oct. 1 upgrade to the status of a quasi-special
municipality legally authorizes the county government to promote its police
officers, Chou said the large-scale promotion exemplifies the "rule of law" and
underlines the county's resolve to improve law enforcement.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that Taipei County is the country's most populous constituency
with a population of 3.8 million and covers a vast area of land, Chou said the
county's police force assumes an unusually heavy workload and deserves more
access to promotions.</P>
      <P>Chou, a stalwart of the main opposition Kuomintang, said there will be a second,
and even a third, wave of promotions of higher-ranking police officers to boost
morale as police will have to take on additional security responsibilities with
the approach of next legislative and presidential elections in early 2008.</P>
      <P>According to amendments to the Local Government Act passed by the opposition-
controlled Legislative Yuan in May, Chou claimed that the Taipei county
government enjoys the same budget and personnel promotion rights as the
country's two existing special municipalities -- Taipei City and Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>However,  National Police Agency Director-General Hou Yu-ih reiterated  later
in  the  day  that  the  Taipei  County government-presented promotions are
invalid because the existing law does not authorize its magistrate to act in
this regard.</P>
      <P>Unless the Executive Yuan confirms that the existing special municipality
police recruitment and management regulations are applicable to a quasi-
municipality, Hou said the Taipei county government does not have a legal
authority to administer police personnel affairs.</P>
      <P>Although Ho Cheng-cheng, the NPA's personnel department chief, said previously
that the department had agreed with the Taipei county government that heads of
police precincts in the county would not be reshuffled before next year's two
crucial elections, Hou said that consensus is still subject to change.</P>
      <P>"If necessary, the county's police precinct chiefs may still be reassigned to
cater to practical needs, " Hou said, adding that stability is the top concern
and that all personnel reshuffles will take into account the overall well-being
of the country's 68,000-plus police officers.</P>
      <P>Under the country's civil service law and regulations, NPA personnel officials
said, only the minister of the interior has the authority to appoint and promote
high-ranking police officers, meaning those of three-stripes-two-stars rank and
higher grades.</P>
      <P>As  to  promotion  of  police  officers  under  the three-stripes-two-stars
rank, the officials said the Ministry of the Interior tends to authorize the NPA
chief to decide on promotion. Without the MOI's authorization, the officials
insist that the Taipei county government lacks the authority to promote police
officers.</P>
      <P>Nominally, the 140 "promoted" Taipei County police officers are entitled to pay
raises ranging between NT$2,600 and NT$4,150 per month, but the Ministry of
Civil Service under the Examination Yuan has already denied the validity of
their promotions and is not expected to offer them any increased salaries.</P>

      <P>The more powerful political parties in Taiwan -- the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) -- are trying
to oppress emerging political forces, which will be detrimental to the
development of Taiwan's democracy, the leader of a newly-established party said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>"As the two-party political system is taking shape and the number of legislators
will be halved from 225 to 113, the maneuvering space for a small political
party like us has been shrinking because powerful parties are trying to limit
the development of other parties through regulation of the electoral system, "
said Jou Yi-cheng, leader of the Third Society Party (TSP) which was established
in September.</P>
      <P>As a new party, the TSP will have a hard time fielding candidates in the
upcoming legislative election. That could become still more difficult, Jou said,
referring to the latest rumors that the Central Election Committee (CEC) is
considering raising the guarantee deposit of each candidate from NT$200,000 to
NT$500,000, and the minimum number of regional legislative candidate nominations
from 10 to 20 to be listed in the party lists.</P>
      <P>If the rumors are true, the amendment of the Public Officials Election and
Recall Law will deal devastating financial and political blows to small parties
such as TSP, Jou said.</P>
      <P>The new legislature to be elected under the new "single-member constituency, two
ballots" electoral system Jan. 12, 2008 will comprise 73 regional seats, 6 seats
for aboriginals, with the remaining  34 seats to be filled  from party lists.
The 34 legislators-at-large will be elected from the lists of political parties
in proportion to the number of votes won by each party that obtains at least 5
percent of the total vote cast in the election.</P>
      <P>The more established parties should nurture emerging political forces to
cultivate a sound democratic environment, former CEC Chairman Huang Shih-cheng
said, adding that currently political parties placed their own benefit above the
welfare of the people and the country.</P>
      <P>"I would blatantly say that they are not real political parties. They are gangs.
And why would people pay taxes to subsidize gangs? " Huang asked.</P>
      <P>Taiwan needs to make up its mind to determine what is the best electoral  system
for  the  country,  said  Pan  Han-shen, Secretary-General of Green Party
Taiwan, another smaller political party. Pan said that most European electoral
systems, which are dominated  by  proportional  systems,  stress  negotiation
and consensus-seeking while the American system is more like a "cowboys' dual."</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has to know what it wants to be, " Pan said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>All those involved in the illegal solicitation of organ transplants, reportedly
connected to a visit by a Chinese medical doctor to Taiwan earlier this year,
will be punished if the results of an investigation confirm the report, a
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The council has also asked the Cabinet-level Department of Health to investigate
whether the organization that invited the Chinese medical doctor to Taiwan, and
the doctor himself, were involved in other illegal medical practices during his
stay in Taiwan, the official noted.</P>
      <P>The remarks came after the Taipei-based Liberty Times recently reported that Zhu
Zhijun, director of the organ transplant center of Tianjin First Central
Hospital in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin, visited Taiwan in March under
the cover of medical exchanges, but instead conducted assessments of liver
disease patients in the company of two Taiwanese doctors with a view towards
traveling to China for a transplant.</P>
      <P>The Tianjin hospital is touted as the biggest liver transplant center in Asia.</P>
      <P>If the reports are confirmed, Zhu could face a prison term of between six months
and five years should he ever return to Taiwan, and if the Taiwanese doctors who
helped Zhu are found to have engaged in the sale of human organs they could be
disciplined for violating medical ethics and have their licenses to practice
revoked.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the council warned the Taiwanese public of the possibility of
violating Chinese laws by having liver transplant surgeries in China, the
official said.</P>
      <P>The Chinese government outlawed the sale of human organs in May and will issue
huge fines to those who violate the laws, the official said.</P>
      <P>In addition, violators will face criminal prosecution as Chinese laws require
that a written approval be obtained from the organ donor and the organ
transplant surgery be conducted only at third-class, first-grade hospitals, a
category equivalent to Taiwan's top-grade medical centers, the official went on.</P>
      <P>Despite the Chinese government's efforts, the official said that the illegal
trade in human organs remains rampant and that organs often come from unknown
donors.</P>
      <P>International media outlets have also reported that Beijing often illegally
harvests organs from executed prisoners or Falun Gong practitioners for
transplant, the official said, urging the public to beware of possible moral and
human rights violations in receiving organ transplant in China.</P>
      <P>The MAC urged locals who intend to receive such transplants in China to consult
Taiwanese hospitals first and to work through legal channels, the official said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President blasts late presidents over loss of U.N. seat</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 25 (CNA)
10/25/07  23:24:29
(By T.C. Jiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that late President Chiang Kai-shek
should be held responsible for the country's loss of the U.N. seat in 1971 and
that his son, Chiang Ching-kuo who was the premier and the president between
1972 and 1988, failed to push for the country to reenter the U.N.</P>
      <P>Touting the government's campaign to promote the country's U.N. bid under the
name Taiwan this year, Chen criticized the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) for
continuing to push for the U.N. bid under the country's national title, the
Republic of China, describing the act as "self-deceiving."</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while attending the opening of an exhibition organized by
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and Historica Sinica on the retrospect of
the country's loss of U.N. membership and outlook for the country's quest for
U.N. seat under the name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Also present at the opening ceremony were Vice President Annette Lu and Foreign
Minister James Huang.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, which features historical and official documents and books, will
run through Nov. 1 at the National Central Library in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen said that in an act of protest against Communist China's admission into the
United Nations, Chiang Kai-shek decided to give up the country's U.N. seat.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the ROC's U.N. seat has already been taken over by the People's
Republic of China and that it is impossible to promote the country's U.N. bid
under its national title.</P>
      <P>By contrast, he said that his administration's current campaign to promote the
bid under the name Taiwan is aimed at gaining representation for the country's
23 million people in the world body, not retrieving the U.N. seat from China.</P>
      <P>He also noted that it wasn't until 1991, when former President Lee Teng-hui was
in office, that the government again sought to enter the U.N.</P>
      <P>However, over the past decade, the government's campaign to push for U.N.
membership under the national title, the Republic of China, has been proven
ineffective; he went on to describe the government's new bid under the name
Taiwan as a correct and historical step.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of a recent poll, Chen said that 75 percent of the Taiwanese
public responding to the poll regard Taiwan as an independent, sovereign
country, not as a part of China, while 85 percent think that Taiwan's
sovereignty does not cover the territory of China.</P>
      <P>On the occasion, Chen also sang the first few lines of a song honoring the
Republic of China and said that the song touts the massive area of grass in
China's Qinghai Province and the view of the Himalayan Mountain Range, which he
said are impossible for people to see in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei County promotes 140 police officers amid controversy</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 25 (CNA)
10/26/07  10:49:04
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei promoted 140 of the northern county's middle-
ranking police officers Thursday, defying repeated central government warnings
that the head of a quasi-municipality lacks the authority to advance the ranks
of policemen serving in the constituency.</P>
      <P>Chou presided over the promotion ceremony in which he presented the higher rank
-- designated by the insignia of two stripes and three stars -- to the county's
140 two-stripes-two-stars police officers.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the county's Oct. 1 upgrade to the status of a quasi-special
municipality legally authorizes the county government to promote its police
officers, Chou said the large-scale promotion exemplifies the "rule of law" and
underlines the county's resolve to improve law enforcement.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that Taipei County is the country's most populous constituency
with a population of 3.8 million and covers a vast area of land, Chou said the
county's police force assumes an unusually heavy workload and deserves more
access to promotions.</P>
      <P>Chou, a stalwart of the main opposition Kuomintang, said there will be a second,
and even a third, wave of promotions of higher-ranking police officers to boost
morale as police will have to take on additional security responsibilities with
the approach of next legislative and presidential elections in early 2008.</P>
      <P>According to amendments to the Local Government Act passed by the opposition-
controlled Legislative Yuan in May, Chou claimed that the Taipei county
government enjoys the same budget and personnel promotion rights as the
country's two existing special municipalities -- Taipei City and Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>However,  National Police Agency Director-General Hou Yu-ih reiterated  later
in  the  day  that  the  Taipei  County government-presented promotions are
invalid because the existing law does not authorize its magistrate to act in
this regard.</P>
      <P>Unless the Executive Yuan confirms that the existing special municipality
police recruitment and management regulations are applicable to a quasi-
municipality, Hou said the Taipei county government does not have a legal
authority to administer police personnel affairs.</P>
      <P>Although Ho Cheng-cheng, the NPA's personnel department chief, said previously
that the department had agreed with the Taipei county government that heads of
police precincts in the county would not be reshuffled before next year's two
crucial elections, Hou said that consensus is still subject to change.</P>
      <P>"If necessary, the county's police precinct chiefs may still be reassigned to
cater to practical needs, " Hou said, adding that stability is the top concern
and that all personnel reshuffles will take into account the overall well-being
of the country's 68,000-plus police officers.</P>
      <P>Under the country's civil service law and regulations, NPA personnel officials
said, only the minister of the interior has the authority to appoint and promote
high-ranking police officers, meaning those of three-stripes-two-stars rank and
higher grades.</P>
      <P>As  to  promotion  of  police  officers  under  the three-stripes-two-stars
rank, the officials said the Ministry of the Interior tends to authorize the NPA
chief to decide on promotion. Without the MOI's authorization, the officials
insist that the Taipei county government lacks the authority to promote police
officers.</P>
      <P>Nominally, the 140 "promoted" Taipei County police officers are entitled to pay
raises ranging between NT$2,600 and NT$4,150 per month, but the Ministry of
Civil Service under the Examination Yuan has already denied the validity of
their promotions and is not expected to offer them any increased salaries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New political party laments oppression from powerful counterparts</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  25 (CNA)
10/26/07  10:50:04
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The more powerful political parties in Taiwan -- the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) -- are trying
to oppress emerging political forces, which will be detrimental to the
development of Taiwan's democracy, the leader of a newly-established party said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>"As the two-party political system is taking shape and the number of legislators
will be halved from 225 to 113, the maneuvering space for a small political
party like us has been shrinking because powerful parties are trying to limit
the development of other parties through regulation of the electoral system, "
said Jou Yi-cheng, leader of the Third Society Party (TSP) which was established
in September.</P>
      <P>As a new party, the TSP will have a hard time fielding candidates in the
upcoming legislative election. That could become still more difficult, Jou said,
referring to the latest rumors that the Central Election Committee (CEC) is
considering raising the guarantee deposit of each candidate from NT$200,000 to
NT$500,000, and the minimum number of regional legislative candidate nominations
from 10 to 20 to be listed in the party lists.</P>
      <P>If the rumors are true, the amendment of the Public Officials Election and
Recall Law will deal devastating financial and political blows to small parties
such as TSP, Jou said.</P>
      <P>The new legislature to be elected under the new "single-member constituency, two
ballots" electoral system Jan. 12, 2008 will comprise 73 regional seats, 6 seats
for aboriginals, with the remaining  34 seats to be filled  from party lists.
The 34 legislators-at-large will be elected from the lists of political parties
in proportion to the number of votes won by each party that obtains at least 5
percent of the total vote cast in the election.</P>
      <P>The more established parties should nurture emerging political forces to
cultivate a sound democratic environment, former CEC Chairman Huang Shih-cheng
said, adding that currently political parties placed their own benefit above the
welfare of the people and the country.</P>
      <P>"I would blatantly say that they are not real political parties. They are gangs.
And why would people pay taxes to subsidize gangs? " Huang asked.</P>
      <P>Taiwan needs to make up its mind to determine what is the best electoral  system
for  the  country,  said  Pan  Han-shen, Secretary-General of Green Party
Taiwan, another smaller political party. Pan said that most European electoral
systems, which are dominated  by  proportional  systems,  stress  negotiation
and consensus-seeking while the American system is more like a "cowboys' dual."</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has to know what it wants to be, " Pan said.</P>

      <P>The primary school in eastern Taiwan whose baseball team defeated the Little
League world champion team from Japan in 1968 will try to revive its past glory
by relaunching its Little League team early next month.</P>
      <P>Yu Hsien-teh, principal of the Hongye (red leaf) Primary School, told reporters
Thursday that the school will relaunch a "Red Leaf" baseball team Nov. 3, with
the initial target of winning the championship in the 2008 Red Leaf Cup Little
League International Baseball Tournament.</P>
      <P>The school's baseball team is remembered by baseball fans for defeating the
Little League world champions, the Wakayama team from Japan, 7A-0, in a nine-
inning game played in Taipei in 1968. Baseball has become a popular sport in
Taiwan ever since.</P>
      <P>In recent years, the declining population in the school's catchment area has
resulted in shrinking enrollment and made it impossible for the school to
maintain a baseball team. At present, the school's total enrollment is only 39
students, spread over six grades.</P>
      <P>Yu said, however, that all the pupils have been training hard in baseball,
although they alone cannot form a team.</P>
      <P>The principal added that his school will work with three other neighboring
primary schools to form a "Red Leaf United Baseball Team" with the inauguration
set fir Nov. 3.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Illegal solicitation of organ transplants to be punished: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  25  (CNA)
10/26/07  10:51:58

    <TEXT>
      <P>All those involved in the illegal solicitation of organ transplants, reportedly
connected to a visit by a Chinese medical doctor to Taiwan earlier this year,
will be punished if the results of an investigation confirm the report, a
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The council has also asked the Cabinet-level Department of Health to investigate
whether the organization that invited the Chinese medical doctor to Taiwan, and
the doctor himself, were involved in other illegal medical practices during his
stay in Taiwan, the official noted.</P>
      <P>The remarks came after the Taipei-based Liberty Times recently reported that Zhu
Zhijun, director of the organ transplant center of Tianjin First Central
Hospital in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin, visited Taiwan in March under
the cover of medical exchanges, but instead conducted assessments of liver
disease patients in the company of two Taiwanese doctors with a view towards
traveling to China for a transplant.</P>
      <P>The Tianjin hospital is touted as the biggest liver transplant center in Asia.</P>
      <P>If the reports are confirmed, Zhu could face a prison term of between six months
and five years should he ever return to Taiwan, and if the Taiwanese doctors who
helped Zhu are found to have engaged in the sale of human organs they could be
disciplined for violating medical ethics and have their licenses to practice
revoked.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the council warned the Taiwanese public of the possibility of
violating Chinese laws by having liver transplant surgeries in China, the
official said.</P>
      <P>The Chinese government outlawed the sale of human organs in May and will issue
huge fines to those who violate the laws, the official said.</P>
      <P>In addition, violators will face criminal prosecution as Chinese laws require
that a written approval be obtained from the organ donor and the organ
transplant surgery be conducted only at third-class, first-grade hospitals, a
category equivalent to Taiwan's top-grade medical centers, the official went on.</P>
      <P>Despite the Chinese government's efforts, the official said that the illegal
trade in human organs remains rampant and that organs often come from unknown
donors.</P>
      <P>International media outlets have also reported that Beijing often illegally
harvests organs from executed prisoners or Falun Gong practitioners for
transplant, the official said, urging the public to beware of possible moral and
human rights violations in receiving organ transplant in China.</P>
      <P>The MAC urged locals who intend to receive such transplants in China to consult
Taiwanese hospitals first and to work through legal channels, the official said.</P>

      <P>A group of 84 members of the European Parliament released a joint statement
Thursday to express their support for Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The members representing various political groups, who have gathered in
Strasbourg, France for the European Parliament's plenary session, noted in their
statement that Taiwan is a sovereign state that has never been governed by the
People's Republic of China and that it is wrong and unfair for U.N. Secretary-
General Ban Ki-moon to claim that Taiwan is part of China and deny Taiwan's
eligibility for membership.</P>
      <P>They pointed out that in a report on China issued last September, the European
Parliament called for representation for Taiwan's 23 million people in
international organizations and that to this day, Taiwan remains excluded from
most of these organizations.</P>
      <P>Calling Taiwan a full-fledged democracy with a highly developed economy that can
make valuable contributions to the international community, the members urged
the European Union's 27 member states and other U.N. members to seriously
consider Taiwan's application for membership in the world body.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has not been represented in the United Nations since 1971, when the

      <P>Taiwan trade officials expressed grave concern at a World Trade Organization
(WTO) meeting in Geneva, Switzerland  Wednesday that Argentina has unilaterally
imposed "safeguard duties" on imports of Taiwan-made compact discs-recordable
(CD-Rs) beginning May this year.</P>
      <P>Argentina had notified the WTO that it was imposing "safeguard duties" of US$13
cents per unit in the first year (May 30, 2007 to May 29, 2008), US$11 cents in
the second year (May 30, 2008 to May 29, 2009) and US$8 cents in the third and
final year (May 30, 2009 to May 29, 2010) on CD-Rs imported from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan delegates said at the WTO Committee on Safeguards meeting held Wednesday
at the world trade regulatory body's headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland that
Taiwan is very concerned about the measure, emphasizing that it reserves its
rights under WTO rules to take "whatever step to protect the interests of its
industry."</P>
      <P>The Taiwan officials  expressed  concern  that Taiwan CD-R manufacturers and
exporters have not been given adequate opportunity for prior consultations and
to state its case; that Argentina's accusation that Taiwan charges a higher
f.o.b. price for the product was unsubstantiated; and that Argentina has failed
in establishing a causal link between imports and injury (including salary
adjustments, inflation and debt costs) to domestic industry but has attributed
the cause of the so-called "injury" to imported CD-Rs only.</P>
      <P>The officials also said that the measure has harmed the rights and interests of
Argentina's consumers. According to Argentine tallies, Taiwan-originating CD-Rs
commanded 61.29-percent share of the market in Argentina in the Jan.-July period
of this year, nearly double that of CD-Rs imported from India, which was the
second largest exporter.</P>
      <P>Responding to Taiwan's complaint, Argentine officials posted at the WTO
headquarters stressed that Argentina had given WTO member countries the
opportunity for consultations and that in fact, two rounds of talks were
conducted with Chinese Taipei -- one held in Buenos Aires and the other in
Geneva.</P>
      <P>According to WTO rules, a WTO member may restrict imports of a product
temporarily -- in other words, take "safeguard actions -- if its domestic
industry has been harmed or faces the threat of being harmed by a surge in
imports.</P>
      <P>It has been learned that Taiwan manufacturers of high-technology products have
considered establishing manufacturing plants in the four Mercosur member states
-- Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay -- in view of the huge market
potential of the region and with the aim of skirting various trade barriers.</P>

      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) urged the public Friday to
report soot-emitting vehicles in order to help safeguard the nation's air
quality.</P>
      <P>EPA officials said that it had received 50,000 reports of soot-emitting vehicles
in the first nine months of this year. Among the vehicles inspected as a result
of the reports, five percent were fined fro failing to pass inspections two
times in a row.</P>
      <P>The maximum fine for motorcycles that fail to pass the inspection is NT$6,000
(US$182), while that for diesel-fueled oversized vehicles is NT$20,000, they
said.</P>
      <P>The officials further said that according to figures released by the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications, there were 6.75 million cars and 13.8 million
motorcycles registered in Taiwan as of the end of August, for an average of one
car for every 3.4 people, and one motorcycle for every 1.7 people.</P>
      <P>There were 568 vehicles per square kilometer, showing the strain on the
environment, they added.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Huei-chuan, director general of the DOH's Department of Air Quality,
Protection and Noise Control, said that diesel-fueled trucks had the highest
failure ratio in the inspections, followed by two-stroke motorcycles.</P>
      <P>The diesel-fueled trucks normally emit black smoke, and the two-stroke
motorcycles usually emit white smoke, and the soot they cause has been the
largest source of pollutants found in trees that line sidewalks, he said.</P>
      <P>Hsiao noted that a prize-drawing activity to encourage the public to report soot
emission has entered its eighth year, adding that it is gratifying to see that
the participation rate has gradually increased and that the ratio of vehicles
failing the inspection has decreased.</P>
      <P>Hsiao noted that around 4,300 people are eligible to join a draw for the 1,127
prizes this year, including LCD televisions, digital video cameras, bicycles and
digital cameras. The names of the winners will be posted on the EPA's Web site
at http://polcar.epa.gov.tw soon, she added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan businesses should shift their focus from production to intangible assets
such as intellectual property right and brands to enhance their international
competitiveness, Industrial Technology Research Institute of Taiwan Chairman Lin
Hsin-I said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, with stiffer competition from developing countries such as
China, Vietnam and India where production costs are relatively low, it is
crucial for Taiwan to develop a branding strategy to persuade international
buyers to spend 10 percent to 20 percent more to purchase Taiwan's products.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan businesses always concentrated on production and neglected
marketing and branding in the past, Lin said businesses should now take
advantage of marketing and branding, make good use of the international division
of labor, outsource the production of products with low added value, and allow
domestic production of competitive products.</P>
      <P>Lin pointed out that "quality, brand names and taste" are what customers are
looking for and that a lot of effort is required to make consumers develop trust
in and preference for a particular product.</P>
      <P>He said branding is a "national affair" that requires the participation of the
entire nation and cannot rely solely on the support of certain funds established
by the government.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks while addressing the Branding Taiwan Forum 2007 held in

      <P>Former Premier Yu Shyi-kun was acquitted of defamation charges Friday over his
reference to the opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) acquired assets as "loot"
during his premiership in 2004.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court rejected an appeal by the KMT, upholding a previous ruling
by the Taipei District Court in which Yu was determined not guilty,  on the
grounds that the controversies surrounding the KMT's assets are issues open for
public comment and that Yu only made the comment passively while responding to
related questions.</P>
      <P>At issue was a statement made by Yu Oct. 5, 2004, during an interpellation
session in the Legislative Yuan, when he was asked about the Cabinet's effort to
reclaim the KMT's "ill-gotten" assets.</P>
      <P>In his reply, Yu said the assets were like "loot, " which he claimed would
remain illicit regardless of who were to receive them. Yu made similar remarks
while receiving interviews by the media Oct. 21 and Nov. 9.</P>
      <P>In his testimony during the trial, Yu said he used the term "loot" to refer to
the KMT's assets because an investigative report by the Control Yuan had already
determined that many of the party's assets were embezzled from the government
during the party's 55-year rule of Taiwan and that it was not his intent to
slander the KMT.</P>

      <P>China should resume negotiations with Taiwan on issues concerning the operation
of cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights and visits to Taiwan by Chinese tourists
to show its sincerity in improving relations between the two sides, Mainland

      <P>Chen made the remarks during a Taipei seminar on the situation in cross-strait

      <P>Noting that Taiwan considers the two policies to be milestones paving the way

predicted that direct cross-strait transportation will be achieved within one
year of the implementation of the policies.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, representatives of Taiwan and China have held many rounds of

      <P>The Taipei District Court said Friday that the trial of Vice President Annette
Lu and two other heavyweights of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
over "special allowance fund" misuse has been set for next month.</P>
      <P>Lu's trial is set for Nov. 19, while the trial of Yu Shyi-kun, former DPP
chairman, is set for Nov. 26 and that of Tan Sun Chen, secretary-general of the
National Security Council, for Dec. 3.</P>
      <P>An investigation task force of the Supreme Prosecutor's Office announced last
month the completion of an extensive probe into the use of "special allowance
funds" by the trio, as well as that of Frank Hsieh, DPP presidential candidate,
and his running mate Su Tseng-chang.</P>
      <P>Lu, Yu and Chen were indicted on charges of forgery and embezzlement  for
collecting  invoices  from  others  to claim reimbursement from the "special
allowance funds." Hsieh and Su were cleared after a thorough probe, the
prosecution said.</P>
      <P>The indictment said that from December 2000 to May 2006, staff of Lu's office
and her guards collected 1,005 invoices worth NT$5.63 million (US$169,580) to
claim reimbursement from her "special allowance fund."</P>
      <P>Yu's wife, Yang Pao-yu, Yu's staff during his premiership, and his guards
allegedly collected 516 invoices to claim NT$2.38 million from his special fund
between October 2000 and December 2005, the prosecution said.</P>
      <P>Tan  Sun  Chen,  who  has served  as Presidential  Office secretary-general and
as minister of foreign affairs, is said to have used his staff in those two
posts to collect 106 invoices to claim NT$368,199 from his fund between July
2004 and June 2006.</P>
      <P>The prosecution explained that Hsieh and Su were spared because they deposited
their "special allowance funds" into their bank accounts during their terms of
service as Kaohsiung mayor and Taipei county magistrate, respectively, but the
funds withdrawn from the accounts were greater than the amount of "special
allowance funds" deposited into the accounts.</P>
      <P>During their terms as premier, and Su's term as secretary-general of the
Presidential Office, both claimed their "special allowance funds" in the form of
cash, so there is no way for the prosecution to trace the money.</P>
      <P>After reviewing the income tax returns and the personal asset reports filed by
the two over the years, the prosecution found no abnormal increases in their
personal wealth.</P>
      <P>Because defendants do not have to make statements unfavorable to themselves  or
submit evidence to prove their innocence,  the prosecution could not prove that
they used part of the funds for non-official purposes.</P>
      <P>All executives holding public office are given a "special allowance fund" every
month. Although the use of the money is left to the discretion of the
administrative chief, half of the fund can be spent without any proof of
spending, while use of the other half must be substantiated with receipts or
invoices.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Agriculture experts working for the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA)
are making efforts to persuade farmers in central and southern Taiwan to grow
cover and compost crops on fallow land in order to reap multiple benefits.</P>
      <P>According to the Tainan District Agricultural Research and Extension Station,
its experts have been assisting farmers in the counties of Yunlin, Chiayi and
Tainan to grow crops suitable for mulching, such as sunflowers, common cosmos,
yellow cosmos and zinnias.</P>
      <P>The program, already under way in more than a dozen rural townships, will not
only create beautiful landscapes and promote tourism agriculture, but will also
increase soil fertility and help achieve sustainable farming.</P>
      <P>The experts believe that soil should never be left fallow because this makes it
vulnerable to erosion and weed invasion. Instead, they say, growing a compost
crop, termed as "green manure," is as easy as throwing out a handful of seed
onto freshly cultivated ground and simply covering it with a thin layer of soil.</P>
      <P>Flowering can be expected 40-60 days after sowing, and the stunning blossoms can
last from two or three weeks up to three months, beautifying the landscape.</P>
      <P>In addition to providing a feast for the eye, cover and compost crops can
suppress weeds, increase the soil's available nitrogen and moisture retention,
prevent soil erosion and interrupt pest and disease cycles in much the same way
as crop rotation, according to the experts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Over 80% of Japanese supports Taiwan's U.N. bid: president</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that over 80 percent of Japanese citizens
would support Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations if a proposed referendum
to ask Taiwanese voters whether the country should apply for U.N. membership
under the name Taiwan passes next year.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while speaking at a meeting of the Rotary Club of
Taipei.</P>
      <P>Quoting the results of a recent opinion poll to explore Japanese citizens'
attitude toward Taiwan's U.N. bid, Chen said that 74 percent of Japanese people
responding to the survey are in favor of Taiwan's U.N. membership and that the
percentage of proponents would even increase to 81 percent if the proposed
referendum on the bid passes next year.</P>
      <P>With such a high level of support for Taiwan's bid among the Japanese, he said
Taiwan should have more confidence in itself. When a referendum proposal
initiated by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is put to a vote
alongside the March 22 presidential election next year, the president urged
Taiwan's citizens to cast their votes in support of the proposal.</P>
      <P>He again criticized a proposal by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) to apply
for r-joining the United Nations under the nation's official name, the Republic
of China, or other "pragmatic names, " which he described as "self-deceiving."</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the ROC's U.N. seat has already been taken over by the People's
Republic of China and that it is impossible to promote the country's U.N. bid
under its official title.</P>
      <P>The president also said that in an earlier poll of Americans, 55 percent of
Americans said they support Taiwanese membership in the United Nations, and that
if a referendum on Taiwan's bid passes next year, that support rate will
increase to 70 percent.</P>

      <P>A Canadian beef festival opened in Taipei Friday to officially celebrate the
lifting of an import ban of more than four years on Canadian beef out of concern
over mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan government's decision to lift the ban is very much appreciated, said
George Groeneveld, minister of agriculture and food of the government of
Alberta, the province from which 95 percent of Taiwan's imported Canadian beef
came from prior to the ban.</P>
      <P>Taiwan re-opened its doors to Canadian boneless beef from cattle under 30 months
of age in a partial lifting June 23, more than four years after an import ban on
beef from Canada, the United States, Japan, Britain and several other European
countries was announced Dec. 31, 2003 amid fears over the threat of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, also known as mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>"The safety of meat products is ensured by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency
of the government of Canada, based on scientific principles and consistent with
applicable international standards and rules, " said Ron McIntyre, director of
the Canadian Trade Office in Taipei.</P>
      <P>In 2003, Taiwan was Canada's fifth-largest export market for beef. Overall,
Taiwan is Canada's fourth-largest market in Asia for agriculture products, said

      <P>The Vienna Boys Choir has arrived in Taiwan in preparation for seven
performances to be staged in northern, central and southern Taiwan from Oct. 27,
according to a spokesman for the Lawrence S. Ting Memorial Fund, which is
organizing the tour.</P>
      <P>At a news conference held Thursday to promote the tour, the choir performed the
popular Chinese folk song "Jasmine, " which, along with another Chinese song,
will be featured in the program to bring the choir closer to Taiwanese
audiences.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the news conference, conductor Kerem Sezen said singing in Chinese
is easy for the boys compared to the hardships they have to endure during their
grueling travel schedule and countless hours of practice.</P>
      <P>Sezen said that through  physical  training  and aesthetic cultivation, he finds
children's abilities to be beyond imagination. He also expressed hope that Asian
audiences will learn more about European musical culture through the beauty of
the boys' voices.</P>
      <P>A youth ensemble affiliated with the Taiwan-based Syinlu Welfare Foundation, a
group dedicated to helping people with mental or physical disabilities,  also
staged a performance at the news conference to welcome the European choir.
Foundation CEO Sung Chin-yi said singing is a good way to help the disabled
express their emotions while demonstrating their skills and abilities.</P>
      <P>The event organizer will provide free tickets to the Nov. 2 performance at the
Taipei National Concert Hall for underprivileged groups.</P>
      <P>Founded in 1948, the Vienna Boys Choir is one of the oldest and best known

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) has adopted several measures to stabilize hog
and feed prices amid the surge in corn prices in international markets and a
glut of pigs in the domestic market, a COA official said Friday.</P>
      <P>The official noted that while corn and oil prices have been increasing, hog
prices have been dropping, leading to a sharp decline in hog farmers' profits.
Some farmers have claimed that they are going to quit raising pigs, he added.</P>
      <P>In order to stabilize hog prices, the COA has asked the Fair Trade Commission
(FTC) to investigate whether some traders have monopolized the country's cereal
market.</P>
      <P>In addition, the COA has adopted several measures to remedy the situation,
including releasing 50,000 metric tons of unpolished rice as hog feed and asking
the Animal Technology Institute Taiwan (ATIT) to help hog farmers replace their
feed formula with other cereals.</P>
      <P>Other measures include importing of corn from China on a case-by-case basis and
increasing corn imports from other countries to help reduce the impact on the

      <P>Officials of the Cabinet-level Fair Trade Commission (FTC) said Friday that they
will investigate whether there has been any manipulation of rice prices by
traders on the local market.</P>
      <P>The officials made the announcement after media reports said that rice

this month, resulting in a surge in rice prices, with the price of wet rice
rising to NT$5.43 per kilogram in central and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The average price of wet rice oscillated between NT$4.51 and NT$5.12 in July.</P>
      <P>It was reported that some traders have conspired to increase the price of wet
rice in several stages. As a result, dry rice will be far more expensive than
wet rice after additional costs of drying and husking are taken into account.</P>

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Friday that the opening of a new free cable adult
TV channel could have a negative impact on the younger generation.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks while fielding questions from opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Legislator Hsu Chung-hsiung at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>His remarks came after the Apple Daily recently reported that the National
Communications Commission (NCC) ,  Taiwan's top media regulator, had granted an
operating licence to a cable TV system, Star-Winged Corp., to run a new
satellite channel to provide free pornographic programs on basic cable TV
broadcasting.</P>
      <P>Chang said the Executive Yuan has no right to interfere with the NCC's decision
to issue the licence because the NCC is independent of the Executive Yuan's
jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Noting that as there are many double-income families in Taiwan, it would be
impossible for working parents to prevent their children from watching the
channel, Hsu demanded to know how the Ministry of the Interior plans to respond
to the controversial issue.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Lee Yi-yang said his ministry also opposes the NCC's decision
from the point of view of protecting children and teenagers, but said it is
difficult for the ministry to negotiate with the NCC as it is not under the
Cabinet's control.</P>
      <P>NCC Chairman Su Yeong-chin defended the issuance of the license, describing it
as an individual case and claiming that it is not a new policy nor a free
channel.</P>
      <P>Su argued that the lawmaker was commenting on exaggerated and false media
reports. "There is no point in having a discussion based on wrong information,"
he added.</P>
      <P>According to Su, no R-rated pornographic programs will be permitted to be aired
on the new channel and the NCC will issue fines to the operator according to
relevant laws in the event of any transgressions.</P>
      <P>Later, when fielding questions from ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Legislator Chen Ying, Su said the NCC issued the license based on existing laws
and policies.</P>
      <P>He also said the channel will be encoded, which requires the purchase of a set-
top decoder box to view its programs.</P>
      <P>Su also said that if lawmakers and the public think it is necessary to review
the existing laws and policies, the NCC will be "willing to do that."</P>

      <P>A Taiwan business leader in Japan told Chiayi Magistrate Chen Ming-wen Friday
that he will donate a batch of cherry saplings to further beautify the landscape
in the Alishan National Scenic Area.</P>
      <P>Kin Man Hayashi, 93, president of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Japan, made
the pledge to Chen while paying the magistrate a courtesy call at County Hall.</P>
      <P>Mayashi, who has resided in Japan for 67 years, said he has found a cherry
variety suitable for growing in the mountainous Alishan area.</P>
      <P>He noted that although Alishan is already well-known for the blooming of cherry
flowers in spring, some of the trees are aging and suffering from disease, and
that the young trees he will donate to Chiayi County can inject new vitality to
Alishan's beauty.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed his appreciation to Mayashi and instructed county government
agriculture officials to conduct an evaluation with regard to the environment,
the cherry variety, the quantity needed and related quarantine issues.</P>

      <P>The Chinese government should allow its Internet users to gain free access to
Taiwan's news Web sites to demonstrate its sincerity toward Taiwan, a Mainland
Affairs Council official said Friday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun renewed the council's call to China on the issue
at a regular news conference.</P>
      <P>Liu said there is a serious imbalance in information exchanges between Taiwan
and China due to Beijing's tight control over Chinese people's access to
Taiwanese news Web sites.</P>
      <P>He noted that the distance between Taiwan and China has resulted in different
mentalities and living backgrounds on the two sides, which have resulted in
cross-strait misunderstandings.</P>
      <P>The most direct and effective way for people in China to understand their
Taiwanese counterparts is to visit Taiwanese Web sites in addition to visiting
Taiwan personally, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics released by the Chinese government in July, Liu said China has
162 million Internet users, the second-largest number in the world after that of
the United States.</P>
      <P>The Internet penetration rate in China, however, was a mere 12.3 percent in that
month, which is much lower than the world average of 17.6 percent, Liu went on.</P>
      <P>Liu also pointed out that the rate has grown rapidly in the past six months and
that the increased percentage is close to that of the whole of last year.</P>
      <P>Despite the growing need for information in China, the Beijing authorities have
a tight grip on local media and present only select and partial images of Taiwan
on Chinese media, which he said does not help Chinese people get a complete
picture of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>To reduce the gap between Taiwan and China, people on both sides need to have
long-term and direct exchanges of information, Liu noted.</P>
      <P>There are also many Taiwanese people in China who need Internet access to
Taiwanese media to know the situation in Taiwan, Liu said, adding that China has
no right to deprive them of the right to knowledge and the connection to their
home country.</P>
      <P>The Chinese government recently formed a special Internet police task force and
shut down a number of Chinese Web sites, which Liu said is a disappointing
development that shows the world Beijing has not fulfilled its promises made
after winning the right to host the 2008 Olympics Games to improve press
freedom.</P>

      <P>A multinational electronics company in the northern county of Taoyuan is being
probed for allegedly using pirated software with a combined value of over NT$30
million (US$920,527) , a spokesman for the Taiwan chapter of the Business
Software Alliance (BSA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The BSA spokesman urged local firms to attach more importance to the use of
legal software and warned corporate employees not to become accomplices in their
employers' violation of intellectual property rights (IPR).</P>
      <P>The BSA is an organization dedicated to promoting a safe and legal digital
world.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said IPR protection police raided the headquarters of the company
-- which he did not identify -- a day earlier and found unauthorized software
installed on the company's computers.</P>
      <P>Local prosecutors were questioning the owner of the company and the employees
about their roles in the IPR violations, the spokesman went on.</P>
      <P>The company has offices in the United States and China and has approximately 100
employees, the spokesman said, noting that the company has been previously
awarded the ISO 9001:2000 certification.</P>
      <P>Warning that using pirated software can result in criminal and civil charges,
the spokesman said the company might have to pay damages of up to NT$1 million
for each pirated software license and will also need to purchase legal versions
of the software.</P>
      <P>Speaking of similar cases in the past, the spokesman noted that enterprise
owners often attempt to pass the blame by accusing their employees of illegally
downloading pirated software, which some employees have been found guilty of.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the BSA's Taiwan chapter launched an online poll on its Web
site Oct. 16 in an effort to raise local office workers' awareness about their
role in the use of pirated software at work.</P>
      <P>The Web site has received nearly 180,000 visits since then, the spokesman noted.</P>
      <P>In addition, he went on, up to 76 percent of the 50,000 office workers who have

companies' failure to use authorized software to the authorities.</P>

      <P>Department of Health (DOH) officials urged the public Friday to remember to wash
their hands before and after visiting patients in hospitals to prevent
infection, as survey results show that more than 30 percent of the public fail
to do so.</P>
      <P>The officials made the appeal after the release of the results of a survey
conducted by the Taiwan Joint Commission on Hospital Accreditation (TJCHA) that
show only 47.5 percent of the public wash their hands before and after visiting
patients in hospitals.</P>
      <P>The DOH and the TJCHA have set the fourth week of October as "Patient Safety
Week, " focusing this year on the importance of frequent hand-washing among the
general public.</P>
      <P>According to the TJCHA survey, 73 percent of the people surveyed believe it
unnecessary to wash their hands before having a medical checkup, while 47
percent said they would not remind doctors to wash their hands after attending
other patients.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted via telephone among 1,068 adults around Taiwan early
this month.</P>
      <P>Chang Shan-chwen, director of the division of infectious diseases of National
Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH), noted that between 80 percent and 90 percent
of infections in hospitals are contact infections.</P>
      <P>Noting that it is easy for medical personnel to become infection channels, Chang
stressed the importance of promoting hand-washing among hospital staff.</P>
      <P>Chang said NTUH has been promoting the correct way to wash hands since the
severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak of 2003, a move that has caused the
infection rate in hospitals to drop from 5.3 percent in 2006 to 4.7 percent at
present.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Rice prices to remain stable: food agency officials</HEADLINE>

      <P>Thanks to abundant stocks of rice in state-controlled stockpiles, rice prices on
the domestic market will remain stable in the coming months, officials of the
Agriculture and Food Agency (AFC) under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
said Friday.</P>
      <P>The AFC officials made the remarks after local media reported earlier that day
that rice prices are expected to increase by some 10 percent from next month --
the latest in a string of price hikes in food, gasoline and daily necessities in
recent months.</P>
      <P>At present, the government still has stockpiles of around 500,000 tons of rice
harvested last year that can be provided at any time to meet local demand if
prices increase unreasonably, the officials said, adding that crop prices in
October averaged NT$18.21 per kilogram -- 5percent down from the previous year's
level.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that rice harvests last year fell short of production targets,
bumper crops this year have helped offset the gap, the AFC officials explained.</P>
      <P>They stressed that they are closely watching rice price changes on a daily basis
and will immediately release stockpiled rice onto the market to protect
consumers' interests and ensure fair trade should it become necessary.</P>
      <P>Traders will be subject to punishment  by the Fair Trade Commission if they are
caught manipulating rice prices or hoarding supplies to make extra profit, they
said.</P>

      <P>The government should immediately conduct an evaluation of the mental health of
all guards serving in crucial posts where the president and vice president live
or work, a ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislator said Friday.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Chuang Ho-tzu said armed security guards and bodyguards assigned
to protect the national leaders and who are found to be mentally unstable, to
have obtained their positions through the efforts of political lobbyists, or who
are not up to their jobs should be "retrained."</P>
      <P>Chuang made the suggestions in the wake of an incident involving a military
guard at President Chen Shui-bian's residence who shot himself with his own
pistol early Friday.</P>
      <P>The officer, identified as Capt. Lu Tseng-hsiang from the National Security
Bureau (NSB), was on guard duty at the presidential residence on Nanchang Road
in downtown Taipei when he shot himself.</P>
      <P>The officer was immediately rushed to the nearby National Taiwan University
Hospital at around 8: 30 a.m. but despite several hours of emergency treatment,
the hospital authorities declared him dead at 12:20 p.m.</P>
      <P>NSB officials said later in a news release that Lu may have been suffering from
depression due to a failed relationship.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the latest suicide, Chuang said the NSB, the Coast Guard
Administration and other security agencies should draft a set of criteria to
help regulate their staff in order to prevent further suicide attempts or fatal
shootings.</P>
      <P>Chuang spelled out seven points which she claimed would help the agencies draw
up guidelines to help monitor staff: Watch their physical strength when they
drill; observe their movements and sounds while they are asleep; inspect the
amount of food they eat; listen to their tone of voice when they make phone
calls; examine their luggage when they leave their barracks; and examine their
expressions when they return.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  DPP Legislator Lin Chin-hsing pointed out that presidential
bodyguards are only human and are just as susceptible to depression caused by
failed relationships as anyone else. He called for higher-ranking security
authorities to pay closer attention to this aspect of the lives of key personnel
to reduce the possibility of suicide by bodyguards who have ready access to
weapons.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Web site established to help push for democracy for Myanmar has received more
than 20,000 online signatures from supporters, Vice President Annette Lu said
Friday.</P>
      <P>The Web site was established  under the framework of the Democratic Pacific
Union (DPU) , an international body founded by Lu in 2005 and currently chaired
by her with an aim to promote "democracy, peace, and prosperity" in the Asia-
Pacific region and the world.</P>
      <P>Lu said many parliamentarians from other countries have also posted video
announcements showing support for democracy for Myanmar via the Web site.</P>
      <P>She expressed hope that the Web site will draw more and more people to speak out
for democracy for the junta-ruled Southeast Asian country.</P>
      <P>Lu said the DPU will hold a seminar next week to introduce Myanmar's history,
political system and economy to let Taiwan people and the international
community have a better understanding of the Myanmarese people's efforts in
striving for democracy.</P>
      <P>The DPU will also invite students from other Asian countries studying in Taiwan
to participate in a seminar Nov. 8-9 in which the DPU will introduce Taiwan's
democratization and exchange views with the students on democratic developments
in Asia.</P>
      <P>She said Taiwan's experience with democracy will be beneficial to other Asian
countries that are still struggling for their own democratic systems and
explained that many Taiwan people who have studied in Japan, America or Europe
have been nurtured by those countries' democracies and have later made
contributions to Taiwan's democratization.</P>
      <P>Lu called on the international community to help Myanmarese refugees and send

      <P>Taoyuan County Magistrate Chu Li-lun visited the Legislative Yuan Friday and
called for a swift passage of a bill to upgrade the status and functions of the
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, the country's main gateway.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference in the Legislative Yuan, Chu said that the 30
-year-old airport, formerly known as the Chiang Kai-shek International  Airport,
needs  to  effectively  sharpen  its competitiveness as its ranking has dropped
to 85th place among the world's 136 major airports.</P>
      <P>The airport must be made into a legally and professionally incorporated compound
comprising a multinational business operations hub, a free trade zone,
warehousing and distribution facilities, exhibition centers, tourism hotels,
shopping malls and high-tech science park, so as to avoid being shunted aside
and again become globally competitive, Chu said.</P>
      <P>Driven by that goal, Chu said, he crafted a program to create a "Taoyuan
Aviation Park", to be located in a 6,150-hectare land plot adjacent to the
airport that could house eight different areas and attract over NT$1.2 trillion
(US$37 billion) worth of investment, creating an annual business revenue of at
least NT$600 billion and more than 80,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng addressed the occasion, hailing the
"Taoyuan Aviation Park" bill prepared and submitted by Chu is an original and
creative idea which will not only boost Taoyuan County's development but also
galvanize Taiwan's entire economy.</P>
      <P>To iron out a comprehensive bill allowing for the building of a state-of-the-art
aviation park -- although that task could not possibly be accomplished during
his second tenure -- Chu has in recent years traveled to Japan, the United
States and South Korea, where he inspected modern airports in search of new
ideas, Wang noted.</P>
      <P>Wang called for support of legislators from all political parties for the
proposal and the rapid passage of the bill before the end of the current
legislative session.</P>
      <P>To date, 113 legislators, half of the total number of lawmakers, have endorsed
the bill, which was referred to the Legislative Yuan Friday afternoon for

      <P>Law-enforcement personnel have seized more than 200 kg of ketamine from a
container in Keelung Port and have arrested seven suspects, a spokesman for the
Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau said Friday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said agents from a local Marine Affairs Office of the
Investigation Bureau, along with customs officials and military police,
searched the Keelung container terminal after workers reported seeing
suspicious-looking white powder leaking from a container.</P>
      <P>They discovered 227.6 kg of ketamine with a street value of NT$100 million in 48
boxes of goods in the suspect container. According to the spokesman, the drugs
would have been "enough for consumption by 1 million addicts."</P>
      <P>The agents arrested the owner of the cargo but would only identify him by the
surname Lin. They later tracked down the mastermind behind the smuggling
operation, surnamed Cheng, along with five accomplices.</P>
      <P>The suspects were referred to the Keelung Public Prosecutors Office on charges
of violating the Narcotics Endangerment Prevention Act and the Act for the
Control and Punishment of Smuggling.</P>
      <P>Ketamine, a rapid-acting dissociative anesthetic used on both animals and
humans, is being abused by an increasing number of young people as a "club
drug." It can produce hallucinogenic effects and impaired perception in a user.
It can also elicit an out-of-body or near-death experience and can render the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu proposed Friday making Taiwan's offshore islands into
cross-Taiwan Strait passenger and cargo transshipment hubs so as to offset the
lack of direct links between Taiwan proper and China.</P>
      <P>Lu  made  the  proposal  during  a seminar  with  company representatives at an
industrial park in Tucheng City in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Using offshore islands, such as Kinmen and Matsu, to serve as transshipping
points between Taiwan proper and China would be a step forward from the existing
"mini links," which refer to direct ferry and trade services maintained between
Taiwan's Kinmen and Matsu islands and Xiamen, Mawei and Quanzhou ports in
China's Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>As China has not forsworn using force against Taiwan, national security remains
a key concern for the government despite the fact that many Taiwan businesses
have relocated to China, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Currently, more than 71 percent of Taiwan's overseas investment goes to China --
a situation which she said imperils Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The local trade and business community has long called for the establishment of
full direct transportation, trade and postal links between Taiwan proper and
China, and many Taiwan-based companies have moved their operations to China due
to that factor.</P>

      <P>The head of the Directorate General of Customs (DGC) expressed his wish Friday
that the number of sniffer dogs used by customs offices can be increased from
the existing six to 80 in five or six years to reinforce efforts to crack down
on drug smuggling.</P>
      <P>Of the six sniffer dogs on active duty, DGC Director-General Chien Liang-chi
said, two serve with the Kaohsiung Customs Office and the other four work for
the Taipei office.</P>
      <P>Chien praised the sniffer dogs' excellent performance in cracking drug smuggling
attempts at airports.</P>
      <P>According to Kaohsiung Customs Office statistics, the combined value of heroin,
ketamine and amphetamine seized by customs officials accounted for 7.2 percent
of all seized smuggled cargo during the first nine months of this year, making
drugs the third-largest smuggled cargo following tobacco/liquor and Chinese
agricultural products.</P>
      <P>The office attributes the result to increasing demand for drugs, as the
population of addicts has been rising for several years, customs officials said.</P>

step in this direction will be to build an R.C. airplane museum at the defunct
Shuinan Airport terminal.</P>
      <P>Hu made the announcement at the opening of the third Taichung aviation festival
being held at Shuinan Airport, which drew crowds of visitors on its first day.</P>
      <P>In his address, Hu said his idea to develop the industry in Taichung was
inspired by the large number of people attending the inauguration ceremony for
the two-day festival.</P>
      <P>He said the city has enough space and resources for the sector's development,
referring to the old terminal of Shuinan Airport, which has been left idle since
relocation of the city's commercial flight services to Chingchuankang a few

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Representative to the United States Joseph Wu said Friday that
the United States observes a flexible "one China" policy that is not based on
the premise that Taiwan is part of China.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks when he analyzed Taiwan-U.S. relations from the perspectives
of Taiwan's strategic security stance, economic strength and democratic politics
and the more complex Taiwan-U.S. relations in the wake of a rising China. He was
speaking at the invitation of the Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule
of Law of Stanford University in California.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, those who lack an understanding of Washington's "one China"
policy might think it is identical to that of Beijing "one China" principle.
However, they could not be more wrong, he said.</P>
      <P>The U.S. has adopted a flexible approach in handling its relations with China
and Taiwan, an approach that is not based on the premise that Taiwan is part of
China, as advocated by China, said Wu.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the United States observes a "one China" policy with its own
interpretation of what it means. He did not elaborate, but could have been
referring to the fact that Washington "acknowledges" Chinese advocacy that there
is one only China and that Taiwan is part of China, although it does not
necessarily accept or embrace Beijing's advocacy, and that the U.S. has always
encouraged the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to resolve their differences
through peaceful dialogue.</P>
      <P>He dismissed a "peace agreement" overture offered by Chinese President Hu Jintao
for the two sides of the Taiwan Strait at the opening of the Communist Party of
China National Congress Oct. 15.</P>
      <P>Wu also noted that Hu used the word "democracy" 61 times during his speech and
proposed conducting negotiations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
under the framework of Beijing's "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>Wu said the "one China" principle is a pitfall set for Taiwan by China and that
Beijing is simply using the rhetoric to suppress Taiwan internationally.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Home is "the place where the family bones lie," opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday when he voiced his love for
Taiwan and his identity with the country.</P>
      <P>Ma, a former KMT chairman, was born in Hong Kong in 1950 to parents who were
post-war immigrants from China. His father is buried in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Addressing the idea of "Taiwan identity, " Ma cited a speech titled "Who are the
French? " made by French President Nicolas Sarkozy during his presidential
election campaign earlier in this year.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Sarkozy said that "what makes us French is not only that we were
born in France but also that we choose to stay in France."</P>
      <P>Sarkozy is the son of a Hungarian immigrant father and his mother is the
daughter of a Greek immigrant. Sarkozy's family "was not born in France but
decided to stay in that country because they love France and the people who live
there," Ma said.</P>
      <P>"They are French people because they chose to fight alongside people living in
that land for a better life, " Ma added, asking "why cannot we do what the
French can? " referring to bickering between the weishengren -- people who
immigrated from China to Taiwan near the end of the Civil War in 1949 and their
descendants -- and the benshengren, who came to Taiwan from China hundreds of
years ago.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China government has existed in Taiwan for 57 years since its
relocation by the KMT administration from China in 1949, Ma said, citing a local
poet who wrote: "homeland is where a man has stayed for long."</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu claimed Saturday that Taiwan's exports of agricultural
produce to China have "proved to be nothing but a pipe-dream" and a "hoax."</P>
      <P>According to the vice president, a majority of Chinese people "cannot afford" to
buy Taiwan agricultural produce even if the quality is superior.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks as she visited the opening of an agricultural exhibition  in
central Taiwan's  Yunlin County.  The three-day exhibition,  which features the
latest agricultural  machinery, seedlings, and technology exchanges, has
attracted more than 300 manufacturers.</P>
      <P>She noted that China offers tax-free treatment for certain items of farm produce
from Taiwan, which lured a lot of Taiwanese farmers into exporting their premium
produce to China.</P>
      <P>The Chinese authorities have held promotions for the Taiwanese produce, but
Chinese people cannot afford to buy it, while Chinese farmers have simply stolen
the brands of Taiwanese agricultural produce, promoting inferior Chinese items
as coming from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Those who have a conscience should not promote the export of agricultural
produce to China but should eye the rest of the world by moving toward high-tech
agriculture," Lu said.</P>
      <P>She said agriculture is no longer a traditional industry and that it should work
with technology to upgrade quality, build brand names and pay attention to
safety.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has premium agriculture, " she said, adding that although China's
farming population is as high as 900 million, they are mostly illiterate.</P>
      <P>In comparison, Taiwan's 900,000 farmers are knowledgeable, which gives the
country's agriculture the edge, she added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) is planning to set up a national nutrition
foundation that will conduct a nutrition census and provide nutritional
education, a health official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Cheng Huei-wen, director-general of the DOH Bureau of Food Safety, noted that
nutrition of the populace is a major indicator of a nation's progress and said
the DOH will push for a national nutrition bill to provide the basis for the
establishment of a nutrition foundation.</P>
      <P>Cheng noted that the DOH has conducted six nutrition censuses since 1981.
However, there have been disruptions during these years due to lack of funds,
age or ethnic groups, so that the DOH has not been able to match its
counterparts in the United States and Japan, which have conducted continuous and
comprehensive censuses every year.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the nation's nutrition census and education has to rely on
stable financial support, which is why the DOH is now planning to collect 0.01
percent of the turnover of the country's food and nutrition product
manufacturers to finance the foundation.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the DOH has decided to adopt the premise that "those who use it
should pay, " the idea being that the food and nutrition product manufacturers
will pass on their extra costs to consumers, so that it will actually be the
public that has to pay for the foundation.</P>
      <P>He said that based on the combined turnover of food manufacturers of around
NT$600 billion in 2006, the DOH can collect NT$60 million a year, which he said
will be enough to finance the expenses for a nutrition census and various
nutritional education activities.</P>
      <P>A continuous census on public nutrition is urgently needed, Cheng said, noting
that it will allow the DOH to see the changes in public nutrition.</P>
      <P>He noted that eating habits have undergone dramatic changes over the past
decade, caused by the number of people eating out surging and newly arrived
immigrants introducing their own cooking styles, while society is ageing and
fewer children are being born, all of which are playing roles in the changes of
public health.</P>
      <P>He said the DOH is hammering out the draft of a national nutrition bill and
estimated that it can be sent to the Executive Yuan by the end of the year and
that the Legislative Yuan can start to review the draft bill in the new session
that will begin next February.</P>

      <P>No disciplinary measures will be taken prior to the completion of a thorough
probe into the suicide of a security guard at President Chen Shui-bian's
official residence, a Presidential Office spokesman said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lee Nan-yang, director of the Public Affairs Department of the Presidential
Office, made the remarks after a local newspaper reported that the National
Security Bureau (NSB) held a meeting late Friday to discuss discipline for
officials accountable for the security incident sparked by the suicide of Capt.
Lu Tseng-hsiang earlier that day.</P>
      <P>According to the Apple Daily, NSB Director Shi Hwei-yow proposed during the
meeting that he himself should be disciplined over the tragic incident.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the paper claimed, Maj. Gen. Chi Tai-lai, a division chief with the
NSB's special service center, will be given a demerit and Fu Yung-mao, the
Presidential Office's deputy chief aide-de-camp, who concurrently heads the
security office at Chen's official residence, will also be subject to
administrative discipline.</P>
      <P>The NSB, which is responsible for presidential security, has made no
announcement regarding disciplinary measures.</P>
      <P>Asked about his views on the Apple Daily report, Lee said the NSB and military
prosecution authorities are investigating the case.</P>
      <P>"The cause of the incident and other relevant details must first be clarified, "
Lee said, adding that the NSB will hammer out disciplinary measures only after
it has ascertained all the relevant details.</P>
      <P>Hsu Li-meng, deputy commander of the NSB's Special Service Center, echoed Lee's
views, saying that the NSB will not deal with disciplinary issues until after
military prosecutors have finalized their investigation  and relevant legal
proceedings  have been completed.</P>
      <P>He also dismissed a rumor that the scene of the suicide was compromised before
the arrival of investigators. "Security personnel called the 119 emergency line
for help immediately after the incident and the scene was kept intact to
facilitate the investigation by military prosecutors," he added.</P>
      <P>Hsu further rebutted speculation that Lu committed suicide because of a heavy
workload -- standing guard for four shifts during the day and two at night --
and that he might have been bullied by senior security guards.</P>
      <P>"The reality is that Lu worked for four hours during the day and two hours at
night," Hsu said, adding that while Lu was young, he was by no means a rookie.</P>
      <P>Lu, 27, a military police officer, shot himself to death at 8:35 a.m. Friday
while on duty at the president's official residence near the Presidential Office
in downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>"From our preliminary investigation, Lu shot himself because of difficulties in
a relationship, " the NSB said in a press statement issued shortly after he was
pronounced dead at National Taiwan University Hospital.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, President Chen confirmed during a community outreach tour in the
southern county of Pingtung Saturday that he was in his official residence when
the incident took place, although neither he nor his wife heard the gunshot.</P>

      <P>Taiwan used to be world famous for yacht manufacturing, with the number of
vessels exported overseas reaching 1,755 in 1987, the TAITRA officials said.
They added, however that exports had fallen to just  228  boats  in  1994,
while  the  number  of  yacht manufacturing-related businesses had dropped from
more than 100 to just a little over 10.</P>
      <P>They said the recession continued until just a few years ago, when the sector
performed a number of business reforms in order to upgrade.</P>
      <P>According to TAITRA statistics, U.S. shipping industry imports totaled US$1.4
billion in 2006, with Canada, Italy, Taiwan, Mexico and Britain serving as the
top five sources of imports. The five countries took a 74 percent U.S. market
share, the tallies show.</P>
      <P>However, there are still many trade opportunities in that huge market, the
officials said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hundreds of Taiwan citizens attended a forum Saturday that focused on Chechnya,
an autonomous republic of Russia that sought independence, and went home with a
better understanding of events in the Central Asia and the cruelty of war.</P>
      <P>The forum, titled "The Chechnya You Don't Know, " screened a documentary on
Chechnya before a speech by Erkin Ekrem, who once taught in Taiwan and is now a
history professor at Turkey's Hacettepe University.</P>
      <P>The independence movement in Chechnya spans over 200 years against a complicated
background of ethnicity, religion, geopolitics and political control of the
Russian Federation, said Ekrem.</P>
      <P>Russia will not tolerate Chechnya independence because of the autonomous
republic's important strategic location and its rich oil resources, Ekrem said.
Russia also fears a "domino effect" of independence movements among its 21
autonomous republics, he added.</P>
      <P>He said international support of the Chechnya independence movement took a
downturn after Chechen separatists began a string of suicide attacks and
bombings in Moscow in recent years.</P>
      <P>Since the first and second Chechen wars from 1994-2000, during which an
estimated 300,000 Chechens were killed, there has been reconstruction  and
rebuilding  in Chechnya,  and the Russian government has regained control of the
region. However, future unrest remains an issue, said forum moderator Wang Sing-
shu, a professor at the Graduate Institute of Russian Studies of National
Chengchi University.</P>
      <P>Responding to a question from the audience, Ekrem doubted that a better economy
will stop Chechnya from seeking independence because " nowadays, terrorists come
from all walks of life, not just from poor families."</P>
      <P>"It's all about survival. For the Chechens, survival means an independent
country. For Russia, it means the federation cannot afford to lose Chechnya, "
Wang summed up.</P>
      <P>The forum was among a series of events organized by the Lung Yingtai Cultural
Foundation, which tries to raise Taiwanese citizens' understanding of
international affairs. Upcoming forums are scheduled to discuss Cuba, Israel-
Palestine relations and the Malay peninsula.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President touts DPP's efforts to resurrect Hakka culture</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 27 (CNA)
10/27/07  21:52:02
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian touted his ruling Democratic  Progressive  Party's
(DPP's)  long-term devotion to preserving and resurrecting Hakka language and
culture Saturday, saying that the DPP's efforts in this regard dates back to the
20th Century.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in a speech delivered at the opening of an annual athletic
event at Hsinpei Junior High School in Hsinpei township in the southern county
of Pingtung, known locally as the Liutui Hakka Sports Meet, which was initiated
43 years ago to promote unity and harmony among the 12 Hakka communities in
Pingtung and neighboring Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, who doubles as DPP chairman, Taiwan's first Hakka language
teaching materials were compiled by the Pingtung county government in 1990 when
Su Tseng-chang, the DPP's vice presidential candidate for the 2008 presidential
election, was at the county's helm.</P>
      <P>In 1991, Chen said Su further designated the county's Wanluan Elementary School
to serve as the model for Hakka teaching among young schoolchildren.</P>
      <P>During his own tenure as Taipei mayor from 1994-1998, Chen said he organized the
city's first-ever Hakka Festival, which included a Hakka-themed symposium.</P>
      <P>"The seminar was also the first of its kind ever held in Taiwan," Chen  said,
adding  that  he  felt  regret  after  the then-opposition-controlled Taipei
City Council killed the budget for opening a Hakka radio station.</P>
      <P>Since he took over the presidency in May 2000, Chen said his administration has
devoted even more energy and resources to promote Hakka language and culture.</P>
      <P>Besides constructing the Liutui Hakka Culture Park in Pingtung County's
Changchih township, Chen said a similar Hakka culture park will also be built in
the northern county of Miaoli, also a Hakka-dominated region.</P>
      <P>Noting that Hakka is the world's third dialect survived through strenuous
government efforts after Maori dialects in Australia and Welsh English in Wales,
a constituent part of the United Kingdom, Chen said construction of Liutui and
Miaoli Hakka culture parks underlines his administration's resolve to turn
Taiwan into an international hub for study and promotion of Hakka culture and
language.</P>
      <P>Chen further said the DPP, as Taiwan's first indigenous political party, is
committed to promote Hakka cultural renaissance. "As DPP members have a deep
affection for all endemic things, our commitment to preserving and reviving
glory of Hakka culture will not be just an electoral campaign gimmick," he
stressed.</P>
      <P>More than 3,000 people took part in this year's Liutui Sports Meet, which
include contests in many folk games as well as dancing and martial art
performances.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Chen traveled to Changchih township to tour the Liutui Hakka
Culture Park where he joined with many schoolchildren in making Hakka-style
handicraft items, including oil-paper umbrellas.</P>
      <P>The Liutui Hakka Culture Park will be built in three phases and it has been
opened for commercial operations on a trial basis since Oct. 20 following the
completion of first-phase construction.</P>

      <P>Taiwan needs U.N. membership to underline its national identity and gain a
decent status in the international community, the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) presidential candidate said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a campaign rally in Hsinchuang, Taipei County, Frank Hsieh said that
just like a newborn child who must be registered with a household registration
office to obtain various welfare benefits and an identification card, a country
needs to join the United Nations  to obtain  access  to many  other  key
international organizations and activities.</P>
      <P>Rebutting main opposition Kuomintang presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou's
accusation that he does not care about the economy and popular livelihoods while
placing excessive emphasis on the U.N. membership bid and other political
issues, Hsieh said he has long made it clear that in his political platform, the
economy is as important as national pride and dignity.</P>
      <P>As a presidential candidate, Hsieh said he must outline his visions for long-
term national development. "If we do not talk about pride and dignity and only
focus on the economy, we could become Hong Kong and Macau whose only goal in
life is to make money, " he claimed.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's exclusion from the United Nations and its affiliated
agencies, such as the World Health Organization, has compromised basic human
rights of the 23 million people of Taiwan, Hsieh said he feels obliged to push
for Taiwan's U.N. bid to arouse public awareness of Taiwan's separate status and
identity.</P>
      <P>"We have our own core values and national identity. We should not blindly follow
the path imposed by outside forces; otherwise, we'll risk losing our unique
identity. Without a sense of national identity, we could become slaves of an
alien power, " Hsieh told a full house of enthusiastic supporters.</P>
      <P>Hsieh further said he envisioned an economy where happiness is the ultimate goal
and economic development is complemented by social justice.</P>
      <P>The campaign rally at the Hsinchuang Stadium marked the first time that Hsieh
and his running mate Su Tseng-chang have stumped together in Taipei County where
Su was twice elected its magistrate.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian also addressed the rally, accusing Ma, Hsieh's campaign
rival, of having played a negative role in Taiwan's strive for democracy and
political reform in the 1970s through 1990s.</P>

      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) presidential candidate's plan to visit
Japan is still in the works, a campaign aide said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Su Chun-pin, spokesman for Ma Ying-jeou's campaign office, made the remarks
after Japan's Jiji Press news agency reported the same day that Ma is scheduled
to visit Japan Nov. 13-15.</P>
      <P>The Japanese news agency quoted unidentified KMT sources as saying that Ma plans
to visit several Japanese cities, including Kyoto, Osaka, Yokohama and Tokyo,
next month.</P>
      <P>During the visit, Ma will meet with Japanese politicians and deliver speeches on
his policy visions, the report said, adding that Ma wants to underline the
importance he attaches to relationship with Japan through his visit.</P>
      <P>Responding to the report, Su said Ma's campaign staff have indeed been in talks
with the Japanese side on arranging for Ma to visit Japan, one of Taiwan's most
important trading partners, in the near future. Nevertheless, he said, the
travel plan is still in the works.</P>
      <P>"We'll publicize them when the date and other technical details are fleshed
out," Su added.</P>
      <P>If the travel plan materializes, it will be Ma's first visit to Japan since he
formally became earlier this year the KMT's standard bearer in the next
presidential election slated for March 22, 2008. He last visited Japan in July
2006.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Japanese sources told CNA that Ma's rival from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , Frank Hsieh, originally planned to visit Kyoto in
November, but the plan has been canceled.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, Hsieh's alma mater, Kyoto University, had arranged for
Hsieh to deliver an address Nov. 12. However, the sources said, the speech
invitation has been dropped. Sources close to the Hsieh campaign said it remains
uncertain whether he will visit Japan in the near future. Hsieh has a doctoral
degree in law from Kyoto University.</P>

      <P>Relations between Taiwan and the United States are in good shape, even though
the two sides do not always agree on all issues, Republic of China
Representative to the United States Joseph Wu said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a gathering to mark the sixth conference of the Taipei-based Global
Alliance for Democracy and Peace, Wu reassured those who had come from over the
world to attend the conference that "Taiwan is on good terms with the United
States."</P>
      <P>Wu said that although Taiwan and the U.S. have "differing stances" on Taiwan's
bid to enter the United Nations under the name Taiwan,  he claimed that the U.S.
"will accept" the U.N.-bid referendum that President Chen Shui-bian and the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party are pushing as a way for Taiwanese people to
express their desire for democracy and freedom.</P>
      <P>In the future, he predicted, no matter whether the DPP-initiated U.N.-bid
referendum or a referendum planned by the main opposition Kuomintang on the
ROC's re-entry into the U.N. succeeds, the U.S. will perceive Taiwan from a
different viewpoint that will be conducive to mutual understanding and
communication between the two countries.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, as one in five high-technology engineers working in San
Francisco's Bay Area are Taiwanese, this proves the close ties between Taiwan
and the United States.</P>
      <P>He urged Taiwan expatriates in the United States to spare no efforts to push the
U.S. administration and business sector to begin talks with Taiwan on the
signing of a bilateral free trade agreement so that Taiwan can enjoy equal trade
opportunities as those enjoyed by other countries.</P>
      <P>Wu also noted that China has not relented in its oppression and containment of
Taiwan in the international community, which he said has led Taiwan to strive to
change its official name, which he said should be Taiwan rather than ROC, and to
seek global publicity about "Taiwan identity."</P>
      <P>He said that if Taiwan relents in these efforts, the island will risk becoming a
part of China sooner or later, as Beijing has always claimed.</P>

      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) has continued to improve its earthquake
detection system and has predicted that by the end of 2008, it will be able to
detect a magnitude 4.0 or stronger earthquake and issue notification in 35
seconds, CWB sources said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan suffered its deadliest earthquake in five decades Sept. 21, 1999, when a
magnitude 7.3 temblor struck central Taiwan, leaving 2,415 people dead and more
than 10,000 injured, and causing immeasurable damage to property and
infrastructure islandwide.</P>
      <P>At that time, it took the CWB Seismology Center 102 seconds to fully grasp the
magnitude of the devastating earthquake and issue a notification, center
officials said.</P>
      <P>But with strenuous efforts made by staff at the center to develop instant
detection and automatic calculation systems for earthquakes in recent years, the
time the weather bureau takes to notify of earthquakes of magnitude 4.0 or
stronger has been remarkably reduced, the CWB seismologists said.</P>
      <P>The precision rates on the seismic intensity and location of quake epicenters
have also been raised significantly, they noted.</P>
      <P>The weather bureau hopes that quicker reports on strong tremors will help alert
the public earlier and "thus reduce seismic damage."</P>

      <P>The campaign office of ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential
candidate Frank Hsieh challenged opposition Kuomintang (KMT) presidential
candidate Ma Ying-jeou Sunday to explain where his "huge campaign fund" comes
from.</P>
      <P>Chao Tien-lin, a spokesman for Hsieh's campaign headquarters, claimed that Ma
has spent nearly NT$200 million (US$6.13 million) on seven TV commercials and
numerous radio and printed advertisements.</P>
      <P>Ma should explain how he can afford such expensive ads run with such high
frequency and whether they were financed with money from the KMT's ill-gotten
assets, many of which have been sold only recently, Chao said.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the DPP presidential ticket of Hsieh and former Premier Su Tseng-
chang  has spent less than NT$20 million on campaigning, Chao alleged that the
ruling party is fighting an "asymmetric campaign" against the KMT.</P>
      <P>According to Chao, the KMT has netted some NT$25.3 billion by liquidating some
of its ill-gotten assets.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp. (TTLC) plans to sell its star product,
Taiwan Beer, to the U.S. and Canadian markets and will set up a liaison office
in China to promote it, the company's star product, TTLC Chairman Martin Tsai
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>In the face of stiff competition from imported beer, Taiwan Beer nonetheless
maintains a domestic market share of approximately 80 percent thanks to the
development of new product lines and successful marketing strategies, according
to Tsai.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks while addressing the Branding Taiwan Forum 2007 held in
Taipei, which also featured speeches by Chunghwa Telecom Chairman Hochen Tan and
ZyXEL Communications Corp. Chairman Chu Shun-i, who shared their experiences in
brand building.</P>
      <P>Noting the significance of marketing tactics, Tsai said that when the government
opened the market to imported beer in 1987, Taiwan Beer's market share dropped
sharply to 72 percent from 99 percent during the initial period.</P>
      <P>However, the company then developed the new Gold Medal Taiwan Beer brand in 2003
and later hired entertainers and baseball players to tout the brand name among
young people, Tsai said. He added that the marketing strategy proved successful,
as the new brand's market share has jumped to 23 percent in just four years,
making it the second-biggest brand after Taiwan Beer in Taiwan's beer market.</P>
      <P>Building on this success, the company is planning to expand its overseas markets
in addition to its operations in Japan and South East Asia, Tsai went on, adding
that a liaison office in China will soon open if approved by the Chinese
government.</P>
      <P>Tan, meanwhile, said the key to a successful brand lies in quality, business
scale and customized services. He added that the success of innovative products
depends on cooperation  between manufacturers and distributors, as well as close
ties among various industries and government agencies.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese brands can shine in the global market and are likely to become one of
the top 10 global brands with the concerted efforts of the government and
private sector, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung claimed Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks while making an address on the second day of the Branding
Taiwan Forum 2007 held in Taipei by the Taiwan External Trade Development
Council.</P>
      <P>He said the forum gathers experts from academia, industry and government to
engage in discussions and help lay the foundation for new ideas on "branding
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Only through establishing their own brand names can Taiwan businesses strengthen
their products' competitiveness and made inroads into international markets,
according to Chang.</P>
      <P>He said the Executive Yuan has earmarked NT$1.6 billion (US$48.04 million) over
the past seven years for measures to help local industries build global brand
names. As a result, in 2006, the value of Taiwan's top 10 brands reached US$5.2
billion, up from US$3.5 billion in 2003, Chang added.</P>

      <P>The number of gun crimes handled by law enforcement agencies around the country
totaled 331 in the first nine months of this year, down by a substantial 30
percent, or 135 cases, from the year before, Ministry of the Interior (MOI)

officials said.</P>
      <P>Of the total, 281 were solved with the perpetrators arrested, marking a
crackdown rate of 85 percent, a figure that is 14 percent higher than the one
posted for the same period of 2006, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>One hundred and fifty cases, or 45 percent, involved robbery and 114 involved
homicide, they added.</P>
      <P>Taipei County in northern Taiwan had the largest number of armed crimes in the

      <P>The production capacity of Taiwan's semiconductor industry this year is likely
to account for 18 percent of the total global output, the first time it will
have surpassed the United States to take second place in the world after Japan,
an analyst from the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Peng Kuo-chu said that since 2,000, chip makers and the IC industry have played
the main roles in the capacity expansion of Taiwan's semiconductor industry,
adding that Taiwan and South Korea have the greatest number of 12 inch wafer
plants and that their production capacities have increased most rapidly in the
world.</P>
      <P>Peng predicted that in the fourth quarter, the production capacity of Taiwan's
12 inch wafer fabs will reach 590,000 units, a 16 percent increase over the
previous quarter. He forecast that in two years, five such fabs will each post a
quarterly growth rate of more than 10 percent.</P>
      <P>Although Japan's semiconductor industry will maintain its top position in terms
of production capacity worldwide, its production value is forecast to drop to
only 24 percent of the total this year, according to Peng.</P>
      <P>The production capacity of South Korea's semiconductor industry is forecast at
17 percent of the global total, the same level as the United States, with which
it will share third place in the world.</P>
      <P>With the aggressive capacity expansion in Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and
China, the ratio of the output of Asia's semiconductor industry is expected to
reach 47 percent of the global total, Peng added.</P>

infringing upon the rights of the copyright holders.</P>

      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development under the Executive Yuan is
urging local governments to impose fees on users of their sewage systems to
replenish government funding for the expansion of the country's sewage network,
according to a report issued by the council Sunday.</P>
      <P>Noting  that the government  has spent over NT$30 billion (US$924.21 million) on
the construction of the sewage system over the last three years, the report said
most of the users of the system do not pay for it, while the government has to
use its budget for the prevention of water pollution.</P>
      <P>The report said the rate of treated waste water, including industrial effluent,
in Taiwan had grown to 37.33 percent by September 2007 from 17.8 percent in
2002.</P>
      <P>That figure is relatively low in comparison with the 2004 figures of 80 percent
for Hong Kong, Malaysia, South Korea, and more than 95 percent for the
Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Germany, the report said,
citing statistics carried in the 2007 World Competitiveness Yearbook compiled by
the Lausanne, Switzerland-based International Institute for Management
Development.</P>
      <P>However, the report said, the budget the government can set aside for expanding
the sewage network to the whole island is far less than needed, which helps
explain why the network covers only 16.76 percent of the country's households.</P>
      <P>It is for this reason, the report said, that the CEPD is urging local
governments to levy sewage fees on those who are connected to the network.</P>
      <P>Taipei City is the only city in Taiwan that charges sewage fees along with water
rates, said the report.</P>

      <P>A dispute between Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei and Minister of the Interior
Lee Yi-yang continued to rage Sunday, with Chou challenging Lee to debate the
matter in public only to have his challenge rebuffed by the minister.</P>
      <P>Lee said there is no point arguing with Chou in public, as the promotion and
appointment of police officers lies squarely within the authority of the
National Police Administration according to the law, so that as a magistrate,
Chou simply does not have the right to promote or appoint, irrespective of the
fact that Taipei County was upgraded to a quasi-special municipality Oct. 1.</P>
      <P>However, Chou, who tried to promote 140 middle-ranking police officers in his
county only to have his promotions decreed null and void by the Ministry of the
Interior, argued that his power to control police appointments and promotions
should be the same as that of his counterparts in the special municipalities of
Taipei and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>He challenged Lee to explain in a public debate Wednesday why the chief of a
quasi-special municipality cannot have the same power enjoyed by other special
municipality chiefs.</P>
      <P>In a related development that same day, police on Kinmen and in Nantou and
Yunlin counties signed a public letter to support the Ministry of the Interior
in the dispute, claiming that the promotions attempted by Chou were unfair and
would disrupt the well-established order of promotions in the national police
system.</P>

Japan and the world -- to upgrade its local representative office to a branch
office.

Mencius' lesson of the day: "When a ruler regards his ministers as his hands and
feet, they regard him as their belly and heart; when he regards them as dogs and
horses, they regard him as a common citizen; when he regards them as dirt and

      <P>Twenty-six percent of disposable chopsticks randomly selected from around Taipei
City for examination were found to be not properly packaged or labeled, the
Taipei City Department of Health reported Monday.</P>
      <P>Eight out of the 31 randomly-selected disposable chopstick samples were
substandard in terms of packaging -- either failing to indicate on the
chopsticks' outer plastic wrapping the manufacturer's name and address or the
chopsticks' production and expiration dates, said Chiang Yu-mei, a section chief
at the department in charge of drug and food safety.</P>
      <P>Chiang said most of the suppliers and manufacturers of the poorly-packaged
disposable chopsticks are based in Taipei County. Owners of these operations
could face fines of up to NT$150,000 (US$4,601) in accordance with food safety
laws.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to Chiang, six out of the 18 disposable chopstick samples
were found to contain sulfur dioxide residue -- ranging from 9.3 parts per
million to 27.8 ppm. The sulfur dioxide residue content, however, was far lower
than the maximum acceptable level of 500 ppm that the Cabinet-level Department
of Health has set, he added.</P>
      <P>Chiang suggested  that before using disposable  chopsticks, consumers should
place the chopsticks in hot water for a few minutes to remove most of the sulfur
dioxide residue.</P>
      <P>She noted that long-term exposure to sulfur dioxide can cause skin rashes,
negatively affect pulmonary function or lead to chronic bronchitis.</P>
      <P>Taiwan imports roughly 5 billion pairs of chopsticks a year, with imports from
China accounting for 40 percent of the total. About 5 million pairs of
chopsticks are used in Taiwan every day, according to the Taiwan Solidarity
Union.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian recognized Monday the contribution that a new Ministry
of Education program of offering free one-year kindergarten education has made
to low-income families.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a visit to a kindergarten run by the Chienchen Elementary School
in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, Chen said the new program -- launched
Aug. 1 this year for low-income families with children aged under 5 -- has
greatly helped alleviate the financial burden on young couples with children who
are generally not faring very well financially.</P>
      <P>Chen said that since Aug. 1, 38 preschool kids from low-income families in the
Chienchen District area in Kaohsiung City have been admitted to study at the
Chienchen Elementary School's affiliated kindergarten for free.</P>
      <P>"The program has prevented kids from poor families from losing the education
battle at the starting line -- enabling them to receive normal education on an
equal footing with their peers from well-off families," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Under the program, five-year-olds from families around the nation with an annual
income of less than NT$300,000 (US$9,259) are entitled to receive free
kindergarten education as part of the government's efforts to address the issue
of declining birth rates in the country and help reduce the financial burden on
families with children.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, five-year-olds from families with an annual income ranging from
NT$300,000  to NT$600,000 are entitled to attend kindergarten without having to
pay tuition fees.</P>
      <P>Some 109,000 kids are expected to benefit from the program, which forms the
first-phase of an Executive Yuan project to financially assist children from
low-income or disadvantaged families. The program will cost the government about

    <TEXT>
      <P>The recently approved salary hikes for executives of state-owned enterprises are
"unrelated to" the coming elections set for early next year, Chou Hung-hsien,
minister of the Central Personnel Administration (CPA), said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chou noted that at the national conference on sustainable economic development
held in July 2006, a consensus was reached on raising the salary of the chairmen
and presidents of the state-owned enterprises, and that the hikes have nothing
to do with the January legislative and March presidential elections.</P>
      <P>Chou was responding to reports by a local newspaper, the United Daily News, that
the Executive Yuan approved last week a sharp salary increase for the chairmen
and presidents of 12 state-owned enterprises that have proved to be
"competitive." The hikes will take effect on Jan. 1, 2008.</P>
      <P>The average monthly salary increase will be more than 90 percent, with the
ceiling for the salary increases set at NT$300,000 (US$9,090), according to the
reports. The raise will mean the current restriction that the salaries for top
executives of state-owned enterprises cannot exceed those of ministerial-level
officials will be lifted, the reports said.</P>
      <P>The reports also said that the salary increase will be a "boost" for encouraging
the top executives to canvass support for the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's candidates.</P>
      <P>Chou said that the average salary for the top executives of the state-owned
enterprises is about NT$160,000 per month, which is far lower than that of their
counterparts in the private sector.</P>
      <P>Noting that the chairmen and presidents of the state-owned enterprises are
responsible for large operations, Chous asked how they will be able to compete
with their counterparts at financial holding companies if their salary is too
low.</P>
      <P>Chou denied the reports of "a sharp increase in salary," stressing that "not
every executive will see a monthly salary increase to NT$300,000."</P>
      <P>According to the plan, there are presently 25 state-owned enterprises, and if
the Bureau of National Health Insurance and the Bureau of Labor Insurance --
which are considered to be para-government agencies in nature -- and Taiwan
Railway Administration and RSEA Engineering Corp. -- which are considered to be
incompetitive -- are excluded, only 12 state-owned firms are considered to be
"competitive."</P>
      <P>The 12 "competitive" state-owned enterprises are Taiwan Power Co., CPC Corp.,
Taiwan, Taiwan Sugar Co., Taiwan Water Corp., CSBC Corp. Taiwan, Taiwan Tobacco
and Liquor Corp., Taiwan Post Co., Bank of Taiwan, Land Bank of Taiwan, the
Export-Import Bank of ROC, Central Deposit Insurance Corp., and Aerospace

raided a drug lab on Batam Island in central Indonesia, arresting six suspects
including three Taiwanese men, the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) reported
Monday.</P>
      <P>During the operation, nearly 600 kg of amphetamine worth around NT$500 million
(US$15.45 million) in street value was seized, along with 1,000 kg of chemical
raw materials and manufacturing equipment, CIB officials said.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the amphetamine factory was built and financed by
the Taiwanese suspects, who also offered technical expertise in refining the
drug to their Indonesian accomplices.</P>
      <P>The amphetamines were shipped to Taiwan, China and other parts of Indonesia via
air and sea, the officials said.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the CIB obtained tipoffs in March that Taiwanese and
Indonesian criminals were cooperating to set up a drug production and smuggling
operation.</P>

million) for financing the development of a Taiwan-El Salvador Park in the
Central American country and NT$8.17 million (US$282,932) to foot the cost of
remodeling the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy headquarters -- these budgets can
be returned to the national coffers, legislators said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) Director-General Billy Chang said Monday
that it is normal for pilots to work for foreign air carriers that offer more
generous pay than they can command at home.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks while fielding questions at a legislative committee
meeting.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Hung-chun of the opposition People First Party cited statistics
of the Civil Aviation Airman Association of the Republic of China to say that
Taiwan pays foreign pilots US$12,000 a month, while local pilots get only
US$8,000.</P>
      <P>Lee claimed that this is the reason for an exodus of 40 Taiwanese pilots in the
first eight months of this year to air carriers in other countries.</P>
      <P>He urged the CAA to pay attention to the "pilot drain, " which he claimed could
lead to insufficient pilots in Taiwan and could possibly mean pilots having to
work overtime.</P>
      <P>Chang pointed out that foreign pilots usually get better pay than their local
counterparts, "a situation that is the same in every other country."</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that although Taiwanese pilots might be working in other
countries, there is a large number of foreign pilots working for Taiwanese
carriers.</P>
      <P>Chang said he was unaware that 40 local pilots have left to work for foreign
carriers and said he did not believe the figure.</P>
      <P>He also noted that pilots cannot work overtime and face steep fines if caught
doing so.</P>
      <P>"It is reasonable for pilots to go to the air carriers that offer the highest
salaries, " Chang said, adding that Taiwan has around 1,900 pilots, more than
600 of whom are foreign.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian unveiled a new plaque of the Fisheries Agency under the
Council of Agriculture (COA) Monday, formally re-opening the agency -- the first
government unit relocated to southern Taiwan from the north.</P>
      <P>At the ceremony, Chen, who was accompanied by Premier Chang Chun-hsiung and COA
Minister Su Jia-chyun, expressed hope that the agency will boost services for
fishermen and fishing boat operators.</P>
      <P>The relocation, Chen said, is part of the government's efforts to improve care
for people living in central and southern Taiwan, and to balance the development
of the north and south of the country.</P>
      <P>The agency will also set up a branch office in northern Taiwan to maintain its
services to fishermen there, Chen added, underlining the importance with which
the government regards the country's fishery development.</P>
      <P>The new Fisheries Agency is in the Ocean-Going  Fisheries Development Center
located in Kaohsiung's Chienchen Fishing Port complex. Kaohsiung is an important
base of Taiwan's deep-sea fishing industry.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Doctors acting as organ transplant brokers subject to penalties: DOH</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese doctors who are found to have helped solicit local patients seeking
organ transplants in China are subject to legal penalties, an official with the
Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Hsueh Jui-yuan, director of the DOH Bureau of Medical Affairs, said such doctors
could be disciplined for violation of medical ethics. The penalties, depending
on the seriousness of the violation, range from an official reprimand to having
their licenses to practice revoked, he added.</P>
      <P>Hsueh made the remarks at a news conference held at the Legislative Yuan by
ruling Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Tien Chiu-chin who alleged that
China might have become the world's "organ transplant supermarket."</P>
      <P>Pointing out that many international human rights organizations have expressed
concern about China's frequent execution of prisoners, Tien implied that many of
those executed -- many of whom were reportedly young and strong -- might be
executed for their organs rather than as punishment for their crimes.</P>
      <P>Tien claimed that a "young and strong" executed prisoner would be worth about
NT$5 million (US$154,320) if his organs were to be removed and sold to Taiwanese
patients.</P>
      <P>Tien also alleged that China has offered "organ transplant tourism" packages,
soliciting Taiwanese citizens seeking organ transplants in China, taking only
two or three weeks to match patients with suitable organs and make other
relevant arrangements.</P>
      <P>The DOH has instructed that a probe be conducted into reports of a Chinese
doctor coming to Taiwan to solicit local patients seeking liver transplants in
China, DOH officials said.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based Liberty Times reported Oct. 24 that Zhu Zhijun, director of the
organ transplant center of the Tianjin First Central Hospital, came to Taiwan in
March and conducted assessments in the company of two Taiwanese doctors on liver
disease patients waiting to travel to China to get transplants. The Tianjin
hospital is touted as the biggest liver transplant center in Asia.</P>
      <P>Hsueh said the DOH has instructed the Taipei city government Department of
Health to conduct a thorough probe into the matter, including  who were the two
Taiwanese  doctors who reportedly accompanied Zhu during his visit in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He added that Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, which
invited Zhu to come to Taiwan, should also be dealt with according to the
Statute Governing the Relations Between the people of the Taiwan Area and the
Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the Legislative Yuan session, Yang Chia-chun, director of the
Legal Affairs Department under the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, said
that doctors from three or four Taiwanese hospitals are suspected of having
served as brokers between Taiwanese patients and Chinese organ suppliers. He
added that the investigations into those cases are continuing.</P>

      <P>A legislative caucus whip of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said
Monday that it is normal for political appointees to campaign for the DPP.</P>
      <P>Wang Tuoh made the remarks after the Taipei-based China Times reported that the
Executive Yuan will inaugurate a campaign team made up of Cabinet members this
week in preparation for the legislative and presidential elections early next
year.</P>
      <P>The reports said the Cabinet has planned for the members to come to the defense
of the DPP's administrative policies in specific areas such as finance and
economics, agriculture and culture, as well as diplomatic work, when they are on
the campaign trail.</P>
      <P>Some political appointees will be responsible  for certain constituencies,  the
reports said,  noting that Executive Yuan Secretary-General Chen Chin-jun, who
began his political career after serving as Sanchung mayor, and Minister Without
Portfolio Lin Hsi-yao, who once served as Taipei deputy magistrate, should help
the DPP in hotly contested Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Council of Agriculture (COA) Minister Su Jia-Chyuan, who once served as Pingtung
magistrate, and COA Vice Minister Lin Tsung-nan, who formerly served as Nantou
magistrate, have also made frequent weekend visits to the two counties recently,
according to reports.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Hsin-ni, a DPP legislator and director of the DPP's Department of Culture
and Information, said it is "only natural for a political appointee to serve the
ruling party."</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Huang Wei-cher echoed her views, saying that when political
appointees are off duty, they are free to campaign and that if they take leave,
it is also permissible for them to stump for DPP candidates during those
periods.</P>
      <P>The main opposition  Kuomintang caucus in the legislature, however, blasted the
Cabinet members, accusing them of "blurring the line" between their official
duties and campaign work.</P>
      <P>Kuo Su-chun, a KMT caucus whip, claimed that the Cabinet members are always on
the campaign trail, whether on weekends, at night or during the working day.</P>
      <P>Kuo cited the China Times reports that ranking Cabinet officials are serving in
key posts in the campaign office of Frank Hsieh, the DPP's presidential
candidate.</P>
      <P>Yeh Chu-lan, secretary-general of the Presidential Office, is serving as Hsieh's
campaign manager; Chen Chi-mai, deputy secretary-general of the Presidential
Office, is serving as Hsieh's deputy manager; Cheng Li-chun, chairwoman of the
National Youth Commission, is serving as the director of Hsieh's Youth
Department; COA Minister Su Jia-Chyuan is deputy head of the mobilization
department, and Council of Labor Affairs Chairman Lu Tien-lin serves as the head
of Hsieh's Labor Department, according to the reports.</P>

Chinese society that practices democracy.</P>
      <P>Vincent Wei-cheng Wang, chairman of the Department of Political Science at the
University of Richmond, Virginia, made the call in a speech to an academic
conference held by the California-based Chinese American Professional Society in
the City of Industry in California.</P>
      <P>Wang said Taiwan and the United States are both democratic countries that share
common values and suggested that the two reinforce cooperation in efforts to

      <P>Wang said that although Washington has set many restrictions on its interactions
with Taiwan since switching diplomatic recognition from the Republic of China to
the People's Republic of China in 1978, the restrictions "have now become

      <P>Speaking of the important issues concerning U.S.-Taiwan ties, Wang suggested
that the U.S. and Taiwan should navigate around the bureaucratic barriers to
push for the signing of a U.S.-Taiwan free trade agreement.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health designated Nov. 11 as the National Health Walk Day in

      <P>The Central Geological Survey institute under the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) will begin a four-year research project in 2008 to investigate hydrate
gases on the ocean floor off Taiwan's southwest coast, an institute official
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The announcement came after the institute geologically mapped the areas off
Taiwan's southwest and northeast coasts over the last few years.</P>
      <P>The institute kicked off a series of projects to map the areas in 2001 as part
of the government's efforts to understand the country's marine resources in
order to better explore the use of them, Chiang Chung-jung, deputy director of
the institute, said.</P>
      <P>In recent years, a massive amount of hydrate gas, also known as "combustible
ice, " has been discovered in many parts of the world, including areas off
Taiwan's southwest coast, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the total volume of combustible ice is twice that of all
currently available petroleum fuels, Chiang added.</P>
      <P>Given skyrocketing  oil prices,  many coastal countries -- including the United
States, Japan, and Canada -- have begun studying the future use of combustible
ice, Chiang went on.</P>
      <P>According to the institute's preliminary estimates, there are approximately 500
billion cubic meters of hydrate gas in the region, enough for over 65 years of
use, Chiang noted, describing hydrate gas as "a great potential source of future
energy."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 29 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Central Election Commission (CEC) Chairman Chang Cheng-hsiung said Monday that
if voters have received referendum ballots but decide not to cast them, the
ballots will not be counted in turnout rate.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks during a meeting with local election commission
officials, noting that referendum proposals initiated by both the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) as well as the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) will be held alongside the January legislative and March presidential
elections next year, meaning that coming elections will be more complex than in
the previous elections.</P>
      <P>The participation rate is crucial to the passage of referendum proposals as
under the Referendum Law a proposal will be considered to have passed only if
the voter turnout rate exceeds half of all eligible voters and if 50 percent of
those who cast ballots vote in favor of the proposal.</P>
      <P>In the 2004 presidential election, two proposals initiated by President Chen
Shui-bian and put to a referendum -- one on purchasing more missiles to counter
the military threat from China and the other on engaging in dialogue with China
-- failed because although 90 percent of those who cast ballots in the
referendum voted in favor of the proposals, the overall participation rate was
only 45 percent of eligible voters.</P>
      <P>Chang said that after voters receive referendum ballots, they can express their
intention not to vote and the ballots will be retrieved by the poll station
staff, who then will mark that the ballots have been claimed but were not cast.</P>
      <P>He said that since the ballots are not cast, there will be three categories --
"valid ballots, " "invalid ballots, " as well as "ballots claimed but not cast"
-- in tallying the ballots, and that the last category will not be considered
when calculating the participation rate.</P>
      <P>One local election official, who asked for anonymity, said the coming elections
will be "unprecedentedly complex" if the election staff have to ask each voter
if they wish to claim their referendum ballots, and they have to mark whether
the ballots have not been cast by the voters.</P>
      <P>The staff member wondered how polling station staff are going to deal with long
queues if they have to spend a significant amount of time with each voter inside
the polling stations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  officials from seven local election commissions proposed, during a
Monday meeting with Chang, that the CEC adopt a two-step ballot distribution
approach.</P>
      <P>In response, Chang said that their suggestion will be presented to the next
meeting of the CEC members for reference. The CEC will also solicit the views of
election staff at the grass-roots level via questionnaires or public hearings,
he added.</P>
      <P>Election officials from Taipei City, Taipei County, Taoyuan County, Yilan
County, Hsinchu County, Kinmen and Matsu suggested that it would be better to
adopt the two-step distribution format as it would "ensure an impartial election
and avoid disputes, " while the one-step ballot distribution "is prone to chaos
and the consequences are not to be underestimated."</P>
      <P>CEC Secretary-General Teng Tien-you said that based on past experience, each
polling station should be staffed by 10.7 people giving a one-step format, but
will need between 13-14 people if a two-step format is adopted.</P>
      <P>He said that the CEC has appropriated a budget for nine staff members per
polling station for the legislative elections, but given the serious shortage of
manpower, the Executive Yuan has agreed to use provisional funds to add an
additional staff member.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei Deputy Mayor Wu Hsiu-kuang, who assumed the chairmanship of
Taipei Election Commission last week, said that the commission would strongly
recommend that the CEC maintain a two-step format.</P>
      <P>Wu said that election polling falls under the purview of local governments,
noting that the Election Law stipulates that local election commission can
decide on the layout and management of the polling stations.</P>
      <P>CEC members were originally set to decide whether to adopt a "one-step" or "two-
step" ballot format during a meeting Friday, but postponed its decision after
heated debate.</P>
      <P>On the eve of the CEC meeting, 18 mayors and magistrates from the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" led by the main opposition Kuomintang, issued a joint
statement that if votes on referendum proposals are held alongside the
legislative and presidential elections early next year, they will follow the
previous "two-step" voting format" to ensure the smooth operation of the
elections."</P>
      <P>The "two-step"  voting  format refers to voters  receiving presidential election
and referendum ballots separately.  After casting their presidential ballot in
one box, voters will receive a referendum ballot to cast in another box. This
method was used in the 2004 presidential election, but many voters chose to
leave the polling stations after casting their presidential ballots, without
bothering to vote on a referendum being held at the same time.</P>
      <P>Under the "one-step" format, two ballots -- a presidential and referendum ballot
-- are handed out at the same time and voters then cast the two ballots in
separate boxes. This format is generally considered to boost the participation
rate.</P>
      <P>A referendum proposal initiated by the DPP to retrieve ill-gotten assets amassed
by the KMT during its five decades of rule of Taiwan and another initiated by
the KMT on opposing corruption will be put to a vote in conjunction with the
legislative election.</P>
      <P>The DPP also plans another referendum on a proposal to bid for U.N. membership
under the name Taiwan, to be held in tandem with the presidential election,
while the KMT plans a referendum on a proposal to return to the world body under
its official name, the Republic of China, or any other "pragmatic name" at the
same time.</P>

      <P>Mango, known as the king of tropical fruits,  has tentatively  recovered  its
No.  1 status  among Taiwan-produced fruits in an online vote held by the
Agriculture and Food Agency under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The vote, which began July 1 and will end Oct. 31, allows each voter to select
up to 10 kinds of fruit. With only two more days to go, the mango has surpassed
the strawberry as Taiwan's top classical fruit by capturing more than 122,400
votes, accounting for 8.35 percent of the votes cast.</P>
      <P>The strawberry has lagged behind the mango after tentatively placing first in
September because of support from many Internet users in Miaoli County who
strongly endorsed their locally produced fruit. As of Oct. 29, the strawberry
has received over 118,600 votes, accounting for 8.09 percent of the popular
vote.</P>
      <P>Bell fruit ranked third with 97,127 votes, followed by custard apples, also
known as "Buddha-head fruit, " with 94,032 votes, and lychees with 93,002 votes.</P>
      <P>Other fruits ranking from fifth to 10th places are pears, grapes, bananas,
watermelons and pineapples.</P>
      <P>According to the Agriculture and Food Agency, lots will be drawn in November to

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung vowed Monday to push for balanced economic development
in an effort to narrow the gap between the nation's rich and poor.</P>
      <P>Chang said the government has launched economic policies to help the nation's
small and medium enterprises upgrade their management and production technology,
to improve infrastructure in central and southern Taiwan, and to better care for
people in the lower class.</P>
      <P>In terms of taking care of people in lower social class, Chang said that since
the transition of political power in Taiwan, the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party has adjusted the minimum wage, brought in a new retirement system for
laborers, and provided care to elderly farmers and fishermen who do not enjoy
the benefits of the social welfare system.</P>
      <P>Chang made his remarks while attending a ceremony inaugurating the new
headquarters of the Fisheries Agency in the southern port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Fisheries Agency was moved from Taipei City to Kaohsiung City in order to
enhance the government's administrative management of the country's fishery
industry, Chang said, adding that Kaohsiung has been Taiwan's most important
deep sea fishing industry.</P>
      <P>The agency's new office will be in charge of making policy for the fishery
industry and of providing more direct and timely service to fishermen in
southern Taiwan, in accordance with one of the Executive Yuan's economic
policies, Chang said.</P>
      <P>He added that servicing the fishery industry in northern Taiwan will be managed
by the agency's office at its previous headquarters in Taipei City.</P>

      <P>In the midst of massive media coverage and interest in investing in India and
Vietnam, researchers expressed concern with that frenzy in a forum that focusing
on opportunities in the rapid-developing countries Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's manufacturing industry has been doing well in Vietnam, which opted to
open its domestic market in late 1980s, but it is still risky to invest in
Vietnam's stock market, said Ben Chang, General Manager of AEGON Securities
Investment Consulting Co., in the forum organized by Taiwan Research Institute.</P>
      <P>Vietnam's economy has shown robust growth during the last decade, during which
it has registered an average gross domestic production (GDP) growth rate of more
than seven percent, he said. However, given the small scale of its stock market
and foreign  investment restrictions, it's still a risky market for foreign
investors.</P>
      <P>India has been lauded as another promising market for investors all over the
world, but opinions on its future economic development remain mixed, said Ma
Daw, an assistant researcher of Chung Hua Institution for Economic Research.</P>
      <P>India possesses a number of advantages for investors. The strength of its
information technology (IT) sector, work force structure and large population
are expected to be the driving force behind its strong growth in the future, Ma
said.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Ma warned, investors have to be willing to take risks given
the state of the infrastructure, complicated taxation code,  government
inefficiency  and foreign investment restrictions.</P>

      <P>Taipei city councilors asserted Monday that many city-owned trees planted
alongside city sidewalks have been mistreated and requested that relevant
authorities step up their efforts to protect them.</P>
      <P>City Councilors Hsu Chia-ching and Wu Si-yiao made the assertion at the city
council and cited many specific cases of "tree abuse" which showed old sidewalk
trees were either cut down, ringed, or wounded by electrical cables connected to
nearby distribution boxes set up by construction workers.</P>
      <P>In response, Taipei City Parks and Street Light Office Director Chen Chia-chin
indicated that under the city regulations governing sidewalk tree management and
maintenance, a person found maliciously damaging a sidewalk tree must pay a
compensatory fee six times higher than the basic cost, as well as replacement
costs.</P>
      <P>So far this year, Chen said the office has written five tickets, worth a
combined value of NT$580,000, for offenses done to sidewalk trees. In the near

      <P>A fraud ring, operated by several local men conspiring with illegal Indonesian
workers in Taiwan, was smashed Sunday by police authorities in central Taiwan,
the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) announced Monday.</P>
      <P>A total of 18 suspects, 10 Taiwanese men and eight illegal Indonesian workers,
were detained a day earlier in separate police raids in Miaoli, Taichung, Nantou
and Changhua counties, CIB officials said.</P>
      <P>According to Miaoli Prosecutor Chang Wen-jie, who took charge of the case and
organized the raids, the 10 Taiwanese men were involved in fraud and had
previously been set freed on bail by a local court, while all the eight
Indonesian are absconded workers who illegally left their factory positions.</P>
      <P>The 18 suspects previously worked with a China-based fraud ring, which was
tracked down by police early this year after a series of fraudulent plots
hatched in Taiwan, Chang said, adding that the Taiwanese criminals, while
awaiting the ruling in a second trial, again hired the Indonesian workers to con
local people and Indonesian nationals.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese criminals had been planning to sneak into China in early November
on board fishing ships from the outlying Kinmen Island to escape judicial
punishment, police added.</P>
      <P>According to the initial police probe, members of the fraud ring often disguised
themselves as prosecutors, National Police Agency officers or Chunghwa Telecom
officials to swindle money from locals in regions in central Taiwan. Police
estimate that they took in more than NT$10 million using this fraudulent scam.</P>
      <P>As the fraud ring was found to also use these illegal Indonesian laborers to
swindle their compatriots both in Taiwan and Indonesia, Taiwan police
authorities have been in contact with their Indonesian counterparts to
investigate relevant cases, CIB officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT U.N. bid referendum understandable to U.S.: Siew</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Oct. 29 (CNA)
10/29/07  23:24:39
(By Charles Kang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite Beijing's objections, Washington understands the motivation behind a
U.N. membership bid referendum proposed by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
,  KMT vice presidential candidate Vincent Siew has claimed in a recent
interview with a Singaporean Chinese-language daily.</P>
      <P>The Lianhe Zaobao published the interview, conducted in Taipei last Friday, in
its Monday edition.</P>
      <P>Dismissing a public misconception that the KMT's drive to call for a referendum
on "re-joining U.N." was following the lead of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) , Siew stated that the KMT launched the campaign with an aim of
checking and impeding the DPP.</P>
      <P>According to Siew, the DPP, with its plan to hold a referendum on what it
described as Taiwan's U.N. cause, is moving in a direction extremely dangerous
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The DPP has been pushing for a public referendum, to be held along with the
March 22, 2008 presidential election, on whether the country should pursue full
U.N. membership under the name of Taiwan, while the KMT, to counter the DPP, has
aslo initiated a signature campaign to call a referendum to re-join the world
body in the name of the Republic of China, Taiwan or some other feasible
designations.</P>
      <P>Now that President Chen Shui-bian has publicly said that holding a U.N.
membership referendum "definitely has to be done," the KMT certainly will not
back away from its own referendum proposal, Siew said.</P>
      <P>Although Beijing would not presently agree to the political course the KMT is
advocating, he argued, the ROC, as an independent sovereignty, has to
communicate the desire of its people to all the world.</P>
      <P>Siew, who visited the United States early this month in his capacity as the
KMT's vice presidential candidate to explain the meaning for his party's call
for a U. N. membership referendum, said that Washington is well aware of the
KMT's purpose in doing so and that is exactly why the United States has not, to
date, publicly voiced opposition to the KMT's U.N. bid referendum plan.</P>
      <P>In contrast, both Beijing and Washington voiced their objections to the U. N.
membership referendum proposed by the ruling DPP, saying that holding such a
referendum would step on a red-line in sensitive cross-Taiwan Strait relations
and mark a step towards "de-jure Taiwan independence."</P>
      <P>The KMT's U.N.  membership strategy is more pragmatic and flexible, as it
includes the ROC, Taiwan and other designations that the country has used in
other international organizations, he claimed.</P>
      <P>During his recent visit to the United States, Siew said, he learned that
Taiwan-U.S. relations have sustained "unprecedented" damage as a result of the
DPP's failure to keep its promises to the United States regarding cross-strait
ties.</P>
      <P>If the KMT regains power in the March 22, 2008 presidential election, it will
commit to making peace, rather than creating trouble, in the region, he said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the DPP's decision to make its "Taiwan-centric" notion a chief
plank in the coming presidential election, Siew contended that such a concept
should be more broadly defined, have a more profound meaning, and be more
flexibly applied in international contexts.</P>
      <P>A "Taiwan-centric" identity cannot be so narrow-minded that it is defined by
ethnicity as the DPP has claimed, Siew reiterated, adding that those who live in
Taiwan and contribute to the country are Taiwanese, not just those who were born
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the KMT maybe to blame for a great deal of wrongdoing
during its rule of Taiwan, but its economic achievements in turning Taiwan from
a poor society into a prosperous state are undeniable.</P>
      <P>Siew asserted that it is important to make people realize that after eight years
of reform, it is a revamped, clean and indigenous KMT which now seeks power in
the next presidential election.</P>
      <P>Siew also rebutted the president's misinterpretation of his proposal to develop
a "cross-strait common market" between Taiwan and China as a market oriented to
serve the "one China" position.</P>
      <P>The idea of a "cross-strait common market" is based on free flows of personnel,
merchandise and capital on a conditional basis between the two sides, and
absolutely will not infringe upon Taiwan's sovereignty because the governments
on both sides would first have to engage in normalizing two-way trade and
investment at the negotiating table before agreeing to build a common market.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT vice presidential candidate, a "cross-strait common market"
could help create a security framework for Taiwan over the long term on the
grounds that it would ensure steady and stable economic exchanges in the service
of the common interests of Taiwan and China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Businesses encouraged to advert to Middle East, Latin America</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  29  (CNA)
10/29/07  23:28:33
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As the majority of Taiwan's foreign investment went to China and the BRICs
(Brazil, Russia, India and China) had been the "media darlings" in recent years,
it's time for Taiwanese businesses to turn their focus to the Middle East and
Latin America, two regions with vast potential, financial researchers said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Economic development of six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members -- Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Qatar -- has been so
phenomenal that Taiwan has to be a part of it and take advantage of the great
opportunity, said Wang Mei-ling, a researcher of Polaris International
Securities Investment, in a forum which focused on investment opportunities in
developing nations.</P>
      <P>GCC member nations are expected  to have high demands in information technology
(IT) services, which is one of Taiwan's strengths. Therefore, it will be
Taiwan's great opportunity to make its way into the Middle East market, she
said.</P>
      <P>For example, Qatar is seeking help from Taiwan's Institute for Information
Industry (III) to plan for a science park. Taiwan will be able to provide with
its top-caliber engineers, which are among the most sought-after work force in
these Gulf nations, Wang said.</P>
      <P>These countries knew very well that they need to take advantage of the current
oil price surge and seek multi-faceted development to prepare for potential
price downfall or oil depletion. And that's why they will increase investments
in Asia dramatically while keep investing in the Western countries, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Investors in the region has shifted their priority to Asia following the Sept.
11 terrorist attack and deteriorating U.S.-Middle East relations, she claimed.</P>
      <P>A survey of more than a dozen Gulf investors found that they were planning to
place 10-30 percent of their assets allocation in Asia, she said, adding that
the amount could reach US$ 250 billion in the next five years and Taiwan should
try to attract some of the Middle East investors.</P>
      <P>The future of Latin America is intriguing as it has the advantages of large
markets, rich resources and rapid-developing labor skills, but the economic
integration and political stability in certain countries are still in doubt,
said Hsieh Ming-jui, a professor at National Open University's Department of
Business.</P>
      <P>Given the region's uncertainties, Taiwanese businesses will probably hesitate in
investing in Latin America, Hsieh said. However, the economic integration and
development of Latin America is expected to be a factor in Taiwan's global
competitiveness. Taiwan needs to understand more about the market and increase
bilateral cooperation, he said.</P>
      <P>The forum was organized by Taiwan Research Institute. Former president Lee Teng-
hui served as the Honorary Chairman of the institute.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Businesses encouraged to advert to Middle East, Latin America</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  29  (CNA)
10/30/07  11:57:10
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As the majority of Taiwan's foreign investment went to China and the BRICs
(Brazil, Russia, India and China) had been the "media darlings" in recent years,
it's time for Taiwanese businesses to turn their focus to the Middle East and
Latin America, two regions with vast potential, financial researchers said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Economic development of six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members -- Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Qatar -- has been so
phenomenal that Taiwan has to be a part of it and take advantage of the great
opportunity, said Wang Mei-ling, a researcher of Polaris International
Securities Investment, in a forum which focused on investment opportunities in
developing nations.</P>
      <P>GCC member nations are expected  to have high demands in information technology
(IT) services, which is one of Taiwan's strengths. Therefore, it will be
Taiwan's great opportunity to make its way into the Middle East market, she
said.</P>
      <P>For example, Qatar is seeking help from Taiwan's Institute for Information
Industry (III) to plan for a science park. Taiwan will be able to provide with
its top-caliber engineers, which are among the most sought-after work force in
these Gulf nations, Wang said.</P>
      <P>These countries knew very well that they need to take advantage of the current
oil price surge and seek multi-faceted development to prepare for potential
price downfall or oil depletion. And that's why they will increase investments
in Asia dramatically while keep investing in the Western countries, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Investors in the region has shifted their priority to Asia following the Sept.
11 terrorist attack and deteriorating U.S.-Middle East relations, she claimed.</P>
      <P>A survey of more than a dozen Gulf investors found that they were planning to
place 10-30 percent of their assets allocation in Asia, she said, adding that
the amount could reach US$ 250 billion in the next five years and Taiwan should
try to attract some of the Middle East investors.</P>
      <P>The future of Latin America is intriguing as it has the advantages of large
markets, rich resources and rapid-developing labor skills, but the economic
integration and political stability in certain countries are still in doubt,
said Hsieh Ming-jui, a professor at National Open University's Department of
Business.</P>
      <P>Given the region's uncertainties, Taiwanese businesses will probably hesitate in
investing in Latin America, Hsieh said. However, the economic integration and
development of Latin America is expected to be a factor in Taiwan's global
competitiveness. Taiwan needs to understand more about the market and increase
bilateral cooperation, he said.</P>
      <P>The forum was organized by Taiwan Research Institute. Former president Lee Teng-
hui served as the Honorary Chairman of the institute.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT U.N. bid referendum understandable to U.S.: Siew</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Oct. 29 (CNA)
10/30/07  11:59:20
(By Charles Kang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite Beijing's objections, Washington understands the motivation behind a
U.N. membership bid referendum proposed by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
,  KMT vice presidential candidate Vincent Siew has claimed in a recent
interview with a Singaporean Chinese-language daily.</P>
      <P>The Lianhe Zaobao published the interview, conducted in Taipei last Friday, in
its Monday edition.</P>
      <P>Dismissing a public misconception that the KMT's drive to call for a referendum
on "re-joining U.N." was following the lead of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) , Siew stated that the KMT launched the campaign with an aim of
checking and impeding the DPP.</P>
      <P>According to Siew, the DPP, with its plan to hold a referendum on what it
described as Taiwan's U.N. cause, is moving in a direction extremely dangerous
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The DPP has been pushing for a public referendum, to be held along with the
March 22, 2008 presidential election, on whether the country should pursue full
U.N. membership under the name of Taiwan, while the KMT, to counter the DPP, has
aslo initiated a signature campaign to call a referendum to re-join the world
body in the name of the Republic of China, Taiwan or some other feasible
designations.</P>
      <P>Now that President Chen Shui-bian has publicly said that holding a U.N.
membership referendum "definitely has to be done," the KMT certainly will not
back away from its own referendum proposal, Siew said.</P>
      <P>Although Beijing would not presently agree to the political course the KMT is
advocating, he argued, the ROC, as an independent sovereignty, has to
communicate the desire of its people to all the world.</P>
      <P>Siew, who visited the United States early this month in his capacity as the
KMT's vice presidential candidate to explain the meaning for his party's call
for a U. N. membership referendum, said that Washington is well aware of the
KMT's purpose in doing so and that is exactly why the United States has not, to
date, publicly voiced opposition to the KMT's U.N. bid referendum plan.</P>
      <P>In contrast, both Beijing and Washington voiced their objections to the U. N.
membership referendum proposed by the ruling DPP, saying that holding such a
referendum would step on a red-line in sensitive cross-Taiwan Strait relations
and mark a step towards "de-jure Taiwan independence."</P>
      <P>The KMT's U.N.  membership strategy is more pragmatic and flexible, as it
includes the ROC, Taiwan and other designations that the country has used in
other international organizations, he claimed.</P>
      <P>During his recent visit to the United States, Siew said, he learned that
Taiwan-U.S. relations have sustained "unprecedented" damage as a result of the
DPP's failure to keep its promises to the United States regarding cross-strait
ties.</P>
      <P>If the KMT regains power in the March 22, 2008 presidential election, it will
commit to making peace, rather than creating trouble, in the region, he said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the DPP's decision to make its "Taiwan-centric" notion a chief
plank in the coming presidential election, Siew contended that such a concept
should be more broadly defined, have a more profound meaning, and be more
flexibly applied in international contexts.</P>
      <P>A "Taiwan-centric" identity cannot be so narrow-minded that it is defined by
ethnicity as the DPP has claimed, Siew reiterated, adding that those who live in
Taiwan and contribute to the country are Taiwanese, not just those who were born
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the KMT maybe to blame for a great deal of wrongdoing
during its rule of Taiwan, but its economic achievements in turning Taiwan from
a poor society into a prosperous state are undeniable.</P>
      <P>Siew asserted that it is important to make people realize that after eight years
of reform, it is a revamped, clean and indigenous KMT which now seeks power in
the next presidential election.</P>
      <P>Siew also rebutted the president's misinterpretation of his proposal to develop
a "cross-strait common market" between Taiwan and China as a market oriented to
serve the "one China" position.</P>
      <P>The idea of a "cross-strait common market" is based on free flows of personnel,
merchandise and capital on a conditional basis between the two sides, and
absolutely will not infringe upon Taiwan's sovereignty because the governments
on both sides would first have to engage in normalizing two-way trade and
investment at the negotiating table before agreeing to build a common market.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT vice presidential candidate, a "cross-strait common market"
could help create a security framework for Taiwan over the long term on the
grounds that it would ensure steady and stable economic exchanges in the service
of the common interests of Taiwan and China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Minister clarifies controversial statement about car sizes</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R.L. Chen apologized Tuesday for a
controversial statement made a day earlier in which he defined cars with an
engine capacity of 3,000 cc as "small cars."</P>
      <P>Chen said his comment "was a relative statement and may not be precise enough, "
pointing out that what he really intended was to encourage people to use more
energy-efficient cars.</P>
      <P>At issue is a statement made by Chen during a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's
Economics and Energy Committee Monday, in which he suggested that members of the
general public drive less or replace their large cars with smaller ones to cope
with soaring oil prices.</P>
      <P>Asked if his 3,000 cc car can be considered a small car, Chen gave a positive
response.  The remarks immediately  triggered widespread criticism that Chen is
totally out of touch with Taiwan society, where cars below 2,000 cc are
generally accepted as small, economy cars.</P>
      <P>Chen explained to reporters Tuesday that what he meant was that he has replaced
his 3,800 cc car with a 3,000 cc one, admitting that a 3,000 cc car is usually
classified as a middle-to-large car in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that he replaced his large car with a smaller one and that he is
considering changing to an even smaller car in the future and driving less to
contribute to energy conservation efforts.</P>
      <P>Also asked to comment on the issue Tuesday, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said that
classifying car sizes according to engine capacity is a "technical matter, "
adding that the main point is to use cars that consume less energy and cause
less pollution.</P>
      <P>On whether he has any plans to replace his 4,600 cc car with a smaller one,
Chang said he will do so if related authorities come up with a comprehensive
plan to replace the energy-wasting cars used by Cabinet members with cars with
an engine capacity of below 3,000 cc or below 2,500 cc.</P>
      <P>The issue has come to the forefront as domestic gasoline and diesel prices are
expected to be further hiked by NT$0.7 to NT$0.8 per liter next month following
recent increases in international oil prices.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet has not been allowed to purchase cars with an engine capacity larger
than 3,000 cc for ministerial-level  officials  since  2001,  Executive  Yuan
Secretary-General Chen Chin-jun said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Referring to measures adopted by the Democratic Progressive Party administration
to conserve energy and cut costs, Chen said the upper limit for the value of
cars purchased for ministerial-level officials has also been lowered from NT$1.4
million to NT$1.2 million since 2001.</P>
      <P>In addition, from the start of 2008, the government will stop dispatching cars
to transport senior-level civil servants to and from work, Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the Environmental Protection Administration has also been
promoting the use of hybrid cars as part of an energy conservation campaign.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that many of the cars with large engine capacity, such as
Cadillacs, currently used by Cabinet members were purchased before 2001 and that
the vehicles have not been replaced because they have yet to reach the end of
their targeted service duration.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks amid public concerns about whether the Cabinet has any
plans to replace the energy-wasting cars used by many of its members, in the
wake of a recent proposal by Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R.L. Chen that
members of the general public drive less or replace their large cars with
smaller ones to cope with soaring oil prices.</P>
      <P>While the economics minister himself currently uses a 3,000 cc car, Premier
Chang Chun-hsing uses a 4,600 cc vehicle.</P>
      <P>Accusing Chen Chin-jun of lying, opposition Kuomintang Legislator Wu Yu-sheng
claimed the Cabinet earmarked NT$4 million in its 2006 budget plan for the
purchase of a car for then-Premier Frank Hsieh and that almost all the cars
currently used by ministerial-level officials are larger than 3,000 cc.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Kuo Su-chun claimed that a new car purchased for National
Security Council Secretary-General Tan Sun Chen is a 4,300 cc Japan-made sedan,
while another one purchased for Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Chen Ming-tong
is a 3,500 cc car which cost more than NT$1.2 million.</P>
      <P>In related news, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) Deputy spokeswoman Yeh Fei-
pi said that the ministry purchased its first hybrid car in late September to be
used as a limousine to receive foreign guests and that it will purchase more
such eco-friendly vehicles in the future.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, the MOFA now has a total of 31 limousines and 30 cars for
business use in Taiwan, and the MOFA uses cars more frequently than any other
ministries do owing to the ministry's need to receive foreign guests.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Yeh said the country's 121 diplomatic missions overseas have a total
of 521 business cars and that in deciding what car models to purchase for use by
these overseas missions, the MOFA will take into consideration local car and

      <P>The government will offer assistance to local semiconductor firms in the
establishment of 18-inch-wafer plants in an effort to expand Taiwan's global
reach in this regard, according to Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R.L. Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks Monday at a meeting held in Taipei with senior corporate
executives, experts, and scholars in the semiconductor industry to hear their
opinions on the future development of the industry.</P>
      <P>The meeting, which came after another one held recently by the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) with local solar energy firms, is part of the
government's efforts to understand whether its policy direction is in line with
the development of local industries.</P>
      <P>Noting that Intel, the world's biggest chipmaker, has announced a plan to
research and develop the next generation's 18-inch-wafer plants, Chen said that
the government will help local enterprises introduce cutting-edge technologies.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the government will promote joint investment by local firms and the
world's first-rate facility and equipment factories in the research and
development of 18-inch-wafer plants in order to lower the total investment costs
and risks, Chen went on.</P>
      <P>Through these efforts, the government hopes to increase the global market share
of Taiwan's semiconductor industry in order to maintain the industry's
competitiveness in the future, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>However, an executive of the firm said at the meeting that given the trend to
set up 18-inch-wafer plants, it is necessary to note that by 2009, there will be
22 12-inch-wafer plants in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If the government suddenly changes its policy towards the development of 18
-inch-wafer plants, how to deal with existing 12-inch-wafer plants will be a big
problem, the executive warned, citing the current problem of phasing out 8-inch-
wafer plants as an example.</P>

      <P>Several academics called Monday for significant action to be taken in Taiwan in
terms of environmental protection, urging the public to "establish a new
relationship with the forests."</P>
      <P>The academics made the appeal on the first day of a two-day 2007 International
Workshop on Global Environmental Governance being held at the Transworld
Institute of Technology in Yunlin, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang Tze-chien and Chen Tai-an,  both professors  at the institute, have
initiated an action plan to protect rainforests in Indonesia  and organized the
conference  to call international attention to the excessive deforestation
taking place in Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Chang said they are promoting international cooperation in this regard and are
planning concrete actions.</P>
      <P>Cheng Hsien-yiou, dean of the College of Environmental Sciences and Ecology at
the National University of Tainan, southern Taiwan, stressed that governments,
businesses and regular citizens around the world have paid a heavy price for the
blind and excessive development that has occurred at the expense of forests. He
called for the establishment of a new relationship between people and the
forests to break the "impasse that exists between humanity and nature."</P>
      <P>Cheng suggested that countries around the world put the brakes on excessive
deforestation and over-consumption, devote more resources to the study of
forests, and encourage members of local communities to participate in forest
administration and the establishment of the rule of law.</P>
      <P>The conference is focusing on global experience sharing on environmental
administration, with several reports being released on the situation of the
forests in Sumatra, Indonesia, the preservation of endangered species of birds,
the possibility of Taiwan-Indonesia technology cooperation in organic
agriculture, as well as green consumption.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan will not interfere with the domestic price of oil, which is
set to rise next month in accordance  with a floating pricing mechanism,
Executive Yuan Secretary-General Chen Chin-jun said Monday.</P>
      <P>Under the current pricing mechanism, the government will freeze the price only
when it has risen to a level 15 percent or more above that of Sept. 2 when the
mechanism kicked into action.</P>
      <P>Given that the 15 percent ceiling has yet not been reached, and that the pricing
mechanism was formulated after extensive discussion and was just adopted Sept.
2, Chen said that the Cabinet has decided not to interfere in the oil market.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after Premier Chang Chun-hsiung held a Cabinet meeting to
respond to a call, issued by legislators earlier in the day, to temporarily
freeze prices on all oil products in the face of surging global oil prices.</P>
      <P>Noting that domestic gasoline and diesel prices are still lower than those of
neighboring countries, Chen called for calm and urged consumers to conserve oil
and electricity in response to possible price hikes, noting that Taiwan is
heavily dependent on imported oil.</P>
      <P>Chen added that at the moment the government has no plans to adjust the prices
of natural gas, tanked household gas or fuel oil. Such inputs impact the price
fluctuations of common consumer goods, the basic costs of living, and the
welfare of disadvantaged groups.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan needs to act aggressively to boost and maintain diplomatic ties with its
six South Pacific allies as Beijing is acting to supplant Taiwan in this
strategically important area rich in marine resources, a senior foreign affairs
official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Donald C. T. Lee, director-general of the Department of East Asian and Pacific
Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) , made the remarks at the MOFA
routine press conference, underlining the importance of strengthening the
country's relations with its South Pacific allies.</P>
      <P>Lee recently returned from Tonga where he attended the 38th Pacific Islands
Forum, which took place Oct. 16-17 in Nukualofa, the capital city of the South
Pacific island-state.</P>
      <P>Lee indicated that none of the six Pacific countries -- including Palau, Tuvalu,
the Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands, Kiribati and Nauru -- that maintains
diplomatic ties with Taiwan occupies a vast territory.</P>
      <P>However, Lee said Taiwan can help them in a wide range of fields, including
medical treatment and health care, sanitary improvement, environmental
protection, economic and trade cooperation, fishing resources, military
strategy, and Austronesian culture.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, Taiwan's aid policy to those Pacific friends has focused on
"project-oriented" assistance, such as offering technical expertise to help the
countries stand on their own, Lee said, noting that the policy can also save
Taiwan from criticisms by New Zealand and Australia, both of which have accused
Taiwan of conducting "checkbook diplomacy" in the region.</P>
      <P>Speaking of military strategy, Lee said both China and Japan have displayed a
great desire to extend their influence in the Pacific area, revealing China has
never given up its attempt to re-erect a satellite monitoring station in the
region since it dismantled a facility of this kind in Kiribati when the latter
switched diplomatic recognition from China to Taiwan in 2003.</P>
      <P>Without the Kiribati satellite monitoring station, Lee said that Beijing can no
longer monitor movements at the U.S. missile base located in the Marshall
Islands.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan is very much concerned about China's desire to rebuild a
monitoring facility in the region, Lee added.</P>
      <P>In terms of environmental protection, the MOFA official mentioned that Tuvalu
and Kiribati face great threats from rising sea levels due to global warming. He
said it is believed that Tuvalu could disappear below the waves in 50 years.</P>
      <P>In the face of that crisis, Chen said Tuvalu has asked Australia and New Zealand
to take in its immigrants and proposed cooperating with Taiwan to build sea wall
against the coming flood.</P>
      <P>That proposal is now being evaluated by the Cabinet-level Environmental
Protection Administration, Lee said.</P>

The market is convinced the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates tomorrow,
but for the Fed itself, it is a closer call.

The behavior of financial markets implies near certainty by investors of a
quarter-point cut in the Fed's key short-term interest rate.  But for policy
makers,  the decision  is between  the quarter-point reduction and no cut at
all. A half-point cut is unlikely to get serious consideration from Fed
officials, though some in the market expect it.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Judicial Yuan President Weng Yueh-sheng was spared graft charges Tuesday
as prosecutors said they found no irregularities in his use of a discretionary
"special allowance fund" during his time at the head of the country's top
judicial organ.</P>
      <P>Chu Chao-liang, a member of a prosecutorial team responsible for investigating
how Weng used his "special allowance fund" while in office, said Weng clearly
recorded each item for which reimbursement was claimed from the special monetary
fund and that no breaches of law had been detected after a thorough review and
painstaking scrutiny.</P>
      <P>According to Chu, most of Weng's "special allowance fund" was spent entertaining
guests for official purposes, and he had earmarked NT$30,000 per month for use
by his personal aides.</P>
      <P>Weng, who retired from public service late last month, was among a group of
senior officials whom the main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) legislative
caucus targeted in a legal suit filed Nov. 23, 2006 with the Taiwan High
Prosecutors Office in a probe into suspected misuse of the "special allowance
fund."</P>
      <P>At the first, the case was handled by prosecutor Chen Jui-jen. After the Supreme
Prosecutors Office formed a special task force in April this year to deal with
cases involving official corruption and other major crimes, three prosecutors
with the task force -- Chu Chao-liang, Wu Wen-chung and Lee Hai-lung -- were
assigned to take over Weng's case.</P>
      <P>Chu said the amount allocated for Weng's "special allowance fund" had declined
steadily from a high of NT$180,000 (US$5,538.46) per month to a mere NT$105,500
last year.  Until  August  2006, reimbursement for half of Weng's "special
allowance fund" was backed by original proofs of spending, such as uniform
invoices, while the remaining half was claimed with Weng's duly signed receipts.</P>
      <P>A senior Judicial Yuan official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Weng
consistently entrusted half of the "special allowance fund" claimed with his
signature to the management of one of his aides.</P>
      <P>To the best of his understanding, the official said, Weng's "special allowance
fund" was used legally and none of the surplus went to line his own pocket. On
the contrary, he said Weng often overspent and had to make up the difference out
of his own money.</P>
      <P>Starting in September 2006, Weng claimed all of his "special allowance fund"
with original proofs of spending or invoices.</P>
      <P>While there are differing opinions concerning whether the nature of the "special
allowance fund" set aside for discretionary use by certain public agency heads
or local government chiefs is strictly a "public fund" or a "substantial
subsidy" for public functionaries, the prosecutorial team said such a question
was not involved in Weng's case since his claims on the fund were entirely legal
and fully used for official functions.</P>
      <P>The "special allowance fund" issue came into spotlight after main opposition KMT
presidential candidate for the 2008 election Ma Ying-jeou was indicted Feb. 13
on charges of embezzling NT$11.17 million from his "special allowance fund"
during his tenure as Taipei mayor from 1998-2006. He was acquitted Aug. 14 in
the first trial. His acquittal is now being reviewed by the Taiwan High Court
after prosecutors appealed the case.</P>
      <P>As a result of political wrangling between the KMT-led "pan-blue" alliance and
the "pan-green" camp led by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) ,
many "special allowance fund"-related lawsuits have been filed with prosecutors.</P>
      <P>Among others, three DPP heavyweights -- Vice President Annette Lu, former DPP
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and National Security Council Secretary-General Tan Sun
Chen -- have been indicted on charges of corruption  and  forgery  over
"special  allowance  fund" misappropriation.</P>
      <P>Lu's trial is set for Nov. 19, while the trial of Yu is slated for Nov. 26 and
that of Tan Sun Chen is scheduled for Dec. 3.</P>
      <P>Like Weng, the DPP presidential candidate Frank Hsieh and his running mate Su
Tseng-chang were spared corruption charges in Spetember after prosecutors failed
to find any irregularities in their use of their "special allowance fund" during
Hsieh's tenures as premier and as Kaohsiung  mayor and Su's tenures as premier,
presidential secretary-general and Taipei County magistrate.</P>

      <P>Frank Hsieh, the presidential candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) , urged the government Tuesday to temporarily freeze domestic
gasoline prices and promised that he will quickly swap opinions with Premier
Chang Chun-hsiung regarding the issue.</P>
      <P>Hsieh issued the call at a news conference held at the DPP headquarters while
answering questions from reporters.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who served as premier from 2005-2006, called for a temporary freeze on
gasoline prices in the domestic market as the Executive Yuan has approved price
increases for some oil products that are set to be implemented Friday in line
with the government's floating oil pricing system.</P>
      <P>Despite a set of official mechanisms to adjust oil product prices, the
government has some flexibility when it comes to intervening in the short term
to tackle hoarding or manipulating the prices of derivative goods in view of the
high flying price of crude oil in international markets, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>"It will fuel the public's expectations that oil prices in the domestic market
will further rise if the government sticks to the formula to deal with rising
oil prices, " he argued, adding that he will suggest that the Executive Yuan
conduct short-term adjustments so as to fend off the ensuing price hikes in
other merchandise and mitigate the impact on people's daily lives.</P>
      <P>"The government is obliged to take good care of the people, particularly at a
time when the prices of everything are soaring, and this is the reason why I
always did my best to reject hikes in water fees and electricity rates when
serving as premier," he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsieh is reported to have phoned Chang Chun-hsiung earlier the same
day, inviting him to discuss the issue. The two men are likely to meet and
exchange views concerning the matter later the same day, Hsieh's aides said.</P>
      <P>According to ranking DPP officials, the viewpoints of both Hsieh and the
Executive Yuan have to be fully respected, and a consensus is expected to be
forged within the party following its weekly Central Standing Committee meeting
Wednesday.</P>

court in Penghu, where Chen comes from, for trial, the officials said, noting
that this is the first overseas case in which the CGA has successfully gained
assistance from countries with no diplomatic ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 45-year-old Chen reportedly used a private pistol to shoot dead the
Vietnamese worker following a number of verbal and physical conflicts Oct. 19,
the CGA officials said.</P>
      <P>The Japanese fishing boat later stopped at the Ivory Coast where other crew
members reported the case to local police, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>After learning of the incident, the CGA officials said that they sought
assistance from the foreign ministry to negotiate with officials in Ivory Coast
over the deportation of the Taiwanese suspect.</P>
      <P>Due to the absence of diplomatic relations between Taiwan and Ivory Coast, and
interference from China, Ivorian police initially refused to deport the suspect
to Taiwan, the officials went on.</P>
      <P>Police of the Ivory Coast later agreed to turn the suspect over to Taiwan's
officials after the Taiwanese side insisted that the case fell within its
jurisdiction on the grounds that the incident occurred on the high seas and the
suspect is a Taiwanese citizen, the officials said.</P>

      <P>The mandated margin of safety of the Maokong Gondola in Taipei will not be
lowered, out of respect for the recommendations of the builder and to guarantee
the safety of the public, deputy secretary-general of Taipei city government
Yang Hsi-an said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Yang made the remarks in response to suggestions that the Taipei MRT, which
operates the Maokong Gondola, lower the margin of safety of the Maokong Gondola,
a four-kilometer long cable car system passing through scenic southern mountain
area of Taipei, in order to avoid frequent suspension of the system due to minor
mechanical failures.</P>
      <P>Operations of the Maokong Gondola were suspended for one minute because of
insufficient distance between carriages Tuesday morning, the day after it
resumed service after an eight-day hiatus for cable trimming, a procedure
necessary after a period of operation for any large-scale gondola system to
maintain the required cable tension.</P>
      <P>Yang explained that Tuesday's one-minute suspension was made in accordance with
the sensitive detective system of the gondola.</P>
      <P>Regarding the suggestions of some city government officials that the safety
margin of Maokong Gondola be lowered to prevent frequent suspensions of service
that have created a negative impression, Yang stressed that the safety margin of
the gondola was established by the French builder POMA, and should be respected
by the city government.</P>
      <P>The Maokong Gondola began services July 4 this year to an enthusiastic reception
from the public. However, the system has encountered frequent mechanical
failures, causing many complaints and public criticisms.</P>

      <P>He suggested staff members of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative

      <P>The 2005-2006 academic year saw school resumption rates of 76.04 percent, an
increase of 5.2 percent over the previous year, a Ministry of Education (MOE)
official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the MOE, the official said 7,453 junior high and
elementary students dropped out of schools during the same academic year, a
decrease of 715 from the year-earlier level. Meanwhile, 5,668 students resumed

      <P>Taipei County, Taoyuan County, and Kaohsiung County have the highest numbers of
both dropout and school resumption rates, the official said.</P>
      <P>The official attributed the increasing school resumption rates to counselling
efforts made by related schooling institutes  and organizations.</P>
      <P>Of the total number of dropouts, 18.76 percent or 1,398 were elementary school
students, while other 6,055 were junior high school students, the official said.</P>
      <P>Some 992 dropouts were aboriginal students, the largest numbers of whom were in
Taitung, Hualien and Hsinchu counties.</P>
      <P>Students tend to drop out of school for reasons related to personal, family or

      <P>To better serve Kinmen residents flying between Kinmen and Taipei, Taipei-based
Trans Asia Airways will, beginning Nov. 1, upgrade its fleet and offer discount
ticket prices on the route, Trans Asia General Manager Dennis Tien announced
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Tien made the announcement following a meeting earlier the same day with Kinmen
County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng at the Kinmen County Government office.</P>
      <P>Lee warmly welcomed the carrier's measures and expressed the hope that other
aviation companies would follow the lead and provide better service to Kinmen
residents.</P>
      <P>According to Tien, starting Thursday, Trans Asia will use 150-seat A320s and
182-seat A321s to ply the Kinmen-Taipei route, and local residents with
registered households on the outlying island will be entitled to a 50 percent
discount on ticket prices onboard Trans Asia's Kinmen-Taipei flights until the
end of December.</P>
      <P>The adjustment will see eight of Trans Asia's jet planes fly between the two
destinations per day, offering a total 1,044 seat capacity on a daily basis, up
from the previous level of 740 seats.</P>
      <P>Among Taiwan's 18 domestic airports, Shangyi Airport on Kinmen Island is the
fourth-largest airport in terms of transportation volumes, only trailing behind
Taipei's Songshan Airport, Kaohsiung International Airport and Makung Airport on
Penghu Island, Tien said, adding that Shangyi Airport is rapidly catching up
with Makung Airport.</P>
      <P>As Kinmen has a great potential to develop its tourism thanks to its location
and the direct ferry services maintained between Kinmen and Xiamen in China's
Fujian Province, Trans Asia decided to upgrade and enhance its service on the
Taipei-Kinmen route, he explained.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese non-government organization (NGO) Tuesday established an alliance
with a Japanese NGO to strengthen the capabilities of both to further pursue
international humanitarian  works  and deepen  their global  impact  through
collaboration.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Root Medical Peace Corps (TRMPC) , an NGO devoted to humanitarian  relief
and emergency medical services,  signed a memorandum of agreement with Peace
Winds Japan (PWJ) , which is operating more than 50 relief projects around the
world.</P>
      <P>As the majority of its members are physicians and surgeons, TRMPC will be able
to provide medical assistance which PWJ cannot, said TRMPC President Liu Chi-
chun in a press conference.</P>
      <P>PWJ will be able to help its Taiwanese ally to obtain visas to countries that do
not have official diplomatic ties with Taiwan through foreign embassies in
Tokyo, PWJ chief executive officer Kensuke Onishi said, adding that Taiwanese
humanitarian workers could join PWJ missions in the future to avoid political
interference.</P>
      <P>TRMPC missions have failed to enter Tanzania, Lebanon and Pakistan in the past
for political reasons, which was unfortunate because international humanitarian
works should know no borders, Liu said.</P>
      <P>The alliance is expected to begin collaborating on emergency relief work in the
wake of earthquakes and on several projects in Africa, Liu said. Onishi added
that PWJ, with an annual budget of 1.5 billion Yen, will be able to provide help
with funding as the TRMPC does not conduct public fund-raising events.</P>
      <P>Onishi said he would describe the alliance as the "integration of Japanese and
Taiwanese civil societies", and therefore deeper than the simple collaboration
of two NGOs.</P>
      <P>The two parties will strengthen their mutual relations and promote cooperation
for organizational interaction with international institutions.  Staff
exchanges  will  be carried  out on all organizational levels through field
visits,  training seminars, internships, conferences, and consultations, Liu
said.</P>
      <P>TRMPC was established in 1995 and has participated in relief works in Kosovo,
Macedonia as well as Taiwan. PWJ, one of the largest NGOs in Japan, was
established in 1996 and currently employs about 50 paid staff members and 1,000
volunteers around the world.</P>

      <P>The "Million Voices Against Corruption" campaign headquarters donated Tuesday
all the money it has collected for the campaign since last year to five social
welfare organizations in the country at the same time as it announced the end of
the movement.</P>
      <P>The headquarters' chief press director Chang Fu-chung, as well as two deputy
chief commanders Wei Chien-fung and Hsu Po-yun held a press conference in Taipei
City to present the donation. They also announced the failed campaign to topple
scandal-ridden President Chen Shui-bian has come to its end.</P>
      <P>In the future, there will be no more large-scale public movements concerning the
campaign but the headquarters will continue to promote the idea of fighting
against corruption and the formation of relevant laws through writing articles,
Wei said.</P>
      <P>Addressing the money issue, Chang explained that they collected more than NT$100
million (US$3.08 million) in total to finance the anti-corruption campaign
initiated by Shih Ming-teh,  a former chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party last August.</P>
      <P>Currently, they still have NT$15.67 million on hand, an amount which has been
independently audited and certified by the Taipei City Certified Public
Accountants Association, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Under strict  public monitoring,  Cheng stressed  that the headquarters would
never dare to allocate the so-called "promise money, " which the headquarters
promised donors would only be used on anti-corruption campaigns, for other
purposes or for the personal use of headquarters members.</P>
      <P>Chang also indicated that the headquarters stopped spending the "promise money"
in September, saying the cost of holding a "Return to the Ketagalan Boulevard"
rally Sept. 9 was paid by the headquarters' deputy commander out of his own
pocket.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of thousands of the protesters, answering the call of the campaign
headquarters, staged several large sit-ins and rallies on Ketagalan last
September demanding that President Chen resign. The activities climaxed with a
half-million  people encircling the Presidential Office on National Day on Oct.
10. The movement had gradually died out by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing urged the Ministry of Justice
Tuesday to stamp out vote-buying in a township election -- the fourth in five
years -- so that his county will be spared the disgrace of having to hold a
fifth election in six years.</P>
      <P>Yang made the call in the wake of rampant rumors in the county about vote-buying
by some of the candidates in the Nov.  10 by-election of the head of Niaosung
township.</P>
      <P>Yang said he had paid a call at the Ministry of Justice, asking law enforcement
personnel to make more strenuous efforts to stamp out vote buying.</P>
      <P>Noting that vote buying is the main reason why Niaosung township has to hold the
fourth election in five years, Yang expressed the worry that if the next by-
election is again ruined by vote buying, making it necessary to hold a fifth
election, the township will be remembered as "the greatest disgrace" in the
Kaohsiung County history.</P>
      <P>Niaosung township has a population of 41,000 people, 31,000 of whom are elegible
to vote.</P>
      <P>In a Jan. 26, 2002 election, Chang Mei-yao was elected township head but removed
from office after a court found her guilty of taking bribes in the run-up to the
election of township council speaker and deputy speaker. Her husband Lin Jung-
tsung won the township head by-election Nov. 1, 2003</P>
      <P>Lin won re-election Dec. 3, 2005 but was later convicted of vote-buying and
stripped of his post, prompting another by-election.</P>
      <P>Chang, a member of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), staged a comeback by
declaring her candidacy in the Nov. 10 by-election, pitting herself against KMT
candidate Chen Chin-chuan and a candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive

      <P>The government will hold a coordination meeting on small biting midge
eradication in Taichung City Nov. 16 to exchange views with local governments on
solving problems caused by the pest, the Taichung city government's
Environmental Protection Bureau Chief Lee Li-to said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The meeting will be attended by representatives of the National Science Council
(NSC), the Department of Health (DOH), the Council of Agriculture (COA), and six
regions in central Taiwan whose residents are suffering from the biting midge
problem, including Taichung City and the counties of Taichung, Miaoli, Yunlin,
Changhua and Nantou, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The tiny insect, barely visible to the naked eye, is known locally as the little
black mosquito, although it is actually not a mosquito. Its bite causes severe
itching and irritation that can last for days and leave scars that take even
longer to heal.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the meeting marks the first time the central government
convened a meeting on solving the biting midge problem since Taichung Mayor
Jason Hu asked former Premier Su Tseng-chang for assistance in the matter in
March.</P>
      <P>Lee said the Central Taiwan University of Science and Technology in Taichung
City started genetic research on reducing the population of biting midges, using
subsidies provided by the NSC. The school set up a demonstration area in
Taichung City and has carried out field experiments since August.</P>
      <P>The NSC will present the research results at the coordination meeting for the
reference of local governments, Lee went on, adding that the DOH and the COA
will give briefings on efforts already made to solve the problem, while the six
local governments will report on their efforts.</P>
      <P>The meeting  will  be presided  over  by Yuan  Shao-ying, director-general of
the DOH Bureau of Environmental Sanitation and Toxic Substance Control, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>Lee said Taichung City has spent NT$1.75 million (US$53,850) on pesticide
spraying and on hiring the Taichung Pest Control Association to monitor the
effectiveness of the spraying, while a subsidy of NT$340,000 from the central
government was used for research into biting midge densities by the Central

      <P>Taiwan's online shopping market value is expected to increase to NT$252.9
billion (US$7.8 billion) in 2008 from this year's level of approximately
NT$185.5 billion, according to the latest assessment by the Market Intelligence
Center (MIC) , a local ICT industry and market research firm.</P>
      <P>MIC senior analyst Chou Wen-ching released the assessment, along with his
research report on the online consumption behavior of Taiwanese people, at a
conference organized by MIC on online consumptions trend and retail channels
that was attended by local marketing executives.</P>

frequently by Taiwanese Internet users in 2007 include using search engines,
using instant messaging, sending e-mails, downloading software, shopping and
booking tickets, reading blogs and visiting knowledge-oriented Web sites.</P>
      <P>Chou said a survey conducted for the report also found that 80 percent of online
shoppers read product reviews before purchasing and that 74 percent would take
into account blog evaluations when choosing products.</P>
      <P>The results show that most online shoppers place orders directly with Web-based
shops, accounting for 39.8 percent of all shoppers on the Internet. Another 35.8
percent purchase goods directly on auction Web sites, 22.5 percent join online
auctions, and 1.9 percent usually choose group buys to secure better prices.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOJ urged to stamp out vote-buying in Kaohsiung County by-election</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung County,  Oct. 30 (CNA)
10/31/07  10:39:00
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing urged the Ministry of Justice
Tuesday to stamp out vote-buying in a township election -- the fourth in five
years -- so that his county will be spared the disgrace of having to hold a
fifth election in six years.</P>
      <P>Yang made the call in the wake of rampant rumors in the county about vote-buying
by some of the candidates in the Nov.  10 by-election of the head of Niaosung
township.</P>
      <P>Yang said he had paid a call at the Ministry of Justice, asking law enforcement
personnel to make more strenuous efforts to stamp out vote buying.</P>
      <P>Noting that vote buying is the main reason why Niaosung township has to hold the
fourth election in five years, Yang expressed the worry that if the next by-
election is again ruined by vote buying, making it necessary to hold a fifth
election, the township will be remembered as "the greatest disgrace" in the
Kaohsiung County history.</P>
      <P>Niaosung township has a population of 41,000 people, 31,000 of whom are elegible
to vote.</P>
      <P>In a Jan. 26, 2002 election, Chang Mei-yao was elected township head but removed
from office after a court found her guilty of taking bribes in the run-up to the
election of township council speaker and deputy speaker. Her husband Lin Jung-
tsung won the township head by-election Nov. 1, 2003</P>
      <P>Lin won re-election Dec. 3, 2005 but was later convicted of vote-buying and
stripped of his post, prompting another by-election.</P>
      <P>Chang, a member of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), staged a comeback by
declaring her candidacy in the Nov. 10 by-election, pitting herself against KMT
candidate Chen Chin-chuan and a candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party, Wang Hui-lin.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Meeting on biting midge eradication to be held in Taichung</HEADLINE>

      <P>The government will hold a coordination meeting on small biting midge
eradication in Taichung City Nov. 16 to exchange views with local governments on
solving problems caused by the pest, the Taichung city government's
Environmental Protection Bureau Chief Lee Li-to said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The meeting will be attended by representatives of the National Science Council
(NSC), the Department of Health (DOH), the Council of Agriculture (COA), and six
regions in central Taiwan whose residents are suffering from the biting midge
problem, including Taichung City and the counties of Taichung, Miaoli, Yunlin,
Changhua and Nantou, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The tiny insect, barely visible to the naked eye, is known locally as the little
black mosquito, although it is actually not a mosquito. Its bite causes severe
itching and irritation that can last for days and leave scars that take even
longer to heal.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the meeting marks the first time the central government
convened a meeting on solving the biting midge problem since Taichung Mayor
Jason Hu asked former Premier Su Tseng-chang for assistance in the matter in
March.</P>
      <P>Lee said the Central Taiwan University of Science and Technology in Taichung
City started genetic research on reducing the population of biting midges, using
subsidies provided by the NSC. The school set up a demonstration area in
Taichung City and has carried out field experiments since August.</P>
      <P>The NSC will present the research results at the coordination meeting for the
reference of local governments, Lee went on, adding that the DOH and the COA
will give briefings on efforts already made to solve the problem, while the six
local governments will report on their efforts.</P>
      <P>The meeting  will  be presided  over  by Yuan  Shao-ying, director-general of
the DOH Bureau of Environmental Sanitation and Toxic Substance Control, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>Lee said Taichung City has spent NT$1.75 million (US$53,850) on pesticide
spraying and on hiring the Taichung Pest Control Association to monitor the
effectiveness of the spraying, while a subsidy of NT$340,000 from the central
government was used for research into biting midge densities by the Central
Taiwan University of Science and Technology.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's online shopping market value is expected to increase to NT$252.9
billion (US$7.8 billion) in 2008 from this year's level of approximately
NT$185.5 billion, according to the latest assessment by the Market Intelligence
Center (MIC) , a local ICT industry and market research firm.</P>
      <P>MIC senior analyst Chou Wen-ching released the assessment, along with his
research report on the online consumption behavior of Taiwanese people, at a
conference organized by MIC on online consumptions trend and retail channels
that was attended by local marketing executives.</P>

frequently by Taiwanese Internet users in 2007 include using search engines,
using instant messaging, sending e-mails, downloading software, shopping and
booking tickets, reading blogs and visiting knowledge-oriented Web sites.</P>
      <P>Chou said a survey conducted for the report also found that 80 percent of online
shoppers read product reviews before purchasing and that 74 percent would take
into account blog evaluations when choosing products.</P>
      <P>The results show that most online shoppers place orders directly with Web-based
shops, accounting for 39.8 percent of all shoppers on the Internet. Another 35.8
percent purchase goods directly on auction Web sites, 22.5 percent join online
auctions, and 1.9 percent usually choose group buys to secure better prices.</P>

billion, made up of some NT$108 billion in the business-to-consumer  market and
around NT$77.4 billion in the consumer-to-consumer market.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The European Confederation of Iron and Steel Industries (EUROFER) has officially
filed anti-dumping charges against certain steel products from Taiwan, China and
South Korea, a EUROFER official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>EUROFER Director-General Gordon Moffat told the CNA that the charges targeting
cold-rolled steel sheets from the three countries were filed Monday with the
European Commission.</P>
      <P>In addition to Taiwan's move to sell cold-rolled steel sheets at prices lower
than the production cost, the sharp increase in the quantity of Taiwan's cold-
rolled steel sheet exports to the European Union in recent years was another
major reason behind the EUROFER's decision to file the anti-dumping charges,
Moffat said.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan's cold-rolled steel sheet exports to the European Union
rose from 45,000 tons in 2005 to 95,000 tons in 2006 and that the figure is
expected to further increase to 168,000 tons for 2007, adding that Taiwan's
cold-rolled steel sheet exports have attained a market share of over 1 percent
in the EU.</P>
      <P>When asked about the matter by the CNA, a European Commission official in charge
of trade policy declined to confirm whether the commission has received official
notification of any anti-dumping charges from the EUROFER.</P>
      <P>According to European Commission rules, upon receiving notice of an anti-dumping
charge, the commission will complete a study of the case within 45 days to
determine  whether formal anti-dumping investigations are warranted.</P>
      <P>In addition to pressing anti-dumping charges against China's cold-rolled steel
sheets, the EUROFER also lodged anti-dumping charges against China's galvanized
steel sheets Monday. It is also planning to file similar charges against other
steel products from China over the coming weeks, according to Moffat.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Temple University in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania is set to sign pacts with
six universities in Taiwan on academic cooperation, a Taiwan diplomatic source
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Temple University President Ann Weaver Hart is scheduled to arrive in Taiwan
Wednesday for a three-day visit in the company of several administrative
officials of the university, mainly for the purpose of signing agreements with
six Taiwan universities on joint efforts to promote double degree programs,
according to officials from the Cultural Division of the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office in New York.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu and Education Minister Tu Cheng-sheng reportedly will
attend a ceremony to be held at National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) in
Taipei Thursday to mark the signing of the agreements on double degree programs
between Temple University and NTNU; National Taiwan University of Science and
Technology; National Cheng Kung University; National Sun Yat-sen University;
Tunghai University and Chung Yuan Christian University, the Taiwan officials
said.</P>
      <P>Under the agreements on double degree programs -- sometimes called conjoint
degree, dual degree, or simultaneous degree programs -- students from the six
Taiwan universities will be able to attend Temple  University  after  they
finish  three years  of their undergraduate education in Taiwan to study in the
same subject area or in different subjects.</P>
      <P>Under the agreements, Temple University will recognize the credits that the
Taiwan university students earn in Taiwan. The students will also be able to
study at Temple University's graduate schools and will have a good chance of
obtaining their master's degrees in two years, the officials said.</P>
      <P>To attract Taiwan university students, Temple University will also offer
exclusive English classes and scholarships for the students, the officials
added.</P>
      <P>A double degree program allows the two participating institutions to reduce the
amount of time a student needs to earn degrees at both institutions.  For
example,  a  joint  Master  of  Business Administration/J.D. typically takes
four years to complete, as opposed to the five years it would take to complete
each program separately.</P>
      <P>Established in 1884, Temple University, a privately-run research university,
maintains 18 schools and colleges, including four professional  schools.  It has
eight  campuses  and sites  in Pennsylvania, as well as international campuses
in Rome, Tokyo and London, and programs in China, South Korea, Greece, Israel
and other locations around the world. It ranks as the 26th largest university in
the United States in terms of number of students and faculty members.</P>
      <P>Among the Temple faculty members expected to accompany Weaver Hart on her
forthcoming Taiwan visit is Hai-Lung Dai, dean and Laura H. Carnell Professor of
the College of Science and Technology, who was born and raised in Taiwan and
pursued advanced studies in the United States.</P>
      <P>Dai will be a chief liaison officer for Temple University's double degree
program, according to the officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier asks for preparations for gasoline price hikes</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31  (CNA)
10/31/07  14:46:51
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung asked the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
Wednesday to "make preparations" for gasoline price hikes based on a floating
oil pricing system.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang made the remarks amid concerns that the MOEA will adjust fuel
prices upward and add to the woes of the public who are already feeling the
pinch of rising living costs due to a series of basic goods price increases.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet had decided Monday to hike gasoline prices in line with the floating
pricing system which is linked to world oil prices. However, Frank Hsieh, the
presidential candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), urged
the government the following day to temporarily freeze domestic gasoline prices.</P>
      <P>Despite a set of official mechanisms to adjust oil product prices, the
government has some flexibility when it comes to intervening in the short term
to tackle hoarding or manipulation of the prices of derivative goods in view of
the high flying price of crude oil in international markets, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang asked the MOEA to prepare for gasoline and diesel price hikes.
However, to avoid a serious impact on the average family, small shops, and
small- and medium-sized enterprises, he added, prices for fuel oil, natural gas
and liquefied petroleum gas cylinders will not be adjusted for the time being.</P>
      <P>Whether gasoline prices will be raised or not should be clear after a DPP
Central Standing Committee meeting slated for Wednesday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Economics and Energy Committee of the Legislative Yuan passed a
resolution Wednesday urging the MOEA not to adjust gasoline prices upward before
the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Committee members focused on gasoline prices when they met to review the MOEA's
budget for the next year.</P>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Shih Yen-hsiang said the floating oil pricing mechanism
was only implemented in September after extensive debates.</P>
      <P>"Before the mechanism is revised, the ministry thinks it should continue to be
followed," Shih said.</P>
      <P>Committee members said that they are not asking for a scraping of the mechanism
but instead for a "temporary freezing" of it. They also noted that the state-
owned CPC Corp. has reached its targeted legal profit surplus for the year and
that it should now consider the needs of the public.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet is set to carry out the second phase of a national flood control and
management project from 2008 to 2010, with the goal of accomplishing 90 percent
of the targeted areas of work by the end of June 2008, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Making the remarks during a weekly Cabinet meeting, Chang noted that the project
was worked out by the Cabinet in July 2005 in light of the significant increase
in extreme rainfall events in Taiwan as a result of global climate change.</P>
      <P>The project, which covers a series of measures to clean up rivers and improve
regional drainage systems and sea dams in flood-prone areas, is set to be
carried out in three phases over an eight-year period, Chang said.</P>
      <P>While flood-prone areas in Taiwan total 1,150 square kilometers, the project
gives priority to the 500 square kilometers where improvement is urgently
needed, Chang said.</P>
      <P>He said that during the past 15 months following the project's launch, the
flood-prone areas have survived several extremely heavy rain events, which he
said proves the effectiveness of the project.</P>
      <P>In the second phase, related authorities will continue to remove silt from
targeted rivers and drainage systems and try to finish work that has not been
completed in the first phase, Chang said.</P>
      <P>To ensure the passage of a special budget for the second phase of the project,
the premier instructed the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics to actively  communicate  with the
various party caucuses in the Legislative Yuan after the Cabinet submits the
budget draft to the legislature for review.</P>

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung put forward five contingency  measures Wednesday,
including setting up a price stabilization ad hoc task force, to cope with
volatile inflation situations.</P>
      <P>At a regular Executive Yuan meeting, Chang appointed Vice Premier Chiou I-jen as
convener of the price stabilization ad hoc task force and the Council for
Economic Planning and Development as the planning and executive body to activate
a supra-division mechanism to monitor the supply situations of major commodities
and keep inflation under control.</P>
      <P>Chang said that in an Aug. 1 Executive Yuan meeting, he instructed the Ministry
of Economic Affairs (MOEA) to monitor the price structures of raw materials and
major commodities in Taiwan, the Ministry of Finance to be ready to halve taxes,
and the Ministry of Justice to investigate any possible hoarding in the face of
spiralling prices on the international market.</P>
      <P>Since September, he said, the prices of raw materials and major commodities in
the country have gone even higher as a result of several typhoons and ever-
rising international oil prices.</P>
      <P>Taiwan society has become increasingly  jittery since late October, when the
price of crude soared to US$90 per barrel, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>To cope with this grave situation, Chang said, he issued a five-point directive
to be implemented by the relevant Cabinet agencies, including that the MOEA make
preparations for gasoline price hikes based on a floating oil pricing system;
that the Council of Agriculture work with private suppliers to ensure adequate
grocery supplies; that the Environmental Protection Administration and the MOEA
work out plans for alternative energy, including liquefied gas and biofuel for
automobiles; and that the Ministry of Justice and the Fair Trade Commission
continue to monitor and investigate pricing irregularities.</P>

      <P>Domestic hog breeders are losing profits due to surging international prices of
the feed corn that comprises the major portion of pig fodder, along with
increasing transportation costs, opposition People First Party Legislator Chung
Shao-ho said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chung, who represents Kaohsiung County in southern Taiwan, revealed the plight
of the pig farmers at a press conference at the Legislative Yuan, saying the
farmers have complained that each head of livestock equals a deficit of NT$1,200
(US$37) in real terms.</P>
      <P>According to this calculation, a herd of 50 pigs represents a deficit of
NT$60,000, he added.</P>
      <P>Chung also accused two leading domestic feed suppliers, including the state-run
Taiwan Sugar Corp., of stockpiling feed corn for profiteering.</P>
      <P>The lawmaker also said supply has outstripped demand in the domestic pork
market. In Taiwan, he said, 6 million head of hogs is the number required to
meet demand, but local raisers at present have a total of 7 million head.</P>
      <P>The excessive supply has benefited pork traders, who have bought stocks at a low
price, frozen them and are waiting until the market is short of fresh pork,
Chung said, blaming the traders for controlling market prices and preventing hog
price fluctuations to reflect rising breeding costs.</P>
      <P>Chung suggested that the government take measures to help breeders. He proposed
encouraging breeders who no longer want to raise hogs to quit the business by
offering subsidies as part of efforts to control stock numbers.</P>
      <P>He also demanded that the government probe the allegations of profiteering by
local suppliers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislator Ko Chun-hsiung of the Farmers' Party called on the
government to subsidize local hog breeders.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian enumerated Wednesday what he called "15 innovations"
that he has achieved during his tenure over the past seven years, rebutting
allegations by the opposition  that the country has made no progress  under his

      <P>According to Chen, the innovations are the launch of the high-speed railway
system, the completion of the Hsuehshan Tunnel -- the world's fifth-longest, the
opening of Taipei 101 -- one of the world's tallest skyscrapers, the
inauguration of the Central Taiwan Science  Park,  tax  reforms,  re-

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian gave the thumbs-up to Taiwan's horticultural industry
Wednesday, saying that with techniques continuing to advance, flower exports are
expected to top US$100 million next year.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of the 2007 Taipei International Flower Exhibition at the
Taipei World Trade Center, Chen said that in order to increase horticulturists'
incomes, his administration has in recent years pushed to improve growing
techniques and plant hybrids.</P>
      <P>The government has helped establish the Taiwan Orchid Plantation in Tainan,
southern Taiwan, which has pushed Taiwan's status as the "kingdom of the
butterfly orchid" even higher in the world, Chen claimed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the administration put forward in 2004 a statute governing plant
species and seed and seedling development to better protect the rights of
horticulturists, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan has also consulted advanced countries in a bid to allow
Taiwanese plant and flower breeders to have species they have developed
registered for patent rights. To date, many countries, including the European
Union, the United States, Australia and Japan, have allowed patent right
applications and registration by Taiwanese breeders.</P>
      <P>Chen  said  he hopes  the administration  will also  help horticulturists to
build a world plant germplasm database and help them with plantation facilities,
as well as assist them to secure patent protection from other countries.</P>
      <P>By doing so, he said, Taiwan could easily become a hub for high-quality flower
production in Asia.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the opening, Council of Agriculture Minister Su Jia-Chyuan said
that in 1995, 9,661 hectares of land were devoted to flower cultivation, which
generated production worth about NT$9 billion (US$276.92 million). By 2006, he
went on, the amount of land had increased to 13,375 hectares, with production
multiplying to NT$12.5 billion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Su said, Taiwan's flower exports totaled US$9.7 million in 1995, a
figure that had jumped eight-folds in 11 years to US$78 million.</P>
      <P>The bulk of such exports included butterfly orchids, Chinese orchids and
paphiopedilum (lady's slipper) , making Taiwan a global stronghold of orchid
cultivation and exports, Su said.</P>
      <P>The 2007 Taipei International Flower Exhibition, which runs from Nov. 1-4, has
attracted local horticulturists, as well as those from the Netherlands, Japan,
the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Australia to show their latest
horticulture developments.</P>

how the Kyoto Protocol has affected Taiwan's energy policy and what the future
holds for the efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, according to the

      <P>He pointed out that the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate

atmosphere at a low enough level to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference
with the climate system."</P>
      <P>The international environmental treaty is legally non-binding but includes
provisions for updates that would set mandatory emission limits. The principal
update is the Kyoto Protocol, which went into effect Feb. 16, 2005 and requires
all member countries to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gases.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday
that the late President Chiang Kai-shek made contributions to Taiwan and that
"it is appropriate to commemorate him."</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks on the occasion of Chiang's 120th birthday anniversary when
he and KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung attended the inauguration of a group of Ma
supporters made up of Huangpu Military Academy servicemen. Chiang served as
president of the academy, which was founded by the KMT in 1924 in China's
Guangzhou Province.</P>
      <P>Ma admitted that historical figures "have their merits and faults," but said
Chiang's faults should not obscure his merits.</P>
      <P>According to Ma,  Chiang contributed in three areas:  the rectrocession of
Taiwan from Japanese colonial rule, the development of Taiwan, and the defense
of the island.</P>
      <P>Ma cited Chiang's well-known land reform program, the nine-year compulsory
education and economic development projects.</P>
      <P>Chiang also promoted resolutely self-government ordinance and women's
emancipation, as well as scrapping the foster daughter system, which Ma claimed
made a great contribution to advancing Taiwan's democracy and human rights.</P>
      <P>Although Chiang achieved notoriety for his part in the infamous 2-28 incident
and ensuing white terror -- referring to a 1947 brutal KMT crackdown on
civilians rising up against KMT corruption and the ensuing KMT persecution of

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung City Council Deputy Speaker Huang Shih-lung demanded Wednesday that
the government deliver on its promise to relocate the refinery of the state-
owned CPC Corp., Taiwan in the southern port city.</P>
      <P>Huang made the appeal at a news conference in the wake of two accidents
involving the company's main refinery in the city over the past three months.
Also on hand were officials from various civic groups, as well as main
opposition Kuomintang Legislator Huang Chao-shun and Pasuya Yao, a legislative
candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party. Five borough chiefs of
Houchin, in Kaohsiung's Nantze district -- where the refinery is located -- were
also present.</P>
      <P>They claimed that the Ministry of Economic Affairs, instead of thinking about
delivering on the relocation promise, is planning to renovate the site and allow
its continued operation.</P>
      <P>Huang said the CPC often disseminates reports that the relocation of the
refinery will result in 100,000 people losing their jobs on the eve of
elections, and that they distribute leaflets in the communities claiming that
the CPC has spent billions of dollars in improving the environmental situation
and safety facilities.</P>
      <P>"The approach of the CPC Corp. is both childish and ignorant, " Huang said.</P>
      <P>He noted that two explosions occurred at a distillation plant of the CPC
refinery July 29 and Oct. 26, respectively, which resulted in panic among
Houchin residents.</P>
      <P>He demanded that the CPC and the Ministry of Economic Affairs deliver on the
promise made in 1990 to complete relocation by 2015.</P>
      <P>If the government agrees only to renovate the existing site, the residents will
demand that the refinery be closed, he warned.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's economy would not be significantly impacted even if international oil
prices surge to US$100 per barrel in November  or December,  Council for
Economic  Planning and Development (CEPD) Chairwoman Ho Mei-yueh predicted
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Ho made the remarks in a report on the country's general economic situation
delivered at a weekly Executive Yuan meeting.</P>
      <P>According to Ho, Taiwan's consumer price index would grow by some 1.7 percent
for 2007 should the average world oil prices soar to US$100 per barrel between
November and December. But she pointed out that global demand for crude oil
might decrease next year, citing international research.</P>
      <P>Ho said she is optimistic that, measured over the entire year, Taiwan's economy
would expand by 4.6 percent as originally forecast thanks to stable growth in
private consumption and investment despite high-flying oil costs.</P>
      <P>Commenting on growing public concern that rice prices may rise next week in the
wake of several typhoons, Ho said that the average rice price this year has
actually been lower than the previous year's level.</P>
      <P>Ho said that rice price hikes might just be a short-term phenomenon as the
Council of Agriculture has sufficient stockpiles of the crop. "Theoretically,
there is no reason for the domestic rice price to continue climbing over a long
term," she said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) demanded
Wednesday that the government temporarily freeze gasoline price hikes on the
domestic market as the legislature has passed a resolution to that effect.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whip Kuo Su-chun and lawmaker Hsu Su-po made the comments
in a Legislative Yuan news conference after its economics and budgetary
committees approved a resolution earlier in the day during a joint meeting
demanding that the government freeze gasoline prices until the end of the year
to help relieve the growing financial burden on the public.</P>
      <P>According to Kuo, the government should immediately announce a freeze in
gasoline product prices as the state-run petroleum product provider is expected
to rack up NT$20 billion in profits for the whole year. The government must stop
gouging the people, she argued.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that high consumer  product  prices  brought  by continuously rising
oil and staple commodity prices have sparked widespread complaints.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan must swiftly address the issue to ease grave public concerns
now that the Legislative Yuan has endorsed a short-term price freeze, Hsu said,
adding that the executive branch must be held fully accountable for the negative
consequences if gasoline prices remain so high.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan was slated to implement a spate of the latest gasoline price
hikes Nov. 2 after upward adjustments in accord with a government-set floating
oil pricing system which came in response to surging oil prices on the
international market.</P>
      <P>According to Wang Tuoh, legislative caucus whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), most caucus members are in favor of a temporary price
freeze out of grave concerns about a possible string of implications in the
people's daily lives.</P>
      <P>Earlier the same day, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said at the weekly Executive
Yuan meeting that he has asked the Ministry of Economic Affairs to "get ready"
for possible gasoline prices hikes in compliance with the floating pricing
system -- marking a departure from his Oct. 29 statement, when he announced that
the newly adjusted price hikes were set to be implemented Friday.</P>
      <P>Frank Hsieh, presidential candidate of the ruling DPP, urged the Executive Yuan
a day earlier to temporarily put aside the gasoline price hikes plan and
flexibly address the issue to assuage deep public concerns.</P>

      <P>A lawmaker of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Wednesday censured Taiwan's top
official in charge of youth affairs for neglecting her duty by playing a major
role in the campaign office of the ruling Democratic  Progressive  Party's
presidential candidate.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Chou Shou-hsun said that Cheng Li-chun, head of the Cabinet-level
National Youth Commission, ought to be "ashamed" of herself for accepting former
premier Frank Hsieh's offer to be the director of the youth division in his
campaign office to the detriment of her official duties.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics released by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics, Chou pointed out that one in every four unemployed people in Taiwan
is a university graduate, and that Cheng should be ashamed when facing Taiwan's
university students.</P>
      <P>Official statistics show that Taiwan had 116,000 unemployed university graduates
as of September, representing an increase of 1,000 from August and accounting
for nearly one-quarter of the total jobless population.</P>
      <P>According to estimates by the Ministry of Education, about 250,000 graduates
from all levels of schools in Taiwan enter the job market each year. Because
those who suffer setbacks are mostly first-year job hunters, it is believed that
about one out in every 2.5 new graduates ends up unemployed.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-chung, head of the KMT Youth League, also criticized Cheng for
launching a "new patriotic movement" on behalf of the DPP presidential
candidate. He said the problem now is not whether university students love
Taiwan, but whether Taiwan loves its university students.</P>
      <P>Huang said that in light of the high unemployment rate for university students,
it is "extremely ridiculous" for Cheng to launch the "new patriotic movement."</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP not to interfere with Cabinet's decision on gasoline hikes</HEADLINE>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will not interfere in the decision
of the Executive Yuan on gasoline price adjustments, a spokeswoman of the DPP
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Hsin-ni, DPP legislator and director of the party's Department of Culture
and Information, made the remarks after the conclusion of a weekly meeting of
the DPP Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>The public widely expected that the DPP would endorse the views of Frank Hsieh,
the DPP presidential candidate, to temporarily freeze the floating oil pricing
mechanism, which was put into practice in September to reflect fluctuations on
the international oil market.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet decided Monday to hike domestic gasoline prices after a recent price
surge in the world oil market but Hsieh called for a freeze the following day in
a show of empathy for the public, who are already feeling the pinch of rising
living costs due to a series of price increases for basic goods.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Hsin-ni quoted President Chen Shui-bian, who doubles as the party
chairman, as saying in the meeting that stabilizing prices is the responsibility
of the government, and that price gouging or manipulation will not be allowed.</P>
      <P>The government has ensured that water and electricity rates remained unchanged,
and the Cabinet should focus on this rather than the volatile oil market,
according to the president.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Hsin-ni also said that the Central Standing Committee is "coordinating"
between the party and the government and not "leading" the government as it
would "not be appropriate to interfere with the Cabinet's decision."</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Cho Jung-tai said that the president asked the Executive
Yuan to properly and cautiously tackle the gasoline price adjustment issue.</P>
      <P>"The Executive Yuan will have the final say on gasoline price hikes, and the DPP
will throw its weight behind the decision, " Cho said.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan Secretary-General Chen Chin-jun said the Cabinet has established
a price stabilization task force, noting that Taiwan's domestic gasoline prices
are the lowest among 11 neighboring countries and that the Cabinet will proceed
in line with "relevant mechanisms."</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung asked the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) earlier
in the day to prepare for gasoline price hikes based on the floating oil price
mechanism.</P>
      <P>However, to avoid a serious impact on families, small shops, and small- and
medium-sized enterprises, prices for fuel oil, natural gas and liquefied
petroleum gas cylinders will not be adjusted for the time being, the premier
also said.</P>
      <P>Sources said that the Presidential Office, Cabinet, party and Frank Hsieh's camp
have reached a consensus that national policies should not be formulated in the
DPP Central Standing Committee meeting lest it gives rise to a negative
impression that the party "is pulling strings behind the administration."</P>
      <P>This is why Frank Hsieh and the DPP legislative caucus did not insist on a
freeze or easing of gasoline price hikes and instead asked that the stability of
water, gas and electricity rates be further publicized, sources added.</P>

      <P>Taipei city police announced Wednesday that they will step up road patrols
beginning Thursday when riders of motorcycles with engines exceeding 550cc are

      <P>Same regulations used to address cars will be applied to heavy motorcycles, said

      <P>An education foundation aims to duplicate the success of the first English
Village in Taoyuan County and take it to other cities in Taiwan by setting up
more English Villages by mid-2008,  providing  better English learning
environments  for students, a foundation executive said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"With the experience and success of the Taoyuan English Village, we are looking
for establishing two to three villages by summer 2008. We are also calling for
more corporate sponsors to join us in developing  better English learning
environments  for the next generation, " said Morgan Sun, General Director of
King Car Education Foundation.</P>
      <P>The foundation established the first English Village in Taiwan, which began
operation in September. The village has 12 situational classrooms and employs
volunteer American English teachers. It has received much praise and has been
popular among students, Sun said.</P>
      <P>The village creates all-English situational environments, such as an airline
passenger compartment, a bank and a restaurant. Students are able to enjoy a
virtual flight in the cabin, withdraw money from an ATM (Automated Teller
Machine), and order meals in the restaurant with the help and an introduction
from foreign teachers.</P>
      <P>"All counties and cities interested in building up a program are welcome to talk
to us by Nov. 15, " Sun said, adding that it will only take an estimate of NT$6
million to establish an English Village because the foundation planned to
utilize abandoned classrooms across the country and turn them into situational
classrooms.</P>
      <P>Expenditures to hire 10 English teachers will cost around NT$2 million annually,
he estimated.</P>
      <P>Sponsorship from corporations will definitely ease the financial burden in
setting up these institutions, Sun said. Currently, EVA Air and the
International Commercial Bank of China's Cultural and Educational Foundation
have pledged to sponsor the situational classrooms.</P>
      <P>Sun encouraged more local companies from the hotel, high tech, and other
industries to contribute to Taiwan's English education. However, Sun insisted on
undertaking the project with "civil effort" rather than directly cooperating
with governments because going through the endless official procedures would be
a "waste of time."</P>
      <P>English Villages will be financially supported by the local government,
corporate sponsors, visitors and the foundation itself, Sun noted.</P>

      <P>Taiwan ranks 14th in the latest global competitiveness survey released by the
Geneva-based World Economic Forum (WEF) Wednesday, one notch lower than its 2006
ranking.</P>
      <P>Among Asian countries, Taiwan ranks fifth in the annual WEF survey, also one
notch down from last year's level.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's competitiveness lags behind that of its Asian neighbors Singapore,
Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong, according to the Global Competitiveness Report
2007-2008, a survey of 131 countries and areas conducted by the WEF.</P>
      <P>It marks the first time that Taiwan has been surpassed by its main rival, South
Korea, in the annual WEF report.</P>
      <P>South Korea's global ranking jumped to 11th place from last year's 24th place,
reflecting its rapidly growing competitive might, the report says.</P>
      <P>In a world competitiveness report issued by the Swiss business school in
Lausanne -- the International Institute for Management Development (IMD) -- in
May, Taiwan was in 18th place, ahead of Japan (24th) and South Korea (29th),
while lagging behind Singapore, Hong Kong and China.</P>
      <P>Topping the WEF report is the United States, followed by Switzerland, Denmark,
Sweden, Germany, Finland, Singapore, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the
Netherlands, in that order.</P>
      <P>In the WEF's Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) , which consists of three sub-
indexes -- Basic Requirements, Efficiency Enhancers, and Innovation and
Sophistication factors -- Taiwan ranks 19th, 17th (14th last year), and 10th
(9th last year), respectively.</P>
      <P>In the Business Competitiveness Index (BCI), Taiwan finds itself in 23rd place,
down two notches from last year, the report shows.</P>
      <P>Among the 12 pillar indicators under the three sub-indexes, Taiwan ranks fourth
in "higher education and training, " sixth in "health and primary education, "
and ninth in "innovation," according to the report.</P>
      <P>In a measure of "financial market sophistication, " Taiwan ranks 58th, a
decidedly poor performance which dragged down the country's overall ranking.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's ranking of "institutions" fell to 37th place from last year's 32nd, the
report says, adding that Taiwan ranks 26th in the "macroeconomic stability."</P>
      <P>The WEF said in a press release that Taiwan "draws its greatest competitive
strengths from education and innovation, " which the WEF described as being "in
line with the government's development strategy in recent decades."</P>
      <P>The WEF noted that Taiwan enjoys one of the highest enrollment rates in the
world as the country ranks 3rd and 5th in primary and tertiary enrollment rates,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also "gets excellent marks for the quality of its educational system, "
particularly in "math and science, " the WEF noted, adding that this "has
buttressed the country's potential for innovation, as demonstrated by the
extremely high rate of patenting per capita."</P>
      <P>Taiwan ranks 3rd in the "utility patents" category in the "innovation" sector.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also performs well on the 11th pillar of the "business sophistication" --
in which it ranks 14th. In the "state of cluster development" sub-category under
this pillar, Taiwan is the top-ranked country.</P>
      <P>In terms of the country's stage of development, the WEF report regards  Taiwan
as being  in a transitional  period  between "efficiency-driven" and
"innovation-driven" development.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cancer forms top killer for wage earners: CLA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct, 31 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) released Wednesday a list of the top 10
causes of death for the country's wage earners in 2006, with cancer, accident
and chronic liver disease and cirrhosis rounding out the top three.</P>
      <P>Shih Tung-sheng, chairman of the CLA's Institute of Occupational Safety and
Health, said the death rate from cancer per 100,000 wage earners reached 54.41
in 2006, while accident death rate was 22.92, and that from chronic liver
disease and liver cirrhosis hit 8.69.</P>
      <P>The overall death rate for employed persons in 2006 was 138.25 per 100,000
people, the lowest rate in the past five years, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Shih pointed out that although cancer is also the leading cause of death for the
population as a whole, the second and third leading causes of death, nationally,
are cerebrovascular disease and heart disease.</P>
      <P>The fourth through 10th leading causes of death for wage earners were heart
disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, kidney disease, pneumonia,
infectious disease and parasitic disease, and high blood pressure.</P>
      <P>Female workers were less likely to suffer from chronic liver disease or
cirrhosis of the liver than their male counterparts, as these health problems
ranked sixth among women, but third for workers as a whole.</P>
      <P>Putting a fine point on the death rate due to cancer, Shih said workers' three
leading causes of death due to cancer were liver cancer, lung cancer, and oral
cavity cancer.</P>
      <P>Nationwide, lung cancer was most common, followed by liver cancer. Oral cavity
cancer ranked sixth, Shih added.</P>
      <P>Death rates from cancer per 100,000 male workers in 2006 was 70, with the three
highest death rates attributed to liver cancer, 20.6, oral cavity cancer, 11.1,
and lung cancer, 9.8, Shih said, adding that the three categories accounted for
58 percent of cancer deaths among male workers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the death rate from cancer per 100,000 female wage earners in 2006
was 38, with the top three types being breast cancer, 7.3, lung cancer, 5.3, and
colorectal cancer, 4.6. The three accounted for 45 percent of female workers'
death rate from cancer, Shih said.</P>
      <P>For wage earners aged between 20 and 39, accident was the leading cause of
death, while cancer killed most workers above 40, Shih said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>State-run sugar company denies hoarding crop</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>State-run Taiwan Sugar Corp.(Taisugar) denied a rumor Wednesday that one of its
affiliates has stockpiled a large amount of corn to push up the crop's price in
the domestic market.</P>
      <P>As a state-own company, Taisugar is fully responsible for stabilizing  consumer
product  prices at home despite soaring international prices of crude oil and
raw materials, Taisugar officials said, stressing that it is impossible for the
company to stockpile crops to make extra profits illegally.</P>
      <P>According to Taisugar officials, since May this year the company has released
6,480 metric tonnes of maize and 15,930 metric tonnes of soybeans on the
domestic market, meaning that its current stockpiles have decreased down below
the company's safety margins.</P>
      <P>Although Taisugar has also been hit by surging raw materials prices in the world
market, officials said that it has still decided to release its stockpiled crop
as part of government efforts to help bring down high prices in the home market.</P>
      <P>As to allegations that one of its affiliates are hoarding maize, the officials
explained that Taisugar controls only 40 percent of that company's shares and
does not have a final say in that company's operations.</P>
      <P>Quoting management at the branch company, the officials said that it called for
understanding from the public because its stockpiles of maize have significantly
dwindled to a point below its safety margins level.</P>
      <P>In a related development, the officials said, Taisugar has also begun slashing
the number of pigs raised for sale, with the current number dipping by 6,000 per
month in comparison with past figures in a bid to help offset a slump in the
hog-farming business.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Joining legislative race aims to inspire DPP progress: hopeful</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31 (CNA)
10/31/07  23:51:04
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Luo Wen-jia, a reformed-minded former lawmaker of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , said Wednesday that his decision to run for a
legislative seat again is driven by a desire to inspire advancements in the DPP.</P>
      <P>Luo, who had been one of the DPP's most promising political stars before losing
his bid for Taipei County magistrateship in late 2005, made the remarks shortly
after the DPP passed a proposal to draft Luo to join the legislative race in
Taipei City's Daan district, which has traditionally been dominated by the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT)-led "pan-blue alliance."</P>
      <P>Luo, a former legislator representing the northern county of Taoyuan, drew on a
"kitchen theory" to elucidate his reasons for agreeing to the DPP's call to
fight an uphill battle for the party's cause.</P>
      <P>"If you enter a kitchen, you tend to get dirty and may not necessarily get an
opportunity to cook, but if you don't enter the kitchen in the first place,  you
certainly will not have an opportunity to cook at all, " said Luo, who also once
headed the Cabinet-level Council for Hakka Affairs.</P>
      <P>Noting that the DPP has come to a bottleneck in its development, Luo said the
party needs more reform-minded people to drive it forward in a rational,
moderate direction, Luo said he doesn't want to see a vicious cycle of "the bad
driving out the good" from its ranks.</P>
