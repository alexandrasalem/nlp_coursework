    <HEADLINE>Penghu residents may soon decide fate of casinos on islands</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Penghu County residents may soon have the chance to decide whether the outlying
island group will allow casinos to be built there, as the initiators of a
referendum on the issue have collected a sufficient number of signatures to put
it to a vote.</P>
      <P>Lang Chun-yi, president of the Penghu County Business Council and concurrently
acting speaker of the county assembly, said Friday that the initiators have
collected a total of 3,853 signatures and sent the petition to the county
election commission for verification.</P>
      <P>He said the county government must hold a referendum within two months if the
signatures are validated.</P>
      <P>Expecting that a referendum will be held in mid-September, Lang said the county
government  has budgeted  NT$8 million (about US$242,000) for the vote, and the
special budget plan will pass the county assembly next week.</P>
      <P>Gambling has long been banned in Taiwan, but the Legislative Yuan passed
legislation on Jan. 12 to legalize casino gambling on outlying islands.</P>
      <P>Since then,  Penghu's business community has been keen to introduce the casino
business to the relatively resource-deficient islands.</P>
      <P>Many Penghu residents, however, have a different outlook on their home islands'
economic development,  fearing that gambling may instigate criminal activity.</P>
      <P>Because receiving popular approval in a direct vote is a prerequisite for the
county government to issue operating licenses, businessmen initiated the drive
to collect signatures in February so that a referendum could be held at the
earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>According to the Referendum Law, a referendum in a county is possible when no
less than 5 percent of the voters who cast ballots in the most recent county
magistrate election have signed the petition.</P>
      <P>A total of 70,427 votes were cast in the 2005 magistrate election, meaning at
least 3,522 signatures were needed.</P>
      <P>Consisting of some 90 small isles, the Penghu archipelago is seated off the
western coast of Taiwan in the Taiwan Strait. Tourism has been an important
source of revenue for the county of 93,000 residents.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ruling on ex-first daughter's travel ban to be issued Aug. 3</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei District Court is scheduled to hand down a ruling Monday on whether
to lift an overseas travel ban on former President Chen Shui-bian's daughter,
judicial sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>In the course of investigating perjury charges against Chen Hsing-yu in
connection with a case against the former president, prosecutors imposed an
overseas travel ban on the former first daughter in June.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsing-yu later appealed the ruling. A panel of three judges at the district
court is scheduled to hold a hearing Aug. 3 to decide whether to remove or
uphold the travel ban, a court official said.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors indicted Chen Hsing-yu on perjury charges July 17. Also indicted in
the case were her husband Chao Chien-ming and her younger brother Chen Chih-
chung.</P>
      <P>Her mother, former first lady Wu Shu-jen, was also charged with coercing her
children to give false testimony in the corruption case against the former
president.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors of the Special Investigation Division of the Supreme Prosecutors
Office found inconsistencies in the testimony given in May by Chen Chih-chung,
Chen Hsing-yu and Chao Chien-ming in their probe into the former president's
alleged misuse of public funds during his term in office from 2000 through May
2008.</P>
      <P>The indictment said the three lied to prosecutors when they claimed that the
receipts they provided to Wu to claim reimbursement from the president's special
state affairs fund were for gifts they bought for their parents.</P>
      <P>Despite the indictment, prosecutors from the Taipei District Prosecutors Office
have asked the court to treat them leniently because they admitted their
offenses during the probe in connection with perjury.</P>
      <P>Wu also confessed that she urged her children to give false testimony to cover
up her offenses.</P>
      <P>Wu was indicted on bribery and embezzlement charges in November 2006 in a
separate case, but prosecutors have not sought to detain the wheelchiar-bound
former first lady.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian has been detained since last December on charges of corruption,
money laundering and embezzlement -- crimes he is accused of committing during
his presidency. The former presdient has insisted on his innocence, arguing
history will clear his name.</P>
      <P>The court is scheduled to hand down a ruling on his case Sept. 11.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Locally produced H1N1 vaccine being tested on animals (roundup)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  July 31 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Locally produced swine flu vaccines are being tested on animals and are expected
to be ready for human inoculation in November at the earliest if all goes
smoothly, Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yeh Ching-chuan said Friday.</P>
      <P>"Research on the swine flu or influenza A (H1N1) vaccine is proceeding smoothly
and the producer -- Adimmune Corp. -- promises to deliver the product at the end
of September. As the vaccine has to undergo clinical trials, it will not be
ready for distribution until November at the earliest," Yeh explained.</P>
      <P>The DOH has already ordered 5 million doses of the vaccine from the company, in
which the government has a stake.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the DOH has formed a special task force to monitor progress in vaccine
research and development for the H1N1 flu strain, and Premier Liu Chao-shiuan
has also directed the DOH to seek foreign supplies.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, the DOH plans to purchase up to 10 million doses of swine flu
vaccine to meet domestic demand.</P>
      <P>"As Adimmune can only provide 5 million doses, we still have to seek foreign
supplies to make up for the deficiency and we hope potential foreign suppliers
will be able to deliver the vaccines ahead of Adimmune," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an Adimmune spokesman said it is scheduled to start human trials of
its swine flu vaccine in October, with Huang Li-ming, a professor at National
Taiwan University Medical College, presiding over the trial project.</P>
      <P>"Those who receive the first injection will have to receive a second
inouculation three weeks later as foreign medical data show that humans need two
doses of vaccines to produce antibodies, " the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>With the confirmation of Taiwan's first swine flu fatality the previous day and
the incidence of cluster and community infections growing, the DOH has stepped
up efforts to contain the spread of the virus.</P>
      <P>Yeh himself visited the central Taiwan branch of the DOH's Centers  for  Disease
Control  (CDC)  Friday  to review  its epidemic-fighting operations.</P>
      <P>At the moment, three severe swine flu patients are still receiving hospital
treatment and 10 cluster infections have been confirmed around Taiwan involving
students who are attending summer study programs, military servicemen on
outlying islands, and migrant workers at local factories.</P>
      <P>As part of the campaign against the spread of the virus, the minister said that
from this weekend, 300 local hospitals will be allowed to conduct testing and
offer anti-viral drugs to patients displaying swine flu symptoms.</P>
      <P>From Aug. 15, grassroots doctors contracted by the Bureau of National Health
Insurance will also begin offering testing and medication, Yeh added.</P>
      <P>Five schools in four counties and cities have closed at different times since
the beginning of summer vacation over swine flu concerns, Ministry of Education
officials said. While some schools have re-opened, others remain closed.</P>
      <P>Former DOH Minister Chen Chien-jen, an epidemiologist, warned Friday that Taiwan
is approaching a stage where the swine flu will spread quickly.</P>
      <P>"If we fail to intensify prevention efforts, a major outbreak could hit in late
September or October, the traditional flu peak season," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has so far confirmed six severe swine flu cases, including one death.
Based on this figure, he said, Taiwan should have at least 10,000 swine flu
cases.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the government speed up purchases of anti-viral drugs and
vaccines to cope with any possible outbreak of the disease.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, the Ministry of Education announced that any local school
with a confirmed case should be closed for seven days to contain the possible
spread of the disease.</P>
      <P>If the situation is very severe, the ministry said, the school's closing can be
extended to 10 days.</P>
      <P>At the same time, should two schools in the same city or county each have a
confirmed swine flu case or cluster infections, local governments can order all
schools in the district or nearby region to be shut down for a week or so,
ministry officials said.</P>
      <P>Wang Chun-chuang, director of the ministry's Physical Education Department,
urged local students not to go to school if they develop flu symptoms.</P>
      <P>Wang said the ministry will hold a meeting Aug. 4 to map out a comprehensive
package of working guidelines to prevent the spread of swine flu after schools
reopen in September.</P>
      <P>The general guiding principle, he said, will be that any nationwide school
closure plan over swine flu concerns should be announced by the Central
Epidemics Command Center.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kinmen to use horseshoe crab breeding season to educate residents</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  July 31 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kinmen County government will begin to send experts to horseshoe crab
breeding grounds on Sunday to give lectures on the "living fossil" and ways to
protect the species, a county official said Friday.</P>
      <P>County Bureau of Cultural Affairs Director Lee Hsi-lung said the program, to be
held every weekend and holiday until Sept. 30, was conceived to promote
horseshoe crab conservation and preserve the breeding grounds of the ancient
creature.</P>
      <P>The horseshoe crab's breeding territory in the island county, which lies just
off the coast of southeastern China, has been eroded in recent years by wharf
construction and expansion to accommodate increasing marine traffic between
Kinmen and southern Chinese ports.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to preserve the marine species, the local government has
listed the sea area surrounding the small Jiankong islet off the western coast
of Greater Kinmen as a conservation area.</P>
      <P>Lee said the local government  has invited the public to participate in the free
lecture and tour on Jiankong islet, hoping local residents will then join in
efforts to preserve the unique species.</P>
      <P>Kinmen is one of only a few breeding areas in Taiwan for the horseshoe crab, a
hard-shelled invertebrate that lives in coastal waters on the sea floor but
breeds on shore. Its breeding season falls between June and October.</P>
      <P>According to Kinmen County Fisheries Research Institute data, the horseshoe crab
is known as a "living fossil" because it has been around for 400 million years.</P>
      <P>Despite their common name, they are not crabs but rather related to spiders,
scorpions, ticks and mites. Kinmen residents have nicknamed the horseshoe crab
the "helmet fish" because it is shaped like a military helmet.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Penghu County residents may soon have the chance to decide whether the outlying
island group will allow casinos to be built there, as the initiators of a
referendum on the issue have collected a sufficient number of signatures to put
it to a vote.</P>
      <P>Lang Chun-yi, president of the Penghu County Business Council and concurrently
acting speaker of the county assembly, said Friday that the initiators have
collected a total of 3,853 signatures and sent the petition to the county
election commission for verification.</P>
      <P>He said the county government must hold a referendum within two months if the
signatures are validated.</P>
      <P>Expecting that a referendum will be held in mid-September, Lang said the county
government  has budgeted  NT$8 million (about US$242,000) for the vote, and the
special budget plan will pass the county assembly next week.</P>
      <P>Gambling has long been banned in Taiwan, but the Legislative Yuan passed
legislation on Jan. 12 to legalize casino gambling on outlying islands.</P>
      <P>Since then,  Penghu's business community has been keen to introduce the casino
business to the relatively resource-deficient islands.</P>
      <P>Many Penghu residents, however, have a different outlook on their home islands'
economic development,  fearing that gambling may instigate criminal activity.</P>
      <P>Because receiving popular approval in a direct vote is a prerequisite for the
county government to issue operating licenses, businessmen initiated the drive
to collect signatures in February so that a referendum could be held at the
earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>According to the Referendum Law, a referendum in a county is possible when no
less than 5 percent of the voters who cast ballots in the most recent county
magistrate election have signed the petition.</P>
      <P>A total of 70,427 votes were cast in the 2005 magistrate election, meaning at
least 3,522 signatures were needed.</P>
      <P>Consisting of some 90 small isles, the Penghu archipelago is seated off the
western coast of Taiwan in the Taiwan Strait. Tourism has been an important
source of revenue for the county of 93,000 residents.</P>

      <P>The Taipei District Court is scheduled to hand down a ruling Monday on whether
to lift an overseas travel ban on former President Chen Shui-bian's daughter,
judicial sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>In the course of investigating perjury charges against Chen Hsing-yu in
connection with a case against the former president, prosecutors imposed an
overseas travel ban on the former first daughter in June.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsing-yu later appealed the ruling. A panel of three judges at the district
court is scheduled to hold a hearing Aug. 3 to decide whether to remove or
uphold the travel ban, a court official said.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors indicted Chen Hsing-yu on perjury charges July 17. Also indicted in
the case were her husband Chao Chien-ming and her younger brother Chen Chih-
chung.</P>
      <P>Her mother, former first lady Wu Shu-jen, was also charged with coercing her
children to give false testimony in the corruption case against the former
president.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors of the Special Investigation Division of the Supreme Prosecutors
Office found inconsistencies in the testimony given in May by Chen Chih-chung,
Chen Hsing-yu and Chao Chien-ming in their probe into the former president's
alleged misuse of public funds during his term in office from 2000 through May
2008.</P>
      <P>The indictment said the three lied to prosecutors when they claimed that the
receipts they provided to Wu to claim reimbursement from the president's special
state affairs fund were for gifts they bought for their parents.</P>
      <P>Despite the indictment, prosecutors from the Taipei District Prosecutors Office
have asked the court to treat them leniently because they admitted their
offenses during the probe in connection with perjury.</P>
      <P>Wu also confessed that she urged her children to give false testimony to cover
up her offenses.</P>
      <P>Wu was indicted on bribery and embezzlement charges in November 2006 in a
separate case, but prosecutors have not sought to detain the wheelchiar-bound
former first lady.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian has been detained since last December on charges of corruption,
money laundering and embezzlement -- crimes he is accused of committing during
his presidency. The former presdient has insisted on his innocence, arguing
history will clear his name.</P>
      <P>The court is scheduled to hand down a ruling on his case Sept. 11.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's residents should minimize water consumption as the country's reservoirs
are drying out, water resources officials warned Saturday.</P>
      <P>Because of less-than-usual rainfall this summer, water levels at major
reservoirs around Taiwan have fallen to alarmingly low levels, said Chen Shen-
hsien, director-general of the Water Resources Agency under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>The situation at Shihmen Reservoir in northern Taiwan is the most serious, with
its water level standing at 224.3 meters Friday evening, close to the "shortage
level" of 220 meters, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Shihmen Reservoir is a major source of potable water in the northern county of
Taoyuan. At present, water supply for household use has been cut by 10 percent
and that for agricultural use by 25 percent.</P>
      <P>If the situation continues to worsen, supply for agricultural use may be cut
further, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He further said his agency will make every possible effort to refrain from any
further cut into water supply for household use before October.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The American International Group (AIG) Inc. has decided to sell its Taiwanese
unit, Nan Shan Life, and some international private equity funds are reportedly
going to team up with financial holding companies in Taiwan to bid for the life
insurance company, which has total assets exceeding NT$1.5 trillion (about
US$45.5 billion).</P>
      <P>While Taiwanese regulators have expressed concern over the stability of whoever
takes over Nan Shan, private equity funds attending the bid are looking for
domestic partners.</P>
      <P>According to local media reports, Bain Capital LLC and Morgan Stanley are
teaming up with Chinatrust Financial Holding Company, while the Carlyle Group is
interested in an alliance with the Fubon Financial Holding Company.</P>
      <P>Nan Shan was established in July 1963. Nearly 50 years of operation in Taiwan
has earned the company 10 percent to 12 percent of Taiwan's insurance market.</P>
      <P>The company's extensive network of 35,000 agents serve 4 million policy holders
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>When a crisis in AIG was exposed last October, reports regarding the company's
plan to auction its overseas operations in order to raise money caused
turbulence in Asia.</P>
      <P>Sources in the insurance sector said the Nan Shan bid is a severe case for
Taiwan's financial sector. While leading insurance companies are among the
bidders, the changing hands of Nan Shan will change the landscape of Taiwan's
insurance business tremendously.</P>
      <P>Statistics released by Nan Shan indicate that as of May 2009, the company's
total assets amounted to NT$1.5 trillion. Total policies in force reached 7.94
million, with 4 million policy holders.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's new tax reform a misstep: U.S. trade group</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1 (CNA)
08/01/09  15:18:22
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A recommendation made by the Tax Reform Committee (TRC) to tax earnings from
investment-linked life insurance policies is a "misstep," the American Chamber
of Commerce (AmCham) in Taipei said in its latest monthly publication Topics,
expressing concern that it will undermine the interests of the insurance
industry and disadvantage consumers by discouraging a useful option for funding
their insurance needs.</P>
      <P>"AmCham Taipei believes the TRC came to the wrong conclusion this month (July)
when it decided that earnings from investment-linked life insurance policies
should be subjected to income tax, " the editorial says.</P>
      <P>"The biggest issue with the TRC's finding is that it misconstrues the purpose of
the investment link," according to the editorial.</P>
      <P>Rather than serving as a tax loophole for the very wealthy, the purpose of
investment-linked insurance is to provide policy holders from all backgrounds
with an alternative means of paying for their insurance coverage, it notes.</P>
      <P>The TRC has proposed treating earnings from unit-linked insurance products as
taxable income. Gains of up to NT$270,000 (US$8,241) would be tax-exempt under
the existing exemption for interest income, but amounts beyond that would be
subject to taxation.</P>
      <P>At present, policy holders do not pay tax on income from investment-linked life
insurance products.</P>
      <P>The committee also suggested that proceeds from policies where the policy holder
and beneficiary are not the same person be subject to a 10 percent gift tax on
benefits of over NT$2.2 million.</P>
      <P>The decision,  which still requires final approval by the Executive Yuan, is
aimed at creating a fairer tax environment, and the committee said it could take
effect later this year but will not be applied retroactively.</P>
      <P>The AmCham editorial says that Taiwan will be out of step with most advanced
economies if it denies the status of investment-linked products as insurance.
Although Taiwan should not necessarily be obliged to always take its cues from
other jurisdictions, being the odd man out should at least set off warning bells
that extra caution is needed and that international business may be heavily
burdened by having to follow a separate standard in this market, it adds.</P>
      <P>Another problem with the TRC's decision is procedural, as responsibility for
determining what is or is not insurance should rest with the Financial
Supervisory Commission, according to AmCham.</P>
      <P>AmCham also disputed the TRC's judgment that implementing its decision could be
done simply by administrative order without legislative approval, saying that
investment-linked policies have been consistently accorded tax-exempt treatment
under the law and if that status is to be revised, it should be through formal
action by the Legislative Yuan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Employment outlook expected to remain bleak in coming year</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's employment outlook is likely to remain bleak over the coming year,
despite  recent signs of improvement in the economic situation, Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>This is typical of a "jobless recovery" -- recovery from a recession in the
absence of strong employment growth -- the officials said.</P>
      <P>According to the latest data released by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics, the unemployment rate hit a new high of 5.94 percent
in June, with 647,000 people out of work.</P>
      <P>The number of employed  people increased  by 0.03 percent month-on-month to
10.24 million in June -- the third consecutive month in which growth was
recorded. However, compared with the same month of last year, the number was
down by 170,000, or 1.63 percent.</P>
      <P>The results of a recent CEPD study reveal that the employment market tends to
take longer to recover than the economy itself, as was the case during the
economic downturn following the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2001.</P>
      <P>While it took six quarters for Taiwan's economy to recover from the recession,
the unemployment rate still did not return to the low level before the bubble
burst, despite 30 quarters of consolidation, the report shows.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials noted that employers usually wait until an economic recovery is
established or the economy begins to thrive before they increase hiring.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, the number of employed people is unlikely to post a
year-on-year growth at least until the second quarter of 2010, the officials
said. A return to the level of before the global financial crisis hit will
probably take until late 2010 or 2011, they added.</P>
      <P>A strong recovery momentum will be essential to drive the unemployment rate down
to below 4 percent -- the level before the start of the financial crisis, they
said.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu Friday awarded a total of NT$4.1 million (US$125,000)
to 11 of the city's athletes who won medals in the just-concluded World Games
2009 Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>They include seven who garnered a total of five golds, five silvers and one
bronze in the formal competitions for roller sports, karate, powerlifting and
billiards. The other four bagged two silvers and two bronzes in the invitational
dragon boat regatta and women's softball.</P>
      <P>Chen said the games marked the first time Taiwan has held any global sports
event and were also the biggest challenge she has encountered during her term in
office.</P>
      <P>Despite the many difficulties involved, the city government worked as hard as
the athletes to ensure the event's success, proving Taiwan has the ability to
host large-scale international sports competitions, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Stressing that athletes are the soul of any such competition, she promised that
the city government will continue to support efforts to nurture top athletes to
help further improve Taiwan's sporting performance.</P>
      <P>To encourage its residents to take part in athletic activities, Kaohsiung City
currently awards NT$200,000 to each gold medalist, NT$150,000 to each silver
medalist and NT$100,000 to each bronze medalist in formal international sports
competitions. The prize money for medalists in invitational games is half the
amount received by those in formal competitions.</P>
      <P>The city government, however, has doubled the prize money for the medalists  in
formal competitions  in the World Games,  while maintaining the original level
for those in invitational games.</P>

      <P>The Tourism Bureau is planning to launch an incentive program to encourage
Chinese travel agents to organize creative tours to Taiwan, as well as tours of
specific regions of the country, as part of efforts to enhance tourist
satisfaction, a bureau official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Under the program, top-performing salespeople will be offered free trips to
Taiwan and the travel agencies that show the best performance in each Chinese
province will also receive prizes in Taiwan, said Liu Hsi-lin, chief of the
bureau's international affairs division.</P>
      <P>The bureau will also provide training sessions for Chinese travel agents between
late November and early December to increase their understanding of Taiwan's
travel products, Liu added.</P>
      <P>Since the first half of this year, various Chinese provinces have launched a
"10,000 people traveling to Taiwan" campaign to promote tours to the country.</P>
      <P>During this period, the number of tourists from Zhejiang Province has totaled
70,000, while those from Jiangsu and Shandong each reached 10,000, according to
Tourism Bureau statistics.</P>
      <P>Although tourists from these three provinces are less numerous than those from
Fujian and Guangdong provinces, they tend to spend more on both their package
tours and their consumption in Taiwan, bureau officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the results of a survey conducted by the bureau among Chinese
tourists show that as many as 85 percent are satisfied with their visits here.</P>
      <P>Among those who expressed dissatisfaction, the most common complaints were the
long travel time for a round-the-island tour and hurried itineraries.</P>
      <P>During her most recent visit to China in July, Tourism Bureau Director-General
Janice Lai first raised the proposal of encouraging Chinese travel agencies to
organize more regional tours and to place less emphasis on round-the-island
tours.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan announced Saturday that the Taiwan Lantern Festival --
one of the most significant annual events on the country's calendar -- will be
held in southern Taiwan's Chiayi City next year.</P>
      <P>Liu made the announcement in a meeting with Chiayi Mayor Huang Ming-hui and
other city officials during a visit to the city to attend the 49th National
Primary and High School Science Fair held at National Chiayi University, a two-
day event.</P>
      <P>Applauding the decision, Huang described having the chance to host the annual
festival as a "big gift" to the southern city from the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The festival is held each year in a different county or city on the 15th of the
first month on the lunar calendar. As an event with prominent cultural and local
folk features, the event always draws participation by both local and foreign
visitors and is an important tourist draw.</P>
      <P>Liu told Huang that he was impressed by the city's achievements in carrying out
the central government's construction projects designed to expand domestic
demand, as well as its success in organizing  a magnificent  fireworks  display
for the official celebration of last year's Oct. 10 National Day.</P>
      <P>These achievements, he said, are why the central government decided to entrust
Chiayi City with the task of organizing the Lantern Festival.</P>
      <P>After the meeting, Liu went on to visit the science fair, at which  award-
winning  projects  were  displayed,  including  a "sophisticated architect --
the silk worm" project by fifth graders Huang Yi-ning and Ting Jung of Long An
Elementary School in Taipei City, who said it took them two years to study how
the worm builds its cocoon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan should position itself as technology hub: U.S. trade group</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 1 (CNA)
08/01/09  17:31:32
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A U.S. trade group has suggested that Taiwan should leverage its strengths in
high-tech manufacturing to position itself as a technology regional hub, as more
businesses will be willing to consider Taiwan an Asia-Pacific center when there
are regular direct flights across the Taiwan Strait to major cities in China.</P>
      <P>"Numerous analysts say, Taiwan's best bet would be to leverage its existing
strengths in high-tech manufacturing to position itself as a regional hub for
technology-intensive industries such as ICT and biotech, though they caution
that Taiwan has a window of about 10 years to accomplish this before cities in
China start catching up, " the Taipei-based American Chamber of Commerce
(AmCham) said in the cover story of its latest business publication, Topics.</P>
      <P>Many Taiwan-based ICT companies are already playing important regional and even
global roles, the report analyzes, noting that Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), for instance, is the world's largest contract chip
maker and that companies with head offices in Taiwan account for 80 percent of
the world's notebook computer production.</P>
      <P>"In Taiwan, you have ready access to the electronic manufacturing chain and also
access to distribution channels in China," Peter Kurz, head of Taiwan country
research for Citi Investment Research, is quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>"It'll be the tech companies that draw foreign companies here, whether Japanese
or Western," he added.</P>
      <P>Tristan Liu, an economist with the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER),
reached the same conclusion about Taiwan's prospects for serving as a regional
center.</P>
      <P>He views such a hub as encompassing tech-related downstream activity, such as
chip packaging, venture capital firms and other financial services aimed
specifically at technology companies, and other services such as recruiting and
training.</P>
      <P>Wang Jiann-chyuan, an economist with the Chung-Hwa Institution for Economic
Research (CIER), estimates that 5 percent to 10 percent of Taiwanese companies
based overseas intend to relocate more operations here because of the
improvements in cross-strait ties and new, more stringent labor regulations that
have been adopted in China.</P>
      <P>Lim Tay Her, an analyst with Asias leading brokage house CLSA Asia Pacific
Markets, notes that if 30 percent of the more-than 1 million Taiwanese working
in China should return, the added consumption of those 300,000 people would have
a dramatic impact on the economy, since most of them are relatively highly paid
professionals.</P>
      <P>Besides technology expertise, Taiwan is also more attractive than Chinese
locations in terms of living conditions, IPR protection and employee loyalty --
and surprisingly, even for many costs. But it still needs to reduce government
red tape in order to be competitive.</P>
      <P>"We've found that the cost of running a business in Taiwan is actually slightly
better than running the same business in other (Asian) locations -- including
things like cost of living, the cost of expatriate rent, office costs and
manufacturing costs, " said Alan T. Eusden, chairman of AmCham and president of
Corning Display Technologies, a leading maker of glass substrate for liquid
crystal display panels.</P>
      <P>However, the report warns that inadequate infrastructure and the proliferation
of bureaucratic red tape might be the two most daunting obstacles  standing in
the way of Taiwan becoming a regional operations hub.</P>
      <P>Overall, Eusden noted, as long as regulations are clear, their implementation
efficient,  and  improvements  made  in  the infrastructure, "combined with all
the benefits that already exist in Taiwan, I think you end up with a location
that can operate as a regional operations hub quite effectively."</P>

      <P>Five trains on the high-speed railway were canceled and other 20 were delayed
Saturday due to a signal malfunction on a track switch on the Miaoli-Yuanli
section of the line, according to a statement released later that day by the
Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC).</P>
      <P>The malfunction occurred at 6: 37 a.m. and was not fixed until 8: 50 a.m.</P>
      <P>While technicians raced to fix the problem, all trains had to be switched to run
on the unaffected southbound rail, a change that forced the company to cancel
three scheduled southbound trains and two northbound ones, the statement said.</P>
      <P>It added that 13 other trains were delayed to degrees that the company had to
give passengers full refunds or half refunds of the ticket fares, while minor
delays of less than 30 minutes hit a further seven trains.</P>
      <P>The first delay occurred when a northbound train, which began its journey from
Taichung at 6: 30 a.m., stopped suddenly after passing Miaoli Station and
remained there for 30 minutes before taking off in reverse direction back toward
Taichung Station.</P>
      <P>The train was scheduled to arrive at Taoyuan Station at 7:05 a.m. but failed to
get there until 8:38 a.m.</P>
      <P>The company apologized for the cancellations and delays that triggered waves of
complaints from inconvenienced passengers, with one TV station reporting that
the cancellations and delays led to over 10,000 people having their travel plans
disrupted.</P>
      <P>One irate passenger said he was booked on a direct chartered flight to Nanjing
from the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and that the delay caused him to
miss his flight.</P>
      <P>In addition to the businessman, five participants in a national examination for
medical personnel at Taipei County's Chiang-Tsui Junior High School did not
arrive at the test venue in time, and were forced to sit the first one-hour
section of the test with only 20 minutes left on the clock.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of High Speed Rail was cited by a local evening newspaper in its
Saturday edition as saying that it is scheduled to conduct its annual check on
THSRC's operations, maintenance and repairs, as well as passenger services, some
time between the end of August and early September.</P>
      <P>The bureau also said there have been 21 incidents on the high speed railway
involving  signal malfunctions  related to track switching since the system
began operation in January 2007.</P>
      <P>The frequency has been so high that the company must strengthen its regular
maintenance and repair operations, said Hu Hsiang-ling, deputy director general
of the bureau.</P>

      <P>Chinese Taipei opened the scoring with a point in the first half of the second

several defensive mistakes by the Taiwanese players, including a wild pitch.</P>
      <P>South Korea took a 2-1 lead in the third inning, but by the fourth had lost it

himself and his teammate Lin Ken-wei who was at first base back to the home

      <P>Not until the seventh inning did South Korea begin to claw its way back, getting
one point by taking advantage of Chinese Taipei pitcher Huang Chih-lung's poor

      <P>A health official confirmed Saturday two more influenza A(H1N1) cluster
infections, bringing to 12 the number of cluster infections, with a report on a
possible third pending confirmation.</P>
      <P>Lin Ting, deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control under the
Department of Health, said that among the two newly confirmed cases, one
occurred at a senior high school in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Twenty-two students from a single class of a summer camp at the school had
developed flu symptoms since July 29. Out of five affected students tested, four
were confirmed to be suffering from A(H1N1) infection, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The school was ordered closed Friday and will not open until Aug. 5, according
to Lin.</P>
      <P>The second cluster infections took place in a junior high school in southern
Taiwan, with 17 students from one class showing flu symptoms and four of eight
children from whom samples were taken and examined confirmed as being infected.</P>
      <P>That school was also ordered to be closed until Aug. 5.</P>
      <P>Health officials were also taking samples from students from a third senior high
school in southern Taiwan after being informed that 34 students there had
developed flu symptoms.</P>
      <P>Lin urged the public to be watchful for flu symptoms among the people around

symptoms, as cases of A(H1N1) are increasing in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Chinese Taipei beat South Korea 5-4 Saturday in the 25th Asian Baseball
Championships that opened that day in the Hokkaido prefectural capital of
Sapporo, in northern Japan.</P>
      <P>Chinese Taipei opened the scoring with a point in the first half of the second
inning. South Korea, however, tied the score later in the inning thanks to
several defensive mistakes by the Taiwanese players, including a wild pitch.</P>
      <P>South Korea took a 2-1 lead in the third inning, but by the fourth had lost it
again 2-4 after Chinese Taipei batter Wu Chung-chun hit a homerun, sending
himself and his teammate Lin Ken-wei who was at first base back to the home
plate.</P>
      <P>Not until the seventh inning did South Korea begin to claw its way back, getting
one point by taking advantage of Chinese Taipei pitcher Huang Chih-lung's poor
performance.</P>
      <P>Huang was then replaced by Wang Yi-cheng in the same inning, who also made a
wild pitch, allowing South Korea to tie the score.</P>
      <P>Chinese Taipei struggled to overcome the Koreans in the ninth inning and took
the winning point by striking out four safe hits in a row.</P>
      <P>Chinese Taipei will take on defending champion Japan Sunday.</P>
      <P>Four teams, including China, are in the semi-final round of the regional
baseball championships, which are held every two years.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A health official confirmed Saturday two more influenza A(H1N1) cluster
infections, bringing to 12 the number of cluster infections, with a report on a
possible third pending confirmation.</P>
      <P>Lin Ting, deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control under the
Department of Health, said that among the two newly confirmed cases, one
occurred at a senior high school in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Twenty-two students from a single class of a summer camp at the school had
developed flu symptoms since July 29. Out of five affected students tested, four
were confirmed to be suffering from A(H1N1) infection, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The school was ordered closed Friday and will not open until Aug. 5, according
to Lin.</P>
      <P>The second cluster infections took place in a junior high school in southern
Taiwan, with 17 students from one class showing flu symptoms and four of eight
children from whom samples were taken and examined confirmed as being infected.</P>
      <P>That school was also ordered to be closed until Aug. 5.</P>
      <P>Health officials were also taking samples from students from a third senior high
school in southern Taiwan after being informed that 34 students there had
developed flu symptoms.</P>
      <P>Lin urged the public to be watchful for flu symptoms among the people around
them and to alert health officials if they know anyone showing flu-like
symptoms, as cases of A(H1N1) are increasing in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Health officials are concerned that the flu could spiral out of control when
students return at the start of the regular semester in September after the
summer vacation.</P>

      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) said Sunday that it was watching a tropical
depression system near Luzon Province in the Philippines that might develop into
a tropical storm or typhoon.</P>
      <P>The depression was moving in a west-northwesterly direction toward Taiwan at a
speed of 20 kilometers per hour as of 8 a.m. Sunday, the CWB reported.</P>
      <P>The system later slowed a bit, CWB meteorologists said, adding that it remained
to be seen whether the system will alter in structure after passing across Luzon
Island.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, hot weather in Taiwan persisted, with temperatures expected to reach
35-36 degrees Celsius in northern Taiwan and 33-34 degrees for the rest of the

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan housing prices to rise up to 30% in three years: analyst</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's housing prices are expected to rise about 20 percent-30 percent in the
next two to three years because the local housing market hit bottom in the first
quarter of this year and is now showing signs of recovery, an analyst with Union
Bank of Switzerland (UBS) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The housing trade volume rose by 47 percent in the second quarter compared with
the first, while the average price of second-hand houses posted a 10 percent
quarterly growth and a 3 percent growth over the same quarter of last year, said
Chung Chao-an, a UBS analyst focused on mid- and small-cap companies.</P>
      <P>Despite a 1.6 precent quarterly drop in new house prices, 70 percent-80 percent
of houses traded in the first quarter were second-hand houses, according to
Chung.</P>
      <P>Judging from the surging housing prices and the increasing trade volume, housing
prices must have hit their lowest in the first quarter, Chung added.</P>
      <P>He further predicted that the unemployment rate will probably reach a peak in
the fourth quarter of this year or the first of next year and that there will be
room for house prices to rise further in the next two to three years following
an anticipated increase in economic and trade relations between Taiwan and
China, an overall recovery of Taiwan's economy, a boost in consumer confidence,
and a low interest rate environment.</P>
      <P>Chung also suggested  that investors buy shares in Taiwan Fertilizer and Far
Eastern Textile because they hold a high number of assets and have high
potential for development.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Far Eastern Air expects to resume flights by October</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 2 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Far Eastern Air Transport Corp. (FEAT), which is under reconstruction after
suspending all its flights since May 2008 due to financial troubles, expects to
resume flights by October, although approval from the Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) is still pending, a CAA spokesman said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The airline has been conducting  aircraft  inspection  and maintenance at
Sungshan Airport in Taipei since early July.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said FEAT is renting facilities at the airport from the
administration's Taipei Aviation Station at a cost of NT$1.6 million (US$48,837)
per month.</P>
      <P>Eager to resume the flights, FEAT in mid-June asked more than 80 of its staff to
report for work, paying them 80 percent of their salaries until such time as
flights are resumed.</P>
      <P>FEAT was the first privately owned airline in Taiwan and had its heyday as the
major carrier on Taiwan's domestic routes before the Taiwan High Speed Railway
started its north-south services in March 2007.</P>
      <P>Ever-dwindling business and rising fuel prices took a heavy toll on the airline
and it was forced to submit a bankruptcy protection early last year.</P>
      <P>Court approval of bankruptcy protection failed to save the airline because it
failed to obtain the necessary funds and it suspended all its flights after the
last service between South Korea's Jeju and the Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport May 16, 2008.</P>
      <P>Many of its staff remained on duty for several months, holding on to every
chance to save the company. Meanwhile, the airline received a court order three
months ago,  allowing it to initiate  a restructuring plan.</P>
      <P>The CAA spokesman said that while the administration  has rescinded its
certification for FEAT's international services, the airline can resume its
regular domestic flights as well as flying cross-Taiwan Strait routes when it
obtains final approval.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tourism Bureau plans 10 new ecotourism packages</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 2  (CNA)
08/02/09  16:47:00

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau is planning 10 new ecotourism  packages to capitalize on
Taiwan's rich ecological resources and promote development of the tourism
industry, an official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>"The bureau has commissioned the Taiwan Ecotourism Association to help design
ecotourism themes and tour packages to be implemented from next year, " said
Chen Yu-chuan, a section chief at the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC).</P>
      <P>The initiative stems from findings that the number of foreign ecotourists who
travel to Taiwan to see indigenous or migratory bird species and diverse
geological  spectacles has been increasing significantly in recent years, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>"The phenomenon  indicates that our plentiful  natural and ecological marvels
can be most precious assets to upgrade the local tourism industry," Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Major local tour operators echoed Chen, saying that domestic travel styles are
changing as local people are no longer focusing their interest on simply
visiting major sightseeing spots.</P>
      <P>"Tour packages that feature whale- and dolphin-watching, hiking in Fushan
Botanical  Park and walks along historic trails in mountainous  regions have
become ever-more popular,  " said a Taipei-based travel agent who spoke on
condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>Chiang Kun-ta, a local birdwatching tourism promoter who led a group of British
and Dutch tour operators on an islandwide tour in mid-July to appreciate the
myriad bird species seen in Taiwan, said that nearly 150 bird species can be
sighted in 24 hours from coastal areas of Tainan County to Yushan, or Jade
Mountain, in neighboring Chiayi and Nantou counties.</P>
      <P>Chen said the planned ecotour packages could feature a variety of themes, such
as geological wonders, lagoons and coastal wetlands, rare bird species and water
birds, as well as insects and indigenous plants.</P>
      <P>The ecotourism association is also expected to come up with recommended lists of
spots for appreciation of various ecological marvels or natural spectacles, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>The bureau will invite local travel industry executives to a meeting in October
to map out detailed ecotour packages, Chen said, adding that the Tourism Bureau
will offer incentives or subsidies for travel agencies that help promote
ecotourism.</P>
      <P>The association has also been commissioned to help organize training courses for
volunteer ecotour guides, Chen went on, adding that special ecotour guiding
courses will also be launched between Aug. 18 and Sept. 11 for local
professional group tour leaders and guides.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Taiwan has become increasingly known as one of the world's
major whale- and dolphin-watching meccas, with the success rate of sighting
whales and dolphins on a voyage from Shihti port in eastern Taiwan's Hualien
County reaching 95 percent, a ratio widely believed to be the world's highest.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Taiwan's fame as a mountain climbing mecca is also growing, with an
ever-increasing number of foreign climbers traveling to Taiwan to scale local
peaks, particularly from Austria, Japan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>"The fact that Taiwan has about 290 mountains rising above 3,000 meters has
contributed to the maturing of the local mountain climbing tour business," Chen
explained.</P>
      <P>"Most of our high mountains are located not far from major highways and it is
not difficult for foreigners to reach and scale even our highest summits," he
added.</P>

      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yeh Ching-chuan  spelled out Sunday his
intention to run for the magisterial seat in the eastern county of Hualien.</P>
      <P>Yeh, who had been rumored over the past month to be running on a ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) ticket in the Hualien magistrate election but had never spoken
publicly about it, said he will report his intention to Premier Liu Chao-shiuan
at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>Declining to disclose whether he has submitted a resignation request to the
premier, Yeh said he will take heed of Liu's instruction on the matter.</P>
      <P>One of Yeh's aides told CNA that day that "it's up to the KMT leadership  to
decide whether and when Yeh should resign the ministership for the election."</P>
      <P>KMT Vice Chairman Wu Den-yih said the day before that a primary for the KMT's
candidate in the election will be held in the following month and that the
candidate is expected to be determined before Sept. 12.</P>
      <P>"Yeh will made his decision shortly on whether he will remain health minister or
take part in the KMT primary," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yaung Chih-liang, a professor at Asia University, Taiwan and a former
DOH vice minister, confirmed that he is on a shortlist of candidates to be
appointed Yeh's successor, but stressed that if possible he would rather not be
appointed.</P>
      <P>"I hope Minister Yeh will stay in his current post and make more contributions

      <P>National Taiwan University (NTU) was listed 26th in the 2009 Webometrics Ranking
of World Universities released in July by the Spanish National Research Council,
making it the only local university to be included in the top 100 of the
rankings, a university official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The rankings,  along with the 2009 Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for
World Universities released last week by the Higher Education Evaluation and
Accreditation, Council of Taiwan, are among a great number of ranking surveys of
world universities that are conducted based on objective figures, said Chiang
Been-huang, dean of academic affairs at NTU.</P>
      <P>NTU is normally ranked high in these types of ranking surveys, but is at a
disadvantage relative to some other universities in the world when rankings are
made using overall impression scores, such as the one conducted by The Times
newspaper, Chiang added.</P>
      <P>With concerted efforts of NTU faculty and teachers, however, the school has
greatly improved its rankings in the Webometrics ranking survey, according to
Chiang.</P>
      <P>However, NTU's development is constrained to a great extent by inadequate
resources, Chiang went on, expressing concern over a loss of talent at the
school as the pay it offers to its faculty is lower than top-ranking
universities in Singapore, Hong Kong and even China.</P>

      <P>A high-profile Chinese media delegation wrapped up a week-long visit Sunday with
commitments to further promote cross-Taiwan Strait journalistic exchanges and
cooperation in a pragmatic manner.</P>
      <P>Yang Yi, director of the information department of China's Taiwan Affairs Office
who headed the 16-member delegation, said at a pre-departure news conference
that the visit had been very fruitful.</P>
      <P>During the visit, Yang said, journalism scholars, journalists and media
executives from the two sides discussed issues regarding the promotion of
bilateral journalistic exchanges.</P>
      <P>"Even though Taiwanese and Chinese media organizations operate in different
environments  and their management  philosophies  and operational principles are
not identical, there should still be ample room for them to share their
experiences and learn from each other, " Yang said.</P>
      <P>Through candid and exhaustive discussion, Yang went on, both sides agreed to
increase exchanges to lay a solid foundation for normalization of cross-strait
journalistic exchanges and cooperation.</P>
      <P>Some media organizations from both sides also tentatively agreed to cooperate or
give mutual support in news coverage in the future, Yang said.</P>
      <P>One of the group's purposes was to push for the establishment of reciprocal
media company offices in Taiwan and China, and Yang said he hopes the two sides
can reach an agreement on this issue as soon as possible to facilitate cross-
strait news coverage and contribute to the peaceful development of bilateral
ties.</P>
      <P>"There have been mounting calls for each side to allow media organizations from
the other side to set up permanent offices to facilitate continued and in-depth
news coverage," Yang continued.</P>
      <P>As basic differences exist between the two sides in terms of basic journalistic
concepts and media functions, Taiwan is still reluctant to strike a deal with
China on reciprocal media company office establishment, however.</P>
      <P>Yang said he believes any problems or glitches in bilateral engagements can be
overcome through goodwill exchanges. "We can do whatever is easy first to
achieve concrete progress, leaving the more thorny issues to be tackled at a
later stage," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA staff writer</P>
      <P>People are scared of earthquakes  mostly because of their unpredictability.</P>
      <P>For decades, seismologists have dreamed of being able to divine the time and
place of the next disastrous shock. But the behavior of quake-prone faults has
proved so complex that the experts have been forced to conclude that large
tremors are isolated, random and unpredictable.</P>
      <P>Industrially advanced countries have made commendable progress over the past
several decades in earth sciences, but the prediction of the time, epicenter and
magnitude of major earthquakes is a problem that has not been solved.</P>
      <P>"We're still finding the ways to predict earthquakes, like a blind man feeling
an elephant, " said Shin Tsai-chin, deputy director of the Central Weather
Bureau (CWB) , who oversees the bureau's Seismic Network.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is located in a strongly oblique convergent zone between the Eurasian
Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate, an area commonly referred to as the Pacific
Ring of Fire. According to the CWB Seismic Network, the Taiwan area has about
16,000 to 18,000 detectable earthquakes each year, about 250 of which are of
magnitude 4.0 and about 30 of which are magnitude 5.0 or larger.</P>
      <P>Yilan in the northeast and Hualien in the east are the most earthquake-prone
counties in Taiwan. However, a deadly 7.3 magnitude earthquake unexpectedly
struck Taiwan Sept. 21, 1999, with its epicenter located near the town of Chi-
Chi in central Taiwan -- not close to the more active seismic zones of Yilan and
Hualien.</P>
      <P>The earthquake -- the most serious disaster since World War II in Taiwan -- left
some 2,500 people dead and 100,000 houses destroyed, and seriously disrupted the
local economy as it occurred near the island's densely populated western plain.</P>
      <P>Shin said seismologists may have gained some knowledge from labs and theoretical
studies about earthquake precursors, but when it comes to reality, they have a
hard time telling whether the phenomena they have detected can be coded as
earthquake precursors.</P>
      <P>Taking the CWB's experience as an example, he said, prominent short-term
anomalies or dynamic tendencies of underground water levels are often detected
in its seismological observation station in Hualien prior to certain major
earthquakes, but there have been incidents in which underground water levels
have had no changes at all before some quakes of similar magnitude have struck.</P>
      <P>Shin said one of the things that make earthquake predictions impossible is that
the prediction theory or method that proves to be effective at one location does
not necessarily prove to be applicable to other localities,  because all
locations vary in terms of geological structure.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, some historical accounts show that there have been
apparent foreshocks before some major earthquakes have occurred, but many
devastating quakes have struck without any foreshocks.</P>
      <P>Japan, the United States and China have spent money and manpower in earthquake
prediction research over the past 30-odd years, while Russia, Italy, Greece and
Taiwan have started to catch up.</P>
      <P>There have been cases that have proved to be successful in earthquake
predictions in China, such as one made in 1975 that pre-warned an incoming
disastrous jolt for Haicheng City in Liaoning Province, helping reduce damage to
lives and property.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the same theory and technology applied in an area of northeastern
China failed to divine in advance a killer earthquake that battered Tangshan the
following year that left more than 250,000 people dead.</P>
      <P>Earth scientists have worked from various angles -- crustal deformation, plate
behavior and alteration of underground water levels -- to try to divine when,
where and how disastrous earthquakes occur, in the hope that someday,
seismologists will be able to forecast major quakes the same way they forecast
typhoons, Shin said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he went on, the CWB's earthquake prediction research has mainly
focused on observation and analysis of mass transfer and rock dilation of the
Earth's crust, as well as the short-term anomalies or dynamic tendencies of
underground water levels before major earthquakes.</P>
      <P>Since the devastating 921 Chi-Chi earthquake, the CWB has installed global
positioning  systems (GPS)  at 150 earthquake observation spots nationwide,
aimed at detecting crustal activities before and after major quakes.</P>
      <P>The weather bureau has also dug a deep well in Hualien, hoping that variations
in the underground water levels in the 300-meter well will tell when and how
earthquakes occur.</P>
      <P>So far, however, they have failed to obtain effective evidence provided by the
well to prove that variations in underground water levels have direct or
definite relationships to earthquakes, Shin noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he continued, the CWB has received many phone calls from enthusiastic
members of the public who claim to have an instinct for forecasting earthquakes.
In one case, he said, a man said he develops tinnitus prior to a major
earthquake. After quantitative verification, however, most of the predictions
have proved wrong.</P>
      <P>Aware that improper forecasting of a major earthquake based only on superstition
could trigger social anxiety or even instability, the CWB never makes any
temblor forecasts based on the "precognition" of an individual, Shin stressed.</P>
      <P>Many people have also shown great interest in animal precursors, Shin went on,
but pointed out that animal behavior can be altered by too many factors and so
far, no government in the world has made serious research on the relationship
between animal behavior and earthquakes.</P>
      <P>Besides the CWB, other research institutes have also been doing research on
earthquake precursors.</P>
      <P>According to Shin, the Institute of Earth Sciences under Academia Sinica has
established eight earthquake monitoring stations around the country since 1988
aimed at discerning the relationship between major earthquakes and geomagnetic
fluctuations.</P>
      <P>So far, they have not been able to determine the reasons behind geomagnetic
fluctuations and their physical mechanism, Shin said.</P>
      <P>Several leading local universities, including National Taiwan Central University
and National Taiwan University, have also set up task forces to research the
possibility of short-term earthquake prediction on the basis of electromagnetic
field variations under, on, or over the Earth's surface and near space.</P>
      <P>"Despite being an uphill battle, earthquake prediction research must go on,"
Shin concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan medical mission serves Tibetans in northwestern India</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese medical delegation returned to the Indian capital of New Delhi
Saturday after concluding a week-long medical mission providing services to
Tibetans living in the mountainous northwestern region of India.</P>
      <P>The 36-member mission of the Taiwan Root Medical Peace Corps (TRMPC), composed
of six doctors in various fields, five dentists and three nurses, as well as
medical technicians and volunteers, left Dharamsala Friday and took a 12-hour
bus ride to New Delhi before heading home later that day.</P>
      <P>Liu Chi-chun, a dentist who served as head of the mission, said the group
managed to see 2,690 patients in Dharamsala over its seven-day mission.</P>
      <P>"The figure was far lower than that of the past years, " he said, however,
speculating that rainy weather might have put prospective patients off traveling
to seek medical attention.</P>
      <P>But he also noted that the lower patient turnout "could also mean that the
health of the Tibetans in the area has improved to a large degree."</P>
      <P>Liu said his mission arrived in Dharamsala, seat of the Tibetan government-in-
exile just as the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama was about to leave on
a trip to Europe.</P>
      <P>When his holiness heard of the arrival of the mission, however, he arranged a
meeting with them at his office and shook hands with each of the member to
express his appreciation for their work, Liu said.</P>
      <P>The TRMPC first visited Dharamsala in 2000, marking the beginning of the group's
annual visits to India ever since. As the Tibetans living in the northern region
suffer from a general lack of medical resources and health information, the
group has made its visits to the area a priority.</P>
      <P>In addition to Dharamsala, the group also visited Sikkim in northern India and
Darjeeling in northeastern India.</P>
      <P>The TRMPC, founded by Liu in 1995, is a private non-profit organization
dedicated to improving quality of life through provision of medical services and
health education.</P>
      <P>It believes that medical service should transcend national borders and exceed
the limitations of politics, race, and religion. It holds as its end goal a
united international community working in cooperation to bring about equitable
access of healthcare to all populations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Hypermarket helps promote local produce</HEADLINE>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Unlike some of its rivals, which regularly host gala-like  sales to promote
imported produce,  one local hypermarket franchise has been cooperating with the
Council of Agriculture (COA) to push sales of local produce on a seasonal basis.</P>
      <P>The Far Eastern Ai Mai Group, which has since 2007 been cooperating with the COA
to push domestically produced agricultural products, has launched a series of
sales drives since July 21 this year to boost sales of freshly picked fruit and
vegetables.</P>
      <P>In one single week of promotion, the company's 15 branches islandwide sold
300,000 kg of fresh pears, guavas and lemons, mostly from southern Taiwan,
generating record high sales to the tune of NT$5 million (US$15,244), said the
franchise's marketing chief Chuang Chin-lung.</P>
      <P>"The sales drive marked a four-way victory for the government, the consumers and
the farmers, as well as for Far Eastern Ai Mai, " Chuang said.</P>
      <P>The drive was particularly welcomed because it helped alleviate the price
pressure that farmers have suffered due to abnormal weather in the first half of
this year, when too much sunshine and too little rain caused some crops to ripen
ahead of schedule or resulted in a glut of others.</P>
      <P>Touting "produce directly from the farms," the Far Eastern Ai Mai stores have
helped fruit growers in southern Pingtung and Kaohsiung counties by selling
lemons at NT$1 per fruit and guavas at NT$5, greatly easing the glut of these
fruits, Chuang said.</P>
      <P>From July 29-Aug. 8, a second sales drive was launched at the stores, promoting
signature agricultural products from the central county of Nantou, including
pork sausages made with shaohsing wine, as well as various kinds of mushrooms
cultivated in the area, he added.</P>
      <P>He said that by the end of the year, the chain will have promoted agricultural
products from 12 cities and counties.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The world's first botanical product industry cluster is taking shape in southern
Taiwan's Pingtung Agricultural Biotechnology Park, which is now home to more
than 20 companies in the field, a Council of Agriculture (COA) official said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>With the global botanical products market growing rapidly, the official said,
the Cabinet-level council has made strenuous efforts to promote the development
of the industry in Taiwan over the past few years.</P>
      <P>"The role of botanical  products  is becoming increasingly important in the
global mainstream medical market and the industry is growing at an average
annual rate of more than 10 percent, " said the official.</P>
      <P>Noting that annual global sales of botanical products have already exceeded
US$60 billion, the official said Taiwan stands a good chance of excelling in
this domain, given its outstanding research achievements and plentiful research
capacity.</P>
      <P>The Pingtung agricultural park -- the COA's botanical product industry
development arm -- has for the last three years prioritized attracting companies
that use herbs and medicinal plants as their major raw materials to set up
production facilities there, the official said.</P>
      <P>"Thanks to our strenuous efforts, we have managed to persuade 22 such companies
to set up factories in the Pingtung park, " he went on, adding that the
companies manufacture a variety of products, including health supplements, skin
care products and animal feed additives.</P>
      <P>As local botanical product manufacturers tend to operate alone, they can have
difficulty upgrading their operational efficiency, a situation that prompted the
park administration to lobby those companies to pool their resources and form a
cooperative platform to enhance their operational efficiency and sharpen their
competitive edge.</P>
      <P>The official noted that the Taiwan Botanical Product Industry Union was
established in April this year to help union members cooperate in raw material
procurement,  technology development, product examination and certification, as
well as marketing and distribution.</P>
      <P>"Through the integration  of resources and cooperation  in research, development
and marketing, the Pingtung park is set to become the world's first and probably
only botanical product industry cluster, " the official said.</P>
      <P>He addd that the park administration has also set up various divisions to help
those companies with raw material supply, technology development, product
certification and marketing cooperation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Financial crisis hurts job market more than dotcom bubble: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  2 (CNA)
08/02/09  19:51:50

    <TEXT>
      <P>The impact of the financial crisis on the local job market is even worse than
that caused by the dotcom bubble of 2000 and will take at least two years to
recover, the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's average unemployment rate in the first six months of this year reached
5.73 percent, up 1.86 percent from the same period of last year and exceeding
the 1.15-percent increase between the first half of 2001 and 2002 after the
dotcom bubble burst. The figures signal the even stronger impact of the
financial debacle on the job market, according to the CEPD.</P>
      <P>Men bore the brunt of the global financial turmoil because between January and
June, the average employment among male workers was down by 134,000, compared
with a decrease of 14,000 among females, the CEPD said.</P>
      <P>The unemployment rate is expected to continue rising in July and August when new
graduates enter the job market and will then begin to show signs of improvement
after September, when a global economic recovery is expected, according to the
CEPD.</P>
      <P>However, the CEPD predicted that the employment situation will not improve
greatly until the second quarter of 2010 at the earliest and said a booster shot
is needed to help with economic recovery if Taiwan aims to bring the
unemployment rate down to the average of 3.19 percent recorded in 2006 and 2007.</P>
      <P>The economy recorded a negative 2.17 percent growth in 2000 and the nation's
business cycle indicators flashed blue for the eighth straight time during the
period, as it suffered badly from the collapse of the dotcom bubble. It took
three quarters before the economy recovered from the recession and two years
before the employment market was restored to its previous level, according to
the CEPD.</P>
      <P>Reeling from the global financial crunch that began in the last half of 2008,
Taiwan's economy and gross domestic product (GDP) had both stayed in negative
territory for four quarters as of the second quarter of this year.</P>
      <P>As part of efforts to tackle unemployment, especially among middle-aged and
elderly people, the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) has urged job seekers in
those groups to find a new job before quitting their old one.</P>
      <P>Huang Meng-ju, head of a CLA-affiliated employment service center in central
Taiwan, attributed the relatively high unemployment rate among middle-aged and
elderly people to their general unwillingness to lower their expectations about
their jobs.</P>

      <P>Summer camp activities for local students will proceed as scheduled despite
confirmation of several influenza A(H1N1) cluster infections involving students
taking part in such programs, a Ministry of Education (MOE) official said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>"Influenza A(H1N1) is a category-four statutory communicable disease, just like
other forms of flu. Since no stricter regulations have been imposed on its
prevention, summer camp activities can go ahead as usual," said Wang Chun-chuan,
director of the MOE's Physical Education Department.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Wang went on, the ministry will ask students attending camp
activities to strengthen their health self-management.</P>
      <P>The ministry has been scheduled to organize up to 110 summer camp programs for
school students at various levels during this year's summer vacation, some of
which have already been going on for more than a month. Some participating
students have been involved in A(H1N1) cluster infections.</P>
      <P>Addressing rising concerns as to whether the summer camps should be suspended
because of fear of further infections, Wang said the ministry sees no need for
such a course of action, as long as the camping site environments are kept clean
and students maintain rigorous personal hygiene.</P>
      <P>He also reminded local parents that their children should not attend camp
activities if they develop flu symptoms, such as fever and sore throat.</P>
      <P>As to whether schools that offer summer courses for students should be closed
down if an A(H1N1) case is confirmed, Wang said the ministry has authorized
school authorities to decide on their own because summer courses are not formal
school days.</P>
      <P>When local schools reopen in September at the end of summer vacation, Wang said
that if there are still cluster infections arising, the ministry may announce
clear guidelines for school closure.</P>
      <P>As of Saturday, 12 A(H1N1) cluster infections have been confirmed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Former Department  of Helath Minister  Chen Chien-jen,  an epidemiologist,
warned in an interview with a local newspaper Friday that Taiwan is approaching
a stage where the A(H1N1) flu will spread quickly.</P>
      <P>"If we fail to intensify prevention efforts, a major outbreak could hit in late
September or October, the traditional flu peak season," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has so far confirmed six severe A(H1N1) cases, including one death. Based
on this figure, he said, Taiwan should have at least 10,000 such cases.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the government speed up purchases of anti-viral drugs and
vaccines to cope with any possible outbreak of the disease.</P>

for a two-day visit during which he will attend a forum on the prevention of
A(H1N1) infection and exchange views with members of the medical establishment
there, a DOH source said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The source made the remarks amid reports that Yeh will soon resign from his post
to run on a ruling Kuomintang ticket in the Hualien magistrate election.</P>
      <P>"Yeh's visit to Hong Kong was arranged a month ago and we have received no
instructions that the trip has been canceled, " the source continued.</P>
      <P>Yeh will depart for Hong Kong Tuesday and return the following day. During his
visit, he will speak on the outlook of medical and health cooperation between
Taiwan and Hong Kong, and will visit Princess Margaret Hospital and call on
Anthony Wu, chairman of Hospital Authority.</P>
      <P>Accompanying Yeh for his visit will be Huang Kun-chang, chief executive officer
of the Hospital Administration Commission under the DOH; Chen Wen-chung,
superintendent of Taoyuan General Hospital; and Chang Shen-chwen, vice
superintendent of National Taiwan University Hospital.</P>
      <P>Huang said that both Taiwan and Hong Kong have experienced A(H1N1) community and
cluster infections, and both also have reported one fatality from the new flu
strain.</P>
      <P>Princess Margaret Hospital and the Taoyuan General Hospital are both charged
with admitting potential sufferers of A(H1N1) that are detected at the
international airports on both sides, and both could share each other's

      <P>National Taiwan University (NTU) was listed 26th in the 2009 Webometrics Ranking
of World Universities released in July by the Spanish National Research Council,
making it the only local university to be included in the top 100 of the
rankings, a university official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The rankings,  along with the 2009 Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for
World Universities released last week by the Higher Education Evaluation and
Accreditation, Council of Taiwan, are among a great number of ranking surveys of
world universities that are conducted based on objective figures, said Chiang
Been-huang, dean of academic affairs at NTU.</P>
      <P>NTU is normally ranked high in these types of ranking surveys, but is at a
disadvantage relative to some other universities in the world when rankings are
made using overall impression scores, such as the one conducted by The Times
newspaper, Chiang added.</P>
      <P>With concerted efforts of NTU faculty and teachers, however, the school has
greatly improved its rankings in the Webometrics ranking survey, according to
Chiang.</P>
      <P>However, NTU's development is constrained to a great extent by inadequate

      <P>A high-profile Chinese media delegation wrapped up a week-long visit Sunday with
commitments to further promote cross-Taiwan Strait journalistic exchanges and
cooperation in a pragmatic manner.</P>
      <P>Yang Yi, director of the information department of China's Taiwan Affairs Office
who headed the 16-member delegation, said at a pre-departure news conference
that the visit had been very fruitful.</P>
      <P>During the visit, Yang said, journalism scholars, journalists and media
executives from the two sides discussed issues regarding the promotion of
bilateral journalistic exchanges.</P>
      <P>"Even though Taiwanese and Chinese media organizations operate in different
environments  and their management  philosophies  and operational principles are
not identical, there should still be ample room for them to share their
experiences and learn from each other, " Yang said.</P>
      <P>Through candid and exhaustive discussion, Yang went on, both sides agreed to
increase exchanges to lay a solid foundation for normalization of cross-strait
journalistic exchanges and cooperation.</P>
      <P>Some media organizations from both sides also tentatively agreed to cooperate or
give mutual support in news coverage in the future, Yang said.</P>
      <P>One of the group's purposes was to push for the establishment of reciprocal
media company offices in Taiwan and China, and Yang said he hopes the two sides
can reach an agreement on this issue as soon as possible to facilitate cross-
strait news coverage and contribute to the peaceful development of bilateral
ties.</P>
      <P>"There have been mounting calls for each side to allow media organizations from
the other side to set up permanent offices to facilitate continued and in-depth
news coverage," Yang continued.</P>
      <P>As basic differences exist between the two sides in terms of basic journalistic
concepts and media functions, Taiwan is still reluctant to strike a deal with
China on reciprocal media company office establishment, however.</P>
      <P>Yang said he believes any problems or glitches in bilateral engagements can be
overcome through goodwill exchanges. "We can do whatever is easy first to
achieve concrete progress, leaving the more thorny issues to be tackled at a

    <HEADLINE>Breakthrough in precursor studies key to earthquake prediction</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/02/09  18:00:10</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA staff writer</P>
      <P>People are scared of earthquakes  mostly because of their unpredictability.</P>
      <P>For decades, seismologists have dreamed of being able to divine the time and
place of the next disastrous shock. But the behavior of quake-prone faults has
proved so complex that the experts have been forced to conclude that large
tremors are isolated, random and unpredictable.</P>
      <P>Industrially advanced countries have made commendable progress over the past
several decades in earth sciences, but the prediction of the time, epicenter and
magnitude of major earthquakes is a problem that has not been solved.</P>
      <P>"We're still finding the ways to predict earthquakes, like a blind man feeling
an elephant, " said Shin Tsai-chin, deputy director of the Central Weather
Bureau (CWB) , who oversees the bureau's Seismic Network.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is located in a strongly oblique convergent zone between the Eurasian
Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate, an area commonly referred to as the Pacific
Ring of Fire. According to the CWB Seismic Network, the Taiwan area has about
16,000 to 18,000 detectable earthquakes each year, about 250 of which are of
magnitude 4.0 and about 30 of which are magnitude 5.0 or larger.</P>
      <P>Yilan in the northeast and Hualien in the east are the most earthquake-prone
counties in Taiwan. However, a deadly 7.3 magnitude earthquake unexpectedly
struck Taiwan Sept. 21, 1999, with its epicenter located near the town of Chi-
Chi in central Taiwan -- not close to the more active seismic zones of Yilan and
Hualien.</P>
      <P>The earthquake -- the most serious disaster since World War II in Taiwan -- left
some 2,500 people dead and 100,000 houses destroyed, and seriously disrupted the
local economy as it occurred near the island's densely populated western plain.</P>
      <P>Shin said seismologists may have gained some knowledge from labs and theoretical
studies about earthquake precursors, but when it comes to reality, they have a
hard time telling whether the phenomena they have detected can be coded as
earthquake precursors.</P>
      <P>Taking the CWB's experience as an example, he said, prominent short-term
anomalies or dynamic tendencies of underground water levels are often detected
in its seismological observation station in Hualien prior to certain major
earthquakes, but there have been incidents in which underground water levels
have had no changes at all before some quakes of similar magnitude have struck.</P>
      <P>Shin said one of the things that make earthquake predictions impossible is that
the prediction theory or method that proves to be effective at one location does
not necessarily prove to be applicable to other localities,  because all
locations vary in terms of geological structure.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, some historical accounts show that there have been
apparent foreshocks before some major earthquakes have occurred, but many
devastating quakes have struck without any foreshocks.</P>
      <P>Japan, the United States and China have spent money and manpower in earthquake
prediction research over the past 30-odd years, while Russia, Italy, Greece and
Taiwan have started to catch up.</P>
      <P>There have been cases that have proved to be successful in earthquake
predictions in China, such as one made in 1975 that pre-warned an incoming
disastrous jolt for Haicheng City in Liaoning Province, helping reduce damage to
lives and property.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the same theory and technology applied in an area of northeastern
China failed to divine in advance a killer earthquake that battered Tangshan the
following year that left more than 250,000 people dead.</P>
      <P>Earth scientists have worked from various angles -- crustal deformation, plate
behavior and alteration of underground water levels -- to try to divine when,
where and how disastrous earthquakes occur, in the hope that someday,
seismologists will be able to forecast major quakes the same way they forecast
typhoons, Shin said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he went on, the CWB's earthquake prediction research has mainly
focused on observation and analysis of mass transfer and rock dilation of the
Earth's crust, as well as the short-term anomalies or dynamic tendencies of
underground water levels before major earthquakes.</P>
      <P>Since the devastating 921 Chi-Chi earthquake, the CWB has installed global
positioning  systems (GPS)  at 150 earthquake observation spots nationwide,
aimed at detecting crustal activities before and after major quakes.</P>
      <P>The weather bureau has also dug a deep well in Hualien, hoping that variations
in the underground water levels in the 300-meter well will tell when and how
earthquakes occur.</P>
      <P>So far, however, they have failed to obtain effective evidence provided by the
well to prove that variations in underground water levels have direct or
definite relationships to earthquakes, Shin noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he continued, the CWB has received many phone calls from enthusiastic
members of the public who claim to have an instinct for forecasting earthquakes.
In one case, he said, a man said he develops tinnitus prior to a major
earthquake. After quantitative verification, however, most of the predictions
have proved wrong.</P>
      <P>Aware that improper forecasting of a major earthquake based only on superstition
could trigger social anxiety or even instability, the CWB never makes any
temblor forecasts based on the "precognition" of an individual, Shin stressed.</P>
      <P>Many people have also shown great interest in animal precursors, Shin went on,
but pointed out that animal behavior can be altered by too many factors and so
far, no government in the world has made serious research on the relationship
between animal behavior and earthquakes.</P>
      <P>Besides the CWB, other research institutes have also been doing research on
earthquake precursors.</P>
      <P>According to Shin, the Institute of Earth Sciences under Academia Sinica has
established eight earthquake monitoring stations around the country since 1988
aimed at discerning the relationship between major earthquakes and geomagnetic
fluctuations.</P>
      <P>So far, they have not been able to determine the reasons behind geomagnetic
fluctuations and their physical mechanism, Shin said.</P>
      <P>Several leading local universities, including National Taiwan Central University
and National Taiwan University, have also set up task forces to research the
possibility of short-term earthquake prediction on the basis of electromagnetic
field variations under, on, or over the Earth's surface and near space.</P>
      <P>"Despite being an uphill battle, earthquake prediction research must go on,"
Shin concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan medical mission serves Tibetans in northwestern India</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New Delhi,  Aug. 2 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese medical delegation returned to the Indian capital of New Delhi
Saturday after concluding a week-long medical mission providing services to
Tibetans living in the mountainous northwestern region of India.</P>
      <P>The 36-member mission of the Taiwan Root Medical Peace Corps (TRMPC), composed
of six doctors in various fields, five dentists and three nurses, as well as
medical technicians and volunteers, left Dharamsala Friday and took a 12-hour
bus ride to New Delhi before heading home later that day.</P>
      <P>Liu Chi-chun, a dentist who served as head of the mission, said the group
managed to see 2,690 patients in Dharamsala over its seven-day mission.</P>
      <P>"The figure was far lower than that of the past years, " he said, however,
speculating that rainy weather might have put prospective patients off traveling
to seek medical attention.</P>
      <P>But he also noted that the lower patient turnout "could also mean that the
health of the Tibetans in the area has improved to a large degree."</P>
      <P>Liu said his mission arrived in Dharamsala, seat of the Tibetan government-in-
exile just as the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama was about to leave on
a trip to Europe.</P>
      <P>When his holiness heard of the arrival of the mission, however, he arranged a
meeting with them at his office and shook hands with each of the member to
express his appreciation for their work, Liu said.</P>
      <P>The TRMPC first visited Dharamsala in 2000, marking the beginning of the group's
annual visits to India ever since. As the Tibetans living in the northern region
suffer from a general lack of medical resources and health information, the
group has made its visits to the area a priority.</P>
      <P>In addition to Dharamsala, the group also visited Sikkim in northern India and
Darjeeling in northeastern India.</P>
      <P>The TRMPC, founded by Liu in 1995, is a private non-profit organization
dedicated to improving quality of life through provision of medical services and
health education.</P>
      <P>It believes that medical service should transcend national borders and exceed
the limitations of politics, race, and religion. It holds as its end goal a
united international community working in cooperation to bring about equitable
access of healthcare to all populations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Hypermarket helps promote local produce</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 2 (CNA)
08/02/09  19:10:39
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Unlike some of its rivals, which regularly host gala-like  sales to promote
imported produce,  one local hypermarket franchise has been cooperating with the
Council of Agriculture (COA) to push sales of local produce on a seasonal basis.</P>
      <P>The Far Eastern Ai Mai Group, which has since 2007 been cooperating with the COA
to push domestically produced agricultural products, has launched a series of
sales drives since July 21 this year to boost sales of freshly picked fruit and
vegetables.</P>
      <P>In one single week of promotion, the company's 15 branches islandwide sold
300,000 kg of fresh pears, guavas and lemons, mostly from southern Taiwan,
generating record high sales to the tune of NT$5 million (US$15,244), said the
franchise's marketing chief Chuang Chin-lung.</P>
      <P>"The sales drive marked a four-way victory for the government, the consumers and
the farmers, as well as for Far Eastern Ai Mai, " Chuang said.</P>
      <P>The drive was particularly welcomed because it helped alleviate the price
pressure that farmers have suffered due to abnormal weather in the first half of
this year, when too much sunshine and too little rain caused some crops to ripen
ahead of schedule or resulted in a glut of others.</P>
      <P>Touting "produce directly from the farms," the Far Eastern Ai Mai stores have
helped fruit growers in southern Pingtung and Kaohsiung counties by selling
lemons at NT$1 per fruit and guavas at NT$5, greatly easing the glut of these
fruits, Chuang said.</P>
      <P>From July 29-Aug. 8, a second sales drive was launched at the stores, promoting
signature agricultural products from the central county of Nantou, including
pork sausages made with shaohsing wine, as well as various kinds of mushrooms
cultivated in the area, he added.</P>
      <P>He said that by the end of the year, the chain will have promoted agricultural
products from 12 cities and counties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>World's 1st botanical product industry cluster shaping in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The world's first botanical product industry cluster is taking shape in southern
Taiwan's Pingtung Agricultural Biotechnology Park, which is now home to more
than 20 companies in the field, a Council of Agriculture (COA) official said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>With the global botanical products market growing rapidly, the official said,
the Cabinet-level council has made strenuous efforts to promote the development
of the industry in Taiwan over the past few years.</P>
      <P>"The role of botanical  products  is becoming increasingly important in the
global mainstream medical market and the industry is growing at an average
annual rate of more than 10 percent, " said the official.</P>
      <P>Noting that annual global sales of botanical products have already exceeded
US$60 billion, the official said Taiwan stands a good chance of excelling in
this domain, given its outstanding research achievements and plentiful research
capacity.</P>
      <P>The Pingtung agricultural park -- the COA's botanical product industry
development arm -- has for the last three years prioritized attracting companies
that use herbs and medicinal plants as their major raw materials to set up
production facilities there, the official said.</P>
      <P>"Thanks to our strenuous efforts, we have managed to persuade 22 such companies
to set up factories in the Pingtung park, " he went on, adding that the
companies manufacture a variety of products, including health supplements, skin
care products and animal feed additives.</P>
      <P>As local botanical product manufacturers tend to operate alone, they can have
difficulty upgrading their operational efficiency, a situation that prompted the
park administration to lobby those companies to pool their resources and form a
cooperative platform to enhance their operational efficiency and sharpen their
competitive edge.</P>
      <P>The official noted that the Taiwan Botanical Product Industry Union was
established in April this year to help union members cooperate in raw material
procurement,  technology development, product examination and certification, as
well as marketing and distribution.</P>
      <P>"Through the integration  of resources and cooperation  in research, development
and marketing, the Pingtung park is set to become the world's first and probably
only botanical product industry cluster, " the official said.</P>
      <P>He addd that the park administration has also set up various divisions to help
those companies with raw material supply, technology development, product
certification and marketing cooperation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Financial crisis hurts job market more than dotcom bubble: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  2 (CNA)
08/02/09  19:51:50
(By Y.L. Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The impact of the financial crisis on the local job market is even worse than
that caused by the dotcom bubble of 2000 and will take at least two years to
recover, the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's average unemployment rate in the first six months of this year reached
5.73 percent, up 1.86 percent from the same period of last year and exceeding
the 1.15-percent increase between the first half of 2001 and 2002 after the
dotcom bubble burst. The figures signal the even stronger impact of the
financial debacle on the job market, according to the CEPD.</P>
      <P>Men bore the brunt of the global financial turmoil because between January and
June, the average employment among male workers was down by 134,000, compared
with a decrease of 14,000 among females, the CEPD said.</P>
      <P>The unemployment rate is expected to continue rising in July and August when new
graduates enter the job market and will then begin to show signs of improvement
after September, when a global economic recovery is expected, according to the
CEPD.</P>
      <P>However, the CEPD predicted that the employment situation will not improve
greatly until the second quarter of 2010 at the earliest and said a booster shot
is needed to help with economic recovery if Taiwan aims to bring the
unemployment rate down to the average of 3.19 percent recorded in 2006 and 2007.</P>
      <P>The economy recorded a negative 2.17 percent growth in 2000 and the nation's
business cycle indicators flashed blue for the eighth straight time during the
period, as it suffered badly from the collapse of the dotcom bubble. It took
three quarters before the economy recovered from the recession and two years
before the employment market was restored to its previous level, according to
the CEPD.</P>
      <P>Reeling from the global financial crunch that began in the last half of 2008,
Taiwan's economy and gross domestic product (GDP) had both stayed in negative
territory for four quarters as of the second quarter of this year.</P>
      <P>As part of efforts to tackle unemployment, especially among middle-aged and
elderly people, the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) has urged job seekers in
those groups to find a new job before quitting their old one.</P>
      <P>Huang Meng-ju, head of a CLA-affiliated employment service center in central
Taiwan, attributed the relatively high unemployment rate among middle-aged and
elderly people to their general unwillingness to lower their expectations about
their jobs.</P>

      <P>Summer camp activities for local students will proceed as scheduled despite
confirmation of several influenza A(H1N1) cluster infections involving students
taking part in such programs, a Ministry of Education (MOE) official said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>"Influenza A(H1N1) is a category-four statutory communicable disease, just like
other forms of flu. Since no stricter regulations have been imposed on its
prevention, summer camp activities can go ahead as usual," said Wang Chun-chuan,
director of the MOE's Physical Education Department.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Wang went on, the ministry will ask students attending camp
activities to strengthen their health self-management.</P>
      <P>The ministry has been scheduled to organize up to 110 summer camp programs for
school students at various levels during this year's summer vacation, some of
which have already been going on for more than a month. Some participating
students have been involved in A(H1N1) cluster infections.</P>
      <P>Addressing rising concerns as to whether the summer camps should be suspended
because of fear of further infections, Wang said the ministry sees no need for
such a course of action, as long as the camping site environments are kept clean
and students maintain rigorous personal hygiene.</P>
      <P>He also reminded local parents that their children should not attend camp
activities if they develop flu symptoms, such as fever and sore throat.</P>
      <P>As to whether schools that offer summer courses for students should be closed
down if an A(H1N1) case is confirmed, Wang said the ministry has authorized
school authorities to decide on their own because summer courses are not formal
school days.</P>
      <P>When local schools reopen in September at the end of summer vacation, Wang said
that if there are still cluster infections arising, the ministry may announce
clear guidelines for school closure.</P>
      <P>As of Saturday, 12 A(H1N1) cluster infections have been confirmed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Former Department  of Helath Minister  Chen Chien-jen,  an epidemiologist,
warned in an interview with a local newspaper Friday that Taiwan is approaching
a stage where the A(H1N1) flu will spread quickly.</P>
      <P>"If we fail to intensify prevention efforts, a major outbreak could hit in late
September or October, the traditional flu peak season," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has so far confirmed six severe A(H1N1) cases, including one death. Based
on this figure, he said, Taiwan should have at least 10,000 such cases.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the government speed up purchases of anti-viral drugs and
vaccines to cope with any possible outbreak of the disease.</P>

for a two-day visit during which he will attend a forum on the prevention of
A(H1N1) infection and exchange views with members of the medical establishment
there, a DOH source said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The source made the remarks amid reports that Yeh will soon resign from his post
to run on a ruling Kuomintang ticket in the Hualien magistrate election.</P>
      <P>"Yeh's visit to Hong Kong was arranged a month ago and we have received no
instructions that the trip has been canceled, " the source continued.</P>
      <P>Yeh will depart for Hong Kong Tuesday and return the following day. During his
visit, he will speak on the outlook of medical and health cooperation between
Taiwan and Hong Kong, and will visit Princess Margaret Hospital and call on
Anthony Wu, chairman of Hospital Authority.</P>
      <P>Accompanying Yeh for his visit will be Huang Kun-chang, chief executive officer
of the Hospital Administration Commission under the DOH; Chen Wen-chung,
superintendent of Taoyuan General Hospital; and Chang Shen-chwen, vice
superintendent of National Taiwan University Hospital.</P>
      <P>Huang said that both Taiwan and Hong Kong have experienced A(H1N1) community and
cluster infections, and both also have reported one fatality from the new flu
strain.</P>
      <P>Princess Margaret Hospital and the Taoyuan General Hospital are both charged
with admitting potential sufferers of A(H1N1) that are detected at the
international airports on both sides, and both could share each other's
experiences of treating patients and preventing them from infecting others in
the hospital.</P>
      <P>Kuo Hsu-sung, director of the Centers of Disease Control, also under the DOH,
said the DOH is planning to sponsor an international symposium on A(H1N1) when
the flu situation stabilizes, and will invite experts from Hong Kong and the
United States to attend.</P>
      <P>However, if the situation continues to worsen, the DOH might not have time to
spare to sponsor such a gathering, Kuo added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan took part in the 2009 World Police and Fire Games in the Canadian city of
Vancouver under the name of Taiwan rather than Chinese Taipei which is normally
used at most international sports events.</P>
      <P>The National Police Agency under the Ministry of the Interior said in a press
release Monday that the 49-member team organized by the National Police Agency
and the National Fire Agency was led into the venue under the name of Taiwan,
while the flag of the Republic of China was flown at the opening ceremony July
31.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that the nation succeeded in breaking the tradition of
using the name Chinese Taipei as stipulated in an agreement it entered with the
International Olympic Committee in 1981, according to the press release.</P>
      <P>That terms of agreement, which also prevented Taiwan from displaying its flag at
the Olympics in return for China's approval of its participation, have since
become a pattern for Taiwan's participation in international sports events.</P>
      <P>The press release said the appearance of Taiwan's name plaque and flag at the
World Police and Fire Games caught the attention of the spectators, who gave the
Taiwan team a big round of applause at the opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>According to the National Police Agency, its persistent requests and those of
Taiwan's representative office in Vancouver, as well as the goodwill of the host
country, helped to achieve the use of the name Taiwan at the games.</P>
      <P>The biennial games, which started in 1985, has drawn more than 10,000 athletes
from 60 countries for competition in 65 events and will run until Aug. 9.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has so far taken part in 10 events at the games including judo, karate,
taekwondo, shooting, tug-of-war, tennis, golf, badminton, field and track and

      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait should sign an investment guarantee agreement
as soon as possible to resolve the many pending cross-strait investment
disputes, according to a Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) official.</P>
      <P>SEF Deputy Secretary-General Ma Shao-chang made the appeal at a seminar on
promoting cooperation between Taiwanese and Chinese small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs), which took place in Taipei Sunday.</P>
      <P>Noting that cross-strait investment is now a two-way flow since Taiwan has
opened its doors to Chinese capital, Ma said the two sides should negotiate and
sign an investment guarantee agreement soon to provide better protection for
investors from both sides.</P>
      <P>By providing a legal framework that clearly sets out investment norms and
protections on each side, a cross-strait investment guarantee accord will be
help to encourage greater bilateral investment flows, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Such an agreement usually includes principles of equitable treatment and non-
discrimination, compensation in the event of expropriation, free transfer of
funds, and mechanisms for settling disputes between investors and the state.</P>
      <P>In his keynote speech, Ma also mentioned barriers and bottlenecks faced by
Taiwanese companies operating in China.</P>
      <P>"One of the obstacles is the difficulty for Taiwanese companies to obtain
working capital," said the official from the SEF -- a quasi-official
intermediary body authorized to handle cross-strait negotiations in the absence
of formal ties.</P>
      <P>Small and medium-sized enterprises form the backbone of the Taiwan economy,
accounting for 98 percent of all companies. Taiwanese SMEs in China tend to be
denied access to bank loans because Chinese banks have a hard time verifying
their credit status, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"We hope this problem can be resolved after a bilateral memorandum of
understanding (MOU) on financial supervisory cooperation is signed," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Another problem Taiwanese companies face is the myriad kinds of taxes levied on
them by Chinese governments at various levels, Ma noted, adding that China
should offer more tax incentives to Taiwan companies through cross-strait
negotiations.</P>
      <P>The seminar brought together officials and business executives from the two
sides to discuss measures to promote cross-strait cooperation in SME development
and joint marketing efforts.</P>
      <P>Among the participants were Lai Shan-kuei, director of the Ministry  of Economic
Affairs'  Small  and Medium  Enterprise Administration and He Zuoxien, director
of the SME Bureau of China's Guangdong Province.</P>

      <P>A total of 86,268 traffic accidents that resulted in injuries or death were
recorded in the first six months of this year, a 5.3 percent rise from the same
period last year, according to a report released Monday by the Ministry of the
Interior.</P>
      <P>The figures translated into a year-on-year increase in the accident rate, from
39.4 to 40.9 cases per 10,000 vehicles, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>The ministry said that the increase reflected a 5.5 percent rise in the number
of accidents that involved the injury of passengers or motorists and deaths that
occurred more than 24 hours after the accident.</P>
      <P>However, the number of road users who died within 24 hours of an accident
declined by 10 percent, the ministry said. In that category, 19.7 percent of the
fatalities were caused by drunk-driving, 17.7 percent as result of drivers not
paying attention, and 12.5 percent because of drivers' failure to yield right of
way as stipulated in traffic regulations, the report stated.</P>
      <P>According to the report, two-wheeled vehicles are the most dangerous types of
transport, as 43.6 percent of road fatalities involved riders of bicycles,
motorcycles or scooters. The road fatality rate involving cars was 27.3 percent
and trucks 17.6 percent, the report showed.</P>
      <P>The statistics showed that most fatal accidents -- 11.36 percent -- occurred
between 6: 00 p.m. and 8: 00 p.m., while 9.61 percent occurred between 6: 00
a.m. and 8: 00 a.m., and 9.09 percent between 12 noon and 2:00 p.m.</P>
      <P>In terms of the areas where most fatal traffic accidents occur, Pingtung County
was at the top of the list with 78 deaths in 77 accidents, followed by Tainan
County with 76 deaths in 75 accidents, and Taichung County, with 72 deaths in 70
accidents, the report stated.</P>

      <P>The Taxation Agency under the Ministry of Finance convened a meeting Monday to
discuss a proposal to introduce a "green tax" in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Once a green taxation policy is crafted by the administration and passed by the
legislature, the government will be able to levy on high energy use and
environmental pollution as part of its efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions,
a Taxation Agency official said.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that the meeting will yield preliminary consensus on the direction,
parameters and details of the proposed green tax, the official said.</P>
      <P>The meeting was attending by officials from the Ministry of Finance, including
Finance Minister Lee Sush-der, academics from research think tanks and
representatives from the industrial sector.</P>
      <P>According to a Taxation Agency plan, the energy tax will be tied to the
production and consumption of fossil and nuclear energy, while the environment
tax will target the production of greenhouse gas emissions and pollution of the
air, surface and underground water, land, and the ocean.</P>
      <P>Daigee Shaw, president of the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research, said
that the green tax should be based on a "users and polluters  pay"  principle
and designed  to encourage  energy conservation  while granting incentives to
those who meet the specified targets.</P>
      <P>Shaw said the green taxation system that his think tank is proposing is not
meant to increase taxes on the public, but rather is a two-pronged strategy for
improving environmental protection and simplifying the taxation system.</P>
      <P>Under a "financially independent" model, added revenues that the government
collects via the green taxation system would be used to finance the overhaul of
outdated taxation systems, the operations of mass rapid transport systems and
research on energy conservation and emission reduction, he added.</P>
      <P>He estimated that the green tax will help cut carbon dioxide emissions by 19.67
million tons within one year and by 78 million tons within 10 years.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese youth delegation will leave for Israel soon to attend an
international ecology and leadership summer program for young people, the Israel
Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei (ISECO) said Monday.</P>
      <P>At the invitation of the Taipei-based Israeli office, five young people with
volunteering background in animal or environmental protection will participate
in the international youth exchange program, which is being organized by
Israel's National Council for Youth Exchange.</P>
      <P>The ISECO said in a press release that the program will focus on the themes of
ecology and youth leadership, and will feature workshops, adventure, ecological
and cultural activities, and trips to Israel's museums and popular tourist
attractions.</P>
      <P>The program is scheduled to be held Aug. 9-16 in Hakefar-Hayarok (Green Village)
and will serve as a platform for cultural exchanges among the participants, the
office said.</P>
      <P>The five members of the Taiwanese delegation were recommended by Taiwan's
National Youth Commission (NYC).</P>
      <P>They are Chang Hsin-yu from National Chengchi University's Department of Arabic
Language and Literature; Cheng Yu-shun from National Taiwan University's
Department of Geography; Lin Yun from Taipei Municipal First GirlsSenior High
School; Chen Wan-shiuan, a volunteer with the Taiwan Environmental Information

      <P>The youth group will be led by Professor Kuo Shou-wang from Shih Chien
University's Department of Applied Foreign Languages.</P>
      <P>All accommodation costs will be covered by the Israeli Youth Council, the ISECO
said.</P>
      <P>In a meeting  with  the delegation  last  week,  Israel's Representative to
Taiwan Raphael Gamzou gave a short introduction of Israel and the program.</P>
      <P>He also shared with the students his and his wife's experience in joining some

      <P>"I hope that the success of this trip will help to promote the signing of a

      <P>The Tourism Bureau said Monday that seminars were held last week in 10 of
Taiwan's foreign offices, as part of the bureau's efforts to seek creative ways
of promoting the country's tourism.</P>
      <P>According to the Tourism Bureau, the three-day seminars took place July 29 in
the Foreign Ministry's representative offices in Tokyo, Osaka, Seoul, Hong Kong,
Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Frankfurt.</P>
      <P>"The seminars were geared toward finding creative ways to promote tourism
products in Taiwan through brainstorming, analyzing market information, and
taking into consideration the specific needs of each of the overseas areas," the
bureau said in a press release.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau invited the heads of the 10 offices to analyze the
preferences of each of the foreign cities and come up with better promotion
ideas.</P>
      <P>The meeting discussed topics such as how to attract tourists from emerging
markets and how to develop the Taiwan market for bicycle and leisure tours.</P>
      <P>"The participants at the seminars all expressed confidence in the revival of the
tourism market in the later half of the year, anticipating that the economic
situation will improve and more people will start traveling again as the global
outbreak of H1N1 influenza becomes milder," according to the bureau.</P>
      <P>The Tokyo office noted that from January to June, the number of Japanese
traveling abroad was down by 37.1 percent compared to the same period last year,
and the number of Japanese tourists to Taiwan was down by 4 percent in that
period.</P>
      <P>Many new programs, such as the "good luck tours" and packages with culinary
themes, targeting Japanese tourists will be launched in 2010, which has been
designated as Taiwan-Japan tourism exchange year, the office said.</P>
      <P>The Los Angeles office said that it will develop "stop over" tour packages and
cooperate with other Asian countries to encourage tourists to China to include
Taiwan on their itinerary.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan launched a NT$30 billion program in April in an effort to
turn Taiwan into a regional tourism hub that could generate NT$550 billion
(US$16.5 billion) in tourism revenue in four years and help create 400,000 jobs
in the tourism industry by 2012.</P>
      <P>The government has set a goal of 4.1 million foreign tourist arrivals in 2009,
4.5 million in 2010, 5 million in 2011 and 5.5 million in 2012.</P>

      <P>Taiwan slaughtered China 13-1 Monday in the 25th Asian Baseball Championship in
Sapporo, Japan, wiping out agrievance resulting from humiliating defeats to
China in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and World Baseball Classic in March.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese brought into full play their ability against the Chinese, making
three homeruns and 14 hits.</P>
      <P>Chinese Taipei opened the scoring with two points in the first inning, thanks to
a wild pitch by China's starter Lu Jiangang and a second-base hit by Taiwan's
Lin Hung-yu.</P>
      <P>They scored another point in the second inning thanks to several defensive
mistakes by the Chinese players.</P>
      <P>In the third inning, Chinese Taipei began a powerful offensive, scoring another
six points by the end of that inning.</P>
      <P>By the fourth inning, Taiwan had a seemingly unassailable 9: 0 lead over China,
made even stronger when Liu Chien-chung scored with a hit in the fifth.</P>
      <P>By the sixth inning, the Taiwanese lions of the field had secured a decisive
lead of 11-1 against China before finishing in the seventh inning 13-1 after Wu
Tsung-chun struck a two-point homerun.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese baseballers had been striving to even the score after unexpected
losses in recent years to Chinese teams, which are regarded as having much less
experience than the Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>Chinese Taipei beat South Korea 5-4 Saturday in the championships that opened
that day in Hokkaido, capital of Sapporo Prefecture in northern Japan.</P>

      <P>China Times: Deaflympics in Taipei should be as successful as World Games in
Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The success of the Kaohsiung World Games undoubtedly has brought pressure to
bear on Taipei City, which will host the Deaflympics Sept. 5-15.</P>
      <P>Since the The World Games was opened by President Ma Ying-jeou in his capacity
of the country's head, people are sure to expect the organizing committee of the
Taipei Deaflympics to follow suit.</P>
      <P>We are not certain that Taipei can do this, as the Deaflympics organizing
committee has claimed that it follows the rules of the International Olympic
Committee, in which Taiwan uses the name Chinese Taipei rather than the Republic
of China.</P>
      <P>It suggested that Ma probably will not be able to preside over the opening of
the Deaflympics as he did at the World Games.</P>
      <P>But we do not see why Taipei cannot do what Kaohsiung could, and the public will
brook no excuse if Taipei fails to do this.</P>
      <P>United Daily News: Ex-president's ill-gotten wealth should be confiscated.</P>
      <P>Ex-President Chen Shui-bian's ill-gotten wealth is estimated at about NT$2
billion, most of which is salted away in banks overseas.</P>
      <P>Whether justice is done in the case involving Chen and his family will be judged
not only by what punishments the court hands down but also by whether their ill-
gotten gains are confiscated.</P>
      <P>We urge the court of appeal to take this into consideration when it considers
whether to release Chen Shui-bian on bail.</P>

      <P>Artie and Julie, a picture book written and illustrated by Taiwanese author Chen
Chih-yuan, has been selected as one of 10 notable children's books of 2009 by a
U.S. teachers organization, a publishing source said Monday.</P>
      <P>The English-language book about two friends -- Artie the lion and Julie the
rabbit -- has been selected one of the top notable children's books by the
prestigious Children's Literature Assembly under the U.S. National Council of
Teachers of English (NCTE) for its Notables Award, according to Heryin
Publishing Co., which published the Chinese edition of Artie and Julie in 2006.</P>
      <P>Artie and Julie will be featured, along with 29 other notable children's books,
at the NCTE Convention slated for November this year and at the International
Reading Association (IRA) Convention in 2010, as well as in the Autumn 2009
edition of the Journal of Children's Literature, said Chou Yih-fen, editor-in-
chief of Heryin Books Inc.</P>
      <P>The 30 titles, which include works of fiction, non-fiction, poetry and picture
books written for children, demonstrate uniqueness in the use of language or
style, involve word play, word origins, or the history of language, and invite
child response or participation, according to the NCTE assembly.</P>
      <P>Having received glowing reviews from the U.S.-based Kirkus Reviews, the English
edition of Artie and Julie, published in the United States last year, was
introduced as "a good book worthy of having," according to Chou.</P>
      <P>So far, Chen, 34, has six illustrated children's books to his name, including
Guji Guji, On My Way to Buy Eggs, The Featherless Chicken and The Best Christmas
Ever.</P>
      <P>He is also the only Chinese writer and illustrator to have repeatedly won
international recognition for his work, including a best children's book award
presented by the U.S. Publishers Weekly in 2003 and a best children's book award
presented by the Japan Library Association in 2006.</P>

      <P>The Taipei District Court upheld a ruling Monday in which it refused to lift an
overseas travel ban on former President Chen Shui-bian's daughter, Chen Hsing-
yu.</P>
      <P>The ruling, however, said that Chen Hsing-yu could file for permission to go
abroad in the event of an absolute necessity.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court will hold another pre-trial court hearing on her
travel ban Aug. 13, according to the ruling.</P>
      <P>In the course of investigating perjury charges against Chen Hsing-yu in
connection with a case against the former president, prosecutors imposed an
overseas travel ban on the former first daughter June 23.</P>
      <P>She later appealed the ruling, so a panel of three judges at the district court
decided to hold a pre-trial court hearing to decide whether to remove or uphold
the travel ban.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors indicted Chen Hsing-yu on perjury charges July 17. Also indicted in
the case were her husband Chao Chien-ming and her younger brother Chen Chih-
chung.</P>
      <P>Her mother, former first lady Wu Shu-jen, was also charged with coercing her
children to give false testimony in the corruption case against the former
president.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors of the Special Investigation Division of the Supreme Prosecutors
Office found inconsistencies in the testimony given in May by Chen Chih-chung,
Chen Hsing-yu and Chao Chien-ming during their probe into the former president's
alleged misuse of public funds during his term in office from 2000 through May
2008.</P>
      <P>The indictment said the three lied to prosecutors when they claimed that
receipts they provided to Wu to claim reimbursement from the president's special
state affairs fund were for gifts they had bought for their parents.</P>
      <P>Despite the indictment, prosecutors from the Taipei District Prosecutors Office
have asked the court to treat them leniently because they admitted to perjury.</P>
      <P>Wu also confessed that she urged her children to give false testimony to cover
up her offenses.</P>
      <P>Wu was indicted on corruption charges in November 2006 in a separate case, but
prosecutors have not sought to detain the wheelchair-bound former first lady.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian has been detained since last December on charges of corruption,
money laundering and embezzlement -- crimes he is accused of committing during
his presidency. The former president has insisted on his innocence, claiming
that "history will clear his name."</P>
      <P>The court is scheduled to hand down a ruling on his case Sept. 11.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Govt to promote ecology tours on two outlying islands</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 3 (CNA)
08/03/09  19:00:44
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) has decided to
promote ecological tours on two offshore islands, the Tourism Bureau said
Monday.</P>
      <P>One of them, Green Island, is a small volcanic island located 33 kilometers off
the coast of eastern Taiwan's Taitung County. The other, Hsiao Liuchiu, is a
tiny coral islet off the coast of southern Pingtung County.</P>
      <P>Both islands hold some of the most beautiful scenery in Taiwan, but development,
including tourism development, in recent years has led to some environmental
damages. For example, snorkelers have damaged some of the coral reef on Green
Island by stepping on them. Overfishing and local restaurants' ability to sell
coral reef fish, have also led to a reduction in that type of fish, which live
in coral reefs and make the reefs more beautiful. Divers have reported there are
far less fish than in the past.</P>
      <P>Local environmental protection groups have been urging the government to do
something about these problems.</P>
      <P>By turning the islands into ecology-focused tourism destinations, the government
hopes to reduce harm to the islands.</P>
      <P>"The Tourism Bureau has mapped out strategies to promote ecological tours, such
as promotion of the use of low-CO2 emission transportation tools and energy-
saving equipment, as well as public education," the bureau said in a press
statement.</P>
      <P>It is unclear, however, whether such measures will work. On Green Island, the
local office of the Tourism Bureau has said it has tried to encourage tourists
to ride bicycles instead of hiring cars and scooters, but few tourists do so and
there is little promotion of eco-friendly ways of sightseeing on the island or
on the boats taking tourists to the island.</P>
      <P>Sometimes, thousands of tourists rent scooters and zip through Green Island's
roads in packs, changing the quiet, rustic atmosphere of the island.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Liuchiu is less developed than Green Island.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau's plans for the two islands are part of a larger plan to
boost tourism in Taiwan in the next few years.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan launched a NT$30 billion-budget program in April in an effort
to turn Taiwan into a tourism hub in East Asia that could generate NT$550
billion (US$16.8 billion) in tourism revenue in four years and help create
400,000 jobs in the tourism industry by 2012.</P>
      <P>The government hopes to achieve at least 4.1 million foreign tourist arrivals in
2009, 4.5 million in 2010, 5 million in 2011 and 5.5 million in 2012.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts, the Tourism Bureau plans to divide the country into four
major regions featuring different themes to cater to the different tastes of
tourists from around the world.</P>
      <P>To promote northern Taiwan, the bureau will feature lifestyle aspects such as
the arts, pop music and fashion. Tea and flower gardens will be the main focus
of the bureau when it introduces central Taiwan to potential tourists, while
historic monuments will be the major attraction in its efforts to promote
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The slow pace of life in eastern Taiwan will be capitalized on with an emphasis
on bicycle riding tours and the cultures of indigenous tribes in the area, while
the offshore counties of Penghu and Kinmen will be promoted as international
resort islands and as the location of Cold War military relics, respectively.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Safety of H1N1 vaccine guaranteed as production set to begin</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The sole Taiwanese producer of a vaccine for the swine flu guaranteed Monday
that its product will be safe and effective as it was gearing up to begin mass
production of the yet untested formula.</P>
      <P>"Mass production of the vaccine against influenza A (H1N1) for local use will
get underway Tuesday with procedures precisely following international
standards," said Ignatius Wei, deputy CEO and president  of Adimmune  Corp.,
Taiwan's  only  human  vaccine manufacturer.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will be the world's 12th country to produce a swine flu vaccine, Wei
said.</P>
      <P>Although  this will be the first time that Adimmune  has manufactured flu
vaccines, Wei said the company has plenty of experience in producing vaccines
for humans.</P>
      <P>It is currently one of the major suppliers of vaccines for Japanese encephalitis
and tetanus for use in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The partially state-owned company has chosen the seed virus provided by a World
Health Organization (WHO) -authorized lab in New York for mass production of the
vaccine, Wei said.</P>
      <P>The company began animal trials of the vaccine in mid-July, and the Adimmune
president said initial test results have been good.</P>
      <P>"Animal trials have proven the safety and effectiveness of our products, with no
lab animal showing any apparent side effects," Wei said.</P>
      <P>Human trials will begin in October,  with National Taiwan University Hospital
taking charge of the project.</P>
      <P>Only 200 volunteers will have to undergo tests, Wei said. The WHO has agreed to
the unusually small sampling size for all swine flu vaccine producers, in part
because it is simply a flu vaccine and not a new drug.</P>
      <P>As to the company's production capacity, Wei said Adimmune will be able to
produce more than 200,000 doses per day.</P>
      <P>The company on Monday attempted to dispel misgivings about its ability to
produce safe and effective flu vaccines for human use under time pressure.</P>
      <P>Ho Mei-hsiang, an Academia Sinica biomedical research fellow who concurrently
heads Adimmune's R&amp;D department, said using chicken egg embryos to produce
flu vaccines is not new and instead a mature technology that has been in use for
more than half a century.</P>
      <P>"Like vaccines against seasonal flu, those against swine flu are also being
produced with chicken egg embryos and using the same technology, " Ho said.</P>
      <P>She stressed that the company will strictly follow international norms and
procedures in the production process.</P>
      <P>"Any doses that fail to meet the standards will not be marketed," she insisted.</P>
      <P>Before they get to market, the vaccines first have to undergo 24 kinds of tests
within six weeks before they are presented to the Department of Health for
approval to start human trials.</P>
      <P>If the vaccine passes human trials without problems, it still needs to be
certified by the DOH's Bureau of Pharmaceutical Affairs before being used on
patients, Ho explained.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has so far reported six severe A (H1N1) cases, including one death from
the flu strain. As of Saturday, 12 H1N1 cluster infections, involving about 600
people, had also been confirmed.</P>
      <P>Former DOH Minister Chen Chien-jen, an epidemiologist, warned in an interview
with a local newspaper last Friday that Taiwan is approaching a stage where the
A(H1N1) flu will spread quickly.</P>
      <P>"If we fail to intensify prevention efforts, a major outbreak could hit in late
September or October, the traditional flu peak season," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the government speed up purchases of anti-viral drugs and
vaccines to cope with any possible outbreak of the disease.</P>
      <P>DOH officials said the department plans to purchase up to 10 million doses of
swine flu vaccine to meet domestic demand.</P>
      <P>The DOH has ordered 5 million doses of the vaccine from Adimmune Corp. and has
formed a special task force to monitor progress in vaccine research and
development for the H1N1 flu strain.</P>
      <P>If necessary, the officials said, the DOH will seek foreign supplies to make up
for deficiency.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Legislature suggests making IPR protection an ECFA issue</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan has recently suggested listing intellectual property rights
(IPR) protection in a planned cross-Taiwan Strait Economic Cooperation Framework
Agreement (ECFA) , as IPR disputes involving Taiwanese businessmen operating in
China are often reported.</P>
      <P>The Legislature's Organic Laws and Statutes Bureau brought up the proposal in
its latest report on China's existing IPR laws and their effect on Taiwanese
businessmen with operations there.</P>
      <P>The report attributed the occurrence of most legal disputes in the Chinese
market to be related to patents,  trademarks and copyrights held by Taiwanese
businesses, as the value of IPR has never been treated as an asset in China and
Taiwanese businessmen there have never been able to map out IPR protection
strategies.</P>
      <P>The report also said "protectionism" is the greatest hurdle facing Taiwanese
investors doing business in China.</P>
      <P>Moreover, it pointed out that while the two sides have different patent laws,
China has a lack of experience and technique in handling patent disputes. The
Chinese authorities therefore are often seen as inefficient in protecting
Taiwanese businesses' IPR interests, the report said.</P>
      <P>The report, therefore, suggested building an "IPR forum Web site" for Taiwanese
businessmen operating in China that can serve as a platform for information and
opinion exchanges on IPR issues, as well as a place where people can have their
questions on IPR answered.</P>
      <P>The report also suggested placing the issue of opening offices in charge of
cross-strait IPR disputes on the agenda of the planned fourth round of talks
between Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF),
and Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), which is slated for later this year.</P>
      <P>Another option would be to include in the proposed ECFA the issue of having
regular cross-strait exchanges of personnel responsible for patent and trademark
review affairs and cross-strait cooperation in fighting counterfeiting, forgery
and pirating, the report said.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are the two intermediary bodies founded to handle issues
concerning cross-strait exchanges in the absence of official ties.</P>

      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yeh Ching-chuan announced Monday that he
will run for the magisterial seat in the eastern county of Hualien after his
resignation request was approved by Premier Liu Chao-shiuan earlier that day.</P>
      <P>His resignation, which comes at a time when the country is facing mounting fears
over a potential swine flu epidemic, has drawn</P>
      <P>criticism from lawmakers of both the ruling and opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Yeh was scheduled to hold a press conference later in the day to respond to the
criticism, and will stick with his plan to visit Hong Kong later in the week to
attend a forum on the prevention of A(H1N1) infection  and exchange  views  with
members  of the medical establishment there.</P>
      <P>In order to secure the KMT's nomination, he will have to compete in party
primaries with other party members including Legislator Fu Kun-chi, Hualien
County Council Speaker Yang Wen-chi, Hualien Mayor Tsai Chi-ta and former
Hualien County Agricultural Development Office Director Tu Li-hua, who have also
registered with the party to participate in the primary.</P>
      <P>Yeh, the country's first health minister to take part in the World Health
Assembly (WHA) , said he hopes the KMT will retain its control of Hualien County
and that he will support the winner of the primary if he does not get the
nomination.</P>
      <P>Yeh, once an adjunct professor at Hualien's Tzu Chi University, has lived in the
eastern county for 10 years.</P>
      <P>His decision scotched rumors that the KMT leadership was hoping Yeh would run

Taipei City.</P>
      <P>A hero of the SARS crisis of 2003 when he was deputy mayor of Taipei, Yeh
announced his participation in the Taipei mayoral primary three years ago but

      <P>A signal from a track switch on Taiwan's high-speed railway malfunctioned Monday
between Yunlin and Chiayi, resulting in the cancellation of seven trains in
order to accommodate two-way traffic on a single track.</P>
      <P>The glitch occurred at 4: 40 p.m. and was repaired two hours later, Taiwan High
Speed Rail Corp. said.</P>
      <P>It was the railway's second mechanical failure in three days. On Saturday, five
trains were canceled and 20 others delayed due to a similar problem that hit the
railway between Miaoli and Yuanli in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Even before the cause of Saturday's malfunction was determined, the track switch
on the railway's Huwei section in Yunlin County failed to send a signal to the
traffic control center at nearby Chiayi Station as usual Monday evening.</P>
      <P>When such a glitch occurs, the control center has to bar any train from passing
that section, a spokesman for Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp.'s Chiayi Station said</P>
      <P>"As a result, the Chiayi-Yunlin section was only able to maintain a 'single-
track, two-way' service mode," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Monday's signal malfunction led to the cancellation of seven trains and more
than 30-minute delays to many others, the company said.</P>
      <P>Including Monday's malfunction, 22 signal malfunctions have hit the railway
since its inauguration two and a half years ago.</P>
      <P>Chu Hsu, director-general of the Bureau of Taiwan High Speed Rail under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications  which oversees THSRC operations,
said Monday that the high frequency of switch malfunctions is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Chu has directed the company to intensify its maintenance routine and conduct an
overall review of its design and installation procedures to get to the root
cause of the problem and make the necessary improvements.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan workers on unpaid leave sharply down in July</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 3 (CNA)
08/03/09  21:14:32
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of Taiwanese workers remaining on unpaid leave dropped by late July,
the Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) reported Monday about a
practice taken by some local firms to cope with the economic downturn.</P>
      <P>A total of 74,468 workers remained on unpaid leave as of the end of July, down
by 5,499 people compared to the figure recorded as of July 15, the CLA said.</P>
      <P>Early March was the time when the number of Taiwanese workers put on mandatory
unpaid leave peaked -- at 238,975, which is more than triple the current figure,
according to the CLA.</P>
      <P>Since March,  the monthly  figure had started to steadily decreased. The number
of workers on unpaid leave at the end of June was 126,175.</P>
      <P>While not commenting on whether the reduced number of workers on unpaid leave
was an indication that the worst was over for Taiwan's economy, CLA officials
did say that a steadfast rebound in orders placed by foreign buyers for local
companies was a factor.</P>
      <P>As of the end of last month, 655 enterprises still had employees on unpaid
leave, but that was a fall from 704 for the first half of the same month.</P>
      <P>After the global financial crisis broke out late last year, the CLA has since
January required local enterprises to report the number of workers they have
asked to take unpaid leave, to better monitor the impact of the sagging economy
and falling exports on Taiwan's labor market.</P>
      <P>About 202,000 Taiwanese workers have been put by their company on mandatory
furlough since December 2008, due to their companies' bad business performance,
with those in the high-tech sector making up the bulk of the companies using
this practice.</P>
      <P>The practice stirred debate. While employers say it gives them the flexibility
of having staff readily available when business improved, labor rights groups
have criticized the move because it spares the companies from paying the workers
severance pay if they were to layoff the employees, and the employees lost a
chunk of their income.</P>
      <P>Some employees were put on unpaid leave for at least a couple of days a month,
while others had to take several days off a month. Many employees, however, were
grateful to keep their jobs.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Benefiting from higher passenger traffic during the 2009 World Games, the
Kaohsiung mass rapid transport system took in more than NT$100 million (US$3.05
million) in revenue in July, the most it has collected in any single month in
its history.</P>
      <P>The system also set a monthly record by transporting 4.4 million passengers in
July, up from 3.8 million in May and 3.1 million in June, said Huang I-chung,
the director of the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp.'s (KRTC's) Public Affairs
Department.</P>
      <P>During the 11-day World Games, which ran from July 16-26, an average of 150,000
passengers rode Kaohsiung's MRT lines on weekdays and 190,000 took the trains on
weekends, Huang added.</P>
      <P>The record revenue in July was calculated based on the assumption that each
passenger paid an average fare of NT$24 per ride.</P>
      <P>Since beginning commercial runs in April 2008 after a month-long free trial run,
the MRT has totaled revenues of between NT$80 million and NT$90 million a month,
Huang said.</P>
      <P>Monthly revenue had never previously surpassed NT$100 million, even when KRTC
offered incentives to push up ridership numbers, he said.</P>
      <P>Despite July's encouraging numbers, however, the company does not expect they
will substantially ease its financial woes. KRTC posted an estimated loss of
NT$1.2 billion in the first half of the year and it expects to lose NT$2.5
billion for the year, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said interest on loans to construct the line and depreciation on
equipment are the company's biggest burdens, costing a total of about NT$2.2
billion annually.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Consumption vouchers will definitely raise GDP by 0.66%: CEPD</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's consumption voucher program will definitely help boost the country's
annual gross domestic product (GDP) by at least 0.66 percent, the government's
top economic planner reaffirmed Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Tain-jy, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD), made the assertion in response to a recent report by the Ministry of
Audit under the watchdog Control Yuan, which questioned the voucher program's
effectiveness in stimulating the sluggish economy.</P>
      <P>"It remains to be seen whether the NT$85.7 billion consumption voucher program
can live up to its goal of stimulating economic growth given its high
substitution rate and issuance cost, " the ministry said in its report.</P>
      <P>Chen said the CEPD has commissioned Academia Sinica -- Taiwan's foremost
research institute -- to evaluate the effects of the consumption vouchers
program.</P>
      <P>Citing an initial report by the Academia Sinica's research team, Chen said the
consumption voucher "substitution rate" was between 60 percent and 70 percent.</P>
      <P>That means that 60 percent to 70 percent of the vouchers used by consumers
replaced purchases they would have made anyway, with the rest additional
spending.</P>
      <P>"Such a ratio reflects normal consumption activities and by no means implies
that the program had a poor effect," Chen explained.</P>
      <P>Judging from consumption patterns during the Lunar New Year holiday and retail
sales volume for the period, Chen said he was 100 percent sure that the
consumption voucher program will boost GDP growth by an estimated 0.66 percent.</P>
      <P>Chen, however, acknowledged another of the report's criticisms -- that the
program  was too rushed,  possibly  diminishing  its effectiveness.</P>
      <P>He attributed  the haste in issuing the vouchers  to the government's desire to
take advantage of the Chinese New Year shopping spree.</P>
      <P>The government issued the consumption vouchers with a face value of NT$3,600 per
set before the Lunar New Year holiday in January in an attempt to boost slumping
domestic economy amid a global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>To date, most of the consumption vouchers have been distributed and cashed in,
CEPD officials said, adding that the council is scheduled to present a
comprehensive assessment report to the Legislative Yuan in October.</P>
      <P>All consumption vouchers must be used by the end of September.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Water supply in Taoyuan area may be further rationed</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) could further cut or suspend water
supply to selected sectors in the northern county of Taoyuan if the current dry
spell continues, an official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Because of lower-than-usual rainfall this summer, the water level in the Shihmen
Reservoir -- the major source of potable water in the Taoyuan area -- has been
falling rapidly and is approaching an alarmingly low level.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Huang Chung-chiou said the water supply has
been cut during off-peak hours in the area.</P>
      <P>"If the drought gets worse, we will not rule out the possibility of rationing
the supply of water to certain heavy water-consuming services, such as car
washes, spas, swimming pools and tall-building cleaning services, " Huang said,
adding that the new restrictions may be announced Aug. 11.</P>
      <P>To encourage water conservation, Huang said, the MOEA's Water Resources Agency
(WRA) plans to offer subsidies for those who buy water-efficient appliances or
equipment, just as the government has done in the past to encourage the purchase
of energy-efficient home appliances.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan will visit the Shihmen Reservoir
Tuesday to decide if any measures need to be taken immediately to cope with the
continuing dry spell.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, WRA Deputy Director-General Wu Yueh-hsi said that if no rain falls in
the Taoyuan area in the coming days. the agency may further restrict water
supply for agricultural use from late August.</P>
      <P>Water supply for irrigation in the Taoyuan area has been cut by 30 percent since
July, Wu said, adding that if necessary, irrigation water supply may be
suspended from late August in order to ensure that water supply for household
and industrial use will not be rationed until late October.</P>
      <P>Similar water shortage problems are also troubling southern Taiwan, with major
reservoirs in the region drying out due to limited precipitation.</P>
      <P>Wu said his agency will immediately impose a rationing system in Tainan and
Penghu counties where water supply for household use at night will be cut and
water for irrigation purposes will be provided based on a "10 days on, five days
off" supply model.</P>
      <P>He also urged local residents to minimize water consumption in the face of
Taiwan's prolonged drought.</P>

      <P>An aboriginal delegation will visit China later this month in a bid to help
boost the economic prospects of Taiwan's indigenous peoples.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kao Chin Su-mei of the Nonpartisan Solidarity Union will lead the
delegation to visit Beijing and Yunnan province in southwestern China Aug.
19-27, her office director said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chang  Chun-chieh  said this will be the first aboriginal delegation to visit
China since the two sides of the Taiwan Strait began exchanges more than two
decades ago.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin's delegation will exchange views with related Chinese government
agencies on issues that have long concerned indigenous peoples.</P>
      <P>China is expected to announce measures to help the visitors, such as donation
for the construction of "hope" elementary schools, an idea first initiated by
Taiwanese in China, as well as a program to help aboriginal dropouts.</P>
      <P>The delegation  will also ask China to include indigenous communities in the
itineraries of Chinese tourists and help sell agricultural produce grown by
Taiwan's indigenous peoples to help them improve their incomes, Chang added.</P>
      <P>He said it as "quite a pity" that when Chinese tourists visit Sun Moon Lake and
Alishan, they do not have the chance to visit indigenous villages near these
scenic spots.</P>
      <P>He said aboriginal culture forms a major part of local culture, and if Chinese
tourists could observe indigenous communities, they would understand the real
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Taiwan External Trade Development Council recently discussed
the purchase of handicrafts  made by local indigenous peoples while meeting with
Chinese procurement groups in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The delegation hopes to further discuss the issue with China's Ministry of
Commerce on the overall purchase proposal and amount, hoping that China can
systematically introduce handicrafts from Taiwan's indigenous peoples and
establish a marketing network there.</P>
      <P>A traditional eight-part Bunun chorus will travel with the delegation, and it is
expected to meet with the Dai and Na Xi tribes in Yunnan province in
southwestern China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Legislature suggests making IPR protection an ECFA issue</HEADLINE>

08/03/09  19:33:47

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan has recently suggested listing intellectual property rights
(IPR) protection in a planned cross-Taiwan Strait Economic Cooperation Framework
Agreement (ECFA) , as IPR disputes involving Taiwanese businessmen operating in
China are often reported.</P>
      <P>The Legislature's Organic Laws and Statutes Bureau brought up the proposal in
its latest report on China's existing IPR laws and their effect on Taiwanese
businessmen with operations there.</P>
      <P>The report attributed the occurrence of most legal disputes in the Chinese
market to be related to patents,  trademarks and copyrights held by Taiwanese
businesses, as the value of IPR has never been treated as an asset in China and
Taiwanese businessmen there have never been able to map out IPR protection
strategies.</P>
      <P>The report also said "protectionism" is the greatest hurdle facing Taiwanese
investors doing business in China.</P>
      <P>Moreover, it pointed out that while the two sides have different patent laws,
China has a lack of experience and technique in handling patent disputes. The
Chinese authorities therefore are often seen as inefficient in protecting
Taiwanese businesses' IPR interests, the report said.</P>
      <P>The report, therefore, suggested building an "IPR forum Web site" for Taiwanese
businessmen operating in China that can serve as a platform for information and
opinion exchanges on IPR issues, as well as a place where people can have their
questions on IPR answered.</P>
      <P>The report also suggested placing the issue of opening offices in charge of
cross-strait IPR disputes on the agenda of the planned fourth round of talks
between Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF),
and Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), which is slated for later this year.</P>
      <P>Another option would be to include in the proposed ECFA the issue of having
regular cross-strait exchanges of personnel responsible for patent and trademark
review affairs and cross-strait cooperation in fighting counterfeiting, forgery
and pirating, the report said.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are the two intermediary bodies founded to handle issues
concerning cross-strait exchanges in the absence of official ties.</P>

      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yeh Ching-chuan announced Monday that he
will run for the magisterial seat in the eastern county of Hualien after his
resignation request was approved by Premier Liu Chao-shiuan earlier that day.</P>
      <P>His resignation, which comes at a time when the country is facing mounting fears
over a potential swine flu epidemic, has drawn</P>
      <P>criticism from lawmakers of both the ruling and opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Yeh was scheduled to hold a press conference later in the day to respond to the
criticism, and will stick with his plan to visit Hong Kong later in the week to
attend a forum on the prevention of A(H1N1) infection  and exchange  views  with
members  of the medical establishment there.</P>
      <P>In order to secure the KMT's nomination, he will have to compete in party
primaries with other party members including Legislator Fu Kun-chi, Hualien

Hualien County Agricultural Development Office Director Tu Li-hua, who have also
registered with the party to participate in the primary.</P>
      <P>Yeh, the country's first health minister to take part in the World Health

nomination.</P>
      <P>Yeh, once an adjunct professor at Hualien's Tzu Chi University, has lived in the
eastern county for 10 years.</P>

      <P>A signal from a track switch on Taiwan's high-speed railway malfunctioned Monday
between Yunlin and Chiayi, resulting in the cancellation of seven trains in
order to accommodate two-way traffic on a single track.</P>
      <P>The glitch occurred at 4: 40 p.m. and was repaired two hours later, Taiwan High
Speed Rail Corp. said.</P>
      <P>It was the railway's second mechanical failure in three days. On Saturday, five
trains were canceled and 20 others delayed due to a similar problem that hit the
railway between Miaoli and Yuanli in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Even before the cause of Saturday's malfunction was determined, the track switch
on the railway's Huwei section in Yunlin County failed to send a signal to the
traffic control center at nearby Chiayi Station as usual Monday evening.</P>
      <P>When such a glitch occurs, the control center has to bar any train from passing
that section, a spokesman for Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp.'s Chiayi Station said</P>
      <P>"As a result, the Chiayi-Yunlin section was only able to maintain a 'single-
track, two-way' service mode," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Monday's signal malfunction led to the cancellation of seven trains and more
than 30-minute delays to many others, the company said.</P>
      <P>Including Monday's malfunction, 22 signal malfunctions have hit the railway
since its inauguration two and a half years ago.</P>
      <P>Chu Hsu, director-general of the Bureau of Taiwan High Speed Rail under the

08/03/09  21:14:32
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of Taiwanese workers remaining on unpaid leave dropped by late July,
the Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) reported Monday about a
practice taken by some local firms to cope with the economic downturn.</P>
      <P>A total of 74,468 workers remained on unpaid leave as of the end of July, down
by 5,499 people compared to the figure recorded as of July 15, the CLA said.</P>
      <P>Early March was the time when the number of Taiwanese workers put on mandatory
unpaid leave peaked -- at 238,975, which is more than triple the current figure,
according to the CLA.</P>
      <P>Since March,  the monthly  figure had started to steadily decreased. The number
of workers on unpaid leave at the end of June was 126,175.</P>
      <P>While not commenting on whether the reduced number of workers on unpaid leave
was an indication that the worst was over for Taiwan's economy, CLA officials
did say that a steadfast rebound in orders placed by foreign buyers for local
companies was a factor.</P>
      <P>As of the end of last month, 655 enterprises still had employees on unpaid
leave, but that was a fall from 704 for the first half of the same month.</P>
      <P>After the global financial crisis broke out late last year, the CLA has since
January required local enterprises to report the number of workers they have
asked to take unpaid leave, to better monitor the impact of the sagging economy
and falling exports on Taiwan's labor market.</P>
      <P>About 202,000 Taiwanese workers have been put by their company on mandatory
furlough since December 2008, due to their companies' bad business performance,
with those in the high-tech sector making up the bulk of the companies using
this practice.</P>
      <P>The practice stirred debate. While employers say it gives them the flexibility
of having staff readily available when business improved, labor rights groups
have criticized the move because it spares the companies from paying the workers
severance pay if they were to layoff the employees, and the employees lost a
chunk of their income.</P>
      <P>Some employees were put on unpaid leave for at least a couple of days a month,
while others had to take several days off a month. Many employees, however, were
grateful to keep their jobs.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Benefiting from higher passenger traffic during the 2009 World Games, the
Kaohsiung mass rapid transport system took in more than NT$100 million (US$3.05
million) in revenue in July, the most it has collected in any single month in
its history.</P>
      <P>The system also set a monthly record by transporting 4.4 million passengers in
July, up from 3.8 million in May and 3.1 million in June, said Huang I-chung,
the director of the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp.'s (KRTC's) Public Affairs
Department.</P>
      <P>During the 11-day World Games, which ran from July 16-26, an average of 150,000
passengers rode Kaohsiung's MRT lines on weekdays and 190,000 took the trains on
weekends, Huang added.</P>
      <P>The record revenue in July was calculated based on the assumption that each
passenger paid an average fare of NT$24 per ride.</P>
      <P>Since beginning commercial runs in April 2008 after a month-long free trial run,
the MRT has totaled revenues of between NT$80 million and NT$90 million a month,
Huang said.</P>
      <P>Monthly revenue had never previously surpassed NT$100 million, even when KRTC
offered incentives to push up ridership numbers, he said.</P>
      <P>Despite July's encouraging numbers, however, the company does not expect they
will substantially ease its financial woes. KRTC posted an estimated loss of
NT$1.2 billion in the first half of the year and it expects to lose NT$2.5
billion for the year, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said interest on loans to construct the line and depreciation on
equipment are the company's biggest burdens, costing a total of about NT$2.2
billion annually.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's consumption voucher program will definitely help boost the country's
annual gross domestic product (GDP) by at least 0.66 percent, the government's
top economic planner reaffirmed Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Tain-jy, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD), made the assertion in response to a recent report by the Ministry of
Audit under the watchdog Control Yuan, which questioned the voucher program's
effectiveness in stimulating the sluggish economy.</P>
      <P>"It remains to be seen whether the NT$85.7 billion consumption voucher program
can live up to its goal of stimulating economic growth given its high
substitution rate and issuance cost, " the ministry said in its report.</P>
      <P>Chen said the CEPD has commissioned Academia Sinica -- Taiwan's foremost
research institute -- to evaluate the effects of the consumption vouchers
program.</P>
      <P>Citing an initial report by the Academia Sinica's research team, Chen said the
consumption voucher "substitution rate" was between 60 percent and 70 percent.</P>
      <P>That means that 60 percent to 70 percent of the vouchers used by consumers
replaced purchases they would have made anyway, with the rest additional
spending.</P>
      <P>"Such a ratio reflects normal consumption activities and by no means implies
that the program had a poor effect," Chen explained.</P>
      <P>Judging from consumption patterns during the Lunar New Year holiday and retail
sales volume for the period, Chen said he was 100 percent sure that the
consumption voucher program will boost GDP growth by an estimated 0.66 percent.</P>
      <P>Chen, however, acknowledged another of the report's criticisms -- that the
program  was too rushed,  possibly  diminishing  its effectiveness.</P>
      <P>He attributed  the haste in issuing the vouchers  to the government's desire to
take advantage of the Chinese New Year shopping spree.</P>
      <P>The government issued the consumption vouchers with a face value of NT$3,600 per
set before the Lunar New Year holiday in January in an attempt to boost slumping
domestic economy amid a global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>To date, most of the consumption vouchers have been distributed and cashed in,
CEPD officials said, adding that the council is scheduled to present a
comprehensive assessment report to the Legislative Yuan in October.</P>
      <P>All consumption vouchers must be used by the end of September.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) could further cut or suspend water
supply to selected sectors in the northern county of Taoyuan if the current dry
spell continues, an official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Because of lower-than-usual rainfall this summer, the water level in the Shihmen
Reservoir -- the major source of potable water in the Taoyuan area -- has been
falling rapidly and is approaching an alarmingly low level.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Huang Chung-chiou said the water supply has
been cut during off-peak hours in the area.</P>
      <P>"If the drought gets worse, we will not rule out the possibility of rationing
the supply of water to certain heavy water-consuming services, such as car
washes, spas, swimming pools and tall-building cleaning services, " Huang said,
adding that the new restrictions may be announced Aug. 11.</P>
      <P>To encourage water conservation, Huang said, the MOEA's Water Resources Agency
(WRA) plans to offer subsidies for those who buy water-efficient appliances or
equipment, just as the government has done in the past to encourage the purchase
of energy-efficient home appliances.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan will visit the Shihmen Reservoir
Tuesday to decide if any measures need to be taken immediately to cope with the
continuing dry spell.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, WRA Deputy Director-General Wu Yueh-hsi said that if no rain falls in
the Taoyuan area in the coming days. the agency may further restrict water
supply for agricultural use from late August.</P>
      <P>Water supply for irrigation in the Taoyuan area has been cut by 30 percent since
July, Wu said, adding that if necessary, irrigation water supply may be
suspended from late August in order to ensure that water supply for household
and industrial use will not be rationed until late October.</P>
      <P>Similar water shortage problems are also troubling southern Taiwan, with major
reservoirs in the region drying out due to limited precipitation.</P>
      <P>Wu said his agency will immediately impose a rationing system in Tainan and
Penghu counties where water supply for household use at night will be cut and
water for irrigation purposes will be provided based on a "10 days on, five days
off" supply model.</P>

      <P>A tropical depression that has turned into a tropical storm over the West
Pacific early Tuesday morning is expected to approach Taiwan, but it is not
clear if it will deliver the heavy rainfall Taiwan desperately needs.</P>
      <P>"It remains to be seen whether and how the tropical storm, dubbed Morakot, will
directly affect Taiwan, " a Central Weather Bureau (CWB) meteorologist said.</P>
      <P>According to the CWB, Morakot was located 1,500-plus kilometers east of Taiwan's
southernmost  tip of Eluanbi,  moving in a northwesterly direction toward Taiwan
at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour.</P>
      <P>Morakot, the eighth storm system reported in the West Pacific region this year,
is expected to maintain its course and speed until noon Tuesday and then shift
to a west-northwest direction toward Taiwan in the following 24 hours, the CWB
said.</P>
      <P>Based on current projections, the tropical storm will begin affecting Taiwan
Aug. 7 or 8.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has received far less rainfall than normal so far this year, and water
authorities have warned of possible rationing measures if drought conditions
persist.</P>
      <P>Another tropical storm, Goni, which formed Monday and was the West Pacific's
seventh storm of the year, has swept through the South China Sea toward Hong
Kong, CWB meteorologists said.</P>
      <P>Its outer rim has brought sporadic showers to central, southern and eastern
Taiwan, but not enough to ease the country's water shortage.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Tuesday:</P>
      <P>APPLE DAILY:</P>
      <P>Yeh Ching-chuan has fallen to new low</P>
      <P>Amid mounting fears of a swine flu epidemic, Health Minister Yeh Ching-chuan
tendered his resignation to run for Hualien County magistrate Monday.</P>
      <P>We question the timing of his departure and we also regret the rudeness of the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) in handling the matter. The party has been saying that
the SARS fighter would resign for days, leaving the Premier Liu Chao-shiuan in
the cold.</P>
      <P>Can the KMT call itself a democratic party? The party previously suspended the
magistrate primary in Hualien, but decided to reinstate the system after Yeh's
latest decision.</P>
      <P>CHINA TIMES:</P>
      <P>Maintain deficit for time being</P>
      <P>As the central government begins to map out its general budget for next year,
some have begun to debate whether the government should focus on cutting the
deficit to balance spending or continue to prop up the sagging economy.</P>
      <P>We have noted that nearly one year after the economic crisis, various economic
indicators have shown that the economy is slowly bottoming out.</P>
      <P>But looking back at history, economic recovery is never a straight line. A too
hasty retraction of economic stimulus measures could cause the weak economy to
take another plunge.</P>
      <P>For this reason, we think the government should continue to adopt a budget with
a potentially growing deficit, which will be necessary to prop up the weak
recovery, especially because the jobless rate will continue to rise unabated in
the year ahead.</P>
      <P>UNITED DAILY NEWS:</P>
      <P>Is President Ma going to act against Mayor Ma?</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice has begun to review the lands in Taipei City that were
seized during the time when the city failed to make health insurance payments it
owed to the central government.</P>
      <P>If the central government does sell the land to get the money back, then we can
see the farcical effect of the Ma administration acting against Mayor Ma.</P>
      <P>The issue began when the previous DPP administration maliciously cut the funding
allocated to Taipei City. As a result, then Taipei mayor Ma refused to shoulder
the health insurance payments, citing the city's dire financial straits.</P>
      <P>The mayor argued that only 1.4 million workers were registered in Taipei City,
and it was unfair for the central government to ask the city to pay for the 3.6
million employees of companies registered in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Mayor Ma then filed an administrative lawsuit, but the High Administrative Court
ruled late last year that the city should pay its debt by auctioning its land.</P>
      <P>Whether it is reasonable for Taipei to contribute to premiums for more than
double the number of workers registered in the city is open to discussion.</P>
      <P>But the point is that both the central government and Taipei City are headed by
the same party, and they should show the ability to solve the problem instead of
letting it fester.</P>
      <P>LIBERTY TIMES:</P>
      <P>Can premier stay on after Yeh's resignation?</P>
      <P>Health Minister Yeh Ching-chuan resigned from his post Monday to run for Hualien
County magistrate.</P>
      <P>At a time when the number of H1N1 cases continues to rise, President Ma Ying-
jeou has said he was happy to see Yeh's decision, and Premier Liu Chao-shiuan
approved the resignation swiftly.</P>
      <P>A lot of people have begun to ask if Ma's administration thinks winning an
election is more important than winning a battle against the new flu?</P>
      <P>Doesn't the premier feel humiliated for having no say in whether a Cabinet
member stays or leaves?</P>

    <HEADLINE>'Influenza A (H1N1) twist unexpected': outgoing health minister</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The outbreak of new swine flu, or influenza A (H1N1), has unfolded in an
unpredictable way and not as originally expected,  outgoing  Department  of
Health (DOH)  Minister Yeh Ching-chuan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Unlike seasonal flu, which usually strikes mostly vulnerable targets such as the
elderly and children during winter months, the H1N1 strain has affected people
around the globe much earlier, with the majority of patients young people or
individuals in their prime, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Yeh made the comments at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, before boarding a
flight to Hong Kong to take part in the 5th Taiwan-Hong Kong Forum at the Hong
Kong Convention and Exhibition Center Wednesday.</P>
      <P>He said he and three other Taiwanese specialists will meet with top health
authorities in Hong Kong at the forum to exchange views on preparedness in the
face of the regional spread of the H1N1 flu virus strain.</P>
      <P>Because Taiwan's H1N1 cluster infections only recently emerged, and there have
been few cases of the H3N2 strain, Yeh said Taiwan can learn from Hong Kong's
experience.</P>
      <P>"We will take this opportunity to better understand how Hong Kong is treating
and testing for the flu to have as a reference for future prevention efforts in
Taiwan," he said.</P>
      <P>Yeh and the three specialists -- Huang Kun-chang, CEO of the DOH Hospital
Administration Commission, Chen Wen-chung, superintendent of Taoyuan General
Hospital and Chang Shang-chun, deputy superintendent of National Taiwan
University Hospital -- will meet with York Chow, Hong Kong's food and health
secretary, and other ranking Hong Kong health officials during their stay in the
former British territory.</P>
      <P>The meeting will mark the first time that Taiwan and Hong Kong officials will
openly discuss cooperation in epidemic prevention.</P>
      <P>Yeh, who is making a bid to run in the year-end magisterial elections on the
ruling Kuomintang's (KMT's) ticket in Hualien County,  resigned Monday. Premier
Liu Chao-shiuan approved his resignation, which will take effect from Aug. 6.</P>
      <P>His resignation, which comes at a time when the country is gripped by mounting
fears over a possible swine flu epidemic, has drawn criticism from lawmakers of
both the ruling and opposition parties.</P>
      <P>On the question of his successor, Yeh said at the airport that it would be the
right and responsibility of the premier to make the decision.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's mango exports to Japan increase sharply</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug 4 (CNA)
08/04/09  13:47:45
(By Roger Chou)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan exported 999 tons of mangoes to Japan in 2009, up 19 percent from last
year because of the adoption of enhanced safety and quality controls, a Council
of Agriculture (COA) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Han-ching, the chief-secretary of the COA's Agriculture and Food Agency,
said Taiwan's overall mango harvest was down from last year, and the export
season, which usually continues into August, ended July 27 when the last batch
of mangoes was shipped to Japan.</P>
      <P>Yet despite the shorter growing season, this year's exports to Japan were well
above the 838 tons shipped in 2008, but it was not immediately known how much
the shipments were worth.</P>
      <P>Japan was the No. 1 overseas market of Taiwan's mangoes by value in 2008,
importing US$5.2 million worth of the fruit, followed by South Korea (US$2.97
million) and Hong Kong (US$590,000).</P>
      <P>The agency attributed the increase in export volume to Japan primarily to
enhanced quality control and a rise in orders for high-end mangoes.</P>
      <P>By maintaining a high standard of quality, Taiwan's mangoes and especially Irwin
mangoes grown in Tainan have been a hit in the Japanese market, helping prop up
the price of local mangoes, the agency noted.</P>
      <P>Though shipments were up to Japan, Hsu was not yet sure if the overall volume of
mango exports surpassed that of 2008.</P>
      <P>"The total export volume of the fruit is estimated at over 3,000 tons.
Hopefully, this year's volume will exceed the 3,307 tons shipped last year," Hsu
said.</P>
      <P>Other big export markets for the fruit are Singapore and China, although as with
Hong Kong,  they generally  purchase cheaper varieties.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) remained tight-lipped Tuesday on how it
will approach Taiwan's bid for representation in the United Nations as the bid
deadline approaches, suggesting only that it will decide on the strategy in mid-
August.</P>
      <P>"We will make a sound decision based on an overall assessment of Taiwan's needs
and the atmosphere in the international community and in cross-Taiwan Strait
relations, one that will help us achieve concrete results in participating in
international organizations in the future,Paul Chang, director-general of the
MOFA's Department of International Organizations, said at a regular press
briefing.</P>
      <P>Noting that the MOFA has yet to come up with a final decision on this year's
bid, Chang said it should make one around mid-August, but he refused to give any
details on progress in the government's deliberations on the issue.</P>
      <P>Pressed on whether Taiwan will even make a U.N. bid this year, Chang did not
give a direct answer, saying only that the agency is engaging  in a careful
evaluation  and will not exclude  any possibility.</P>
      <P>"There are many other options. We will make a public announcement when the issue
is settled, " Chang said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has not been represented in the U.N. since 1971 when the Republic of
China's seat was given to the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Its annual efforts to rejoin the body since 1993 have failed, as have its
attempts to be part of U.N.-affiliated organizations, mainly because of China's
obstruction.</P>
      <P>But with relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait thawing since
President Ma Ying-jeou's administration took office last year, Taiwan was
invited to attend the World Health Assembly -- the decision-making  arm of the
U.N.-affiliated  World  Health Organization -- in May as an observer.</P>
      <P>Last year, in a departure from the high-profile push in 2007 for full membership
in the United Nations under the name Taiwan, the country proposed that it be
allowed to "participate meaningfully in the activities of U.N. specialized
agencies."</P>
      <P>That approach was in line with President Ma's "modus vivendi" or flexible
diplomatic strategy, which favors a moderate and pragmatic approach to expanding
Taiwan's international space.</P>
      <P>Although the request failed to make the agenda of the 63rd session of the U.N.
General Assembly last year, it was well received by major countries such as the
United States, Japan, and some European Union countries, which issued statements
in support of the effort.</P>
      <P>The 64th U.N. General Assembly session is scheduled to open Sept. 15 at U.N.
headquarters in New York, and Taiwan must submit a bid proposal to the U.N.
Secretariat through a diplomatic ally 30 days before then for it to be
considered for the General Assembly agenda.</P>

      <P>Alishan, a popular mountain resort in southern Taiwan's Chiayi County, welcomed
its millionth visitor for the first time in 33 years, the Alishan National
Scenic Area reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Wei-shuan, who is from Keelung in northern Taiwan but now works in
Kaohsiung City in the south, became the millionth visitor to Alishan this year
when he made his first ever trip to the alpine resort with his friends.</P>
      <P>Since it opened in 1976, the Alishan National Scenic Area had previously never
drawn one million visitors a year. The number reached about 990,000 in 2006, and
950,000 in 1983, but has averaged between 600,000 and 800,000 per year.</P>
      <P>Tsai, who was elated to be the millionth visitor for the year, was showered with
gifts by the Chiayi Forest District Office. He was given an MP3 player, a video
camera, a digital camera, a bicycle and one night free accommodation at Alishan
House. Local tourism-related businesses also offered him speciality food worth
more than NT$10,000 (US$300) and free guided tours of the area.</P>
      <P>According  to Chiayi Forest District Office Director  Yang Chih-hung,  Tsai was
selected  Tuesday  by the scenic  area's computerized ticket selling system as
the year's millionth visitor.</P>
      <P>Yang predicted that the number of visitors to the Alishan National Scenic Area
for the whole of this year will reach a new high, despite the fact that some
segments of the Alishan alpine train system need to be repaired.</P>
      <P>Local forest district officials attributed the record number of visitors to
Taiwan's broader opening to Chinese tourists in July last year.</P>
      <P>Alishan and Sun Moon Lake in central Taiwan's Nantou County are the two most
popular destinations in Taiwan among Chinese visitors.</P>

National Taiwan University said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The three -- Peng Shie-ming and Chou Pi-tai, professors at National Taiwan

chemists from around the world who work at chemistry research institutes and
have made significant contributions in the field of chemistry and applied
chemistry, said Lo Ching-hua, dean of the College of Science at NTU.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the selection of the three local academics reflects Taiwan's

      <P>Peng,  who is also a research fellow at Academia Sinica, specializes in
inorganic chemistry and crystallography.</P>
      <P>With stable financial support from the government, Taiwan's scientific research
standards are close to international standards, he said in an interview with

      <P>Chou, who is also chairman of NTU's Department of Chemistry, specializes in
optoelectronic materials and physical and biophysical chemistry.</P>

the day before to approve the budget for the construction of an ocean culture
and pop music center in the southern port city, which has just successfully
hosted the 2009 World Games.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Economic Planning and Development approved a budget
of NT$5.45 billion (US$166.67 million) for the building of the complex on a
sprawling 12.5 hectares at Kaohsiung Harbor's Piers 11-15 near the mouth of the
Love River.</P>
      <P>The project is scheduled to be completed in 2015, said Chung Wan-shun, a

      <P>"Renowned international architects are welcome to contact the bureau about the
open design bid, which is scheduled to be finalized next May at the latest,"
Chung said.</P>
      <P>The complex, which the planners envision will be on par with the Sydney Opera
House, will feature facilities for outdoor performances, several concert halls,
and exhibition areas for ocean culture. It will also include a center for the
promotion of the pop music industry, and an area to showcase cultural and
innovative designs and products, according to the Kaohsiung Bureau of Cultural
Affairs.</P>
      <P>The complex will be built at a prime location where the Kaohsiung Harbor meets
the Love River and will afford magnificent ocean and river vistas, said a bureau

      <P>Taiwan's share prices opened high but closed 1.42 percent lower Tuesday, a day
after the government said that water rationing measures may be introduced as
early as Aug. 11.</P>
      <P>The weighted index, the market's key barometer, fell 100.84 points Tuesday to
close at 6,955.87.</P>
      <P>The local bourse opened at 7,129.43 and reached the day's high of 7,138.94 after
the Nasdaq composite index closed at its highest level in 10 months and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 index finished at 9-month highs
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The local market later retreated to the day's low of 6,921.04 as selling
pressure emerged following the government's statement that it may announce
measures Aug. 11 for restrictions on the use of water for car washes, spas,
fountains and the cleaning of buildings.</P>
      <P>A total of 6.55 billion shares changed hands on market turnover of NT$159.96
billion (US$4.90 billion).</P>
      <P>Four of the eight major stock categories gained ground, with cement stocks and
plastics and chemicals issues advancing the most at 0.9 percent. Paper and pulp
issues rose 0.3 percent and foodstuff shares added 0.1 percent.</P>
      <P>The other four major stock categories  lost ground,  with construction stocks
moving down the most at 2.6 percent. Machinery and electronics shares fell 2.4
percent, textile issues dropped 0.6 percent, and banking and financial issues
shed 0.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Losers outnumbered gainers 1,667 to 805,  with 135 stocks remaining unchanged.</P>
      <P>Foreign institutional investors were net sellers of NT$2.09 billion in shares.</P>
      <P>Although the weighted index previously broke the 7,000 mark, it pulled back

Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The MOEA first put forth in March the idea of setting up the TMC as part of its
efforts to consolidate Taiwan's ailing dynamic random access memory, or DRAM,
industry. The company has recently completed its establishment, with registered
capital of NT$500,000 (US$15,244).</P>
      <P>Under a project unveiled in July, the government will allocate a maximum of
NT$30 billion to support one or two local DRAM companies to compete with their
foreign counterparts, particularly those in South Korea.</P>
      <P>Companies interested in obtaining the government funding should apply with the
MOEA within three months, after which the ministry will review their
qualifications.</P>
      <P>"TMC is a bellwether, and we hope it will pass the screening, " Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang, however, would not disclose the amount of investment requested by TMC.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the funding, the applicants should have the ability to
efficiently acquire overseas intellectual property and technology usage rights,
as well as fair and balanced research and development records from both domestic
firms and overseas partners, according to requirements set by the MOEA.</P>
      <P>The MOEA also demands that the international collaboration must provide adequate
training of local talent and that the re-structuring plan must aim to improve
existing corporate structures and broker possible mergers and acquisitions.</P>
      <P>TMC, which aims to develop its own technologies in collaboration with Japan-
based Elpida Memory Inc., is so far the only company that has filed its business
plan to bid for the funding.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials said they believe the Formosa Plastics Group will also file an
application.</P>
      <P>Two of Formosa's affiliates -- Nanya Technology Corp. and Inotera Memories Inc.
-- have maintained a partnership with U.S.-based Micron Technology Inc., a
leading DRAM technology provider.</P>
      <P>TMC originally hoped to cooperate with both Elpida and Micron, but Micron turned
down the proposal in April and decided instead to further reinforce its long-
term cooperation with Nanya and Inotera.</P>
      <P>Nanya and Inotera executives have urged the government to give the Micro-Nanya-
Inotera alliance the same level of support it would have given to a Micron-TMC
venture.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's DRAM industry has been ailing due to an oversupply of local makers
here, which are relatively small compared to their South Korean counterparts.
The government thus proposed consolidating all the DRAM makers into one company
-- TMC.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Tuesday that it is still planning for
President Ma Ying-jeou to travel to the South Pacific in October to attend the
Taiwan-South Pacific leaders summit in the Solomon Islands, but details remain
to be confirmed.</P>
      <P>Everything is still in the planning stage within the foreign ministry. An
announcement on the presidents visit will be made by the presidential office
when it is confirmed,said MOFA spokesman Henry Chen.</P>
      <P>Details to be confirmed include the exact date of the summit, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Diplomatic sources, however, revealed that the president and his wife will visit
the South Pacific region in the later half of October and will stop in several
of the Republic of Chinas other diplomatic allies there.</P>
      <P>Ma and his entourage are tentatively scheduled to depart from Taiwan on Oct. 17
and return to the country Oct. 22. During the trip, Ma may also visit Palau and
another ally nation yet to be determined, an official who requested anonymity
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has six diplomatic allies in the South Pacific region, including the
Solomon Islands, the Marshall Islands, Palau, Kiribati, Nauru and Tuvalu.</P>
      <P>At the summit, Ma will join his counterparts from Palau, the Marshall Islands,
Nauru, the Solomon Islands, Kiribati and Tuvalu, said the official, adding that
the summit is currently scheduled to be held on Oct. 20 in the Solomon Islands.</P>
      <P>The leadership summit will be the third of its kind since Sept. 4, 2006, when it
was first held in Palau, and Taiwan was represented by then President Chen Shui-
bian.</P>
      <P>Relevant agencies in Taiwan have begun contacting Taiwan's six South Pacific
allies to work out the topics to be discussed at the summit, the official said.
The agenda may include the recent global financial crisis, climate change,
fishery resources, alternative energy, and cooperation in the fields of
medicine, agriculture and fisheries, the official added.</P>
      <P>The upcoming trip will be President Ma's first visit to the South Pacific since
he took office in May 2008, and Ma's third diplomatic tour this year.</P>
      <P>Ma conducted a visit to Central America from May 26-June 4 that took him to
Belize, Guatemala and El Salvador, and visited the region again from June
29-July 6 to attend the inauguration of then Panamanian President-elect Ricardo
Martinelli and to pay official visits to Nicaragua and Honduras.</P>
      <P>Since Ma took office, he and the Foreign Ministry have said the administration
will seek to establish a long-term cooperation mechanism with the allies based
on the main objective stated in its foreign aid white paper, which is to provide
more effective and meaningful assistance to Taiwan's ally nations.</P>
      <P>Ma previously visited the Solomon Islands in 1997 in his capacity as a
professor.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Improved techniques help Taiwan's red date farmers increase output</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 4 (CNA)

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Revenue generated by red dates in northern Taiwan's Gongguan township, Miaoli
County, has increased by 10 to 15 percent, thanks to improved cultivation
techniques a government research station has taught local farmers, officials
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The revenue generated from red date production reached NT$60 million (US$1.8
million) a year after the new techniques were adopted, said Liu Yu-tsung, an
assistant researcher at the Miaoli District Agricultural Research and Extension
Station under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>Liu attributed the success of improved red date output to the station's guiding
local farmers to increase the concentration of the plants in the orchards, prune
tree branches to help them grow in a way that allows the fruits to bath in
sunlight more completely, and grade their fruits before selling them in the
market.</P>
      <P>Liu said the techniques passed on to farmers by the station have helped raise
both the quantity and quality of the harvests.</P>
      <P>The efforts have, for example, raised the fruit's sweetness by 25 percent, he
added.</P>
      <P>Gongguan is the only place in Taiwan where red dates, a fruit often seen sun-
dried and commonly used in local and Chinese cuisine, are grown.</P>
      <P>Dried red dates are also often used in traditional Chinese medicine to
strengthen the functions of the heart and lungs, as well as to nourish the
stomach and spleen.</P>
      <P>The period between July and August is the only season for growing fresh red
dates in Taiwan, making the fruit all the more precious, Hsieh Fu-yuan, head of
the Gongguan Township Office's agricultural division, told the CNA.</P>
      <P>Hsieh encouraged the public to consume the fruit that is rich in Vitamin C.
Citing a study by the Miaoli agricultural research station, he said the Vitamin
C content of red dates is at 270 mg per 100 grams and other nutrition contained
in dates is much higher than that of apples.</P>
      <P>There are currently more than 50 hectares of red date farms in Gongguan, whose
total annual output amounts to between 6,000 kg and 12,000 kg, according to
Hsieh.</P>
      <P>The price of fresh red dates currently stands at between NT$100 (US$3) and
NT$120 per 600 grams in Taiwan, Hsieh said.</P>

      <P>Chinese tourists in Taiwan spend an average of NT$52,640 (11,000 Chinese yuan)
each during their stays in Taiwan, nearly double the NT$27,850 (6,600 HK
dollars) spent by each Hong Kong tourist, a survey has found.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a survey commissioned by Visa Inc. and conducted by
Research International, 90 percent of Chinese tourists and 87 percent of Hong
Kong visitors have a positive impression of travel in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition, 63 percent of tourists from China and 75 percent from Hong Kong
were impressed by the Taiwan people's hospitality, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>Sun Moon Lake in central Taiwan's Nantou County and Alishan in Chiayi County in
the south are the two most popular destinations among Chinese tourists, while
Hong Kong visitors find Kenting, Alishan, Yangmingshan and Sun Moon Lake the
most attractive places in Taiwan, the survey indicated.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese respondents in the poll named Alishan, Taroko National Park and
Kenting as the top leisure spots.</P>
      <P>Over 70 percent of Chinese and Hong Kong tourists listed Taiwan's night markets
and hot springs as must-see attractions.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, oyster omelets were voted as the most popular snack sold in Taiwan's
night markets, while pineapple cake was selected as the best speciality food in
Taiwan, followed by tea and sun cakes.</P>
      <P>About 60 percent of the Hong Kong respondents and 67 percent of Taiwanese said
steamed dumplings are the number one delicacy in the country, but less than 50
percent of Chinese tourists agreed.</P>
      <P>More than a half of the Chinese respondents said they prefer Taiwanese-style
cuisine, dantsu noodle, beef noodle soup and ginger duck.</P>

      <P>Taiwan reported Tuesday three new severe cases of influenza A(H1N1) infection,
as well as a severe infection of the seasonal type-A flu H3N2.</P>
      <P>Lin Ding, deputy director-general of the Center for Disease Control (CDC), said
at a press conference that the three A(H1N1) -infected patients include a 32
-year-old male chef living in the central Taiwan city of Taichung, who was being
treated in an isolation ward.</P>
      <P>The other patients are two kindergarten boys -- one aged five and the other
three. None of the three, although all were suffering from the complication of
pneumonia, were in critical condition, Lin said.</P>
      <P>CDC Director-General Steve Kuo attributed their non-critical status to the
strategy of giving them anti-viral drugs soon after they were diagnosed.</P>
      <P>The new cases brought the number of severe A(H1N1) cases in the country to nine,
including one fatality. So far, only two of the patients have been discharged
from hospital after recovering, according to CDC statistics.</P>
      <P>The tallies also show that since July 1, Taiwan has reported 16 flu cluster
infections involving over 600 people. One of the cluster infections was caused
by the A virus subtype H3N2.</P>
      <P>The only H3N2 cluster infection was reported in a dance troupe at an elementary
school in Taipei that had recently returned from a tour of Shenzhen in southern
China.</P>
      <P>Lin said that some of the troupe fell sick July 22 during their stay in
Shenzhen. After they came back to Taiwan, one member's brother, who has never
traveled abroad, also came down with a fever, Lin added.</P>
      <P>A total of 11 people were sickened in the cluster infection, six of whom were
infected with H3N2, Lin said.</P>
      <P>He noted that it is still unknown whether the infections were related to current
H3N2 outbreaks in Hong Kong. "It is possible the patients contracted the virus
in Taiwan, or in Shenzhen or Hong Kong" judging from the outbreak, Lin said.</P>
      <P>H3N2 is a subtype of the flu virus that can infect birds and mammals. In humans,
birds and pigs, the virus has mutated into many strains and the recent local
outbreaks have caught the attention of the authorities.</P>

      <P>Allianz, one of the largest financial services providers in the world, will
recruit 1,000 new employees this year in an effort to expand its presence in the
Taiwan market, the CEO of the company's Taiwan subsidiary said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chris James made the announcement at an event to celebrate the opening of a
client service center at Allianz Taiwan Life Insurance Co. amid rumors that the
German insurance giant is reeling from the global financial crunch and therefore
considering withdrawing from the Taiwan market.</P>
      <P>He said that the new client service center was set up to meet customer demand.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, James, who is also chairman of the Insurance Committee of the
European Chamber of Commerce in Taipei (ECCT), reiterated his opposition  to  a
government  plan  to  tax  earnings  from investment-linked life insurance
products.</P>
      <P>He said that it is unfair to deny the long-standing socially recognized system
that offers customers transparent,  flexible, cost-effective life insurance and
savings as an alternative to less flexible and more opaque traditional products.</P>
      <P>He criticized the government's decision on the issue as a misstep, saying that
it will erode public confidence in investment.</P>

      <P>Prosecutors rejected Tuesday requests for plea bargains by several relatives of
former President Chen Shui-bian involved in his corruption and money-laundering
case.</P>
      <P>They  are  the  former  president's  son Chen  Chih-chung, daughter-in-law Huang
Jui-ching, brother-in-law Wu Ching-mao and sister-in-law Chen Chun-ying.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-chung acted as a proxy for the former first family's controversial
overseas bank accounts, while Huang, Wu and Chen Chun-ying were some of the
nominal account holders.</P>
      <P>Lin Che-hui, a prosecutor from the Special Investigation Division of the Supreme
Prosecutors Office, told a Taipei District Court hearing that the prosecution
decided not to consider the defendants' requests because they played a major
part in the money-laundering case and are still under investigation in other
related cases.</P>
      <P>The fact that Chen Chih-chung and his wife Huang Jui-ching have so far not wired
the overseas funds back to Taiwan is another reason why their requests were
turned down, prosecutorial sources said.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife Wu Shu-jen are accused of siphoning off NT$104 million
(US$3.15 million)  from a special Presidential  Office discretionary fund during
his term as president from 2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>They are also charged with accepting bribes totaling NT$300 million in
connection with a land deal between the Hsinchu Science Park and Dayu
Development Corp. and with receiving kickbacks totaling NT$90.93 million between
2002 and 2003 to help a contractor win the tender to build the Nangang
Exhibition Hall.</P>
      <P>In addition, the couple allegedly took bribes totaling NT$310 million from
former Taipei Financial Center Corp. Chairwoman Diana Chen and former Chinatrust
Financial Holdings Co. Vice Chairman Jeffrey Koo Jr.</P>
      <P>The couple allegedly secretly stashed the funds overseas through various

      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) gave a green light Tuesday to measures allowing
elementary schools to give extra classes in Chinese and foreign languages to
children of foreign spouses, a ministry official said that day.</P>
      <P>Lu Hung-lin, director of the MOE's Department of Elementary Education, said the
measures are aimed at helping these school children sharpen their language
abilities and more quickly adapt to school life, and are part of the
government's efforts to foster bilingual talent in its pursuit of an
international competitive edge.</P>
      <P>Apart from offering extra Chinese language classes on campuses, elementary
schools  are permitted  to employ experts to give extra-curricular classes in
the mother tongues of the students of foreign spouses of Taiwanese citizens.</P>
      <P>It has been estimated that more than 30,000 children born into such families in
Taiwan will enroll in first grade classes in September at primary schools around
the country, Lu added.</P>
      <P>The government has since 2004 adopted a series of measures to assist elementary
school students of the so-called "new immigrants" to improve their learning at
school and their family relationships at home, in view of the rising number of
foreign wives from China and Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>At present, children born to foreign husbands and wives of local people account
for about 10 percent of Taiwan's newborns each year, he noted. The ratio peaked
at 13 percent in 2003 and gradually dropped to 9.6 percent in 2008.</P>

      <P>At least seven U.S. and European insurers are expected to attend a news
conference to be held by the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Taipei to
express their opposition to a proposal by Taiwan to tax income from investment-
linked insurance products, an AmCham official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The prospective  participants  are Allianz,  MetLife,  HSBC Insurance, Manulife,
New York Life Insurance, Cardif Assurance Vie and Prudential Life, all of which
are members of either AmCham or the European Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT),
said Lee Wood, chairman of AmCham's Insurance Committee.</P>
      <P>They will also clarify misunderstanding among some members of the public about
investment-linked insurance products, Wood said.</P>
      <P>He said it is important that customers have the option of investment-linked
products because they provide an additional and transparent layer of financial
security for customers who could otherwise lose their savings to other general
creditors if an insurer were to fail.</P>
      <P>On July 24, the Tax Reform Committee under the Executive Yuan adopted a
resolution to treat earnings from unit-linked insurance products as taxable
income. Gains of up to NT$270,000 would be tax-exempt under the existing
exemption for interest income, but amounts beyond that would be subject to
taxation.</P>
      <P>The committee also suggested that proceeds from policies where the policyholder
and beneficiary are not the same person be subject to a 10 percent gift tax on
benefits of over NT$2.2 million.</P>
      <P>The proposal met immediate objections from AmCham and the ECCT, both of which
warned that it would discourage consumer saving and damage Taiwan's insurance
industry.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the issue, officials from the Financial Supervisory Commission
(FSC) said Tuesday that the resolution adopted by the Tax Reform Committee is
not final and that the FSC will continue to communicate with the Ministry of
Finance's Taxation Agency on the issue.</P>

      <P>Taipei City was rated the best among 20 cities and counties in Taiwan proper, as
well as the two special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung, in terms of
healthcare governance, according to rating results released Tuesday by the
Taiwan Healthcare Reform Foundation (THRF).</P>
      <P>In the 2009 healthcare governance rating, Taipei City scored in each of five
rating categories -- medical resources, charges for medical treatment services,
safety of medicines, services for the less-privileged, and settlement of medical
disputes.</P>
      <P>In each category, either "one point" or "zero" is given as a score, which
denotes "good" or "in need of improvement" performance of local governments in
healthcare administration.</P>
      <P>Under the THRF rating, Taipei City received a total score of five points,
meaning that the city was seen as doing a good job in every rating category.</P>
      <P>Taipei County ranked behind the capital city with a score of four points, as its
efforts in promoting the safety of medicines failed to receive a point from
THRF.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan County, Kaohsiung City and Hualien County all received scores of three
points, while Keelung City, Hsinchu County, Taichung City, Taichung County,
Changhua County, Yunlin County, Tainan City, Tainan County, Taitung County and
Yilan County scored two points, according to the rating.</P>
      <P>Hsinchu City, Chiayi County, Chiayi City, Kaohsiung County, Pingtung County,
Nantou County and Miaoli County all got only one point.</P>
      <P>The foundation found that Kaohsiung City performed the best in the management of
medical service charges, while Taipei City, Hsinchu City and Chiayi County

    <HEADLINE>Government to study local government restructuring</HEADLINE>

      <P>The central government will form a task force to study issues related to the
implementation of restructuring Taiwan's administrative regions, such as the
number of seats for city councilors and county councilors and the rezoning of
local electoral districts, Deputy Minister of the Interior Lin Join-sane said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks at a briefing in the southern port city of Kaohsiung on the
rezoning of administrative districts, regional development and national land
planning.</P>
      <P>The forum was held after the Ministry of the Interior approved in June the
upgrading of Taipei County, a merger of Kaohsiung County and Kaohsiung City, a
merger of Taichung City and Taichung County, and a merger of Tainan City with
Tainan County into special municipalities.</P>
      <P>The  upgrade  and  mergers  are part  of the government's administrative
redistricting plan aimed at promoting cooperation between  the  existing
localities  and  enhancing  national competitiveness.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of the plan, the term of office for Kaohsiung magistrate and
county councilors will be extended for one year, and concerns have been raised
about how many seats there will be for Kaohsiung councilors and how many
electoral districts will be in the scheduled 2010 local elections for mayor and
councilors of the special municipality.</P>
      <P>At present, the Kaohisung city council has 44 councilors and the Kaohsiung
county council has 54 councilors. Rumors have been rife that the MOI plans to
slash the total number of councilor seats to 52 after the merger of the two
administrative districts, but the sensitive issue was not touched upon during
the forum.</P>
      <P>However, according to a resolution reached in a Kaohisung city council meeting,
the council supports a proposal initiated by Taichung City that one councilor
should be elected to represent every 35,000 people.</P>
      <P>Under such a formula, Kaohsiung City, with its population of 1.53 million, would
be able to elect 44 councilors, while Kaohsiung County would get 36 councilors.</P>
      <P>Lin said the MOI is gathering public opinion and will form a panel for the
planning of related issues, while local governments will set up task forces to
coordinate with the central government and implement the administrative
redistricting plan.</P>
      <P>He added that the MOI has also drafted comprehensive laws and regulations for
implementation of the national land plan.</P>
      <P>Research, Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC) Chairman Jiang Yi-huah
noted that the restructuring of administrative regions is aimed  at promoting
balanced  development  among  regional administrative units.</P>
      <P>He added that after the mergers and upgrades, the central government will
allocate more funds for local governments, which in return will be required to
shoulder more responsibilities, including supervising general and vocational
high schools, hospitals, sharing payment of national health premiums, and taking
charge of flood prevention.</P>

      <P>Chinese tourists in Taiwan spend an average of NT$52,640 (11,000 Chinese yuan)
each during their stays in Taiwan, nearly double the NT$27,850 (6,600 HK
dollars) spent by each Hong Kong tourist, a survey has found.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a survey commissioned by Visa Inc. and conducted by
Research International, 90 percent of Chinese tourists and 87 percent of Hong
Kong visitors have a positive impression of travel in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition, 63 percent of tourists from China and 75 percent from Hong Kong
were impressed by the Taiwan people's hospitality, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>Sun Moon Lake in central Taiwan's Nantou County and Alishan in Chiayi County in
the south are the two most popular destinations among Chinese tourists, while
Hong Kong visitors find Kenting, Alishan, Yangmingshan and Sun Moon Lake the
most attractive places in Taiwan, the survey indicated.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese respondents in the poll named Alishan, Taroko National Park and
Kenting as the top leisure spots.</P>
      <P>Over 70 percent of Chinese and Hong Kong tourists listed Taiwan's night markets
and hot springs as must-see attractions.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, oyster omelets were voted as the most popular snack sold in Taiwan's
night markets, while pineapple cake was selected as the best speciality food in
Taiwan, followed by tea and sun cakes.</P>
      <P>About 60 percent of the Hong Kong respondents and 67 percent of Taiwanese said
steamed dumplings are the number one delicacy in the country, but less than 50
percent of Chinese tourists agreed.</P>
      <P>More than a half of the Chinese respondents said they prefer Taiwanese-style
cuisine, dantsu noodle, beef noodle soup and ginger duck.</P>
      <P>The survey interviewed 654 people over the age of 20 from Taiwan, Hong Kong and
China, during the period April 25- May 4.</P>

      <P>Taiwan reported Tuesday three new severe cases of influenza A(H1N1) infection,
as well as a severe infection of the seasonal type-A flu H3N2.</P>
      <P>Lin Ding, deputy director-general of the Center for Disease Control (CDC), said
at a press conference that the three A(H1N1) -infected patients include a 32
-year-old male chef living in the central Taiwan city of Taichung, who was being
treated in an isolation ward.</P>
      <P>The other patients are two kindergarten boys -- one aged five and the other
three. None of the three, although all were suffering from the complication of
pneumonia, were in critical condition, Lin said.</P>
      <P>CDC Director-General Steve Kuo attributed their non-critical status to the
strategy of giving them anti-viral drugs soon after they were diagnosed.</P>
      <P>The new cases brought the number of severe A(H1N1) cases in the country to nine,
including one fatality. So far, only two of the patients have been discharged
from hospital after recovering, according to CDC statistics.</P>
      <P>The tallies also show that since July 1, Taiwan has reported 16 flu cluster
infections involving over 600 people. One of the cluster infections was caused
by the A virus subtype H3N2.</P>
      <P>The only H3N2 cluster infection was reported in a dance troupe at an elementary
school in Taipei that had recently returned from a tour of Shenzhen in southern
China.</P>
      <P>Lin said that some of the troupe fell sick July 22 during their stay in
Shenzhen. After they came back to Taiwan, one member's brother, who has never
traveled abroad, also came down with a fever, Lin added.</P>
      <P>A total of 11 people were sickened in the cluster infection, six of whom were
infected with H3N2, Lin said.</P>
      <P>He noted that it is still unknown whether the infections were related to current
H3N2 outbreaks in Hong Kong. "It is possible the patients contracted the virus
in Taiwan, or in Shenzhen or Hong Kong" judging from the outbreak, Lin said.</P>
      <P>H3N2 is a subtype of the flu virus that can infect birds and mammals. In humans,
birds and pigs, the virus has mutated into many strains and the recent local
outbreaks have caught the attention of the authorities.</P>

      <P>Allianz, one of the largest financial services providers in the world, will
recruit 1,000 new employees this year in an effort to expand its presence in the
Taiwan market, the CEO of the company's Taiwan subsidiary said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chris James made the announcement at an event to celebrate the opening of a
client service center at Allianz Taiwan Life Insurance Co. amid rumors that the
German insurance giant is reeling from the global financial crunch and therefore
considering withdrawing from the Taiwan market.</P>
      <P>He said that the new client service center was set up to meet customer demand.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, James, who is also chairman of the Insurance Committee of the
European Chamber of Commerce in Taipei (ECCT), reiterated his opposition  to  a
government  plan  to  tax  earnings  from investment-linked life insurance
products.</P>
      <P>He said that it is unfair to deny the long-standing socially recognized system
that offers customers transparent,  flexible, cost-effective life insurance and
savings as an alternative to less flexible and more opaque traditional products.</P>
      <P>He criticized the government's decision on the issue as a misstep, saying that
it will erode public confidence in investment.</P>
      <P>The subsidiary company suggested that the government should first amend the
relevant laws before implementing the tax reform plan.</P>

      <P>Prosecutors rejected Tuesday requests for plea bargains by several relatives of
former President Chen Shui-bian involved in his corruption and money-laundering
case.</P>
      <P>They  are  the  former  president's  son Chen  Chih-chung, daughter-in-law Huang
Jui-ching, brother-in-law Wu Ching-mao and sister-in-law Chen Chun-ying.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-chung acted as a proxy for the former first family's controversial
overseas bank accounts, while Huang, Wu and Chen Chun-ying were some of the
nominal account holders.</P>
      <P>Lin Che-hui, a prosecutor from the Special Investigation Division of the Supreme
Prosecutors Office, told a Taipei District Court hearing that the prosecution
decided not to consider the defendants' requests because they played a major
part in the money-laundering case and are still under investigation in other
related cases.</P>
      <P>The fact that Chen Chih-chung and his wife Huang Jui-ching have so far not wired
the overseas funds back to Taiwan is another reason why their requests were
turned down, prosecutorial sources said.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife Wu Shu-jen are accused of siphoning off NT$104 million
(US$3.15 million)  from a special Presidential  Office discretionary fund during
his term as president from 2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>They are also charged with accepting bribes totaling NT$300 million in
connection with a land deal between the Hsinchu Science Park and Dayu
Development Corp. and with receiving kickbacks totaling NT$90.93 million between
2002 and 2003 to help a contractor win the tender to build the Nangang
Exhibition Hall.</P>
      <P>In addition, the couple allegedly took bribes totaling NT$310 million from
former Taipei Financial Center Corp. Chairwoman Diana Chen and former Chinatrust
Financial Holdings Co. Vice Chairman Jeffrey Koo Jr.</P>
      <P>The couple allegedly secretly stashed the funds overseas through various
intermediaries, including members of their own family, all of whom have also
been indicted for offenses relating to Chen and Wu.</P>
      <P>The court is expected to announce its verdict on Sept. 11.</P>

      <P>A cultural festival and traditional sports competition for Taiwan's indigenous
people will be staged Saturday in Yuanlin, Changhua County, with representatives
of the Bunun tribe officiating at the opening ceremony, county officials
announced Tuesday at a news conference.</P>
      <P>According to officials of the local civil affairs bureau, the primary aim of the
festival and competition is to allow the more than 4,700 indigenous people
residing in the central Taiwan county to gain a fresh understanding of their
traditional rituals, arts and culture and pass them on to the younger
generations.</P>
      <P>The event, sponsored annually by the Changhua County government, features on a

      <P>This year's festival will highlight the Bunun tribe.</P>
      <P>Leaders, revered elders and representatives of all the tribes living in Changhua

      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) gave a green light Tuesday to measures allowing
elementary schools to give extra classes in Chinese and foreign languages to
children of foreign spouses, a ministry official said that day.</P>
      <P>Lu Hung-lin, director of the MOE's Department of Elementary Education, said the
measures are aimed at helping these school children sharpen their language
abilities and more quickly adapt to school life, and are part of the
government's efforts to foster bilingual talent in its pursuit of an
international competitive edge.</P>
      <P>Apart from offering extra Chinese language classes on campuses, elementary
schools  are permitted  to employ experts to give extra-curricular classes in
the mother tongues of the students of foreign spouses of Taiwanese citizens.</P>
      <P>It has been estimated that more than 30,000 children born into such families in
Taiwan will enroll in first grade classes in September at primary schools around
the country, Lu added.</P>
      <P>The government has since 2004 adopted a series of measures to assist elementary
school students of the so-called "new immigrants" to improve their learning at
school and their family relationships at home, in view of the rising number of
foreign wives from China and Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>At present, children born to foreign husbands and wives of local people account
for about 10 percent of Taiwan's newborns each year, he noted. The ratio peaked
at 13 percent in 2003 and gradually dropped to 9.6 percent in 2008.</P>

      <P>At least seven U.S. and European insurers are expected to attend a news
conference to be held by the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Taipei to
express their opposition to a proposal by Taiwan to tax income from investment-
linked insurance products, an AmCham official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The prospective  participants  are Allianz,  MetLife,  HSBC Insurance, Manulife,
New York Life Insurance, Cardif Assurance Vie and Prudential Life, all of which
are members of either AmCham or the European Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT),
said Lee Wood, chairman of AmCham's Insurance Committee.</P>
      <P>They will also clarify misunderstanding among some members of the public about
investment-linked insurance products, Wood said.</P>
      <P>He said it is important that customers have the option of investment-linked
products because they provide an additional and transparent layer of financial
security for customers who could otherwise lose their savings to other general
creditors if an insurer were to fail.</P>
      <P>On July 24, the Tax Reform Committee under the Executive Yuan adopted a
resolution to treat earnings from unit-linked insurance products as taxable
income. Gains of up to NT$270,000 would be tax-exempt under the existing
exemption for interest income, but amounts beyond that would be subject to
taxation.</P>
      <P>The committee also suggested that proceeds from policies where the policyholder
and beneficiary are not the same person be subject to a 10 percent gift tax on
benefits of over NT$2.2 million.</P>
      <P>The proposal met immediate objections from AmCham and the ECCT, both of which
warned that it would discourage consumer saving and damage Taiwan's insurance
industry.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the issue, officials from the Financial Supervisory Commission
(FSC) said Tuesday that the resolution adopted by the Tax Reform Committee is
not final and that the FSC will continue to communicate with the Ministry of
Finance's Taxation Agency on the issue.</P>

      <P>Taipei City was rated the best among 20 cities and counties in Taiwan proper, as
well as the two special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung, in terms of
healthcare governance, according to rating results released Tuesday by the
Taiwan Healthcare Reform Foundation (THRF).</P>
      <P>In the 2009 healthcare governance rating, Taipei City scored in each of five
rating categories -- medical resources, charges for medical treatment services,
safety of medicines, services for the less-privileged, and settlement of medical
disputes.</P>
      <P>In each category, either "one point" or "zero" is given as a score, which
denotes "good" or "in need of improvement" performance of local governments in
healthcare administration.</P>
      <P>Under the THRF rating, Taipei City received a total score of five points,
meaning that the city was seen as doing a good job in every rating category.</P>
      <P>Taipei County ranked behind the capital city with a score of four points, as its
efforts in promoting the safety of medicines failed to receive a point from
THRF.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan County, Kaohsiung City and Hualien County all received scores of three
points, while Keelung City, Hsinchu County, Taichung City, Taichung County,
Changhua County, Yunlin County, Tainan City, Tainan County, Taitung County and
Yilan County scored two points, according to the rating.</P>
      <P>Hsinchu City, Chiayi County, Chiayi City, Kaohsiung County, Pingtung County,
Nantou County and Miaoli County all got only one point.</P>
      <P>The foundation found that Kaohsiung City performed the best in the management of
medical service charges, while Taipei City, Hsinchu City and Chiayi County
offered the best services in providing medical treatment subsidies.</P>
      <P>In the category of the settlement of medical disputes, Taoyuan County was found
to be doing the best job, the THRF said.</P>

      <P>The central government will form a task force to study issues related to the
implementation of restructuring Taiwan's administrative regions, such as the
number of seats for city councilors and county councilors and the rezoning of
local electoral districts, Deputy Minister of the Interior Lin Join-sane said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks at a briefing in the southern port city of Kaohsiung on the
rezoning of administrative districts, regional development and national land
planning.</P>
      <P>The forum was held after the Ministry of the Interior approved in June the
upgrading of Taipei County, a merger of Kaohsiung County and Kaohsiung City, a
merger of Taichung City and Taichung County, and a merger of Tainan City with
Tainan County into special municipalities.</P>
      <P>The  upgrade  and  mergers  are part  of the government's administrative
redistricting plan aimed at promoting cooperation between  the  existing
localities  and  enhancing  national competitiveness.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of the plan, the term of office for Kaohsiung magistrate and
county councilors will be extended for one year, and concerns have been raised
about how many seats there will be for Kaohsiung councilors and how many
electoral districts will be in the scheduled 2010 local elections for mayor and
councilors of the special municipality.</P>
      <P>At present, the Kaohisung city council has 44 councilors and the Kaohsiung
county council has 54 councilors. Rumors have been rife that the MOI plans to
slash the total number of councilor seats to 52 after the merger of the two
administrative districts, but the sensitive issue was not touched upon during
the forum.</P>
      <P>However, according to a resolution reached in a Kaohisung city council meeting,
the council supports a proposal initiated by Taichung City that one councilor
should be elected to represent every 35,000 people.</P>
      <P>Under such a formula, Kaohsiung City, with its population of 1.53 million, would
be able to elect 44 councilors, while Kaohsiung County would get 36 councilors.</P>
      <P>Lin said the MOI is gathering public opinion and will form a panel for the
planning of related issues, while local governments will set up task forces to
coordinate with the central government and implement the administrative
redistricting plan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government to study local government restructuring</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Aug. 4 (CNA)
08/05/09  08:31:09
(By Y.L. Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The central government will form a task force to study issues related to the
implementation of restructuring Taiwan's administrative regions, such as the
number of seats for city councilors and county councilors and the rezoning of
local electoral districts, Deputy Minister of the Interior Lin Join-sane said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks at a briefing in the southern port city of Kaohsiung on the
rezoning of administrative districts, regional development and national land
planning.</P>
      <P>The forum was held after the Ministry of the Interior approved in June the
upgrading of Taipei County, a merger of Kaohsiung County and Kaohsiung City, a
merger of Taichung City and Taichung County, and a merger of Tainan City with
Tainan County into special municipalities.</P>
      <P>The  upgrade  and  mergers  are part  of the government's administrative
redistricting plan aimed at promoting cooperation between  the  existing
localities  and  enhancing  national competitiveness.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of the plan, the term of office for Kaohsiung magistrate and
county councilors will be extended for one year, and concerns have been raised
about how many seats there will be for Kaohsiung councilors and how many
electoral districts will be in the scheduled 2010 local elections for mayor and
councilors of the special municipality.</P>
      <P>At present, the Kaohisung city council has 44 councilors and the Kaohsiung
county council has 54 councilors. Rumors have been rife that the MOI plans to
slash the total number of councilor seats to 52 after the merger of the two
administrative districts, but the sensitive issue was not touched upon during
the forum.</P>
      <P>However, according to a resolution reached in a Kaohisung city council meeting,
the council supports a proposal initiated by Taichung City that one councilor
should be elected to represent every 35,000 people.</P>
      <P>Under such a formula, Kaohsiung City, with its population of 1.53 million, would
be able to elect 44 councilors, while Kaohsiung County would get 36 councilors.</P>
      <P>Lin said the MOI is gathering public opinion and will form a panel for the
planning of related issues, while local governments will set up task forces to
coordinate with the central government and implement the administrative
redistricting plan.</P>
      <P>He added that the MOI has also drafted comprehensive laws and regulations for
implementation of the national land plan.</P>
      <P>Research, Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC) Chairman Jiang Yi-huah
noted that the restructuring of administrative regions is aimed  at promoting
balanced  development  among  regional administrative units.</P>
      <P>He added that after the mergers and upgrades, the central government will
allocate more funds for local governments, which in return will be required to
shoulder more responsibilities, including supervising general and vocational
high schools, hospitals, sharing payment of national health premiums, and taking
charge of flood prevention.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Younger fathers more willing to take child-rearing role: survey</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>There are significant generational differences on how Taiwanese fathers see
their role in raising children, with younger fathers more willing to be actively
involved in the child-rearing process, a recently conducted survey has found.</P>
      <P>The results of the survey, released Tuesday by Parenting magazine ahead of
Father's Day, revealed that 50 percent of fathers born in the 1950s are willing
to take parental leave, compared to 75 percent of younger fathers.</P>
      <P>Asked if they would give up a promotion for their families' sake, 62 percent to
67 percent of fathers born in the 1970s and 1980s said they would, considerably
higher than the 56 percent of respondents born in the 1950s who answered
affirmatively.</P>
      <P>The survey found that the most cited pressure or challenge of being a father was
"maintaining stable finances." Others cited included lacking an understanding
of what their children are thinking, differing with their wives on how to rear
children, and lacking time to keep their children company.</P>
      <P>Approximately 20 percent of fathers spend less than one hour per day with their
children, and more than 40 percent think they are not spending enough time with
their kids.</P>
      <P>Although most Taiwanese fathers remain in their stereotypical role as their
families' major income earners, many are showing shifts in their personal
values.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 46.92 percent of the respondents most valued family
happiness while 42.52 percent cited health as their top priority, both far
surpassing the 3.13 percent who listed wealth as their top priority and the 2.15
percent who paid most attention to career achievement.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between late June and early July among 1,023 fathers
aged between 19 and 58.</P>
      <P>Also surveyed were 1,572 mothers in the same age group, 56 percent of whom
described their husbands as willing to share the burden of household chores and
bring their children to and from school.</P>
      <P>Among the different types of husbands categorized according to their paternal
roles,  those who "do nothing"  are the most disappointing to the women,
according to the results.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials
Wednesday:</P>
      <P>CHINA TIMES:</P>
      <P>Yeh's decision has tied him to KMT Chairman Ma</P>
      <P>Department of Health Minister Yeh Ching-chuan's decision to step down to run for
Hualien County magistrate has put him on a treacherous path.</P>
      <P>He will now face a powerful local faction struggle and the notorious Kuomintang
election culture.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, even before taking over as KMT chairman, has used Yeh as
a litmus test of the loyalty of KMT members and their desire for reform.</P>
      <P>The KMT's "heavyweight" in Hualien has been convicted in court, and if the party
nominates him, it will not be in keeping with public expectations of Ma's vision
for integrity and reforms.</P>
      <P>Moreover,  if he is elected,  his victory could be later invalidated, which
would deal a heavy blow to the party and Ma.</P>
      <P>But other KMT members cannot match the popularity of the "heavyweight, " and
only if a candidate was "anointed" by Ma was there a chance  of persuading  the
"heavyweight'  to bow out voluntarily.</P>
      <P>Ma had to take this risky step.</P>
      <P>UNITED DAILY NEWS:</P>
      <P>KMT choice in Hualien magistrate election</P>
      <P>Yeh Ching-chuan's departure from the DOH amid mounting swine flu fears has been
severely criticized. Yeh may not be the one and only choice, but from where the
KMT stands, its first priority is to prevent KMT Legislator Fu Kun-chi from
running.</P>
      <P>Fu has demonstrated he is the most popular candidate by leading all other
aspirants in polls, but because he was convicted of violating the Securities
Transaction Law and sentenced to four years in jail, his joining the magistrate
race will become a potential headache.</P>
      <P>If Fu breaks away from the KMT and runs on his own, he still has the clout to
beat rivals from either major camp. But what if he is elected, only to have his
election victory later annulled? What if the scenario of "proxy" candidates
becomes a reality in by-elections?</P>
      <P>Since the legislative elections took place in January 2008, three legislators
have had their victories revoked because of their involvement in various cases.</P>
      <P>A by-election will be costly and will plunge local factions into a prolonged
struggle, which is why the KMT will not allow it to happen in Hualien.</P>
      <P>LIBERTY TIMES:</P>
      <P>Ma administration's coolness toward allies killing nation's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Since the inauguration of Ma Ying-jeou's administration in May 2008, 17 U.S.
congressmen and two U.S. governors have visited Taiwan, but no U.S. senators
have done so.</P>
      <P>Inviting influential U.S. senators to Taiwan is one of the major tasks of Ma's
administration, but the government has fared poorly in this area.</P>
      <P>This indicates that the U.S. government has misgivings about the Ma
administration's tilt toward China. The other possibility is that the Ma
administration has no intention of making efforts to deepen relations with
Washington.</P>
      <P>Ma's diplomatic truce policy toward China may have ended frosty cross-strait
relations, but it has also sent Taiwan's sovereignty plunging into a paralyzed
state of "diplomatic shock."</P>
      <P>For over one year, the Ma administration has kept its distance from countries
that are friendly toward Taiwan, but has seen China, which is doing everything
possible to swallow Taiwan, as a good friend.</P>
      <P>The so-called "cross-strait relations is paramount" outlook indicates that the
Ma administration's overall policy has led Taiwan's sovereignty into crisis.</P>
      <P>APPLE DAILY:</P>
      <P>Two films and democratic collapse</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong film "Miao Miao, " which was partially funded by Taiwan, was
withdrawn from the Melbourne International Film Festival after the festival's
organizer decided to air a documentary on exiled Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer and
invite her to Australia.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, opposition Legislator Chai Trong-rong revealed that a Chinese film
called "Jianguo Daye, " or "The Great Cause of China's Foundation," will be
aired in Taiwan Oct. 1.</P>
      <P>Just looking at its title, the film appears to be a politically charged
production without any artistic or entertainment value.</P>
      <P>The retraction of "Miao Miao" could be a bad omen for the future, a sign that
China's influence over Taiwan will penetrate more deeply into every corner of
life, and that Taiwan will follow in China's footsteps to blast the Dalai Lama
and the Uighur leader.</P>
      <P>Whether Taiwan's democracy can be sustained or will collapse hinges on the
government's attitude and policy toward these two films.</P>

period of nine months, during which the company should complete a capital
reduction and recapitalization  as soon as possible, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The FSC had required Kuo Hua to increase its capital by June.</P>
      <P>At a shareholders meeting in July, the company resolved to increase its capital
by NT$4 billion (US$122.32 million) after a reduction of NT$2 billion, but the
target was never achieved.</P>
      <P>Huang Tien-mu, director-general of the FSC's Insurance Bureau, said the
government will set the target for capital reduction and recapitalization
higher to strengthen  the company's financial structure and better protect the
interests of customers.</P>
      <P>As of the end of June, Kuo Hua had a negative net worth of NT$57.9 billion, with
assets valued at NT$246 billion, and 2 million policyholders, FSC data showed.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that the company's problems were the result of a weak financial
structure rather than day-to-day operations and that during the takeover period,
customers'  rights will be fully protected.</P>
      <P>He promised that the company will continue to operate as usual, collecting
premium payments, and handling insurance coverage, policy loans and contract
alterations or termination.</P>
      <P>With liquidity of NT$120 billion, the company will be capable of handling any
normal business needs or abnormal situations, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) on Wednesday  reported five more clusters
of influenza  A (H1N1) infections, including the first case affecting hospital
staff.</P>
      <P>The CDC has ruled out the possibility that the victims contracted the new swine
flu strain within hospital premises, CDC Deputy Director-General Lin Ting said.</P>
      <P>All of the victims in the case were workers in the hospital's research division,
who could have been infected while taking part in a conference held outside the
hospital, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The other four clusters occurred in local schools, affecting a total of 80 to 90
students, he said.</P>
      <P>The CDC estimated  that the number of influenza A (H1N1) infections in local
communities is increasing at a rate of 4,000 per week, four times faster than
four to five weeks ago.</P>
      <P>The rapid spread of the virus is reflected in the frequent occurrence of
infection clusters in local schools, CDC officials said.</P>
      <P>Also Wednesday, Mingtao High School in Wurih Township, Taichung County decided
to suspend classes for seven days, after five students in a class were confirmed
to have been infected with the H1N1 strain of the influenza A virus.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chinese bank cards usable in Taiwan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  5 (CNA)

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese visitors will be able to make purchases in Taiwan with bank cards issued
by the China-based China UnionPay Co. from Aug. 7, a move that will facilitate
spending by Chinese tourists and help boost business for local companies, the
Taipei-based National Credit Card Center (NCCC) announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The decision will allow Chinese visitors to make purchases in Taiwan using their
China UnionPay bank cards instead of cash, NCCC General Manager Wong Kuang-hui
said. At present, Chinese tourists are permitted to bring with them a maximum of
20,000 Chinese yuan (US$2,928) in cash per visit.</P>
      <P>The two sides are slated to make a joint announcement of the decision Aug. 7 at
the National Palace Museum in suburban Taipei -- one year after Taiwan relaxed
restrictions on visits by tourists from China, he added.</P>
      <P>China UnionPay is China's only national electronic payment network, an umbrella
network that covers more than 80 banking institutions. As the dominant player in
China's bank card industry, it currently has more than 1.8 billion cards in
circulation, which are accepted in 61 countries and regions outside China.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, a China UnionPay delegation led by the company's president,
Xu Luode, arrived in Taipei to announce the decision,  made possible by the
acquiescence of the Taiwanese authorities.</P>
      <P>Speaking on his second visit to Taiwan, Xu hailed the Taiwanese authorities'
decision to accept the use of bank cards issued by China UnionPay.</P>
      <P>"It will not only significantly help increase business volume on both sides but
will also mark a milestone in two-way financial cooperation and facilitate
Chinese visitors' spending in Taiwan, " he said.</P>
      <P>His delegation members included executives from major Chinese banking
institutions such as the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the
Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China,  China Construction Bank and Bank of
Communications.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Taiwan-based Chinatrust Commercial Bank, Taiwan's largest
card issuer, have estimated that Chinese tourists' spending volume in Taiwan is
likely to hit NT$100 billion (US$3.05 billion) , based on 2 million tourist
arrivals from China per year with an average spending in Taiwan of 10,000 yuan.</P>
      <P>Government statistics show that tourist arrivals from China have totaled 380,000
since Taiwan opened its doors wider to Chinese tourists in July 2008. Daily
spending by Chinese tourists averaged US$295 during the first six months of the
opening.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Beauty a top priority for Taiwanese students during summer break</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/05/09  16:23:14</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>What are Taiwanese students doing during summer vacation? Instead of taking
classes for extra credits, earning pocket money, or traveling, many are using
the time off to get beauty treatments and plastic surgery.</P>
      <P>Cosmetology  and plastic surgery clinics are reporting  an increasing number of
student clients since the summer break began, and the Plastic Surgical
Association, Republic of China, and the Taiwan Society of Aesthetic Plastic
Surgery, have confirmed the trend.</P>
      <P>The two professional associations, which represent certified aesthetic doctors
and plastic surgeons, respectively, say it is impossible to get an accurate
estimate of how big the market is and how much it grows every year, mainly
because such treatments are not covered by Taiwan's national health insurance
program.</P>
      <P>Individual beauty clinics, however, are reporting year-on-year increases  in the
number of young people undergoing  cosmetic procedures, with the number even
doubling in July compared to previous months.</P>
      <P>"Business in cosmetic procedures has surged in July and August due to the
increasing number of student customers, whether they are from Taiwan or abroad,
" says Tseng Chung-ren, a dermatologist who owns a medical cosmetic center and
clinic in downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>Tseng told the Central News Agency that Taiwanese students would normally
constitute 20 percent of his clientele, but that has jumped to 40 percent this
summer, while another 20-30 percent are students from abroad and the remaining
customers are local women aged 25-45.</P>
      <P>Chao Tzi-kang, the director of a beauty clinic in Taipei's Ximending, a popular
shopping district and a gathering place for students, has seen a similar trend,
saying that student customers generally increase during the summer.</P>
      <P>The long  break  provides  enough  time  for students  or newly-graduated young
adults to recover from the procedures before entering a new school or the
workforce, as more and more people put greater emphasis on their appearance,
both Tseng and Chao observed.</P>
      <P>The increasingly competitive job market, especially in the current economic
downturn, is prompting people to acquire what they consider more advantageous
features or at least get rid of blemishes and imperfections, all to improve
their chances of getting hired.</P>
      <P>"Patients come to have cosmetic treatment for a better look and to boost their
confidence. The patients are getting younger and younger," Tseng said.</P>
      <P>Even the number of elementary school students being brought in by their parents
for simple treatments, such as mole removal surgery, has increased recently, he
added.</P>
      <P>Young patients go for different treatments depending on their age. Mole and
birthmark removals are common for elementary school students. Acne treatments,
and scar and tattoo removals are popular among high school students.</P>
      <P>And among university students, hair removal, blepharoplasty (double eyelid
surgery), and micro-plastic surgery, such as botox or rhinoplasty using
hyaluronic acid, are in big demand, according to Tseng.</P>
      <P>Hair removal procedures, especially the removal of leg hair for girls, and
armpit odor treatments, are particularly popular among the college crowd, Tseng
said.</P>
      <P>The cost for the former starts at NT$30,000 (US$916) and can go as high as
NT$100,000, depending on the body part, while the latter ranges from NT$20,000
to NT$40,000. The popular surgery to have double eyelids, meanwhile, costs
NT$30,000.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese students studying abroad opt for cosmetic treatments during their
summer break because of Taiwan's high-quality medical sector and relatively low
costs. Local procedures sometimes cost one-tenth the amount charged for the same
procedures in Western countries, Tseng said.</P>
      <P>There is also an increasing number of young men coming to have cosmetic
procedures, according to Chao. He noted that 40 percent of his patients under
the age of 20 are male and most of them come for skin treatments.</P>
      <P>I find that many young male patients are more open-minded than before and will
even make more of an effort than before to look after their skin following the
procedures,Chao said.</P>
      <P>A senior in college surnamed Lin told CNA that he has undergone a series of
laser acne scar removal treatments because the problem has bothered him for a
long time.</P>
      <P>"I decided I had had enough and that I had to get rid of it, " said Lin, who is
in the final stage of the treatment with barely any marks visible on his face.</P>
      <P>Noting that he used to feel ashamed and avoided talking to friends for fear that
they would stare at his acne, Lin said the treatment helped boost his confidence
in his appearance  and self-esteem when facing people.</P>
      <P>Now I can look directly into people's eyes when I talk to them," he said.</P>
      <P>Lin's father, who is paying for the course of six treatments that cost a total
of around NT$100,000, said he totally supports his son's decision.</P>
      <P>"My son feels that the procedures will help him look better and be more
confident, and I think it is OK to do so, as long as the procedures are safe, "
Lin's father said.</P>
      <P>Chao from the Ximending clinic says more parents now bring their children to
cosmetic surgery clinics to have moles and birthmarks removed because some are
paying greater attention to their children's looks while others know their
children worry about their flaws but are unwilling to say so.</P>
      <P>From a professional point of view, it is also good that many parents let their
children have the procedures while they are still young, since most of the moles
or birthmarks should be removed sooner rather than later,according to Chao.</P>
      <P>Both Chao and Tseng suggested patients do some research in advance before
deciding to undergo plastic surgery.</P>
      <P>They also stressed the importance of patients having thorough discussions with
doctors to help their doctor get a better feel for their needs and learn more
about a treatment's effectiveness and risks.</P>
      <P>Tseng said it is better for patients to undergo a treatment over an extended
period of time rather than trying to compress procedures into a limited time
frame because the risks and side-effects are lower.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the doctors said many people incorrectly believe that it is better to
have laser skin treatments in the winter rather than the summer because  there
is less of a chance of developing pigmentation disorders.</P>
      <P>In fact, side-effects such as temporary pigmentation disorders are reactions to
inflammation resulting from skin treatments rather than due to exposure to
sunshine, and they are normal and inevitable.</P>
      <P>Patients should therefore not overreact to or worry about such skin reactions
because the problem will be resolved in one to three months if they follow their
doctor's instructions and take good care of their skin, the experts said.</P>
      <P>These cosmetic treatments, however, are not always safe or satisfactory, said
Hung Chia-huei, an official of the Plastic Surgical Association, Republic of
China.</P>
      <P>She told CNA that among the complaints her group receives from cosmetic surgery
patients, most are related to disappointment with a treatment's outcome or to
disputes with the clinic over the cost of the procedure, especially in a market
where prices charged vary widely among clinics.</P>
      <P>The organization, however, has no power to govern beauty clinics or punish
doctors guilty of malpractice who do not belong to the organization, Hung said,
indicating that it can only refer patients to seek help from the Department of
Health.</P>
      <P>Lin Shih-li, a spokeswoman for the Teacher Chang Foundation, a civic counseling
group for teenagers, warned that plastic surgery should not be encouraged among
young people because they are not mature enough and are easily influenced by the
mass media, pop culture and peer pressure.</P>
      <P>She noted that parents, therefore, play an extremely important role in guiding
their children.</P>
      <P>Your self-value is not about the beauty of your appearance but rather determined
by the confidence and self-esteem gained through interactions with others and
being a responsible person,Lin said.</P>
      <P>"As your external beauty fades over time, your overall character, which
represents who you really are as a person, becomes the charisma that will last
forever,she said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Local firm raises NT$4 million for school fees</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The local chapter of the Christian charity World Vision said Wednesday that
Inventec Appliances Corp. (IAC) has raised more than NT$4 million (US$122,000)
in a one-month drive to help 1,335 disadvantaged students attending primary and
junior high schools around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>From July 1-31, the Taiwan-based manufacturer of Smart Handheld and network
appliances partnered with World Vision to raise money through a "Love Loaf" coin
donation program, mobile phone sales, donations from the corporation and its
employees, as well as a World Vision account designated specifically for the
cause.</P>
      <P>World Vision Taiwan said it has already identified 710 primary school students
and 625 junior high school students who will receive tuition aid to help ease
the financial burden on their families when it comes to paying fees for the
upcoming school year.</P>
      <P>According to World Vision Taiwan, IAC President Daniel Lee sent an internal
message to encourage his employees to support the cause, given that many
businesses have been forced to close factories or lay off employees in response
to the impact of the financial crisis. As a result, many low-income families
lost their only source of income and were pushed deeper into poverty.</P>
      <P>"Although they may not go hungry immediately, their children risk dropping out
of school. Let's do our small part to save children from losing the only
opportunity they have to break out of the vicious cycle of poverty, " Lee was
quoted as saying in a press statement released by World Vision Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Financial contributions from the IAC appeal will be offered to students living
in cities and countries that recorded the highest jobless rates in the first
half of the year -- Taipei County, Taoyuan County, Taichung City, Taichung
County, Nantou County, Tainan County, Kaohsiung City and Hualien County.</P>
      <P>According to the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics under
the Executive Yuan, the unemployment rate climbed to 5.94 percent in June,
representing 647,000 people out of work.</P>
      <P>This year, World Vision Taiwan plans to help finance 45,000 children to stay in
school.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan plays vital role in polio eradication effort: Rotary president</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese Rotarians play an important role in the global effort to eradicate
polio and have made great contributions to the cause, John Kenny, president of
the civic service group Rotary International, said Wednesday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"I think the contributions made (here in Taiwan) are tremendous contributions,
probably out of proportion to the size of the country compared to other
countries in the world," Kenny told CNA in an interview.</P>
      <P>A retired judge and a notary from Grangemouth, Scotland, Kenny is on his first
foreign visit in his capacity as president of Rotary International. He took
office July 1, becoming the first Scotsman to head the international
humanitarian service organization in its 105-year history.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan, which was declared polio-free by the World Health
Organization in 2000 and has had no polio cases since 1991, can serve as a good
example and share its experience with other countries in fighting against the
disease.</P>
      <P>Kenny suggested that Taiwan's landmark skyscraper Taipei 101 consider doing a
light projection promotion that reads "End Polio Now," which he said will give a
boost to the global effort and will be good publicity for the country.</P>
      <P>For more than 20 years, the eradication of polio has been Rotary's top priority,
and Kenny said that a final push is needed to vanquish the crippling,
potentially deadly disease once and for all, especially in countries like India,
Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria where polio is pandemic.</P>
      <P>Kenny said that during his one-year term as president, it's important for him to
visit as many countries as possible where there are Rotary clubs and that he
particularly wanted to visit Taiwan early in his term to thank Rotary members in
Taiwan for their outstanding service.</P>
      <P>"You have done great humanitarian work internationally, " said Kenny, adding
that he also expressed this view and his sincere appreciation to President Ma
Ying-jeou in a meeting the day before.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwanese Rotarians have donated water purifiers for 42 schools in
north Thailand, provided medical supplies and other necessities for people in
war-torn Cambodia villages and helped street children in the Philippines and
Brazil.</P>
      <P>Rotary is very strong in Taiwan compared to the total population and is one of
the top donors to the Rotary charity, Rotary Foundation, Kenny said.</P>
      <P>Rotary held its annual convention in Taiwan in 1994 and is looking forward to
returning, as Taipei is perceived as a safe city and is therefore an attractive
venue, he said.</P>
      <P>After he concludes his three-day visit to Taiwan Aug. 6, Kenny will visit Hong
Kong, Shanghai and Beijing.</P>
      <P>He said he hopes that China will one day relax its regulations on non-
governmental organizations like Rotary International, as only foreign
expatriates in China are allowed to join the civic group at present.</P>
      <P>However, China will most likely change its stance on that issue over the course
of time, he added.</P>
      <P>Kenny intimated that as long as he is president of Rotary, the organization will
not initiate any changes in Taiwan on the basis of considerations for China's
position.</P>
      <P>"It's up to people in this country to decide what they want to do. Rotary
International will not force them to do anything that they don't want to, as
long as I'm the president, " Kenny said. "You don't abandon your friends."</P>

      <P>New Century InfoComm Tech., one of Taiwan's major telecom players, has begun to
provide broadband access services to Dahu village in Chiayi County's Fanlu
township, the National Communications Commission (NCC) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>With the first broadband network for remote areas completed this year, the
commission is confident of achieving its policy goal of "broadband in every
tribe and village, " which is part of Taiwan's telecommunication universal
service program.</P>
      <P>The launch ceremony of the Power Line Communication and Broadband Universal
Service was held at the township's Dahu elementary school, the commission said.</P>
      <P>Those officiating at the ceremony included Chiayi Magistrate Chen Ming-wen, NCC
Chairwoman Bonnie Peng and NCC Commissioner Hsieh Chin-nan.</P>
      <P>Under the Regulations on Telecommunication Universal Services, New Century
InfoComm has completed its construction of broadband connection networks to
offer high-speed Internet access service in Dahu.</P>
      <P>The service allows students at the elementary school to benefit from
opportunities provided by an "e-learning" program.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the NCC pledged that day that broadband services will be available in
every aboriginal village in Taiwan by 2010.</P>
      <P>Of the country's 730 indigenous villages, 54 still do not have access to
broadband Internet. The commission will meet its policy goal when broadband
services are available to all tribal villages in Taiwan's remote areas in 2010,
according to an NCC news release. This year, the project will cost NT$77 million
(US$2.35 million), which will come from the general telecommunication fund, with
30 of the designated sites located in tribal villages, according to the
commission.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Local hospital operators and pharmaceutical manufacturers have decided to
postpone indefinitely their street protest plans due to an imminent change at
the top of the Department of Health (DOH), medical sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The International Research-based Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association
(IRPMA) and the Taiwan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (TPMA) had
planned to mobilize up to 1,000 of their members to take to the streets Friday
in protest against the Bureau of National Health Insurance's (BNHI) decision to
cut its payments for pharmaceuticals by NT$10 billion (US$303 million) with
effect from Sept.1.</P>
      <P>"We have decided to suspend the plan for the time being as the new DOH minister,
Yang Chih-liang, will soon assume office, " said IRPMA Secretary-General Cheng
Hsing.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, the two professional associations made a decision to stage
demonstrations only after outgoing DOH Minister Yeh Ching-chuan refused to meet
with representatives of the two groups to discuss issues related to the BNHI's
payment for pharmaceutical products.</P>
      <P>"It seems that his successor will be more willing to communicate with us on
relevant issues, therefore, we will adopt a wait-and-see attitude and will
decide later whether or not to go ahead with our protest plans," said Cheng.</P>
      <P>She was referring to Yang's remarks a day earlier that he will do his utmost to
communicate with local medical service providers and pharmaceutical
manufacturers because both groups are patrons of the DOH.</P>
      <P>Yeh resigned  Monday  in preparation  to seek  the ruling Kuomintang's candidacy
for the year-end magistrate election in the eastern county of Hualien.</P>
      <P>Yang, 62, will take over the DOH helm Thursday. He is a widely respected public
health educator, promoter and administrator. He has a Ph.D. in public health
from the University of Michigan and has served as DOH vice minister and Asia
University president.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsieh Wu-chi, president of the Taiwan Community Hospitals
Association, said his group will also suspend its plan to besiege the BNHI Aug.
12 in protest against  a new patient classification system, known as the
diagnosis-related group (DRG) system.</P>
      <P>The new DRG system will classify patients' illnesses into 967 categories and
will be phased in over the next six years.</P>
      <P>Under the new system, patients within each category will be expected to use the
same level of hospital resources and the health insurance bureau will pay the
hospital a fixed amount in accordance with the applicable rate within each
category.</P>
      <P>The first phase, which will take effect Sept.1, will cover 111 categories,
including appendectomy, caesarean section, hemorrhoid removal, hernia repair and
myomectomy.</P>
      <P>Hsieh argued that the new system will benefit large medical centers and deal yet
another blow to smaller community hospitals.</P>
      <P>His view was shared by Wu De-lon, president of the Taiwan Hospitals Association,
who argued that the new system could force smaller hospitals to refuse to admit
patients suffering from severe diseases.</P>
      <P>Wu said his association had originally planned to stage a demonstration at the
Legislative Yuan Aug. 13 to enlist lawmakers' support for its call to scrap the
new system in consideration of patients' rights.</P>
      <P>"But we are now having second thoughts as the new health minister will soon take
charge and we would not like to embarrass him soon after he assumes office. Our
association will call a meeting to decide whether to suspend the protest plan
for the time being, " Wu added.</P>

      <P>A group of Taiwanese citizens who hold bonds issued by the Japanese colonial
government petitioned the Ministry of Finance (MOF) Wednesday to help them seek
repayment from the Japanese side in a case has been unresolved for more than 60
years.</P>
      <P>According to the bondholders, after Taiwan was handed over to the Kuomintang
(KMT) government in 1945, the Japanese government notified Taiwan that between
1952 and 1967 it would accept redemption of bonds it had issued.</P>
      <P>However, the Taiwanese government did not seek repayment from Japan on behalf of
the bondholders within that period, so that holders have never received any
repayment, they said.</P>
      <P>In response to the petition, Deputy Minister of Finance Tseng Ming-Chung said
his ministry will work with the bondholders to find a solution to the problem.</P>
      <P>However, opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Lee Chun-yee,
who helped the bondholders negotiate the matter with the MOF, was unsatisfied
with ministry's failure to provide the bondholders with any substantive
commitment and said the DPP will continue to promote the enactment of a law to
require the government to reimburse the bondholders before seeking compensation
from the Japanese side.</P>
      <P>Similar legislation has been introduced by the DPP in the past but has been
blocked by KMT legislators.</P>

Wednesday after enjoying the beauty of the island from north to south.</P>
      <P>The vessel sailed from Taichung in central Taiwan to Keelung in the north that
day and was scheduled to embark for Hong Kong later in the day.</P>
      <P>As the more than 1,500 travelers, including 800 from China, bid farewell to

      <P>Some of them described Taiwan as a "home away from home" and some even wore

      <P>In three days of sightseeing, the tourists visited popular tourist spots such as

      <P>Six Taiwanese coast guard vessels embarked on a patrol of the Taiwan Strait
Wednesday at the launch of a new campaign to crack down against Chinese fishing
boats illegally straying into the Taiwan side of the strait to fish.</P>
      <P>It was the beginning of a reinforced effort by the Coastal Patrol Directorate
General (CPDG) to raid intruding Chinese fishing boats - a problem that arose
after China lifted its 30-month ban against fishing in the strait on Aug. 1.</P>
      <P>Freed from the ban, Chinese fishing vessels are expected to stray into Taiwan-
controlled water, CPDG Deputy General Director Lin Hsing-heng said at a ceremony
Wednesday in Makong City in the Penghu archipelago off southwestern Taiwan, to
mark the launch of the patrols.</P>
      <P>Already, Taiwanese coast guards discovered many Chinese boats illegally sailing
in the waters close to the Penghu archipelago on Tuesday, fishing wantonly,
according to Lin.</P>
      <P>Lin said many Chinese fishing boats spotted in the past use lethal drift gill
nets; trinal nets, which have three parts; and rolling-wheel nets for fishing.
This way of fishing damages the marine ecology and depletes marine resources,
Lin said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan was holding US$321.09 billion in foreign exchange reserves as of the end
of July, a record high amount that was US$3.53 billion more than the June
figure, the Central Bank of the Republic of China reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In late July, Taiwan was ranked as the world's fourth-largest holder of forex
reserves, after China, Japan and Russia, and ahead of India.</P>
      <P>Lin Sun-yuan, chief of the bank's Foreign Exchange Department, attributed the
forex reserves growth to the strong appreciation of its major currencies,like
the euro and Japanese yen,against the U.S. dollar, as well as returns from
foreign exchange reserve management.</P>
      <P>Statistics showed that the euro appreciated by 0.41 percent against the
greenback for the whole of July, while the Japanese yen gained 0.78 percent in
value against the U. S. currency.</P>
      <P>As of the end of June, China was holding the world's largest forex reserves,
worth US$2.13 trillion, ahead of Japan with US$988.5 billion, and Russia with

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) push for a referendum on
the government's proposal to sign an economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) with China is tantamount to "carrying coals to Newcastle," an official
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The DPP's campaign for an ECFA referendum is pointless and superfluous because
if the agreement is signed, it will be referred to the Legislative Yuan for
screening, " said Vice Minister of Economic Affairs John C.C. Deng.</P>
      <P>The pro-independence DPP filed an application with the Central Election
Commission (CEC) July 20 for the government to put the proposed ECFA with China
to a referendum. The DPP's appeal is now awaiting approval by a CEC screening
committee before it could progress to the next stage of obtaining a required
ratio of public signatures.</P>
      <P>Addressing a weekly meeting of the ruling Kuomintang's (KMT's) decision-making
Central Standing Committee on the ECFA proposal, Deng said the DPP's referendum
initiative is a waste of time and social resources  because  it would only spur
yet another  round of referendums.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that some people are still wary about the possible negative impact
of a Taiwan-China ECFA on the local economy, Deng said the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA)  will strengthen communications with various social sectors to
seek their support for the planned cross-strait trade pact.</P>
      <P>"We will try even harder to help the public understand that a cross-strait ECFA
will help improve local job market prospects and will be beneficial to Taiwan's
overall international relations," Deng said.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan fails to strike an ECFA deal with China, Taiwan would be further
marginalized when the "ASEAN plus 1" trade bloc -- comprised of China and ASEAN
member states -- becomes a reality Jan. 1, Deng warned.</P>
      <P>According to Deng, Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) could drop by an
estimated 0.176 percent if the two sides fail to sign an ECFA by then.</P>
      <P>Such a grim scenario could also take a toll on Taiwan's annual exports, imports
and trade surplus, driving them down by 0.421 percent, 0.601 percent and US$180
million, respectively, Deng said.</P>
      <P>However, if the ECFA is signed, Taiwan's employed population could increase by
257,000 to 263,000, he added.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Lee Chien-jung said after the meeting that the KMT will launch a
publicity campaign to help local people better understand the gist and
advantages of a cross-strait EFCA and to enlist their support for the
initiative.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's consumer price index (CPI) in July stood at 104.28 (base year 2006

while prices almost across-the-board were suppressed by the lingering recession,
government statistics showed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) reported
Wednesday that Taiwan's year-on-year CPI and its wholesale price index (WPI) had
both dropped considerably.</P>

      <P>A spokesman for the DGBAS said that as negative growth of the CPI is expected to
continue in the coming months, it raises the worry of deflation.</P>
      <P>A consistent decline in commodity prices over the past months had pushed the

      <P>The 2009 Taipei International Robot Show (TIROS) opened at the World Trade
Center's Nangang Exhibition Hall Wednesday to serve as a platform for Taiwan's
robotics industry to expand in domestic and foreign markets.</P>
      <P>The annual show, the second of its kind, was jointly organized by the Industrial
Department Bureau (IDB)  and the Department of Industrial Technology -- both
agencies under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, as well as the non-profit
Robotics Association Taiwan (ROBOAT).</P>
      <P>As the only professional robots exhibition in Taiwan, the event gathered 91
local and foreign companies, academic and research institutes, and civil
organizations devoted to robotics development.</P>
      <P>A total of 321 booths have been set up at the exhibition hall to showcase their
inventions and products.</P>
      <P>The exhibits at TIROS have been divided into two categories -- industrial robots
and service robots, with the category of industrial robots further divided into
robot arms, robot equipment, automation equipment, controller, and the
components of industrial robots.</P>
      <P>Service  robots  include  cleaning,  security,  educational, entertainment, and
life assistance robots.</P>
      <P>The showcase, however, is not the only activity of the four-day show, the
organizers said, noting that they have also prepared robotics contests, seminars
and conferences for industry leaders, experts and researchers so they can share
their insights on the robotics industry, as well as the sector's current and
future trends.</P>
      <P>According to the IDB, the venue was divided into several sections, including the
one that showcases the government's efforts to promote the intellectual robots
manufacturing industry over the past four years.</P>
      <P>The academic section exhibits 18 works by robotics laboratories of local
universities, such as National Taiwan University and National Taipei University
of Technology. It was hoped the laboratory projects will help increase the
cooperation between enterprises and technical-vocational education, the IDB
said.</P>
      <P>The robots experiencing section is the only area opened to children in the show.
In this section, kids can play with different robots and participate in DIY
activities and educational courses.</P>

      <P>As relations across the Taiwan Strait continue to warm up, more Taiwan
delegations are scheduled to visit China later this year, an official of the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Among others, a media delegation will embark on an exchange visit to China in
October following a trip to Taiwan last week by a high-profile  group  of
Chinese  journalists,  SEF  Deputy Secretary-General Ma Shao-chang said.</P>
      <P>The SEF is a quasi-official intermediary body authorized to handle cross-strait
exchanges and negotiations in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan has nearly 1,000 media organizations, Ma said, the SEF is still
working on the list of media groups that will be invited to form the delegation.</P>
      <P>"Basically, we will focus on inviting those who can contribute to cross-strait
journalistic exchanges and cooperation," said Ma.</P>
      <P>He added that the Liberty Times and SANLIH Entertainment TV, both of which  are
seen  as critics  of the  current  Kuomintang administration's reconciliatory
approach toward China, will be on the invitational list.</P>
      <P>As to whether the Formosa Weekly, a publication launched recently by former Vice
President Annette Lu, will be invited to join the delegation, Ma refrained from
giving a direct reply. He said instead that members of the delegation will be
composed of editors-in-chief or chief editorial writers of major news
organizations.</P>
      <P>"The name list is still in the works, " Ma said, adding that the media
delegation may be headed by SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma said he himself will also lead a delegation of experts and
business executives to China in October to discuss viable measures to better
protect the safety of Taiwanese business people operating in China.</P>
      <P>"The delegation will join with officials of the SEF's counterpart -- the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) -- to
craft an effective emergency communications mechanism to deal with any emergency
situations encountered by Taiwanese businessmen in China, " Ma said.</P>
      <P>Such a mechanism is badly needed to avoid recurrence of a recent case in which
the killing of two Taiwanese businessmen and serious injury of another in
Dongguan in the southern province of Guangdong was not immediately reported, he
said.</P>
      <P>According to the SEF's plan, Ma went on, the foundation will organize two more
Taiwanese delegations to visit China for cultural and judicial exchanges  before
the fourth round of high-level cross-strait talks between SEF Chairman Chiang
Pin-kung and ARATS President Chen Yunlin takes place late this year.</P>
      <P>The first group, to be headed by Liu Te-hsun, a vice chairman of the Cabinet-
level Mainalnd Affairs Council (MAC) which oversees SEF operations, is
tentatively set to depart late this month, with judicial topics high on its
agenda.</P>
      <P>The second delegation, to be headed by another MAC vice chairman, Chao Chien-
ming, is scheduled to visit Beijing, Xian and Keifong in September, with
cultural institutions and museums as main destinations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>While weathermen are alerting people to possible damage by the approaching
Typhoon Morakot, the Shihmen Reservoir Agency is hoping that the storm will
bring torrential rains that will help relieve the long dry spell at the 45-year-
old dam.</P>
      <P>Agency director Chiu Chung-chuan said Wednesday that the water level at the
reservoir had fallen to a critical 222.64 meters, although 7.5 million tons was
collected Tuesday during the heavy showers.</P>
      <P>In recent years, the water levels at the Shihmen Reservoir have fallen to
alarming lows in summer, according to Chien chao-chun, deputy director of the
Northern Region Water Resources Office.</P>
      <P>Originally designed mainly to supply water for irrigation in the Taoyuan region,
the reservoir now supplies households, farms, and a fast growing industrial
sector in the area.</P>
      <P>The population in the Taoyuan area has grown three-fold, from 500,000 in the
1960s to 1.8 million recently, and daily household consumption of water has
increased from 110,000 tons to 1.2 million tons, Chien said.</P>
      <P>He added that even as industrial pollution has contaminated many underground
water resources and farmers are relying heavily on the reservoir for irrigation,
its capacity has dropped considerably because many parts of the old dam have
silted up.</P>
      <P>The reservoir's storage capacity nowadays is 25 percent less than the 680,000
cubic meters it was originally designed to hold, Chien estimated.</P>
      <P>The water resources official said that as rainfall and other sources are not
sufficient to maintain an adequate storage level, the ultimate solution is to
develop new resources.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECFA referendum initiative superfluous: vice minister</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug.5 (CNA)
08/05/09  20:04:30
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) push for a referendum on
the government's proposal to sign an economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) with China is tantamount to "carrying coals to Newcastle," an official
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The DPP's campaign for an ECFA referendum is pointless and superfluous because
if the agreement is signed, it will be referred to the Legislative Yuan for
screening, " said Vice Minister of Economic Affairs John C.C. Deng.</P>
      <P>The pro-independence DPP filed an application with the Central Election
Commission (CEC) July 20 for the government to put the proposed ECFA with China
to a referendum. The DPP's appeal is now awaiting approval by a CEC screening
committee before it could progress to the next stage of obtaining a required
ratio of public signatures.</P>
      <P>Addressing a weekly meeting of the ruling Kuomintang's (KMT's) decision-making
Central Standing Committee on the ECFA proposal, Deng said the DPP's referendum
initiative is a waste of time and social resources  because  it would only spur
yet another  round of referendums.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that some people are still wary about the possible negative impact
of a Taiwan-China ECFA on the local economy, Deng said the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA)  will strengthen communications with various social sectors to
seek their support for the planned cross-strait trade pact.</P>
      <P>"We will try even harder to help the public understand that a cross-strait ECFA
will help improve local job market prospects and will be beneficial to Taiwan's
overall international relations," Deng said.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan fails to strike an ECFA deal with China, Taiwan would be further
marginalized when the "ASEAN plus 1" trade bloc -- comprised of China and ASEAN
member states -- becomes a reality Jan. 1, Deng warned.</P>
      <P>According to Deng, Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) could drop by an
estimated 0.176 percent if the two sides fail to sign an ECFA by then.</P>
      <P>Such a grim scenario could also take a toll on Taiwan's annual exports, imports
and trade surplus, driving them down by 0.421 percent, 0.601 percent and US$180
million, respectively, Deng said.</P>
      <P>However, if the ECFA is signed, Taiwan's employed population could increase by
257,000 to 263,000, he added.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Lee Chien-jung said after the meeting that the KMT will launch a
publicity campaign to help local people better understand the gist and
advantages of a cross-strait EFCA and to enlist their support for the
initiative.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's consumer price index (CPI) in July stood at 104.28 (base year 2006
=100), which was a 38-year record contraction of 2.33 percent year-on-year,
while prices almost across-the-board were suppressed by the lingering recession,
government statistics showed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) reported
Wednesday that Taiwan's year-on-year CPI and its wholesale price index (WPI) had
both dropped considerably.</P>
      <P>Government statistics have shown negative CPI growth for five consecutive months
since March. In the first seven months, the CPI was 0.71 percent lower than in
the same period last year.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the DGBAS said that as negative growth of the CPI is expected to
continue in the coming months, it raises the worry of deflation.</P>
      <P>A consistent decline in commodity prices over the past months had pushed the
July WPI down by 14.11 percent as compared with the same month last year.</P>
      <P>The import price index dropped 15.98 percent year-on-year and the export price
index fell 9.52 percent, according to the statistics.</P>

      <P>The 2009 Taipei International Robot Show (TIROS) opened at the World Trade
Center's Nangang Exhibition Hall Wednesday to serve as a platform for Taiwan's
robotics industry to expand in domestic and foreign markets.</P>
      <P>The annual show, the second of its kind, was jointly organized by the Industrial
Department Bureau (IDB)  and the Department of Industrial Technology -- both
agencies under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, as well as the non-profit
Robotics Association Taiwan (ROBOAT).</P>
      <P>As the only professional robots exhibition in Taiwan, the event gathered 91
local and foreign companies, academic and research institutes, and civil
organizations devoted to robotics development.</P>
      <P>A total of 321 booths have been set up at the exhibition hall to showcase their
inventions and products.</P>
      <P>The exhibits at TIROS have been divided into two categories -- industrial robots
and service robots, with the category of industrial robots further divided into
robot arms, robot equipment, automation equipment, controller, and the
components of industrial robots.</P>
      <P>Service  robots  include  cleaning,  security,  educational, entertainment, and
life assistance robots.</P>
      <P>The showcase, however, is not the only activity of the four-day show, the
organizers said, noting that they have also prepared robotics contests, seminars
and conferences for industry leaders, experts and researchers so they can share
their insights on the robotics industry, as well as the sector's current and
future trends.</P>
      <P>According to the IDB, the venue was divided into several sections, including the
one that showcases the government's efforts to promote the intellectual robots
manufacturing industry over the past four years.</P>
      <P>The academic section exhibits 18 works by robotics laboratories of local
universities, such as National Taiwan University and National Taipei University
of Technology. It was hoped the laboratory projects will help increase the
cooperation between enterprises and technical-vocational education, the IDB
said.</P>
      <P>The robots experiencing section is the only area opened to children in the show.
In this section, kids can play with different robots and participate in DIY
activities and educational courses.</P>
      <P>The 2009 robots show will run through Aug. 8.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan media delegation to visit China in October: SEF</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>As relations across the Taiwan Strait continue to warm up, more Taiwan
delegations are scheduled to visit China later this year, an official of the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Among others, a media delegation will embark on an exchange visit to China in
October following a trip to Taiwan last week by a high-profile  group  of
Chinese  journalists,  SEF  Deputy Secretary-General Ma Shao-chang said.</P>
      <P>The SEF is a quasi-official intermediary body authorized to handle cross-strait
exchanges and negotiations in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan has nearly 1,000 media organizations, Ma said, the SEF is still
working on the list of media groups that will be invited to form the delegation.</P>
      <P>"Basically, we will focus on inviting those who can contribute to cross-strait
journalistic exchanges and cooperation," said Ma.</P>
      <P>He added that the Liberty Times and SANLIH Entertainment TV, both of which  are
seen  as critics  of the  current  Kuomintang administration's reconciliatory
approach toward China, will be on the invitational list.</P>
      <P>As to whether the Formosa Weekly, a publication launched recently by former Vice
President Annette Lu, will be invited to join the delegation, Ma refrained from
giving a direct reply. He said instead that members of the delegation will be
composed of editors-in-chief or chief editorial writers of major news
organizations.</P>
      <P>"The name list is still in the works, " Ma said, adding that the media
delegation may be headed by SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma said he himself will also lead a delegation of experts and
business executives to China in October to discuss viable measures to better
protect the safety of Taiwanese business people operating in China.</P>
      <P>"The delegation will join with officials of the SEF's counterpart -- the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) -- to
craft an effective emergency communications mechanism to deal with any emergency
situations encountered by Taiwanese businessmen in China, " Ma said.</P>
      <P>Such a mechanism is badly needed to avoid recurrence of a recent case in which
the killing of two Taiwanese businessmen and serious injury of another in
Dongguan in the southern province of Guangdong was not immediately reported, he
said.</P>
      <P>According to the SEF's plan, Ma went on, the foundation will organize two more
Taiwanese delegations to visit China for cultural and judicial exchanges  before
the fourth round of high-level cross-strait talks between SEF Chairman Chiang
Pin-kung and ARATS President Chen Yunlin takes place late this year.</P>
      <P>The first group, to be headed by Liu Te-hsun, a vice chairman of the Cabinet-
level Mainalnd Affairs Council (MAC) which oversees SEF operations, is
tentatively set to depart late this month, with judicial topics high on its
agenda.</P>
      <P>The second delegation, to be headed by another MAC vice chairman, Chao Chien-
ming, is scheduled to visit Beijing, Xian and Keifong in September, with
cultural institutions and museums as main destinations.</P>

      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued a sea warning Wednesday for Typhoon
Morakot, which was located some 1,000 kilometers east of Taiwan as of 8:00 p.m.
and moving in a west northwesterly direction toward the island at 23 kilometers
per hour.</P>
      <P>Warning that Morakot will be the worst typhoon to affect Taiwan so far this
year, the CWB advised that boats take precautions against the storm, which has a
radius of about 200 kilometers.</P>
      <P>The storm was gaining strength and was expected to be upgraded to a medium-
strength typhoon, the weathermen said.</P>
      <P>A land warning could be issued by Thursday as the typhoon is expected to bring
powerful winds and heavy rains to Taiwan, the CWB added.</P>
      <P>The weathermen said the typhoon will probably make landfall on Taiwan Friday,

    <TEXT>
      <P>While weathermen are alerting people to possible damage by the approaching
Typhoon Morakot, the Shihmen Reservoir Agency is hoping that the storm will
bring torrential rains that will help relieve the long dry spell at the 45-year-
old dam.</P>
      <P>Agency director Chiu Chung-chuan said Wednesday that the water level at the
reservoir had fallen to a critical 222.64 meters, although 7.5 million tons was
collected Tuesday during the heavy showers.</P>
      <P>In recent years, the water levels at the Shihmen Reservoir have fallen to
alarming lows in summer, according to Chien chao-chun, deputy director of the
Northern Region Water Resources Office.</P>
      <P>Originally designed mainly to supply water for irrigation in the Taoyuan region,
the reservoir now supplies households, farms, and a fast growing industrial
sector in the area.</P>
      <P>The population in the Taoyuan area has grown three-fold, from 500,000 in the
1960s to 1.8 million recently, and daily household consumption of water has
increased from 110,000 tons to 1.2 million tons, Chien said.</P>
      <P>He added that even as industrial pollution has contaminated many underground
water resources and farmers are relying heavily on the reservoir for irrigation,
its capacity has dropped considerably because many parts of the old dam have
silted up.</P>
      <P>The reservoir's storage capacity nowadays is 25 percent less than the 680,000
cubic meters it was originally designed to hold, Chien estimated.</P>
      <P>The water resources official said that as rainfall and other sources are not
sufficient to maintain an adequate storage level, the ultimate solution is to
develop new resources.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Department of Health Minister Yeh Ching-chuan has proposed that a
mechanism be set up to facilitate regular communication between top health
officials of Taiwan and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Yeh noted that while the two sides have no problem exchanging practical or
technical information on health issues such as epidemics and food safety,
communication at the policy level is currently lacking.</P>
      <P>Therefore, establishing a high-level communication mechanism between the health
authorities of the two sides will help to enhance the overall quality of their
respective public health systems, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>The minister expressed the hope that Taiwan and Hong Kong could engage in closer
cooperation on epidemic prevention, pharmaceutical research and the
industrialization of healthcare service.</P>
      <P>Yeh raised the issue in Hong Kong Wednesday  at the 5th Taiwan-Hong  Kong Forum
held at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, Yeh held talks with Hong Kong's Food and Health Secretary York Chow
on cooperation in the field of health, in what was the first meeting between top
health officials of the two sides.</P>

      <P>The National Disasters Prevention and Protection Commission activated a "level
one" alert against Typhoon Morakot Thursday after the Central Weather Bureau
(CWB) issued a land warning for northern Taiwan at 8:30 in the morning.</P>
      <P>The level one alert-- the highest on a three-point scale -- puts more than 110
key personnel from 25 agencies on standby to monitor the impact of the typhoon
around the clock and oversee disaster preparedness throughout the country,
according to the commission.</P>
      <P>The commission also urged the public to take precautions against the storm.</P>
      <P>According to the Central Weather Bureau, Morakot was centered 540 kilometers
southeast of Taiwan as of 11 a.m. Thursday, moving in a west northwesterly
direction toward the island at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour. The typhoon is
packing maximum sustained winds of 137 kilometers per hour and has a radius of
250 kilometers, the CWB said.</P>
      <P>If Morakot, the eighth storm system reported in the West Pacific region this
year, maintains its course and continues to strengthen, the system will cover
the entire Taiwan area early Saturday, CWB meteorologists said.</P>
      <P>The weather bureau cautioned that the storm would bring strong winds and heavy
rains to northern Taiwan Friday and into Saturday.</P>
      <P>Residents in mountainous areas in northern and eastern Taiwan should be extra
careful of landslides and people should keep away from the seaside, the CWB
said.</P>
      <P>The typhoon is expected to temporarily alleviate the water shortage in the
country, as rainfall in Taiwan has been below normal levels so far this year.
Water authorities had warned of possible rationing measures if the drought
conditions persisted.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan visited the national disaster prevention commission
Thursday morning to inspect its state of readiness ahead of the typhoon.</P>
      <P>Because of the approaching storm, he canceled an appointment with local movie
director Chang Tsuo-chi that was set up to view Chang's latest film "How Are
You, Dad?"</P>

(By Roger Chou)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top watchdog body, the Control Yuan, proposed corrective measures to
the Department of Health (DOH) and the Bureau of National Health Insurance
(BNHI) Wednesday, saying they have mismanaged the issues of National Health
Insurance payments and pharmaceutical prices.</P>
      <P>According to the decision, which was announced by Control Yuan members Cheng
Jen-hung, Chien Lin Hui-chun and Liu Yu-shan, negligence by the two government
agencies has resulted in problems in eight areas.</P>
      <P>"The bureau has been asked several times to correct the problems and it has been
warned that if it fails to do so now, incoming DOH Minister Yang Chih-liang
could be impeached," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Outgoing Health Minister Yeh Chin-chuan has been quoted as saying that the
bureau had to pursue cost-saving measures in order to cope with its financial
problems, according to Cheng.</P>
      <P>The main issue is that there are too many kinds of drugs that are approved for
BNHI coverage, so it is difficult to manage them effectively, the Control Yuan
said. The problem has persisted even though the bureau for a long time has been
paying the same amount for all drugs prescribed for a single ailment, though
they may vary in cost, it added.</P>
      <P>There was also no proper monitoring of new drugs, of drug prices, or the
effectiveness and quality of treatment, according to the watchdog body.</P>
      <P>The two agencies did not move to increase health insurance premiums at the
opportune time, even though it was within their right under the National Health
Insurance Act, the Control Yuan said. This has left the BNHI with a budget
deficit of NT$33.1 billion (US$1 billion), it noted.</P>
      <P>When asked about the possibility of former health ministers being impeached,
Cheng said that he does not want to make any speculations.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times: Energy tax will drive industries out of Taiwan</P>
      <P>The Tax Reform Committee decided last week to launch an energy tax and
environmental protection tax.</P>
      <P>The new taxes will be phrased in over ten years and will exact about NT$220
billion from industries per year after they are fully implemented.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that when the taxes are passed on to consumers, households with
an income of NT$30,000 will pay as much as NT$10,000 in taxes.</P>
      <P>We predict that these taxes will force local industries to relocate to China,
rather than result in the improvement of living standards and the environment in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Apple Daily: In memory of actress Wen Yin.</P>
      <P>Wen Yin passed away yesterday. She was a true Taiwanese who displayed the
qualities of diligence, honesty,  kindness,  and generosity that are typical of
Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Her performance style is not popular today, but it was unique to her and was
loved by her audiences.</P>
      <P>China Times:  Ma's public support  will be eroded by his administration's
tinkering with the tax system</P>
      <P>The Tax Reform Committee under the Executive Yuan decided last week to introduce
an energy tax and a pollution tax. We are worried that the administration's
tinkering with the tax system will erode the broad public support that President
Ma enjoys.</P>
      <P>The energy tax is intended more as a means of cutting back on the consumption of
fossil fuel rather than as a source of government revenue, because it could be
transferred to the consumer.</P>
      <P>Tax reform is not just an academic exercise, but is also a political strategy to
woo voters. This is why politicians are usually keen to cut taxes. However, the
government needs to find a formula to increase taxes in some categories so as to
offset tax cuts in other areas.</P>
      <P>The tax system should be reviewed comprehensively rather than in the current
piecemeal  fashion that gives interest groups the opportunity to lobby against
certain kinds of tax.</P>
      <P>United Daily News: Tackling the drought problem.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan braces for a hit by Typhoon Morakot, it is hoping that the storm will
break the dry spell that has plagued the island since the beginning of the year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan recorded average precipitation of 700 mm for the first half of this year,
which is about half of the usual volume.</P>
      <P>The drought problem should be addressed by raising water rates to reduce
consumption, improving the efficiency of water use and recycling waste water.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's water rates are unreasonably low, which leads to water waste by
consumers, and the old pipeline system leaks about one third of the country's
tap water supply every year.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan's irritation systems, which consume about 13 billion tons of
water, are not efficient.</P>
      <P>Also, the government has not done well in recycling waste water, especially
industrial waste water which is easier to recycle than domestic waste water.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The public was advised Thursday to pay more attention to any uncomfortable
symptoms experienced after being bitten by mosquitoes, as the first case of
indigenous dengue fever this year has emerged.</P>
      <P>Lai Chung-chang, a physician at the Dalin Tzu Chi General Hospital in Chiayi
County, noted that the hot and humid summer weather is the most favorable to
mosquito infestations, which can result in the transmission of diseases such as
dengue fever and Japanese encephalitis.</P>
      <P>Therefore,  people who come down with fever or experience drowsiness after being
bitten by mosquitoes should seek medical treatment immediately, as these could
be signs of serious illness, Lai said.</P>
      <P>To prevent transmission of the disease, it is important for the public to
eradicate mosquito breeding grounds by getting rid of standing water that could
accumulate in uncovered containers and drains, he said.</P>
      <P>Dengue fever and Japanese encephalitis are two of the most common mosquito-borne
diseases in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Dengue fever is transmitted by the aedes aegypti mosquito. The disease's
incubation period runs from two to 15 days, and symptoms include high fever,
severe headaches, retro-orbital pain, severe joint pains, muscle aches, general
weakness, nausea, vomiting and rash.</P>
      <P>Japanese encephalitis, meanwhile, is transmissible to humans via mosquitoes that
become infected by feeding on domestic pigs and wild birds infected with the
Japnaese encephalitis virus (JEV).</P>
      <P>The incubation period of the disease runs between five and 15 days. Mild
infections usually occur without apparent symptoms other than fever and
headaches. In more severe infections, patients may experience headaches, high
fever, stiffness of the neck, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, occasional
convulsions and spastic paralysis.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan government has since 1968 provided JEV inoculation to children, with
the first two shots given at 15 months, followed by a booster shot the next year
and another during the first year of elementary school.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday that peace across the Taiwan Strait marks a
new dawn in cross-strait relations and helps improve security ties between
Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>During a brief meeting at the Presidential Office with U.S. Congressman Phil
Gingrey (R-GA) who co-chairs the U.S. Congressional Taiwan Caucus, Ma said that
his administration's continuous efforts since last May to improve relations with
Beijing has brought about a dawn of peace across the Taiwan Strait and has also
made U.S.-Taiwan security ties "easier and simpler" to maintain.</P>
      <P>He told Gingrey that all American friends and politicians who have visited
Taiwan over the past year have reacted positively to Taiwan's efforts,  which he
said have not only helped defuse cross-strait  tensions,  but have also
contributed to regional stability. This has allowed the U.S., the European
Union, Japan and other nations in the region to better position themselves in
terms of global strategy, the president said.</P>
      <P>"In other words, Taiwan's ever-warming relations with China are beneficial to
all parties concerned," Ma added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the president expressed his appreciation for Gingrey's speech in the
U.S. Congress in April to reaffirm the U.S. House of Representatives' commitment
to the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) in recognition of the 30th anniversary of the
law's enactment.</P>
      <P>Rep. Gingrey also saw to it that an English summary of an address that Ma gave
at an international conference in Taipei to mark the 30th anniversary of the TRA
was entered in the U.S. congressional record, the president noted.</P>
      <P>The House of Representatives on March 14 adopted a resolution in recognition of
the TRA's 30th anniversary.</P>
      <P>The resolution acknowledged the TRA as "the cornerstone of U.S. relations with
Taiwan" and reiterated Congress' support for Taiwan's democratic institutions.</P>
      <P>The resolution also expressed support for "the strong and deepening relationship
between the United States and Taiwan."</P>
      <P>President Ma expressed his appreciation for the recent visits to Taiwan by
Shelley Berkley (D-Nev.) and Lincoln Diaz-Balart (R-FL) -- both co-chairs of the
Congressional Taiwan Caucus -- as part of the TRA 30th anniversary celebrations.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Caucus, set up in January 2007, is an informal congressional
organization comprised of 147 lawmakers with an interest in boosting Taiwan-U.S.
relations.</P>
      <P>Gingrey, elected congressman for Georgia State's 11th District in 2002,
currently also serves on the Energy and Commerce Committee of the U.S. House of
Representatives.</P>

      <P>At least 10 more purchase missions from China are expected to visit Taiwan by
the end of this year, following the visits by four such delegations which have
already agreed to buy billions of US dollars worth of merchandise there, Taiwan
External Trade Development Council's (TAITRA) Chairman Wang Chih-kang said in
Beijing Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the first delegation organized by China's Association of
Economy and Trade Across the Taiwan Straits (AETATS) arrived in Taiwan in May
and had agreed to buy consumer electronics worth more than US$2 billion, orders
for US$700 million of which have been received.</P>
      <P>Another AETATS-organized delegation composing of mostly Chinese department store
representatives that arrived in July plans to buy processed food worth US$760
million, orders for US$160 million of which have been placed, Wang said.</P>
      <P>On Aug. 19, yet another AETATS-organized delegation is expected to arrive and
buy goods worth US$1.2 billion, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, another mission comprised mainly of Chinese TV makers organized by
China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology arrived in June and made
plans to purchase flat panels worth US$5 billion. Orders for US$1.5 billion of
the amount have been received, Wang said.</P>
      <P>At least 10 more Chinese shopping delegations will arrive in Taiwan during the
remainder of the year, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks in a news conference held in Beijing to promote the Taiwan
Trade Fair in Nanjing, which is scheduled for Sept. 17-20 at the Nanjing
International Expo Center.</P>
      <P>The event will be the largest overseas exhibition ever organized by TAITRA since
its establishment 40 years ago.</P>
      <P>The show will gather 620 Taiwanese businesses and display more than 30,000
Taiwanese products, with the exhibition area to cover 38,000 square meters,
TAITRA officials said.</P>
      <P>While TAITRA originally intended to provide only 300 booths, the number has been
increased to 1,860 because of the widespread interest among Taiwanese businesses
to take part in the fair, the officials said.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan on Thursday thanked departing Department of Health (DOH)
Minister Yeh Ching-chuan for his efforts as the country's top health official,
and stated the government will continue to seek his advice and assistance in
fighting epidemics, government spokesman Su Jun-pin said.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks in the weekly Executive Yuan meeting presided over by Liu.
Yeh also attended the meeting.</P>
      <P>Yeh announced on Monday that he had tendered his resignation to Liu in a bid to
run for the seat of Hualien County magistrate.</P>
      <P>His request was approved by the premier the same day, but drew criticism from
lawmakers of both the ruling and opposition parties at a time when the situation
of A(H1N1) flu has worsened over the past week, with more than 600 people in
Taiwan newly infected in 24 confirmed cluster cases.</P>
      <P>"Although Yeh resigned to build a new stage of his career, the government still
needs Yeh's experiences in future combat against epidemics," Su quoted the
premier as saying.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Executive Yuan and the DOH agreed to set up an anti-epidemic
counselling panel, and Liu in the meeting demanded the DOH pay greater heed to
the safety of vaccinations, according to Su.</P>
      <P>The premier said the government is confident that it can effectively handle
epidemic outbreaks and minimize their impact on society, but the current swine
flu outbreak was still serious and posed a great challenge for the government.</P>
      <P>But thanks to the efforts made by Yeh and other experts to curb its spread, Liu
said, Taiwan has built one of the world's most comprehensive anti-epidemic
networks.</P>
      <P>When Yeh assumed office as DOH minister last year, he made it clear that he
would leave once his objective at the post has been completed, Liu explained.</P>
      <P>In the Executive Yuan weekly meeting, Yeh reported about the DOH's preparations
against the spread of influenza A (H1N1) , saying that Adimmune Corp., Taiwan's
only producer of vaccine for swine flu, will produce 4 million doses in
November.</P>
      <P>To prevent a second outbreak of the epidemic, the DOH has reserved enough
medicine doses for 4.183 million people and has purchased 5 million doses of the
vaccine and will purchase another 5 million doses.</P>
      <P>In response to grave public concern about the safety of the company's products,
Yeh gave his assurances that DOH personnel will take part in the vaccine's
entire manufacturing and quality control process.</P>

      <P>Adjusting Taiwan's national health insurance premiums will be a top priority,
incoming Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yang Chih-liang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"There is room for adjustment of health insurance premiums, with higher-paid

hours before assuming the top DOH post.</P>
      <P>Yang, who is scheduled to take over the DOH helm from outgoing Minister Yeh

increase health insurance premiums when the conditions were appropriate for an
adjustment.</P>
      <P>The supreme supervisory body said that it would not rule out the possibility of
impeaching the incoming health minister if the DOH fails to address the problem.</P>
      <P>For years, the BNHI has been operating in the red with its accumulated budget
deficit already exceeding NT$33.1 billion (US$1 billion).</P>
      <P>Responding to the Control Yuan's reprimand, Yang said he will ask the health
insurance bureau next week to come up with a premium adjustment proposal and
complementary measures.</P>
      <P>"We will prioritize premium adjustments and then consider an overall overhaul of
the health insurance system in a later stage, " Yang said.</P>
      <P>In his view, Yang said, the insurance premium should be based on individuals'
overall income.</P>
      <P>"The current problems lie in that fact that rich people pay too little while
poor people are overloaded, " Yang said, adding that the future adjustment
should be based on the principle of raising premiums for the higher-paid
individuals while lowering that for lower-paid people.</P>
      <P>"My observation is that there should be room for reducing premiums for poor
people," Yang said.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that hikes in health insurance premiums could trigger a backlash,
Yang said he will step up communications with the public to minimize objections
and enlist their support for any new measures to be adopted.</P>
      <P>Yang was quoted as having said previously that ordinary people should not oppose
health premium adjustments because they tend to benefit from premium hikes.</P>
      <P>"As far as premiums are concerned, the government and employers tend to assume a
larger share of the payment than the insured themselves, " he explained. "Why
not pay a bit more to get better medical and health care services?"</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Government Information Office (GIO) expressed deep displeasure Thursday over
a decision by the producer of the Mandarin-language film Miao Miao to withdraw
it from the Melbourne film festival along with other Chinese films.</P>
      <P>Taiwan office of the Hong Kong-based Jet Tone Films, owned by noted director
Wong Kar-wai, withdrew the movie from the Melbourne International  Film Festival
in protest against the festival's screening of a documentary about an exiled
Uighur leader who has been branded by Beijing as a terrorist.</P>
      <P>GIO Minister Su Jun-pin said at a news briefing that he has lodged a strong
protest with Jet Tone's Taiwan office over the decision to pull the film without
notifying the GIO, which partially funded the movie's production.</P>
      <P>"This action has tarnished Taiwan's international and human rights image," Su
said.</P>
      <P>According to Su, Jet Tone Films Taiwan had applied for and received a grant of
NT$4 million (US$122,324) from the GIO for the production of Miao Miao, which
meant that the film would be representative of Taiwan if it was entered in
international film festivals.</P>
      <P>Miao Miao, a 2008 production, is a romantic comedy directed by Taiwanese Cheng
Hsiao-tse, starring Taiwanese Ko Chia-yan, Sandrine Pinna (Chang Jung-jung) and
Wing Fan.</P>
      <P>Su said the GIO has asked Jet Tone Films Taiwan to produce evidence to prove
that it has stuck to the terms of its contract with the GIO regarding
participation in international festivals, such as the Melbourne International
Film Festival.</P>
      <P>Chinese films were withdrawn from the Melbourne festival July 26 after Beijing
became unhappy with the Australian sponsor's decision to screen the documentary,
The 10 Conditions of Love, about exiled Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer, who is
accused of plotting Urumqi riots.</P>
      <P>The Melbourne festival is being held July 24-Aug. 9.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has two other short films, namely Joyce Agape and The Pursuit of What
Was, which are on the list of films to be shown at the festival.</P>

      <P>The government is expected to set the standards for inspecting potentially
harmful substances in garden clogs within one month, in response to calls by
various sectors for a crack down, a Consumers Foundation official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Overseas reports have revealed that the plastic shoes contain a high level of
plasticizer and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), both of which can cause
cancer,  according to Wu Chia-cheng, secretary-general of the foundation.</P>
      <P>While PAH is linked to lung cancer and lymphoma, plasticizer is related to
thoracic cancer and breast cancer and can also disrupt hormone function, Wu
said.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection (BSMI) under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs has set the inspection criteria for such substances in toys,
but has yet to provide a similar criteria for garden clogs, Wu noted.</P>
      <P>Besides the Consumers Foundation, the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan have
also urged the BSMI to take immediate action to address the issue, Wu said.</P>

      <P>Ending a three-day losing streak, Taiwan's share prices closed slightly higher
Thursday, on news that Taiwan will allow Chinese visitors to make purchases in
Taiwan using their China UnionPay bank cards instead of cash from Aug. 7.</P>
      <P>The weighted index, the market's key barometer, advanced 20.41 points, or 0.29
percent, to close at 6,868.65.</P>
      <P>The local bourse opened higher Thursday at 6,886.70 before reaching the day's
highest of 6,888.09.</P>
      <P>It then surrendered earlier gains and retreated to the day's lowest of 6,775.87
after a government report showed that Taiwan's consumer price index (CPI) in
July registered a 38-year record contraction of 2.33 percent year-on-year,
raising concern the island may take longer to recover from a recession.</P>
      <P>But driven by the news that Chinese bank cards will be usable in Taiwan, the
local bourse retained most of its early gains by the end of trading.</P>
      <P>A total of 5.08 billion shares changed hands on market turnover of NT$121.43
billion (US$3.70 billion).</P>
      <P>Led by banking and financial shares which rose 1 percent, three of the eight
major stock categories gained ground, with machinery and electronics shares
advancing 0.6 percent, and plastics and chemicals shares adding 0.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Cement stocks remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>The other four major stock categories  lost ground,  with construction stocks
moving down the most at 2.7 percent. Foodstuff shares fell 1.8 percent, textile

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that it is drafting a law
to govern its engagement in international cooperation and development projects.</P>
      <P>"The law will provide a legal basis and serve as a guideline for our foreign aid
activities. It will also help speed up our efforts to achieve a more systematic,
professional, and productive approach," Weber Shih, director-general of the
MOFA's Department of Economic and Trade Affairs, said at a regular press
briefing.</P>
      <P>The draft bill will be discussed in the Executive Yuan and then forwarded to the
Legislative Yuan for review, Shih said, adding that he hopes it will be given
priority when the new session of the legislature opens in September.</P>
      <P>The ruling and opposition parties have reached an initial understanding on the
issue, he said.</P>
      <P>The bill,  which  draws on the Paris Declaration  on Aid Effectiveness of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) , is aimed at
standardizing the objectives, principles, scope, and means of Taiwan's
international cooperation and development affairs, bringing them in line with
international standards, Shih said.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, the bill designates MOFA as the authority responsible for
handling such affairs and for coordinating related efforts by other government
agencies.</P>
      <P>In addition, it may entrust foreign aid work to Taiwan's International
Cooperation and Development Fund as well as to private organizations and
professionals, Shih said.</P>
      <P>The draft bill also stipulates that the MOFA must be notified if foreign aid
projects exceed a specified amount, according to Shih. For such projects, the
opinions and assessments of an objective third party, such as a professional
institution, will be taken into consideration, he added.</P>
      <P>In the past, Taiwan's foreign aid programs have come under criticism in the
international community as tools in its diplomatic tug-of-war with China to gain
recognition by other countries.</P>
      <P>Since President Ma Ying-jeou took office last May, the government has been
considering an overhaul of its foreign aid program based on a cross-Taiwan
Strait "diplomatic truce" under which Taiwan and China would tacitly agree not
to vie for each other's allies.</P>
      <P>On May 7, the MOFA released a white paper on Taiwan's foreign aid policy,
outlining the country's vision for a specialized and reliable model to provide
more effective and meaningful overseas assistance.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan urged government agencies Thursday to speed up handling
of petitions filed by ordinary citizens of the country seeking resolution or
redress on various problems.</P>
      <P>To better protect people's rights and improve government efficiency, Liu said,
all Cabinet-level agencies must improve content of statutes governing the
people's petitions, improve the quality of the public offices' handling of
petitions, and move forward the deadlines for screening and deciding on
petitions to as early a date as possible.</P>
      <P>Topping the list of 3,170 petitions filed in 2008 were 506 from people
complaining about their right to travel overseas being restricted due to tax
evasion disputes, according  to  a report reviewing petition handling by the
administration last year.</P>
      <P>The second largest type of petition cases concerned mainland Chinese spouses'
applications to gain the right to come to Taiwan for family reunion and
permanent settlement. There were 353 such cases, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Cases involving foreign workers' employment problems in Taiwan made the third
largest group of petitions, totaling 203, the report showed.</P>
      <P>So far this year, the Executive Yuan agencies have handled 3,976 petitions,
including 806 old cases.</P>
      <P>Of the total, decisions have been made on 2,726 cases. Over half, or 57 percent
of these decisions were made within three months after receiving the petitions,
according to the report.</P>
      <P>Cases that took government agencies more than three months, but less than five
months to resolve amounted to 42.5 percent of the total cases decided upon, or
1,158 cases.</P>
      <P>Decisions were handed down after five months of screening on 14 petition cases,
according to the report. Part of the reason was various departments transferring
the petition to another department.</P>

      <P>A young and promising Taiwanese dancer has been selected to join Israels world-
acclaimed Batsheva Dance Company, making her the first person from Taiwan to do
so, the Israel Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei (ISECO) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee Chen-wei, a former member of the famous Lan Yang Dance Group who graduated
last year from Taipei National University of the ArtsSchool of Dance, will leave
in a few days for Israel to join the dance company, the ISECO said in a press
release.</P>
      <P>In a recent meeting with Lee,  Raphael Gamzou,  Israels representative to
Taiwan, wished the young dancer the best in her journey to Israel and Lee also
expressed her excitement for the opportunity to perform with Batsheva, according
to the press release.</P>
      <P>This is a golden opportunity for you and Im sure you will do a great job
there,Gamzou was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Having grown up in Taiwans northeastern Yilan County, Lee began learning to
dance at the age of 5.</P>
      <P>She was selected by Batshevas Artistic Director, Ohad Naharin, out of many young
dancers who auditioned around the world. Lee will join, at the first stage,
Batshevas Young Dancers Ensemble, and will participate in the groups performance
during the 2009-2010 season.</P>
      <P>Batsheva has scheduled a performance in Taipeis National Theater Hall in 2010,
as part of their Asian tour, and the ISECO said that it hopes Lee will be able
to join the troupe.</P>
      <P>The world-renowned Israeli Dancing Company Batsheva was founded in 1964 by
famous dancer Martha Graham and patron of dance Baroness Batsheva (aka
Bethsabee) De Rothschild, who lived in Israel.</P>
      <P>The style of Naharin, who has served as Batshevas artistic director for the last
15 years, was acclaimed on the New York Times asdistinguished by stunningly
flexible limbs and spines, deeply grounded movement, explosive bursts and a
vitality that grabs a viewer by the collar.</P>
      <P>Jiri Kilian, a renowned choreographer and considered one of the giants of modern
dance, defines Batsheva under Naharin as one of the best modern dance groups in

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is working on establishing a database
that will hold records of the government's foreign aid programs, taking for
reference the method used by the non-profit Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) to compile statistics, a MOFA official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-bin, director-general of MOFA's Department of Economic and Trade
Affairs, said the statistics will be similar to those of the OECD's Development
Assistance Committee (DAC) , which is made up of 23 OECD members, whose numbers
include the most important foreign aid donors.</P>
      <P>Through the DAC, the OECD deals with issues involving aid, development and
poverty reduction in developing countries, Shih added.</P>
      <P>Under the OECD's operational procedures for aid programs, members of the DAC are
required to carry out aid projects under the supervision of the OECD and to
provide statistics and reports on aid and other resources given to developing
countries, which are to be published each year, according to Shih.</P>
      <P>The DAC serves as a forum in which donor governments come together to increase
the effectiveness and the transparency of their aid, and to coordinate their
development efforts, Shih went on.</P>
      <P>The planned MOFA database will be set up similar to the one established by the
OECD, but the MOFA will make some revisions based on the needs of Taiwan's
various government agencies, Shih noted.</P>
      <P>Once the database is established, the MOFA will make it available to government
agencies related to foreign aid affairs and the International Cooperation and
Development Fund (ICDF) , a Taiwanese fund that supports development projects,
said Shih.</P>
      <P>The ministry will also work to integrate information from various organizations
regarding the implementation of foreign aid programs to keep better track of the
flow of aid resources and assess aid effectiveness, Shih added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior official of Taiwan's top online travel Web site said Thursday that the
company's name and management team will remain intact despite  changes  in its
shareholding structure.</P>
      <P>"EzTravel will remain Taiwan's best travel service brand and its management team
will not change in the wake of China's leading online travel Web site, Ctrip,
upping its stake in our company to more than 50 percent," said ezTravel
President Yu Chin-chang.</P>
      <P>Ctrip, a NASDAQ-listed company, revealed a day earlier in its second-quarter
financial report the increase of its stake in ezTravel to the level requiring it
to compile a consolidated financial statement with the latter, indirectly
acknowledging that its stake in ezTravel has exceeded 50 percent, up from the
original 20 percent.</P>
      <P>According to U.S. accounting regulations, listed enterprises are required  to
produce  consolidated  financial  statements  with subsidiaries in which they
own more than 50 percent of the shares.</P>
      <P>Yu described Ctrip as a multinational company rather than a wholly Chinese-owned
one.  With the approval of the Taiwanese government, Ctrip began to invest in
ezTravel in 2006.</P>
      <P>As ezTravel once had its shares traded on Taiwan's GreTai Securities Market
between 2007 and 2008, Yu went on, Ctrip is also known to have purchased a
number of ezTravel shares during that period.</P>
      <P>"From its financial statement, Ctrip increased its stake in ezTravel to more
than 50 percent in Q2 for the first time, " Yu said, adding that he did not know
the company's exact shareholding ratio because ezTravel's  shares are owned by
divergent  groups and individuals.</P>
      <P>"The most important thing is that Ctrip has traditionally respected our
management team, " Yu continued. "Our brand name and management team will remain
unchanged and Ctrip is not expected to post any of its staff in our company."</P>
      <P>Moreover, Yu said, both companies will benefit from their ever-closer ties.</P>
      <P>Bucking a general downward trend in the global travel market in the wake of the
worldwide financial crisis, Yu said, both ezTravel and Ctrip posted enviable
gains in business turnover and earnings in the first half of this year.</P>
      <P>The 10-year-old Ctrip registered a 27 percent year-on-year growth in its
business revenues in Q2 and a 33 percent growth in net profits during the same
period, according to the company's Q2 financial statement.</P>
      <P>In the case of ezTravel, Yu noted, the company posted its best-ever business
performance in the first half of this year since its inauguration in 2000.</P>
      <P>Yu said his company had turned down prospective European and American investors
and picked Ctrip as its partner mainly because it looks forward to the emergence
of a world-famous Taiwan-based travel agency.</P>
      <P>"It is not easy for any single Taiwanese travel agency to establish itself as a
global brand. Just one of the problems is tapping into the vast Chinese market
-- a tall order for a Taiwanese tour operator. Therefore, we needed to choose a
good partner to realize our ambitions," Yu explained.</P>
      <P>Because of the lingering global economic downturn and the worldwide influenza
A(H1N1) outbreak, many of Taiwan's 2,000-plus travel agencies have been reeling
in the recession-hit travel market. Even several of the more noted brands have
reported financial crises and many smaller ones have closed down or declared
bankruptcy.</P>
      <P>Analyzing Taiwanese travel service providers' woes, Yu said small scale and
delay in offering online services are the most serious disadvantages troubling
local operations.</P>
      <P>As many Taiwanese travel agencies have traditionally focused on incentive tour
groups funded by business corporations, they are most vulnerable to the economic
downturn, Yu pointed out.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Yu said, ezTravel's business strategies and selling styles have
been helpful to its survival during the economic hard times.</P>
      <P>"Vacationers like to seek cheaper tour packages online and tend to opt for
individual tours and domestic tours. All of these trends fit our business model.
We have been strong in these fields, " he said proudly.</P>
      <P>Last but not least is the company's joint procurement with Ctrip to cut its
costs and enhance its competitive edge, Yu said, adding that ezTravel and Ctrip
have been making joint purchases since 2007 and that their markets have not been
confined only to Taiwan, China, Hong Kong and Macau but have expanded to
Northeast and Southeast Asia.</P>

      <P>Taiwan Lottery, a subsidiary of Chinatrust Financial Holding Co, made a profit
of NT$1.962 billion in June, bringing its total earnings to NT$46.417 billion as
of that month since it took over as the nation's exclusive Public Welfare

    <HEADLINE>Council stages exhibition on cultural assets conservation</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) will stage an exhibition from Aug. 10
featuring the fruits of a four-year plan aimed at conserving and renewing
regional cultural assets around Taiwan, CCA officials announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at an explanatory session held at the council, a spokesman for the
CCA's Headquarters Administration of Cultural Heritage (HACH) , said the
exhibition will display the program's achievements over the past four years
through a series of activities such as seminars and workshops.</P>
      <P>During the session, the Shengping Wuchou Hand Puppet Troupe staged a show to
underscore the importance of reinvigorating the nation's cultural heritage. A
tea master also showcased the elegant rituals of the tea ceremony to show the
audience the elegance of Taiwan's tea culture.</P>
      <P>The first stage of the exhibition will run Aug. 10- 12 at the HACH's Tainan City
office, while the second stage will be held Aug. 13-23 at its Taichung City
office.</P>
      <P>During the exhibitions,  representatives and officials from grass-roots
communities,  cities  and  townships,  as well  as national-level officials,
will exchange views and experiences on how to preserve and present historical
heritage on a sustainable growth model through cooperation between the public
and private sectors.</P>
      <P>The exhibition  will also  allow  the public  to gain an understanding of the
essence and content of the program designed to conserve and revive regional
cultural practices that take place around their neighborhoods, HACH officials
said.</P>
      <P>The CCA came up with the program in 2006, seeking to better preserve and make
the best use of natural resources, historic settlements  and national  monuments
around the country in a sustainable approach through joint participation and
management by local residents.</P>
      <P>The program revolves around the idea of "regional environments" as its key
notion and integrates  concepts relating to urban development, city and
community renewal and cultural recuperation, HACH officials explained.</P>
      <P>It is also aimed at deepening the identity of Taiwan's people with their local
cultures through a diverse and open platform, in part to raise public awareness
of the significance of conserving local culture and in part to help boost local
economies and create job opportunities, the officials said.</P>
      <P>As of the end of April, the HACH had approved subsidies for 51 plans submitted
by local city and county governments, 64 plans put forward  by private
communities  and groups  and  39 central government-level projects.</P>
      <P>Lukang township in central Taiwan's Changhua County, as well as historic
monuments in southern Tainan City, have already been approved by the HACH as
state-level relics.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kaohsiung City in southern Taiwan unveiled a city renewal plan that
same day -- a project to transform a segment of the century-old railway adjacent
to Kaohsiung Port into a "railway park."</P>
      <P>The city seeks to make the run-down zone into a business district to help
bolster the local economy, and to stage activities there to attract more
tourists.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New health minister assumes office, vows to raise premiums</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  6 (CNA)
08/06/09  21:32:27
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Yang Chih-liang, a veteran public health educator and administrator, assumed
office Thursday as minister of the Department of Health (DOH) and vowed to make
the wealthy pay more for health insurance.</P>
      <P>"If I fail to follow the law in adjusting the health insurance premiums, the
watchdog Control Yuan will impeach me, but any adjustment must follow the
principle that higher-paid individuals should pay more premiums while the
impoverished should pay less, " Yang said at a changeover ceremony.</P>
      <P>Yang, a former DOH vice minister, took over the DOH helm from Yeh Chin-chuan,
who resigned Monday in preparation for his bid for the ruling Kuomintang's
candidacy in the year-end magistrate election in the eastern county of Hualien.</P>
      <P>Yang's pledge to adjust health insurance premiums came a day after the Control
Yuan censured the DOH and the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) for
failing to promptly increase health insurance premiums when the conditions were
appropriate for an adjustment.</P>
      <P>The supreme supervisory body said it will also not rule out the possibility of
impeaching the incoming health minister if the DOH continues to fail to address
the problem.</P>
      <P>For years, the BNHI has been operating in the red, with its accumulated budget
deficit having already exceeded NT$33.1 billion (US$1 billion).</P>
      <P>Yang said he will ask NHIB officials next week to come up with a premium
adjustment proposal and related complementary measures.</P>
      <P>"We will prioritize premium adjustments and then later consider an overall
overhaul of the health insurance system, " Yang said, adding that he will
strengthen communications with the public to minimize any possible backlash over
the premium adjustments.</P>
      <P>Yang further said that ordinary people should not oppose health premium
adjustments because they tend to benefit from premium hikes.</P>
      <P>"As far as premiums are concerned, the government and employers tend to assume a
larger share of the payment than the insured themselves, " he explained. "Why
not pay a bit more to get better medical and health care services?"</P>
      <P>He also outlined two other priorities on his agenda -- pushing city and county
governments to repay their debts to the BNHI and increasing the procurement of
vaccines for influenza A(H1N1) or swine flu.</P>
      <P>Many local governments owe the BNHI huge sums in unpaid health insurance
premiums, with the Taipei city government listed as the top debtor.</P>
      <P>"It would be a dereliction of duty if I fail to work with the BNHI to secure
repayment from local governments," Yang noted.</P>
      <P>With the number of confirmed A(H1N1) infections rising steadily, Yang said the
DOH will  increase  vaccine  procurement  as a precautionary measure to prevent
any possible massive-scale outbreak.</P>
      <P>The DOH has already ordered 5 million doses of A(H1N1) vaccine from Adimmune
Corp., Taiwan's only human vaccine manufacturer. The department is seeking to
purchase up to 10 million doses and may seek foreign supplies if the local
company fails to meet the DOH's demands.</P>
      <P>If necessary, Yang said, the DOH might purchase even more than 10 million doses.
"But the premise must be that the vaccine lives up to the safety requirements,"
he added.</P>
      <P>Describing his new job as a great honor, Yang said he will do his utmost to
fulfill his mission in order not to let down his superiors or his old friend
Yeh.</P>

      <P>The incident-prone newly inaugurated Muzha-Neihu line of the Taipei mass rapid
transit (MRT) system resumed operations at 4: 20 p.m. Thursday after shutting
down yet again at noon due to a network switch malfunction.</P>
      <P>The breakdown halted 26 trains on the line for four-and-a-half hours, including
five trains that stopped between two stations. The five unmanned trains had to
be driven manually to stations to allow passengers to disembark, according to
Tan Kuo- kuang, the Taipei city government's deputy secretary-general who
concurrently serves as head of the administration's emergency response task
force.</P>
      <P>The city then mobilized buses to transport the passengers to their destinations.</P>
      <P>According to Tan, a preliminary investigation found that the failure was caused
by the breakdown of a network switch at Donghu Station that caused the control
center to fail to follow the movements of the trains, prompting it to decide to
suspend services on the whole line.</P>
      <P>The line has suffered repeated glitches, including sudden stops and doors
failing to open, since it was opened to the public July 4.</P>
      <P>The largest breakdown occurred July 10 when the line ground to a halt completely
for more than eight hours because of a power failure.</P>
      <P>A survey conducted by the city government last month found that some 62 percent
of city residents polled were dissatisfied with the new line,  with the top
three complaints listed as too-small carriages,  frequent and sudden stoppages
and poorly designed stations.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan made an inspection Thursday of the Central Emergency
Operation Center and demanded that all personnel stay on high alert against
possible damage caused by approaching Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Liu asked all center staff to remain vigilant over the coming 24 hours, when the

      <P>Government offices and schools islandwide will be closed Friday in preparation
for the arrival of the medium-strength typhoon, which was steadily gaining
strength.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Stock Exchange also announced that day that the market would be
closed the following day and all trading postponed until Monday.</P>
      <P>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) also announced that a ceremony
scheduled for Sunday to mark the local acceptance of bank cards issued by the
China-based China UnionPay Co. will be put off until Monday.</P>
      <P>Morakot, the worst typhoon to affect Taiwan so far this year, is likely to bring

      <P>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong granted authorization
for the first time Thursday to a Taiwan exchange-traded fund (ETF) , Polaris
Taiwan Top 50 Tracker Fund, for cross-listing in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Polaris Fund Management Platform said the ETF will be listed
Aug. 19. While participating dealers are allowed to bid at HK$10 (US$1.29) per

      <P>The Tourism Bureau is collaborating with the Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA)
to launch a new project to promote in-depth travel around Taiwan, the country's
top tourism official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The Taiwan Tourbus Railway Tour Passport program will offer convenient
transport services and tour packages at budget prices, aimed in particular at
the individual traveler, " said Tourism Bureau Director-General Janice Lai at a
news conference to unveil the new promotion.</P>
      <P>Taking its cues from a similar promotional program in Japan, where individual
tours are very popular, Lai said the Tourism Bureau has selected 10 out of the
32 existing Taiwan Tourbus lines to be integrated  with various  rail tickets
to make major tourist destinations accessible for tours using the program.</P>
      <P>The selected bus lines include a one-day tour of the northeastern coastline,
including the picturesque villages of Jinguashih and Jiufen, a one-day tour of
Sun Moon Lake, a one-day tour of Lugang and the sprawling gardens along the
Tienwei highway, as well as a one-day tour of mountain and seashore tourist
spots around the southern port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The "passport" package tour includes bus services plus two railway tickets and a
Sun Moon Lake pleasure boat ticket, as well as discount tickets for 19 theme
parks and 50 hotels around the island, Lai explained.</P>
      <P>Sales of the "passport" were scheduled to begin online at noon Friday  on  the
Tourism  Bureau's  tour  bus  Web  site  at http://www.taiwantourbus.com.tw.</P>
      <P>The first 1,000 online shoppers will get a discounted price of NT$999 apiece,
Lai said, adding that the "passport" will also be available at travel agencies
that use Taiwan Tourbus.</P>
      <P>The "passport" will remain valid until the end of this year, Lai said.</P>

      <P>Ending a three-day losing streak, Taiwan's share prices closed slightly higher
Thursday, on news that Taiwan will allow Chinese visitors to make purchases in
Taiwan using their China UnionPay bank cards instead of cash from Aug. 7.</P>
      <P>The weighted index, the market's key barometer, advanced 20.41 points, or 0.29
percent, to close at 6,868.65.</P>
      <P>The local bourse opened higher Thursday at 6,886.70 before reaching the day's
highest of 6,888.09.</P>
      <P>It then surrendered earlier gains and retreated to the day's lowest of 6,775.87
after a government report showed that Taiwan's consumer price index (CPI) in
July registered a 38-year record contraction of 2.33 percent year-on-year,
raising concern the island may take longer to recover from a recession.</P>
      <P>But driven by the news that Chinese bank cards will be usable in Taiwan, the
local bourse retained most of its early gains by the end of trading.</P>
      <P>A total of 5.08 billion shares changed hands on market turnover of NT$121.43
billion (US$3.70 billion).</P>
      <P>Led by banking and financial shares which rose 1 percent, three of the eight
major stock categories gained ground, with machinery and electronics shares
advancing 0.6 percent, and plastics and chemicals shares adding 0.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Cement stocks remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>The other four major stock categories  lost ground,  with construction stocks
moving down the most at 2.7 percent. Foodstuff shares fell 1.8 percent, textile
issues dropped 1.3 percent, and paper and pulp issues shed 1.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Losers outnumbered gainers 1,364 to 980,  with 163 stocks remaining unchanged.</P>
      <P>Foreign institutional investors were net sellers of NT$4.05 billion worth of
shares.</P>
      <P>Chu Yiu-chi, a senior executive of Grand Cathay Securities Investment Trust.
Co., said that the market would probably need at least a week to bottom out on
weak market turnover and rebound to above 6,950.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that it is drafting a law
to govern its engagement in international cooperation and development projects.</P>
      <P>"The law will provide a legal basis and serve as a guideline for our foreign aid
activities. It will also help speed up our efforts to achieve a more systematic,
professional, and productive approach," Weber Shih, director-general of the
MOFA's Department of Economic and Trade Affairs, said at a regular press
briefing.</P>
      <P>The draft bill will be discussed in the Executive Yuan and then forwarded to the
Legislative Yuan for review, Shih said, adding that he hopes it will be given
priority when the new session of the legislature opens in September.</P>
      <P>The ruling and opposition parties have reached an initial understanding on the
issue, he said.</P>
      <P>The bill,  which  draws on the Paris Declaration  on Aid Effectiveness of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) , is aimed at
standardizing the objectives, principles, scope, and means of Taiwan's
international cooperation and development affairs, bringing them in line with
international standards, Shih said.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, the bill designates MOFA as the authority responsible for
handling such affairs and for coordinating related efforts by other government
agencies.</P>
      <P>In addition, it may entrust foreign aid work to Taiwan's International
Cooperation and Development Fund as well as to private organizations and
professionals, Shih said.</P>
      <P>The draft bill also stipulates that the MOFA must be notified if foreign aid
projects exceed a specified amount, according to Shih. For such projects, the
opinions and assessments of an objective third party, such as a professional
institution, will be taken into consideration, he added.</P>
      <P>In the past, Taiwan's foreign aid programs have come under criticism in the
international community as tools in its diplomatic tug-of-war with China to gain
recognition by other countries.</P>
      <P>Since President Ma Ying-jeou took office last May, the government has been
considering an overhaul of its foreign aid program based on a cross-Taiwan
Strait "diplomatic truce" under which Taiwan and China would tacitly agree not
to vie for each other's allies.</P>
      <P>On May 7, the MOFA released a white paper on Taiwan's foreign aid policy,
outlining the country's vision for a specialized and reliable model to provide
more effective and meaningful overseas assistance.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan urged government agencies Thursday to speed up handling
of petitions filed by ordinary citizens of the country seeking resolution or
redress on various problems.</P>
      <P>To better protect people's rights and improve government efficiency, Liu said,
all Cabinet-level agencies must improve content of statutes governing the
people's petitions, improve the quality of the public offices' handling of
petitions, and move forward the deadlines for screening and deciding on
petitions to as early a date as possible.</P>
      <P>Topping the list of 3,170 petitions filed in 2008 were 506 from people
complaining about their right to travel overseas being restricted due to tax
evasion disputes, according  to  a report reviewing petition handling by the
administration last year.</P>
      <P>The second largest type of petition cases concerned mainland Chinese spouses'
applications to gain the right to come to Taiwan for family reunion and
permanent settlement. There were 353 such cases, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Cases involving foreign workers' employment problems in Taiwan made the third
largest group of petitions, totaling 203, the report showed.</P>
      <P>So far this year, the Executive Yuan agencies have handled 3,976 petitions,
including 806 old cases.</P>
      <P>Of the total, decisions have been made on 2,726 cases. Over half, or 57 percent
of these decisions were made within three months after receiving the petitions,
according to the report.</P>
      <P>Cases that took government agencies more than three months, but less than five
months to resolve amounted to 42.5 percent of the total cases decided upon, or
1,158 cases.</P>
      <P>Decisions were handed down after five months of screening on 14 petition cases,
according to the report. Part of the reason was various departments transferring
the petition to another department.</P>

      <P>A young and promising Taiwanese dancer has been selected to join Israels world-
acclaimed Batsheva Dance Company, making her the first person from Taiwan to do
so, the Israel Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei (ISECO) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee Chen-wei, a former member of the famous Lan Yang Dance Group who graduated
last year from Taipei National University of the ArtsSchool of Dance, will leave
in a few days for Israel to join the dance company, the ISECO said in a press
release.</P>
      <P>In a recent meeting with Lee,  Raphael Gamzou,  Israels representative to
Taiwan, wished the young dancer the best in her journey to Israel and Lee also
expressed her excitement for the opportunity to perform with Batsheva, according
to the press release.</P>
      <P>This is a golden opportunity for you and Im sure you will do a great job
there,Gamzou was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Having grown up in Taiwans northeastern Yilan County, Lee began learning to
dance at the age of 5.</P>
      <P>She was selected by Batshevas Artistic Director, Ohad Naharin, out of many young
dancers who auditioned around the world. Lee will join, at the first stage,
Batshevas Young Dancers Ensemble, and will participate in the groups performance
during the 2009-2010 season.</P>
      <P>Batsheva has scheduled a performance in Taipeis National Theater Hall in 2010,
as part of their Asian tour, and the ISECO said that it hopes Lee will be able
to join the troupe.</P>
      <P>The world-renowned Israeli Dancing Company Batsheva was founded in 1964 by
famous dancer Martha Graham and patron of dance Baroness Batsheva (aka

    <HEADLINE>Foreign Ministry to set up database of foreign aid projects</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is working on establishing a database
that will hold records of the government's foreign aid programs, taking for
reference the method used by the non-profit Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) to compile statistics, a MOFA official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-bin, director-general of MOFA's Department of Economic and Trade
Affairs, said the statistics will be similar to those of the OECD's Development
Assistance Committee (DAC) , which is made up of 23 OECD members, whose numbers
include the most important foreign aid donors.</P>
      <P>Through the DAC, the OECD deals with issues involving aid, development and
poverty reduction in developing countries, Shih added.</P>
      <P>Under the OECD's operational procedures for aid programs, members of the DAC are
required to carry out aid projects under the supervision of the OECD and to
provide statistics and reports on aid and other resources given to developing
countries, which are to be published each year, according to Shih.</P>
      <P>The DAC serves as a forum in which donor governments come together to increase
the effectiveness and the transparency of their aid, and to coordinate their
development efforts, Shih went on.</P>
      <P>The planned MOFA database will be set up similar to the one established by the
OECD, but the MOFA will make some revisions based on the needs of Taiwan's
various government agencies, Shih noted.</P>
      <P>Once the database is established, the MOFA will make it available to government
agencies related to foreign aid affairs and the International Cooperation and
Development Fund (ICDF) , a Taiwanese fund that supports development projects,
said Shih.</P>
      <P>The ministry will also work to integrate information from various organizations
regarding the implementation of foreign aid programs to keep better track of the
flow of aid resources and assess aid effectiveness, Shih added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Travel Web site reaffirms no management changes</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  6 (CNA)
08/06/09  19:54:52

    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior official of Taiwan's top online travel Web site said Thursday that the
company's name and management team will remain intact despite  changes  in its
shareholding structure.</P>
      <P>"EzTravel will remain Taiwan's best travel service brand and its management team
will not change in the wake of China's leading online travel Web site, Ctrip,
upping its stake in our company to more than 50 percent," said ezTravel
President Yu Chin-chang.</P>
      <P>Ctrip, a NASDAQ-listed company, revealed a day earlier in its second-quarter
financial report the increase of its stake in ezTravel to the level requiring it
to compile a consolidated financial statement with the latter, indirectly
acknowledging that its stake in ezTravel has exceeded 50 percent, up from the
original 20 percent.</P>
      <P>According to U.S. accounting regulations, listed enterprises are required  to
produce  consolidated  financial  statements  with subsidiaries in which they
own more than 50 percent of the shares.</P>
      <P>Yu described Ctrip as a multinational company rather than a wholly Chinese-owned
one.  With the approval of the Taiwanese government, Ctrip began to invest in
ezTravel in 2006.</P>
      <P>As ezTravel once had its shares traded on Taiwan's GreTai Securities Market
between 2007 and 2008, Yu went on, Ctrip is also known to have purchased a
number of ezTravel shares during that period.</P>
      <P>"From its financial statement, Ctrip increased its stake in ezTravel to more
than 50 percent in Q2 for the first time, " Yu said, adding that he did not know
the company's exact shareholding ratio because ezTravel's  shares are owned by
divergent  groups and individuals.</P>
      <P>"The most important thing is that Ctrip has traditionally respected our
management team, " Yu continued. "Our brand name and management team will remain
unchanged and Ctrip is not expected to post any of its staff in our company."</P>
      <P>Moreover, Yu said, both companies will benefit from their ever-closer ties.</P>
      <P>Bucking a general downward trend in the global travel market in the wake of the
worldwide financial crisis, Yu said, both ezTravel and Ctrip posted enviable
gains in business turnover and earnings in the first half of this year.</P>
      <P>The 10-year-old Ctrip registered a 27 percent year-on-year growth in its
business revenues in Q2 and a 33 percent growth in net profits during the same
period, according to the company's Q2 financial statement.</P>
      <P>In the case of ezTravel, Yu noted, the company posted its best-ever business
performance in the first half of this year since its inauguration in 2000.</P>
      <P>Yu said his company had turned down prospective European and American investors
and picked Ctrip as its partner mainly because it looks forward to the emergence
of a world-famous Taiwan-based travel agency.</P>
      <P>"It is not easy for any single Taiwanese travel agency to establish itself as a
global brand. Just one of the problems is tapping into the vast Chinese market
-- a tall order for a Taiwanese tour operator. Therefore, we needed to choose a
good partner to realize our ambitions," Yu explained.</P>
      <P>Because of the lingering global economic downturn and the worldwide influenza
A(H1N1) outbreak, many of Taiwan's 2,000-plus travel agencies have been reeling
in the recession-hit travel market. Even several of the more noted brands have
reported financial crises and many smaller ones have closed down or declared
bankruptcy.</P>
      <P>Analyzing Taiwanese travel service providers' woes, Yu said small scale and
delay in offering online services are the most serious disadvantages troubling
local operations.</P>
      <P>As many Taiwanese travel agencies have traditionally focused on incentive tour
groups funded by business corporations, they are most vulnerable to the economic
downturn, Yu pointed out.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Yu said, ezTravel's business strategies and selling styles have
been helpful to its survival during the economic hard times.</P>
      <P>"Vacationers like to seek cheaper tour packages online and tend to opt for
individual tours and domestic tours. All of these trends fit our business model.
We have been strong in these fields, " he said proudly.</P>
      <P>Last but not least is the company's joint procurement with Ctrip to cut its
costs and enhance its competitive edge, Yu said, adding that ezTravel and Ctrip
have been making joint purchases since 2007 and that their markets have not been
confined only to Taiwan, China, Hong Kong and Macau but have expanded to
Northeast and Southeast Asia.</P>

      <P>The Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) will stage an exhibition from Aug. 10
featuring the fruits of a four-year plan aimed at conserving and renewing
regional cultural assets around Taiwan, CCA officials announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at an explanatory session held at the council, a spokesman for the
CCA's Headquarters Administration of Cultural Heritage (HACH) , said the
exhibition will display the program's achievements over the past four years
through a series of activities such as seminars and workshops.</P>
      <P>During the session, the Shengping Wuchou Hand Puppet Troupe staged a show to
underscore the importance of reinvigorating the nation's cultural heritage. A
tea master also showcased the elegant rituals of the tea ceremony to show the
audience the elegance of Taiwan's tea culture.</P>
      <P>The first stage of the exhibition will run Aug. 10- 12 at the HACH's Tainan City
office, while the second stage will be held Aug. 13-23 at its Taichung City
office.</P>
      <P>During the exhibitions,  representatives and officials from grass-roots
communities,  cities  and  townships,  as well  as national-level officials,
will exchange views and experiences on how to preserve and present historical
heritage on a sustainable growth model through cooperation between the public
and private sectors.</P>
      <P>The exhibition  will also  allow  the public  to gain an understanding of the
essence and content of the program designed to conserve and revive regional
cultural practices that take place around their neighborhoods, HACH officials
said.</P>
      <P>The CCA came up with the program in 2006, seeking to better preserve and make
the best use of natural resources, historic settlements  and national  monuments
around the country in a sustainable approach through joint participation and
management by local residents.</P>
      <P>The program revolves around the idea of "regional environments" as its key
notion and integrates  concepts relating to urban development, city and
community renewal and cultural recuperation, HACH officials explained.</P>
      <P>It is also aimed at deepening the identity of Taiwan's people with their local
cultures through a diverse and open platform, in part to raise public awareness
of the significance of conserving local culture and in part to help boost local
economies and create job opportunities, the officials said.</P>
      <P>As of the end of April, the HACH had approved subsidies for 51 plans submitted
by local city and county governments, 64 plans put forward  by private
communities  and groups  and  39 central government-level projects.</P>
      <P>Lukang township in central Taiwan's Changhua County, as well as historic
monuments in southern Tainan City, have already been approved by the HACH as
state-level relics.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kaohsiung City in southern Taiwan unveiled a city renewal plan that
same day -- a project to transform a segment of the century-old railway adjacent
to Kaohsiung Port into a "railway park."</P>
      <P>The city seeks to make the run-down zone into a business district to help
bolster the local economy, and to stage activities there to attract more
tourists.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New health minister assumes office, vows to raise premiums</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  6 (CNA)
08/06/09  21:32:27
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Yang Chih-liang, a veteran public health educator and administrator, assumed
office Thursday as minister of the Department of Health (DOH) and vowed to make
the wealthy pay more for health insurance.</P>
      <P>"If I fail to follow the law in adjusting the health insurance premiums, the
watchdog Control Yuan will impeach me, but any adjustment must follow the
principle that higher-paid individuals should pay more premiums while the
impoverished should pay less, " Yang said at a changeover ceremony.</P>
      <P>Yang, a former DOH vice minister, took over the DOH helm from Yeh Chin-chuan,
who resigned Monday in preparation for his bid for the ruling Kuomintang's
candidacy in the year-end magistrate election in the eastern county of Hualien.</P>
      <P>Yang's pledge to adjust health insurance premiums came a day after the Control
Yuan censured the DOH and the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) for
failing to promptly increase health insurance premiums when the conditions were
appropriate for an adjustment.</P>
      <P>The supreme supervisory body said it will also not rule out the possibility of
impeaching the incoming health minister if the DOH continues to fail to address
the problem.</P>
      <P>For years, the BNHI has been operating in the red, with its accumulated budget
deficit having already exceeded NT$33.1 billion (US$1 billion).</P>
      <P>Yang said he will ask NHIB officials next week to come up with a premium
adjustment proposal and related complementary measures.</P>
      <P>"We will prioritize premium adjustments and then later consider an overall
overhaul of the health insurance system, " Yang said, adding that he will
strengthen communications with the public to minimize any possible backlash over
the premium adjustments.</P>
      <P>Yang further said that ordinary people should not oppose health premium
adjustments because they tend to benefit from premium hikes.</P>
      <P>"As far as premiums are concerned, the government and employers tend to assume a
larger share of the payment than the insured themselves, " he explained. "Why
not pay a bit more to get better medical and health care services?"</P>
      <P>He also outlined two other priorities on his agenda -- pushing city and county
governments to repay their debts to the BNHI and increasing the procurement of
vaccines for influenza A(H1N1) or swine flu.</P>
      <P>Many local governments owe the BNHI huge sums in unpaid health insurance
premiums, with the Taipei city government listed as the top debtor.</P>
      <P>"It would be a dereliction of duty if I fail to work with the BNHI to secure
repayment from local governments," Yang noted.</P>
      <P>With the number of confirmed A(H1N1) infections rising steadily, Yang said the
DOH will  increase  vaccine  procurement  as a precautionary measure to prevent
any possible massive-scale outbreak.</P>
      <P>The DOH has already ordered 5 million doses of A(H1N1) vaccine from Adimmune
Corp., Taiwan's only human vaccine manufacturer. The department is seeking to
purchase up to 10 million doses and may seek foreign supplies if the local
company fails to meet the DOH's demands.</P>
      <P>If necessary, Yang said, the DOH might purchase even more than 10 million doses.
"But the premise must be that the vaccine lives up to the safety requirements,"
he added.</P>
      <P>Describing his new job as a great honor, Yang said he will do his utmost to
fulfill his mission in order not to let down his superiors or his old friend
Yeh.</P>

      <P>The incident-prone newly inaugurated Muzha-Neihu line of the Taipei mass rapid
transit (MRT) system resumed operations at 4: 20 p.m. Thursday after shutting
down yet again at noon due to a network switch malfunction.</P>
      <P>The breakdown halted 26 trains on the line for four-and-a-half hours, including
five trains that stopped between two stations. The five unmanned trains had to
be driven manually to stations to allow passengers to disembark, according to
Tan Kuo- kuang, the Taipei city government's deputy secretary-general who
concurrently serves as head of the administration's emergency response task
force.</P>
      <P>The city then mobilized buses to transport the passengers to their destinations.</P>
      <P>According to Tan, a preliminary investigation found that the failure was caused
by the breakdown of a network switch at Donghu Station that caused the control
center to fail to follow the movements of the trains, prompting it to decide to
suspend services on the whole line.</P>
      <P>The line has suffered repeated glitches, including sudden stops and doors
failing to open, since it was opened to the public July 4.</P>
      <P>The largest breakdown occurred July 10 when the line ground to a halt completely
for more than eight hours because of a power failure.</P>
      <P>A survey conducted by the city government last month found that some 62 percent
of city residents polled were dissatisfied with the new line,  with the top
three complaints listed as too-small carriages,  frequent and sudden stoppages
and poorly designed stations.</P>

physical powers are in decay, he should beware of greed."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The terms of mayors and county chiefs to be elected at the end of this year will
be extended by a year to five years, according to a consensus reached Thursday
at a Ministry of the Interior (MOI) meeting.</P>
      <P>The MOI convened the inter-division  meeting to screen an amendment to the Law
on Local Government Systems in advance of the next elections of local public
office holders set for the end of this year.</P>
      <P>It was decided at the meeting that the next mayoral and county chief terms will
be extended to five years so that the next mayoral and county chief elections
can be held in tandem with the election of special municipality chiefs in 2014.</P>
      <P>"The term extension is aimed at simplifying election proceedings and saving
money," said an MOI official.</P>
      <P>An MOI ad hoc panel approved in June the upgrading of Taipei County and the
merger of Taichung City and Taichung County, Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung
County, and Tainan City and Tainan County into special municipalities.</P>
      <P>If the MOI amendment draft on the overhauled local elections clears the
legislative floor, the next mayoral and county chief elections, as well as the
elections of chiefs of five special municipalities -- Taipei, New Taipei,
Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung cities -- will be held in 2014 simultaneously,
the official said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, it was also decided at the meeting that district administrative
consultant committees will be established in the new special municipalities to
allow local elected representatives -- who are poised to lose their jobs after
the upgrade and mergers -- access to public office work.</P>
      <P>Members of the new district administrative consultant committees will not be
paid, the meeting resolved.</P>

      <P>Locally renowned artist Yang En-dian, who paints with her mouth and feet, and
two other people will receive a special Family Values Award on Father's Day Aug.
8 to recognize their strong family values, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-
day Saints -- better-known as the Mormons -- said in a press release Friday.</P>
      <P>An award presentation ceremony and press conference will be held at the Mormon
Church Taiwan Headquarters on Father's Day, according to the press release.</P>
      <P>This is the sixth consecutive year in which the church has recognized
outstanding Taiwanese citizens for their contributions to strengthening families
throughout Taiwan as they face the challenges of life.</P>
      <P>Yang was born with no arms, a deformed right leg and spine. She was abandoned by
her parents and brought to an orphanage in Kaohsiung in March 1974.</P>
      <P>Believing that the baby was "sent by the Lord, " Rev. Yang Hsu, who founded the
orphanage, named the infant "En-dian," meaning "grace and benevolence from God."</P>
      <P>Yang developed a legendary friendship with the late President Chiang Ching-kuo,
who visited the orphanage six times despite its remote location, and she became
a celebrity after a picture of her and Chiang was used on a postage stamp.</P>
      <P>Growing up to earn her own living by selling her paintings, Yang was one of the
winners of the 2007 Republic of China's Ten Outstanding Young Persons and is now
married with a daughter of her own.</P>
      <P>"Yang used her own experience and devoted herself to helping parents with
physically challenged children, teaching them to develop the strength of mind to
assist their children, " according to the church.</P>
      <P>Huang Suei-ping, founder of the Taiwan Spinocerebellar Ataxia Association, has
also been named as one of the recipients of the award for expanding her love for
her sick siblings to others with similar problems.</P>
      <P>Huang put great efforts in raising funds to help the patients and increase
awareness of the progressive degenerative genetic disease, which is
characterized by lack of coordination of gait and poor coordination of hands,
speech and eye movements.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-ming, the chief advisor of Prudential Financial Inc. Taiwan,  has
also been chosen to receive  the award for his contributions to promoting family
values. Huang is working on restoring his genealogical chart to preserve his
family history, something the Mormons value greatly.</P>

      <P>The state-owned Taiwan Financial Holdings (TFH) Co. is expected to complete all
the required procedures for public offering by the end of this year, paving the
way for its listing in late 2010 at the earliest, TFH Chairwoman Susan Chang

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to consider including Chinese yuan in Forex reserves</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Aug.  6 (CNA)
08/07/09  13:57:56
(By Jaw-pyng Hwang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires Thursday
that Taiwan can consider including the Chinese yuan in its foreign exchange
(Forex) reserves, as cross-Taiwan Strait ties are expanding at an unprecedented
pace.</P>
      <P>As trade and investment ties between Taiwan and China are set to grow further in
the coming years, Taiwan can investigate the feasibility of including the yuan
in its Forex reserves, Liu said during the interview, which was conducted in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>"This can be considered, although we do not have a timeframe at the moment, " he
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Forex reserves, which stood at US$321.09 billion at the end of July,
are the world's fourth-largest.</P>
      <P>Taipei and China expect to sign an economic cooperation framework agreement -- a
prelude to a cross-strait free-trade agreement -- "as soon as possible," Liu
said.</P>
      <P>"Next year, that's the hope, as we do feel the urgency and pressure," he went
on.</P>
      <P>China will become part of a Southeast Asian free-trade bloc in 2010, which will
pose greater challenges to Taiwan's exporters selling goods in China, he
continued.</P>
      <P>Liu also said the Ministry of Finance is expected to announce a midterm fiscal-
stabilization program in about a month, aimed at keeping the budget deficit in
check.</P>
      <P>"From next year, we plan to reduce our regular budget each year," he said,
adding that the Cabinet has forecast that its 2010 central government spending
will fall 3.8 percent to NT$1.74 trillion (US$53.21 billion) , while income is
expected to decline 7.3 percent to NT$1.55 trillion. "That would mean a budget
deficit of NT$189.1 billion, " he noted.</P>
      <P>The government has estimated a budget shortfall of NT$124.78 billion for this
year, he said.</P>
      <P>Liu also said the government will push for more nuclear power once construction
of the country's fourth nuclear power plant is completed, part of a move toward
low-carbon dioxide energy resources.</P>
      <P>Although it has a high population density, Taiwan might not be suited to
renewable energy projects on a large scale because of its geographic
limitations, but it can become a major supplier of equipment for the solar and
wind power industries, he went on.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan aims to complete by the end of 2010 its much-delayed fourth
nuclear power plant at Lungmen in Taipei County and plans to replace or augment
the three existing nuclear plants.</P>
      <P>The Lungmen power plant project, at least five years behind schedule, has been
plagued by construction delays, soaring raw material costs, and at one point a
decision by the previous administration to halt construction because of its
"nuclear-free homeland" policy.</P>
      <P>"The previous administration had a no-nuclear policy, " said Liu. "But nuclear
power has advantages of price and efficiency. We can't really say no to nuclear
power."</P>
      <P>The move toward more nuclear power and renewable energy is part of Taiwan's plan
to lower emissions of greenhouse gases to 2008 levels at some point between 2016
and 2020, and to 2000 levels by 2025.</P>
      <P>Addressing the issue of the possibility of building a fifth nuclear power plant,
Liu said that "the biggest problem is finding a site, but we can add more units
to the existing ones."</P>
      <P>Responding to the premier's remarks about a mid-term fiscal stabilization
program, Vice Finance Minister Chang Sheng-ho confirmed in Taipei that the
program is in the pipeline and is aimed at accelerating a reduction of
expenditure and broadening sources of income.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New health minister proposes raising insurance premium rate</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  6 (CNA)
08/07/09  15:50:42
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New Department of Health Minister Yang Chih-liang has advocated raising health
insurance premium rates to 5.13 percent, a change he said was necessary to close
the persistent shortfall in the program's finances.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's National Health Insurance system, created in 1998, has only raised the
premium rate once in its history, from 4.25 percent to 4.55 percent in 2002.</P>
      <P>That small increase was considered a stopgap measure at the time, but kept the
system's finances roughly in balance through 2006. Political wrangling has
prevented a further increase since large deficits re-emerged in 2007.</P>
      <P>Speaking hours before assuming the top health post Thursday, Yang said adjusting
Taiwan's premium rate will be one of his highest priorities.</P>
      <P>He proposed increasing the rate from 4.55 percent to 5.13 percent but stressed
that under the scheme, higher-income individuals would pay higher premiums while
the poor would pay less.</P>
      <P>At present, anybody earning over NT$126,301 per month has their premium
calculated using an income basis of NT$131,700, but Yang said the ceiling would
be raised in the new plan. At the same time, low-income individuals near the
poverty line would have their premiums reduced by up to 50 percent.</P>
      <P>"The current problems exist because rich people pay too little while poor people
are overburdened, " said Yang, who took over the post from Yeh Ching-chuan.</P>
      <P>If the premium rate is raised to 5.13 percent, office workers with a monthly
salary of NT$40,000 (US$1,223) would pay an extra NT$70 per month in premiums,
while their employers would contribute an additional NT$140 per month on their
behalf.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, the Control Yuan censured the DOH and its Bureau of National
Health Insurance (BNHI) for their failure to promptly increase health insurance
premium rates when the conditions were appropriate for such an adjustment.</P>
      <P>The body, responsible for overseeing the integrity of government agencies and
workers, said it would not rule out the possibility of impeaching the incoming
health minister if the DOH fails to address its deficit, which has ballooned to
NT$33.1 billion.</P>
      <P>Responding to the Control Yuan's reprimand, Yang said he will ask the health
insurance bureau come up with a premium adjustment proposal and complementary
measures next week.</P>
      <P>"We will prioritize premium adjustments and then consider an overhaul of the
health insurance system at a later stage, " Yang said.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for a private alliance of national health insurance monitoring
groups questioned Yang's strategy Friday, arguing that premiums calculated based
on individuals' income would not be effective in getting the wealthy to pay
higher premiums.</P>
      <P>Teng Hsi-hua said many wealthy people in Taiwan are not salaried workers but
rather accumulate income through stock market or real estate transactions or
rental income on their properties, which are not included in the income basis on
which premiums are figured.</P>
      <P>"Even if the income ceiling to calculate premiums is raised to NT200,000 per
month, it will still not sufficiently reflect the assets of the wealthy," Teng
said.</P>
      <P>Teng suggested that the DOH directly promote a second-generation health
insurance premium scheme, which would calculate premiums based on "overall
household income" rather than "individual salaries."</P>

      <P>Taiwan has officially provided assistance to the U.S.-based nongovernmental
Humpty Dumpty Institute (HDI) in support of a program aimed at promoting land
mine removal and assisting land mine and unexploded ordnance survivors in
Vietnam.</P>
      <P>A memorandum of understanding on cooperation was signed in New York Thursday by
Kenneth Liao, director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New York,
and HDI President Ralph Cwerman.</P>
      <P>Liao later handed a US$200,000 check to Cwerman on behalf of his government.</P>
      <P>The amount is intended to support the HDI's ongoing efforts to remove land mines
in Vietnam and to expand mushroom farming there to generate jobs and income for
those who have been left disabled by land mines or unexploded ordnance.</P>
      <P>Over the next two years, Taiwan will also send mushroom farming experts to
Vietnam to take part in the program.</P>
      <P>Building on a small mushroom growing project launched by the institute in
Vietnam's Quang Tri province in 2000, the program is designed to take mushroom
farming in the province to the next level by introducing modern production
technology and developing a strong partnership between Quang Tri mushroom
farmers and the U.S. mushroom industry.</P>
      <P>Quang Tri is one of the Vietnamese provinces that have been most severely
affected by land mines and unexploded ordnance.</P>
      <P>Vietnam now reports 2,000 casualties  from land mines and unexploded ordnance
annually,  rivaling Cambodia and Angola as countries with the world's highest
proportion of amputees, according to the HDI.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Friday:</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Getting local governments to pay premiums owed</P>
      <P>New health minister Yang Chih-liang  vowed to improve the financial health of
the National Health Insurance program by raising the premium rate and collecting
overdue premiums owed by local governments.</P>
      <P>We have to applaud the new minister for daring to go after the overdue payments,
totaling NT$60.3 billion, of which Taipei City accounts for NT$34.7 billion.</P>
      <P>Taipei City's delinquent payments arose from the refusal of its former mayor,
President Ma Ying-jeou, to pay the premium to boycott the then-Democratic
Progressive Party administration.</P>
      <P>Since Ma was elected president, it is time for the city to stop the boycott and
pay what it owes.</P>
      <P>But we urge Yang to reconsider raising premiums, which will force many people
who can hardly find a job amid the financial crisis to drop out of the health
insurance program.</P>
      <P>There are other ways--- such closing wasteful loopholes -- to improve the
financial health of the system.</P>
      <P>Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>Probe three sham projects in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Taipei City currently has three poorly executed public projects -- the Maokong
Gondola, the MRT Neihu Line, and the Xinsheng Elevated Expressway.</P>
      <P>All of them were caused not by corrupt officials but by incompetent officials,
and we have to point out that corrupt officials who are able to get things done
are better than incompetent officials.</P>
      <P>We urge law enforcement authorities to probe the projects and end the flawed
public tendering systems that led to the glitches that are plaguing these public
works initiatives.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Fat cats are raising their ugly heads again</P>
      <P>As the global financial tsunami subsides, fat cats are again raising their heads
around the world,  with some high-profile multinational  companies  paying huge
bonuses  to their senior executives.</P>
      <P>These fat cats, many of whom received lucrative compensation despite
contributing to their companies' failures, caused an uproar around the world and
were branded as shameless by U.S. President Barack Obama.</P>
      <P>To the anger of the general public, many took their bonuses from government
subsidies allocated to keep their cash-strapped companies afloat.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has its own share of greedy fat cats, who skim off the lion's share of
their companies' profits as bonuses. To the chagrin of investors, the Financial
Supervisory Commission can do nothing but require that their names and the size
of their bonuses be made public.</P>
      <P>Investors should shun these companies.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Is DPP ready for ex-president's sentence?</P>
      <P>The court is set to hand down a ruling in the corruption case involving ex-
President Chen Shui-bian and his family members.</P>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party will then face a number of dilemmas, such as
whether it should expel Chen or continue to support him and boycott his trials,
and whether it should separate Chen and its cause for Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>All these questions are connected with each other.</P>
      <P>DPP Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu's success in holding the World Games has proven
that it is possible for DPP politicians to part with Chen Shui-bian and go their
separate ways.</P>
      <P>The DPP will not be able to free itself from the thorn in its side unless it
expels Chen and condemns him.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP slams panel's planned hearing on ECFA referendum</HEADLINE>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) voiced objections Friday to a
plan by a Cabinet panel to hold a debate on whether a proposed Taiwan-China
trade pact should be put to a nationwide referendum.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said the referendum screening panel under the
Executive Yuan, in compliance with the Referendum Law, is authorized to
determine whether a proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
between Taiwan and China can be put to a popular vote, but the panel is not
empowered to host a debate on the issue.</P>
      <P>The 21-member screening panel announced a day earlier that it will sponsor a
public hearing Aug. 18 to discuss the DPP's initiative asking voters to decide
if a referendum should be held on the proposed ECFA.</P>
      <P>The panel decided to invite officials from the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) , including Minister Yiin Chii-ming, DPP representatives, such as DPP
Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, and experts to debate the pros and cons of such a trade
pact in a public hearing.</P>
      <P>The panel also said it will decide Aug. 27 on whether the DPP's referendum drive
meets the criteria laid out in the Referendum Law.</P>
      <P>Cheng accused the referendum screening panel of "expanding its power" to examine
the ECFA under the pretext of a public hearing.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the Referendum Law only bars issues related to budgets,
taxation, investment, salaries and government personnel from being decided in a
referendum, but the potential framework agreement, which could affect Taiwan's
job market and people's livelihoods, does not fall in those categories and can
be put to a popular vote.</P>
      <P>The pro-independence DPP filed an application with the Central Election
Commission (CEC) July 20 to hold a referendum that would have voters decide if
the government should hold a popular vote on a proposed ECFA with China.</P>
      <P>The DPP's petition must be approved by the CEC screening panel before it can
progress to the next stage, where it will need to obtain the signatures of at
least 850,000 eligible voters for the referendum to be held.</P>
      <P>The DPP has repeatedly voiced strong opposition to an ECFA between Taiwan and
China over fears that it would compromise Taiwan's sovereignty and job market.</P>
      <P>According to the MOEA, Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) could fall by an
estimated 0.176 percent if the two sides fail to sign an ECFA by Jan. 1. 2010,
when the "ASEAN plus one" trade bloc -- comprised of China and ASEAN member
states -- is established.</P>
      <P>The lack of an ECFA would also negatively affect Taiwan's annual exports,
imports and trade surplus, driving them down by 0.421 percent, 0.601 percent and
US$180 million, respectively, the MOEA estimated.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level National Youth Commission (NYC) has launched a program that it
hopes will inject some youthful vitality into Taiwan's aging rural townships
with the help of local colleges, universities, and nonprofit organizations.</P>
      <P>The commission will provide subsidies to academic institutions and civic groups
to set up service centers manned by young volunteers in the townships and
provide services needed by local communities, the commission said in a
statement.</P>
      <P>The NYC said it has selected 12 of 368 townships around Taiwan as targets for
the program, including Fusing in Taoyuan County, Dongyin in Lienchiang County,
Dali in Taichung County, Sihu in Changhua County and Jhushan in Nantou County.</P>
      <P>The others are Daliao in Kaohsiung County, Pingtung City in Pingtung County,
Huxi in Penghu County, Toucheng in Yilan County, Sioulin in Hualien County, and
Luye in Taitung County.</P>
      <P>Colleges, universities and nonprofit civic groups are all welcome to apply for
the up to NT$800,000 (US$24,400) in subsidies that will go to paying for people
to plan the center, travel expenses, administrative costs, volunteer training
and publicity.</P>
      <P>The centers will run for a period of 16 months, between September 2009 and
December 2010.</P>
      <P>The planners' tasks will include initiating volunteer service projects based on
local need, developing links with local facilities manned by young volunteers,
and outlining volunteer  training programs.</P>
      <P>NYC Minister Wang Yu-ting said she hopes the installation of the service centers
will attract young blood to revitalize  their hometowns and boost local
development.</P>
      <P>The NYC was established in 1966 to be responsible for "organizing and handling
the guidance of youths in the country."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Friday that it is looking into the
World Health Organization's use of the termTaiwan (China)to refer to the
country.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was referred to asTaiwan (China) in an article titled "Taiwan (China)
urges event planners to take precautions against Pandemic (H1N1) 2009, which was
posted online Aug. 4 by the WHO's Western Pacific Regional Office located in
Manila, Philippines.</P>
      <P>"The Foreign Ministrys representative in the Philippines is now looking into the
matter and will lodge a protest and request a correction from the world health
body, but the process could take some time,said MOFA spokesman Henry Chen.</P>
      <P>We hope that Taiwan can be referred to as Chinese Taipei in WHO agencies and
meetings. This is the goal that we are working toward, " he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which lost its Republic of China seat at the United Nations in 1971, has
long been referred to as "Taiwan, China" or other designations that subjugate
Taiwan to China by the U.N. and affiliated agencies, such as the WHO.</P>
      <P>It was hoped that would change in the WHO after Taiwan was admitted as an
observer to the World Health Assembly in May this year under the name "Chinese
Taipei."</P>
      <P>The WHO also used that designation in its early situation updates on the number
of influenza A (H1N1) cases reported around the world.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Central Bank cool to idea of holding Chinese yuan in forex reserves</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's central bank seemed to have little interest Friday in a suggestion by
the country's premier that it should consider including Chinese yuan in its
foreign exchange reserve portfolio.</P>
      <P>In a statement released Friday, The Central Bank of the Republic of China
(Taiwan) (CBC) said that no central bank in the world has holdings of Chinese
yuan among its foreign exchange reserves because the yuan is not a freely
convertible currency, a strong hint that it would not want to hold the yuan
anytime soon.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires published
Thursday that "Taiwan can consider including the Chinese yuan in its forex
reserves, as cross-Taiwan Strait ties are expanding at an unprecedented pace."</P>
      <P>As trade and investment ties between Taiwan and China are set to grow further in
the coming years, Taiwan can investigate the feasibility of including the yuan
in its forex reserves, Liu also said during the interview, which was conducted
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"This can be considered, although we do not have a timeframe at the moment, " he
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Forex reserves, which stood at US$321.09 billion at the end of July,
are the world's fourth-largest, behind only those of China, Japan and Russia, in
that order.</P>
      <P>Also in the statement, the CBC dismissed a local print media report published
Friday which claimed that roughly 60 percent of the CBC's foreign exchange
reserve holdings are U.S. dollars and 35 percent are euros.</P>
      <P>"The report was sheer fabrication and way off base, " the CBC said.</P>
      <P>The CBC has never disclosed its asset allocation.</P>

      <P>Police is tracking down the owner of a fake Central Personnel Administration
(CPA) Web site that has posted unauthorized announcements on school and office
closures for Typhoon Morakot, Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) officials said
Friday.</P>
      <P>At around 1 p.m. Thursday, the Web site at http: //tw886.tw announced that all
schools and government offices in northern and central Taiwan would be closed
Friday because of the storm.</P>
      <P>As the site appeared similar to the CPA's official site, it convinced many
Internet users that the announcement was truly made by the CPA. It was only
after checking with their local governments that users realized they were
fooled.</P>
      <P>The CIB launched an investigation into the case after receiving a report from
the CPA that evening and discovered that the Web site fell within the domain of
Chunghwa Telecom.</P>
      <P>The police are currently cooperating with the telecom company to check the
site's IP address. It is likely to arrest the owner if the address is confirmed
to be local, CIB officials said.</P>
      <P>While the CPA has requested that the owner be charged with forgery, the
officials said the suspect may not get convicted if the act was intended simply
as a prank.</P>

      <P>Typhoon Morakot battered Taiwan Friday and caused isolated damage, but its heavy
rains have also replenished the country's reservoirs, easing mounting fears of a
looming drought and water rationing, the Water Resources Agency (WRA) reported
Friday.</P>
      <P>The center of the storm was located 90 kilometers off the coast of Hualian
County as of 5 p.m. Friday, moving in a north-northwest direction at 11km/hr.
The storm was packing maximum sustained winds of 144kph.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's reservoirs have accumulated an additional 167 million cubic meters of
water because of the storm, which the water agency said will bring an end to
night time water rationing in Keelung City, Taoyuan County, Tainan City and
Tainan County.</P>
      <P>In the north, the storm had contributed 20 million cubic meters of water to
Feitsui Reservoir, raising its level to 150.95 meters as of Friday noon, less
than 20 meters short of its full supply level. The reservoir will consider
releasing water if the water level goes above 163 meters.</P>
      <P>Shihmen Reservoir has added approximately 80 million cubic meters of rainwater,
raising its level to 230.8 meters as of 10 a.m. Friday. The reservoir's maximum
level is 245 meters.</P>
      <P>In the south, Tsengwen Reservoir had collected about 40 million cubic meters of
water, while Wushantou and Paoshan reservoirs also received large volumes of
rainfall.</P>
      <P>The level of stored water at Nanhua Reservoir had risen to 175.34 meters by
1p.m. Friday, close to its full supply level of 180 meters.</P>
      <P>Because Typhoon Morakot was slowing down, meteorologists forecast that Taiwan
would be in for an extended period of heavy rain that could force reservoirs to
actually release excess water in the coming hours.</P>
      <P>From Thursday until Friday noon, accumulated rainfall had reached the level of
"torrential" rain -- defined as 200mm of rainfall over a 24-hour period -- in
mountain areas in Kaohsiung, Pingtung, Hsinchu, Miaoli and Yilan counties, the
Central Weather Bureau said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, accumulated rainfall had exceeded 400 mm in Sandimen Township in
Pingtung County, and Fanlu in Chiayi County.</P>
      <P>More than 73,469 households around the country have experienced power outages as
a result of the typhoon, including 10,621 households in Taichung.</P>
      <P>The typhoon also forced the evacuation of more than 1,000 people in mountainous
areas in Hsinchu and Taoyuan County Friday as a safety precaution.</P>
      <P>Financial markets, schools and banks around the country were also closed on
Friday in anticipation of the storm, and around 20 flights to outlying islands
were canceled Friday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, some ferry operators announced that service from Taiwan to Makung,
Matsu, Liouciou and Green Island would be suspended Friday and Saturday.</P>
      <P>They warned of the potential for extensive damage caused by strong winds and
torrential rains in northern Taiwan both Friday and Saturday and cautioned
residents in mountainous areas to be aware of the possibility of landslides.</P>

      <P>The United States' continuing assistance in helping Taiwan acquire necessary
defensive weapons is important to the efficient promotion and stable development
of cross-Taiwan Strait ties, the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
chairwoman said Friday.</P>
      <P>The comment by Lai Shin-yuan, made at a meeting with visiting U.S. Congressman
and co-chair of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus Phil Gingrey (R-GA) at the MAC
Thursday, was released in a MAC statement issued Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the statement, Lai described the gradual improvement in the
relations between Taiwan and China, who were once stubborn rivals, as a rare
historic moment.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China should continue to conduct talks, dialogue and negotiations to
build mutual trust and to lay a stepping stone for future eternal peace in the
strait, she said.</P>
      <P>Lai also asserted that increasing interaction between peoples from across the
strait will strengthen the Taiwan identity of the Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>Lai reiterated that the two sides should respect the fact that they co-exist in
international society and therefore should pursue international cooperation by
treating each other with equality and dignity.</P>
      <P>Gingrey encouraged Taiwan to continue its bid to join influential international
organizations, including the United Nations, and Lai responded that it was the
right and expectation of Taiwan's people to participate in the international
community without having their dignity harmed.</P>
      <P>She hoped that China, which has suppressed Taiwan's international space, could
understand how Taiwanese people feel on the matter.</P>
      <P>Gingrey arrived in Taiwan Aug. 5 for a four-day visit. He is described by
President Ma Ying-jeou as one of Taiwan's most faithful friends in the U.S.
Congress. He endorsed a House of Representatives resolution that marked the 30th
anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act.</P>

      <P>Criteria to close schools in Taiwan due to an outbreak of swine flu, or
influenza A (H1N1) , will be announced Aug. 15, Taiwan's top health official
said Friday.</P>
      <P>New Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yang Chih-liang said the DOH and the
Ministry of Education have reached a consensus on the school closure issue and
have decided to make a joint announcement Aug. 15, more than two weeks before
schools open Sept. 1.</P>
      <P>The DOH said last week that it may propose a nationwide school closure if the
current influenza A (H1N1) outbreak gets more serious after local schools reopen
following the summer break.</P>
      <P>Speaking at his first meeting on epidemic control since assuming his post
Thursday, Yang said Taiwan will adopt a school closure measure that is stricter
than that imposed in the United States.</P>
      <P>"Our criteria will be more restrictive than those used in the United States,
where health authorities suggest that affected students stay home but schools
need not close in the event of an A (H1N1) outbreak," Yang said.</P>
      <P>In principle, the DOH would ask affected students to stay home if they were to
come down with the virus, said Lin Ting, deputy director-general of the DOH's
Centers for Disease Control (CDC).</P>
      <P>According to CDC Director-General Kuo Hsu-sung, the new swine flu virus is
transmitted and mutates very rapidly. There have been several thousands of cases
in Taiwan, but most were mild, he said.</P>
      <P>"More than 85 percent of local flu patients over the past week were infected
with the swine flu virus, " Kuo said, adding that the ratio may even surpass 95
percent in the future as has been seen in the United States, Britain, Japan and
Australia.</P>
      <P>Taking cues from those countries' experiences, Kuo said, the CDC has drawn up
plans to cope with a possible further spread of the disease, particularly after
local schools reopen in the fall.</P>
      <P>"Campus flu infections are most likely to trigger community cluster infections,
so we may advise the Education Ministry to close all schools to contain a
further spread of the virus," he said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's colleges and universities will suffer their lowest enrollment and
highest vacancies when the new school semester begins in September,  according
to enrollment statistics released Friday.</P>
      <P>A total of 76,434 students landed a spot in a Taiwanese university, resulting in
a record high of 6,802 vacancies on the campuses and another record high college
admission rate of 97.14 percent, according to the Joint Board of the College
Recruitment Commission.</P>
      <P>That was up from 4,788 vacancies and a college admission rate of 97.10 percent
for last school year, commission statistics showed.</P>
      <P>Admission rates and vacancies at higher learning institutions have been steadily
rising in Taiwan in recent years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's falling birth rate and the rapid increase in the number of colleges and
universities opened in Taiwan over the past 15 years are the main reasons behind
this trend.</P>
      <P>In 1986, there were only 28 four-year colleges and universities across Taiwan,
but the number surged to 147 in 2008 -- the result of a government policy to
reduce pressure and make it easier for high school students trying to get into a
university.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) on Friday urged colleges with low enrollment to
nonetheless fully protect enrolled students' and teaching staff's interests
despite their low enrollments.</P>
      <P>Ho Cho-fei, director of the MOE's Department of Higher Education, asked low-
enrollment colleges and universities to remain committed to giving their
students sufficient training, no matter how small their student population is.</P>
      <P>To cope with this problem, Ho said the ministry will work out a mechanism to
require schools with low enrollment to transform themselves or withdraw from the
market.</P>
      <P>A total of 18 college and university departments in Taiwan failed to recruit any
students for the coming semester, according to the commission's figures.</P>
      <P>Hsing Kuo University of Management in Tainan City had the highest number of
1,465 vacancies, as five of its 13 departments were unable to attract a single
applicant. Only 14 would-be freshmen were recruited by Hsing Kuo despite a total
of 1,479 spaces available.</P>
      <P>Four departments in Leader University in Tainan City also posted zero-
enrollment, with the university recruiting only 49 potential freshmen.</P>
      <P>One department each of Mingdao University in central Changhua County and NanHua
University in southern Chiayi County also failed to attract a single student.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an applicant aged 63 was the oldest freshman in Taiwan accepted by a
university this year. He has been admitted to the English Literature Department
at Aletheia University. The youngest college applicant is almost 16 years old.
He was recruited by the Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology of
National Taiwan University.</P>

than 20 meters short of its full supply level. The reservoir will consider
releasing water if the water level goes above 163 meters.</P>
      <P>Shihmen Reservoir has added approximately 80 million cubic meters of rainwater,
raising its level to 230.8 meters as of 10 a.m. Friday. The reservoir's maximum
level is 245 meters.</P>
      <P>In the south, Tsengwen Reservoir had collected about 40 million cubic meters of
water, while Wushantou and Paoshan reservoirs also received large volumes of
rainfall.</P>
      <P>The level of stored water at Nanhua Reservoir had risen to 175.34 meters by
1p.m. Friday, close to its full supply level of 180 meters.</P>
      <P>Because Typhoon Morakot was slowing down, meteorologists forecast that Taiwan
would be in for an extended period of heavy rain that could force reservoirs to
actually release excess water in the coming hours.</P>
      <P>From Thursday until Friday noon, accumulated rainfall had reached the level of
"torrential" rain -- defined as 200mm of rainfall over a 24-hour period -- in
mountain areas in Kaohsiung, Pingtung, Hsinchu, Miaoli and Yilan counties, the
Central Weather Bureau said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, accumulated rainfall had exceeded 400 mm in Sandimen Township in
Pingtung County, and Fanlu in Chiayi County.</P>
      <P>More than 73,469 households around the country have experienced power outages as
a result of the typhoon, including 10,621 households in Taichung.</P>
      <P>The typhoon also forced the evacuation of more than 1,000 people in mountainous
areas in Hsinchu and Taoyuan County Friday as a safety precaution.</P>
      <P>Financial markets, schools and banks around the country were also closed on
Friday in anticipation of the storm, and around 20 flights to outlying islands
were canceled Friday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, some ferry operators announced that service from Taiwan to Makung,
Matsu, Liouciou and Green Island would be suspended Friday and Saturday.</P>
      <P>They warned of the potential for extensive damage caused by strong winds and
torrential rains in northern Taiwan both Friday and Saturday and cautioned
residents in mountainous areas to be aware of the possibility of landslides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cross-strait steel companies sign cooperative deal</HEADLINE>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung-based China Steel Corp. (CSC) has signed an agreement with China's
Sinosteel Corp. to purchase raw materials and equipment from China's second-
biggest iron ore trader while selling it steel products from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>CSC Executive Vice President L. M. Chung signed the cooperation agreement with
his Sinosteel counterpart Li Yi at CSC headquarters Friday. If the deal works
out, it can be renewed on a yearly basis in the future.</P>
      <P>The two companies signed a strategic cooperation agreement in 2006 to boost
mutual exchanges and cooperation, but Friday's deal is the first time they have
pledged to buy each other's products.</P>
      <P>The deal was struck as international steel prices are surging, forcing CSC to
increase the domestic prices of its steel products by an average of 9.4 percent,
beginning in September.</P>
      <P>The higher prices are expected to improve CSC's results in the third and fourth
quarters and more than offset the NT$15 billion (US$457.69 million) loss it
sustained in the first half of the year, according to analysts.</P>
      <P>Sinosteel is involved in developing and processing metallurgical mineral
resources, and trading and logistics related to metallurgical raw materials and
products. It owns more than 80 subsidiaries, over 20 of which are based outside
China.</P>
      <P>CSC is the largest integrated steel maker in Taiwan. In 2006, it was listed by
the International Iron and Steel Institute (IISI) as the world's 25th largest
steel producer.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Prices of vegetables have risen by an average 20 percent to 30 percent since
Wednesday in anticipation that supplies would fall with the arrival of Typhoon
Morakot, market sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>The average wholesale price of vegetables rose from NT$16.4 per kilo on Aug. 5
to NT$19.8 per kilo a day later at the Siluo fruit and vegetables market in
central Taiwan, according to figures compiled by the Council of Agriculture. No
data was yet available for Friday.</P>
      <P>At the Taipei wholesale fruit and vegetable market, the average price of
vegetables soared to NT$27.9 per kilo Friday, up 32.2 percent from the NT$21.1
per kilo average Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The COA said the price hikes were almost entirely driven by expectations that
the approaching storm would disrupt harvests, as supplies remained stable.</P>
      <P>But the council indicated that it will distribute some 7,770 metric tons of
frozen vegetables, including 5,683 tons of root vegetables, 2,014 tons of leafy
vegetables, and 73 tons of other fruits and vegetables, around the country to
meet possible shortages and help stabilize prices.</P>
      <P>Wholesale prices of most vegetables rose dramatically Friday, with the average
price of 10 out of 76 types of high grade vegetables exceeding NT$100 per kilo,
according to Taipei Agricultural Products Transportation Co.</P>
      <P>The price of asparagus was the highest at NT$200 per kilo, followed by coriander
at NT$170, string beans at NT$125, sweet peppers at NT$123, green bamboo shoots
at NT$115, garlic at NT$115, yellow chives at NT$105, peeled water bamboos at
NT$100, chilies at NT$100 and baby corn at NT$100, the comapany said.</P>
      <P>Three hypermarts took advantage of the high prices at traditional markets by
offering discounts on vegetables to lure consumers, most of whom were at home as
financial markets, schools and most offices around the country were closed
because of the storm.</P>
      <P>Geant, RT-Mart and Carrefour all launched a vegetable sales campaign by
respectively offering 150,000, 5,000, and 60,000 bundles of vegetables for
NT$3-NT$10 each, creating strong buying interest.</P>
      <P>The COA reported that as of 1 p.m. Friday, Morakot has led to losses of NT$5.02
million (US$153,000) in crops in Kaohsiung County, Pingtung County and Chiayi
City, with portions of 144 hectares of farmland affected.</P>
      <P>Bananas and cauliflower were the most affected crops, according to the COA.</P>

      <P>The son of Stanley Ho, Macau's casino king, visited the island county of Kinmen
Friday to learn about its investment environment and specifically the
feasibility of building a casino there.</P>
      <P>Lawrence Ho, chairman and CEO of Melco International Development, arrived at
Shanyi airport in Kinmen on his private jet at 10:30 a.m., the first flight to
fly directly from Hong Kong to the Taiwan-held island just off China's
southeastern coast.</P>
      <P>Ho gathered with other Melco executives, who had arrived in Kinmen by ferry from
Xiamen, before calling on Magistrate Lee Chu-feng.</P>
      <P>Melco had already sent executives to visit Kinmen in May after Taiwan passed an
amendment in January paving the way to open casinos in outlying islands.</P>
      <P>Ho said he has confidence in Kinmen's investment environment and that he is
especially interested in its entertainment sector.</P>
      <P>Lee responded that he is happy that foreign capital may come to the county but
reminded his guest that whether or not Kinmen will allow a casino to open hinges
on public opinion.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that opinion polls have consistently shown considerable opposition
among local residents to such an idea and said he will wait until there are more
concrete plans before putting the matter to a public referendum, as is required
by law.</P>
      <P>Ho returned to Hong Kong at 3:15 p.m.</P>

    <HEADLINE>A-moms struggling to keep colorful dreams alive</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/08/09  12:45:06</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Visitors to the central country of Nantou who become familiar with Chungliao
township after the devastating 921 earthquake will have no trouble finding the
building that houses A-mom's Dyeing Workshop, as it stands in the town as it did
10 years ago.</P>
      <P>The difference now is that very few customers are calling at the shop on
Yungping Road, even on holidays or weekends.</P>
      <P>The flood of people that poured into the area after the 7.3 magnitude earthquake
struck on Sept. 21, 1999 has trickled off and so has business at the hand dyeing
shop.</P>
      <P>Established by a loosely formed group of local women after the earthquake, the
shop sells items that are colored with dyes made from natural plants that grow
in the nearby mountains.</P>
      <P>It also offers do-it-yourself classes for visitors to learn the basic techniques
used by the over 10 mothers and housewives -- known as A-moms -- to dye the
colorful pillows, cellphone pouches, sheets, notebooks and other items on sale
at the shop.</P>
      <P>The women learned their craft from professionals provided by the Taipei-based
ROC Community Resources Exchange Association, and the shop got off to brisk
start after it officially opened in 2003 with financial assistance from the
Council of Labor Affairs.</P>
      <P>However, the colorful dreams of the A-moms are being crushed by the bitter
reality of fewer and fewer visitors over the years.</P>
      <P>"We will not give up, because we don't want it to be just a flash in the pan, "
said Wu Mei-chen, manager of the workshop.</P>
      <P>In their efforts to revive the business, the women refurbished the run-down
workshop and set up the classroom where visitors can learn and practice the
basics of dyeing.</P>
      <P>"At one point, we even hired fashion experts to teach us how to pose and model
and this helped to attract some visitors and boost our revenues for a while,"
said Wu.  "However, in the last two or three years, very few tourists have been
calling at the workshop, and we'd be lucky if 10 people a day come by on
weekends."</P>
      <P>This is mainly because large crowds of people are no longer visiting the
Chungliao area as they did after 921 earthquake, she said, adding that another
factor is the township's relatively remote location.</P>
      <P>The variety of colorfully dyed products on display in the workshop are also not
moving off the shelves because the women lack knowledge of the marketing process
and government assistance has dried up, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The other women also expressed concern over the future of the business to which
they have given so much time and effort and which now earns them only a few
thousand New Taiwan dollars a month.</P>
      <P>One of the women, Chien Chien-mei, called for the government to assist them in
exploring markets and setting up a system to certify their products.</P>
      <P>But the women are not sitting back and waiting. They are trying on their own to
think of new ways to put the workshop back on its feet.</P>
      <P>"We are mulling a transformation plan to achieve sustainable growth for the
workshop, which we established from scratch, and we will continue to strive for
its success despite the tremendous difficulties we are experiencing," said Wu.</P>

      <P>The National Science Council postponed Saturday the opening of an astronomy
exhibition, which was planned to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Galileo's
first observation of space and International Year of Astronomy 2009.</P>
      <P>"The opening ceremony has been put off to next Monday due to Typhoon Morakot,"
according to Delicacy Integrated Marketing Company, one of the organizers.</P>
      <P>At 9 a.m., Typhoon Morakot was centered 40 km south of Taipei City, packing
maximum sustained winds of 119 kph and moving northwest out of Taiwan at 11 kph,
according to Central Weather Bureau data. The storm has brought strong winds and
heavy rains across Taiwan and caused at least two deaths. As of Saturday noon,
four people were reported missing in the storm.</P>
      <P>The NSC exhibit, titled "400 Years of Sky Gazing, " is aimed at explaining
astronomy,  showing how it is related to history, literature, religion, science
and technology, and detailing how it has impacted on human exploration of the
universe.</P>
      <P>The exhibition is being organized by the NSC, Ministry of Education,
Astronomical Society of the Republic of China, Taipei City Government,  and
National  Taiwan  University's  Institute  of Astrophysics.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei-based British Trade and Cultural Office (BTCO) said in its latest
e-newsletter that it will hold a series of activities on climate change as part
of a U.K. government program that is geared toward a global pact on the issue.</P>
      <P>This year is a landmark one for climate change, as the nations of the world will
gather in Copenhagen in December to work out a new international agreement to
tackle climate change because the Kyoto Protocol will expire in 2012, according
to the BTCO.</P>
      <P>The British government has launched a Web site called "Act on Copenhagen, "
which represents the official position of the U.K. on climate change
negotiations, and it has also initiated "The Road to Copenhagen" program that
sets out the U.K.'s case for an ambitious international agreement at Copenhagen.</P>
      <P>The program focuses on urgent action to limit global temperature increases to no
more than two degrees Celsius, beyond which the risks of dangerous climate
change become much greater.</P>
      <P>As part of the efforts, the BTCO is planning to work with the non-governmental
Taiwan Environmental Actions Network to hold a workshop on climate change Aug.
25-26 at Youth Hub in downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>"The workshop is aimed at increasing awareness of climate change among college
and university graduate students and helping them develop concrete plans for
future campus or community actions on combating the issue," according to the
BTCO.</P>
      <P>The BTCO and Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs will together organize a
forum on greenhouse gas management, which is scheduled to take place Sept. 29 at
National Taiwan University's International Convention Center, the e-newsletter
said.</P>
      <P>Experts and representatives of governmental, industrial, academic and research
sectors from home and abroad will participate in the event to discuss how to
fight climate change.</P>
      <P>At the workshop, five British experts will share their views on the policies and
international  cooperation mechanisms for the promotion of a low-carbon dioxide
society, the trend of the European Union's "Carbon Labeling," and measures to
lower corporate greenhouse gas emissions.</P>

per hour, had weakened considerably by the time the eye hit the coastline of
Hualien at 11: 50 p.m. Friday, and was downgraded  to a tropical storm Saturday
noon,  according  to forecasters.</P>
      <P>As of 11 a.m. Saturday, the storm was centered at 20 km south-southeast of
Taipei and was moving at a speed of 11 km per hour.</P>
      <P>According to forecasters, the storm's center will not leave the island until
Saturday afternoon and its outer rim will not leave until Sunday.</P>
      <P>They warned the public to guard against torrential rain which will continue
islandwide for days after the storm has left.</P>
      <P>As the storm drenched the island Friday, a weather station in Pingtung recorded
1003.5 mm of precipitation, the 7th highest ever recorded in a single day in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau predicted that Morakot will bring about 2000 mm of
accumulated rainfall to the island.</P>
      <P>The rain will be welcomed in some areas,  as Taiwan had experienced an unusually
dry spell in the first seven months of the year, with accumulated precipitation
recorded at 700 mm, or half of the normal volume.</P>
      <P>Before the approach of Typhoon Morakot last week, at least four counties had
begun rationing water.</P>
      <P>But on Saturday morning, Shihmen Reservoir in Taoyuan County, which was almost
half dry last week, had to open its floodgates as Morakot had filled it up in
just one day.</P>
      <P>However, the storm wreaked havoc on air and sea transportation, forcing airlines
and shipping companies to cancel all outbound flights and marine services until
Saturday noon.</P>
      <P>By Saturday afternoon,  about 80 percent of domestic  and international flights
had resumed.</P>
      <P>At its peak strength Friday, the storm caused power outages in 896,833
households around the island and electricity grid workers had to brave the
strong winds and heavy rain to fix the power system, according to Taiwan Power
Company.</P>
      <P>At Saturday noon, some 163,075 households were still without power, the company
said.</P>
      <P>Mudslides were reported in mountainous areas in the counties of Nantou, Pingdong
and Taitung, forcing the closure of some bridges during the storm.</P>
      <P>The torrential rain, coinciding with the monthly tide along the coastline of
southern Taiwan, triggered flooding in the townships of Linbian, Jiadong,
Donggang and Sinyuan, all in Pingdong County.</P>
      <P>Flooding was also reported in Taimali, Taitung County when a river bank broke
and a dozen residential buildings were half buried.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Renowned illustrator, 14 artists hold joint exhibition</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 8 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A renowned Taiwanese illustrator, who uses the pen-name Jimmy, launched an
exhibition in Taipei Saturday, featuring his latest drawings and the works of 14
artists from home and abroad.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, titled "The Starry Starry Night" is based on Jimmy 's new book
by the same name, according to the organizer Jimmy S.P.A. Co., Ltd.</P>
      <P>The works on display by the other 14 artists were all inspired by the book and
demonstrate the unique talent of each artist while at the same time showing
aspects of their collaboration with each other, the company said.</P>
      <P>"As an artist, I just try to do well what I am best at doing and leave the rest
to the individual experts," Jimmy said at the opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>"That kind of collaboration is the most appealing," he added.</P>
      <P>Speaking of his newest picture book, Jimmy said The Starry Starry Night is a
story about growing-up and it targets teenagers, which is something he has not
done before as he never aims his work at any specific group.</P>
      <P>Lee Yu-shan, general manager of Jimmy S.P.A. Co., Ltd., said that the exhibit
serves as a dialogue between Jimmy and the 14 artists, whose works have been
woven into a beautiful starry night.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, which will run through Sept. 29 at Huashan Creative Park,
presents Jimmy's work from a fresh perspective, using light installations,
sculptures, horticulture, stage design, and music.</P>
      <P>The artists involved in the project include stage and exhibition designer Huang
I-ju, music composer and producer Liu Chi-ling, fashion designer Lai Wei-jion,
puppet designer Yeh Man-ling, horticulturist Tim Chiu, astrophysicist Sun Wei-
hsin, photographer Lin Sheng-fa, wax sculptor Lin Chien-cheng, industrial
designer Yi Wei-shen, lighting designer Wang Tien-hung, and sculptor Zhang Xiao-
ling.</P>
      <P>The exhibition also features works from noted lyrist and writer Lin Xi, and toy
designer Howard Lee, both of whom are from Hong Kong, as well as Japanese
miniaturist Takuji Yamada.</P>
      <P>Born in Taipei in 1958, Jimmy has become a prolific picture book author since
1998 when he released his first two books, Secrets in the Woods and A Fish that
Smiled at Me.</P>
      <P>He has since published 33 books and his work has been translated into nine
languages worldwide. His illustrations have been used in theme music albums,
stage plays and movies, such as The Sound of Colors and Turn Left Turn Right.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Presidential Office supervisor to be disciplined for flouting security</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 8 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office has referred one of its senior staff members to its
performance evaluation committee for disciplinary action after he flouted
security rules, a spokesman said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi made the disclosure in response to
media inquiries on a news report Saturday that a security loophole had opened up
at the Presidential Office because of the arrogance of one of its division
chiefs.</P>
      <P>According to the local newspaper report, Shih Chao-hsien, who serves both as a
Presidential Office consultant and a supervisor of the division in charge of
liaison with the legislature, refused to submit to the military police's safety
check as he drove into the office complex on July 22.</P>
      <P>Shih reportedly drove through the security checkpoint, hitting and injuring a
guard.</P>
      <P>The report stated that Shih sees himself as a senior long-serving official at
the Presidential Office who should have immunity from security checks.</P>
      <P>However,  the day before the incident, Presidential Office Secretary-General
Chan Chun-po instructed that all officials and employees at the office,
excluding the president and vice president, must submit to ID checks in the
interest of security, the report said.</P>
      <P>When Chan gave the order, Shih was at his side, the report claimed.</P>
      <P>The reinforced security measures were reportedly instituted in the wake of a
June 30 incident in which a 52-year-old local woman slipped past security guards
and entered the Presidential Office building. She went to the fifth floor, which
is off-limits to the public, and wandered around there for more than 10 minutes
before the guards spotted her.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, Wang confirmed that Shih had broken the new security rules and that
Chan had decided to relieve Shih of his post at the liaison division.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chan has referred Shih to the Presidential Office performance
evaluation committee for disciplinary action, Wang added.</P>
      <P>Wang said the committee will release its decision on the matter on Aug. 10. He
stressed the office never intended to conceal the incident, as the newspaper
report claimed. An investigation is in progress and the findings will be
released along with the committee's decision, he added.</P>
      <P>Wang also said that a task force, under Chan's supervision, will speed up its
work of reviewing and making recommendations for improved internal management at
the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>At President Ma Ying-jeou's request, the committee's report will be submitted by
Aug. 24, the spokesman said.</P>

      <P>Tropical Storm Morakot's eye moved off Taiwan Saturday afternoon after pounding
the island with strong winds and downpours for two days.</P>
      <P>The storm's eye moved out to sea from the coast of Taoyuan County in northern
Taiwan at 2 p.m., although its outer rim, which extended 250 km outward from the
eye, will covered most parts of the island until Sunday.</P>
      <P>Forecasters warned however that the torrential rain brought by the storm will
continue, especially in the central and southern parts of the island, until Aug.
10.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot made landfall on Taiwan at 11: 50 p.m. Friday, but weakened as
it moved north-northwesterly, and was downgraded to a tropical storm Saturday
noon, according to forecasters.</P>
      <P>Although the eye of the storm moved over northern Taiwan, the capital Taipei was
spared most of its fury, thanks to the fact that the city is located in basin
shielded by mountains on the east, forecasters said.</P>
      <P>The storm brought torrential showers to the island, drenching Pingdong with
1003.5 mm of rainfall, the 7th highest ever recorded in a single day in Taiwan,
according to a weather station in that southern county.</P>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau predicted that Morakot would bring about 2000 mm of
accumulated rainfall to the island.</P>
      <P>The rain was welcomed in some areas, as Taiwan had experienced an unusually dry

      <P>In some parts of Linbian, where the land had subsided because of overdrawing of
underground water, the floodwaters were more than two meters deep and
firefighters had to use inflatable rafts to rescue people.</P>
      <P>Flooding was also reported in Taimali, Taitung County where a river bank broke
and a dozen residential buildings were half submerged.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile in Kaohsiung City, many streets were flooded by knee-deep water as the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu ordered municipal agencies Saturday to deal with
the damage caused by Typhoon Morakot, as many roads in the city have been closed
due to severe flooding.</P>
      <P>Heavy rainfall brought by Morakot, coupled with the monthly rising tide along
the coastlines of southern Taiwan, caused flooding in many districts in the
city, with the areas adjacent to Sizihwan, Love River and Chienchen River
heavily affected. The water level rose knee-high in some streets in the
Chienchen district.</P>
      <P>Chen issued the recovery order at a disaster prevention meeting with city
government officials Saturday morning, saying that although the typhoon caused
only sporadic damage in Kaohsiung, the flooding in low-lying areas was serious
and priority must be given to elderly citizens who live alone.</P>
      <P>Chen particularly instructed the transportation department and public works
bureau to remove fallen trees, signboards and monitor cameras from the roadways
as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>She also urged citizens to store water in case of an interruption of the supply,
as the water collected in the reservoirs has been silted by mudslides.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot, the worst to affect Taiwan this year, began lashing Kaohsiung
Friday evening with gusty winds and heavy rains.</P>
      <P>According to the Central Weather Bureau, as of 11: 00 a.m. Saturday, Kaohsiung
had recorded 342.5 millimeters of rainfall.</P>
      <P>Although the typhoon weakened after it made landfall in Hualien, eastern Taiwan
late Friday, weathermen said strong winds and heavy rains will continue to
affect Kaohsiung City until Saturday evening.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, air, land and sea transportation in the city was seriously disrupted
by the storm.</P>
      <P>Domestic flights to and from Kaohsiung were canceled Friday and Saturday, while
many international flights were canceled or delayed. Two Kaohsiung-bound flights
from Tokyo were forced to land at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport.</P>
      <P>On the roads, the Yenchao township ramp to the No. 10 national freeway was
closed and access to many townships was blocked due to floods or mudslides.</P>
      <P>Segments of the South Link Line railway system and the High Speed Railway System
also remained closed on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Marine transportation was also affected, as the Kaohsiung Port Bureau closed the
port to incoming vessels until the weather improves.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, rivers and streams in the adjoining Kaohsiung County all rose to
alert levels and 21 bridges were closed as a result of rapidly rising water
levels.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture on Saturday issued a red alert for 24
potentially dangerous streams in Kaohsiung County's 13 townships.</P>
      <P>Agricultural damage in the southern Taiwan county has been initially estimated
at NT$73.18 million (US$2.2 million).</P>
      <P>On Saturday, fruit and vegetable supplies at the Fongshan wholesale market
totaled 44.55 metric tons, down from Friday's 57.67 metric tons. Wholesales
prices per kilogram averaged NT$11.43, an increase of NT$1.59 from the previous
day.</P>
      <P>Weathermen warned Saturday that the outer bands of the storm will continue to
drench Taiwan over the next two days, particularly the central and southern
regions.</P>

      <P>The residents of 37 villages in 11 counties across Taiwan were advised Saturday
to evacuate, as those areas were under severe threat from mudflows, according to
the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau under the Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>With Typhoon Morakot bringing torrential rains at a rate of over 500 mm/day to
many mountainous areas around the island, the 37 villages were put on red alert
under a hazard warning system for landslides and debris flows.</P>
      <P>In case of emergency, local governments can enforce village evacuation, the
bureau said.</P>
      <P>Another 32 villages in 12 counties that recorded rainfall close to the dangerous
level of 350 mm/day were put on yellow alert and warned to be aware of and
prepared for possible mudflows, as weathermen have forecast more rain in the
coming days.</P>
      <P>As of noon Saturday, 297 locations in the island's mountainous regions were
threatened by heavy rain-induced mudflows, according to the bureau.</P>
      <P>Reports from Nantou County in central Taiwan indicated that the aboriginal
village of Hsinyi, with accumulated rainfall of 760 mm in some areas, was under
the most serious threat.</P>
      <P>In southern Taiwan, heavy rainfall in excess of 2000 mm over 24 hours in many
locations caused flooding and the overflow of rivers.</P>
      <P>The situation was exacerbated by high waves in Pingtung County, which recorded
more than 1400 mm of rain over the past three days. Five major bridges in the
county have been closed to traffic and roads leading to mountainous regions have
also been closed due to landslides.</P>

      <P>Tax payers can claim deductions for property damaged by Typhoon Morakot, once
they have proper documentation, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Property  owners are eligible to file their tax deduction applications with
local tax offices within 30 days and must attach detailed reports of the damage
and legal verification of ownership, the MOF said.</P>
      <P>Once the applications have been approved by the tax officials, who are required
to conduct on-site inspections, property holders and business owners can list
their damaged commodities or products for tax deductions when they file their
income or business tax returns next year, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>A wide range of personal property such as private cars, scooters, houses and
land, damaged by Morakot Friday and Saturday, are included on the list of tax
deductible items, according to MOF officials. Deduction rates vary in accordance
with the law, the ministry added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Morakot, the strongest typhoon to affect Taiwan this year, has been
moving off the island. The eye of the storm made landfall in Hualien, eastern
Taiwan late Friday.</P>
      <P>The central and southern regions of the country, including Chiayi, Tainan,
Kaohsiung, Pingtung and Taitung, have been inundated by torrential rains brought

      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) called on the United States Sunday to
supply Taiwan with the advanced F-16C/D fighter jets, in the interest of
military equilibrium in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The ministry stated in a press release that with China's military budget showing
double-digit annual growth in recent years, an imbalance of military power is
developing across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Quoting a recent research report by the Washington-based thinktank RAND Corp.,
the ministry said that "China's ability to suppress Taiwan and local U.S. air
bases with ballistic and cruise missiles seriously threatens the defense's
ability to maintain control of the air over the strait."</P>
      <P>The research report released on Aug. 3 suggests that regaining the initiative in
the air may require the U.S. and Taiwan to acquire new strike capabilities.</P>
      <P>The MND maintains that the procurement of F-16C/Ds is vital and urgent to
Taiwan's air defense, the release stated.</P>
      <P>A military delegation from Taiwan visited Washington, D.C. in May to explore the
possibility of procuring 60 F-16C/D fighter planes.</P>

      <P>The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) has broken a crime ring that smuggled
children from China to countries such as the United States, Mexico and France,
according to a statement released by the bureau Saturday.</P>
      <P>Police arrested two top members of the crime ring at the Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport Aug. 6 and seized items in their personal luggage that
included counterfeit passports, lists of names, and fake National Immigration
Agency entry and exit stamps, the CIB said.</P>
      <P>The two men arrested were identified by their surnames Liao and Hsu.</P>
      <P>According to the CIB, the police acted on a tip that Liao and Hsu were smuggling
Chinese children to the U.S. with the use of passports that faked the identity
of indigenous children from remote areas of Hualien County in eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The police said they found that the crime ring had paid the unaware parents of
the indigenous children NT$5,000 to NT$10,000 (US$305) each for the IDs, which
were then used to apply for passports and visas.</P>
      <P>After acquiring Taiwan passports and the relevant travel permits to foreign
countries, Liao and Hsu linked up in Hong Kong with their Chinese accomplices
who had taken children away from homes in China, the police said. The children
were then smuggled into the U.S. and other countries, they added.</P>
      <P>The crime ring was forced to suspend its trafficking to the U.S. after the U.S.
government amended its immigration regulations with effect from July 1 to
require that Taiwanese children under the age of 14 must show up at the
consulate when applying for non-immigrants visa to the U.S., the police said.
However, the ring continued to smuggle children into France, they added.</P>
      <P>According to CIB statistics, more than 45 aboriginal families in Hualien were
found have sold IDs to the crime ring, and over 37 Chinese  children  were
smuggled  into foreign countries.  The traffickers were paid US$70,000 for each
child, the bureau said.</P>

the overflowing Taimali River, but the occupants had all been evacuated, the
Taitung Emergency Management Center reported.</P>
      <P>The disaster was caused by heavy rainfall brought by Typhoon Morakot, which
damaged approximately 700 meters of roadbed and washed away bridges Friday in
Taitung County along a coastal area that had no seawall.</P>
      <P>Dozens of houses were swamped when the Taimali River burst its banks at around 5
p.m. Saturday. By that time the residents had been airlifted out the danger zone
by helicopter.</P>
      <P>However, as of 9: 00 p.m., a police patrol car carrying two officers was

      <P>Colleges experiencing low enrollment rates should  assess  their  future  in
light of their  recruitment difficulties, a Ministry of Education (MOE) official
urged Saturday.</P>
      <P>Ho Cho-fei, director of the MOE's Department of Higher Education, advised such
universities to thoroughly weigh their options and quickly chart a new course
that could include mergers.</P>
      <P>"A good restructuring plan could help these schools to attract more students,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Ho made the comments after the Joint Board of the College Recruitment
Commission  on Friday published  data on freshman recruitment this year by all
four-year universities and colleges in the country, which showed that the number
of admissions and vacant places were both at record highs.</P>
      <P>The data showed that a total of 76,434 students were admitted to Taiwanese
universities this year, but a record high 6,802 vacant places still remained.
The admission rate was a record high of 97.14 percent, according to the
commission.</P>
      <P>Last year, there were 4,788 vacant places and the college admission rate was
97.10 percent, the statistics showed.</P>
      <P>This year, Hsin Kuo University of Management in Tainan City, which had 1,470
places available, admitted only 14 students, while Leader University in the same
city took in 49 new students, although it had 1,299 places available.</P>
      <P>Mingdao University in central Changhua County recruited 330 students in its
effort to fill its 1,148 places in 17 departments.</P>
      <P>Fo Guang University in northern Ilan County, which had 575 vacant places,
admitted 269 students, while NanHua University in southern Chiayi County
attracted 509 students in its bid to fill 1,034 places.</P>
      <P>All the above-mentioned colleges had a vacant place rate of more than 50
percent, with the figure at Leader University and Hsing Kuo University of
Management being more than 95 percent, MOE statistics showed.</P>
      <P>In the last school year, 24 out of the country's 147 colleges and universities
had an enrollment rate of lower than 70 percent.</P>
      <P>The MOE has stipulated that colleges with an enrollment rate of less than 70
percent must reduce their recruitment targets by 10 percent to 30 percent,
starting from next year. The MOE's aim is to spur these schools to step up their
pace of restructuring.</P>

      <P>The eighth cross-Taiwan Strait forum on technology and economy, scheduled to be
held in Kaohsiung, has been postponed to an undetermined date due to Typhoon
Morakot which swept through Taiwan over the weekend.</P>
      <P>The organizers announced the postponement Saturday, saying that many of the
Chinese participants were unable to make their way to Taiwan because of flight
cancellations and delays.</P>
      <P>The event was scheduled to open on Sunday, with 250 Chinese professionals from
industrial, academic, governmental and research circles expected to attend.</P>
      <P>Legislative  Yuan President  Wang Jin-pyng was expected to attend the opening
ceremony of the one-day forum, which was to be held in Kaohsiung for the first
time since it was launched in 2003 with the goal of promoting technology and
economic exchanges between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>It is being viewed as a significant achievement for the southern port city, as
most major cross-strait activities to date have been held in the capital city of
Taipei in the north.</P>
      <P>The Chinese organizers have planned for the delegation from China to stay for
three nights in Kaohsiung, which would allow for a tour of the southern Taiwan
region.</P>
      <P>The Chinese participants and local representatives will be divided into 11
groups that will discuss a range of topics, including cooperation between the
electronic manufacturing sectors on both sides of the strait for mutual benefit

      <P>Agricultural losses caused by Typhoon Morakot were estimated at NT$832 million
(US$25.36 million), with the southern and eastern regions suffering the heaviest
damage, the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) reported Saturday.</P>
      <P>Presiding over a disaster prevention meeting, COA Minister Chen Wu-hsiung
instructed government personnel to begin the recovery work as soon as possible
and he promised to grant subsidies and assistance to affected farmers and
fishermen,  in cooperation with local governments, to help them return to normal

      <P>Banana farms in Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties, on a total 1,612-hectares of
land, suffered the biggest losses in the agricultural sector, according to the
COA.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, losses in the fish farming sector in Pingtung County's Chiatong
township was around NT$61.17 million, it said.</P>
      <P>Chen also asked land and soil conservation authorities to continue monitoring
the weather so as to prevent more damage from mudslides.</P>
      <P>The typhoon brought torrential rains to the entire island, particularly the
southern regions such as Pingtung, which recorded more than 2,000 mm of
precipitation.</P>
      <P>Weathermen have forecast that downpours will continue in central and southern
Taiwan until Monday.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung and Pintung counties in southern Taiwan and Hualien County in the east
were the hardest hit by Morakot, which made landfall in Hualien in late Friday
and moved off Taiwan Saturday afternoon.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's disabled population is increasing steadily, with the number of
physically or mentally challenged women growing faster than the number of males
in this category, the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>The number of people holding MOI-issued disability certificates had reached
1,054,457 as of the end of June this year, the ministry said in a press
statement.</P>
      <P>The figure marked a 2.67 percent year-on-year rise and accounted for 4.57
percent of Taiwan's total population, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Males outnumbered females, 606,458 to 447,999, according to MOI statistics. But
MOI officials said that over the past 12 years, the disabled female population
has been growing faster than its male counterpart.</P>
      <P>"This phenomenon mainly stems from the fact that more women have been falling
victim to dementia or chronic mental disorders, " said an MOI official.</P>
      <P>According to MOI statistics, people with limb deficiencies accounted for the
largest percentage -- 37.6 percent -- of the disabled population, followed by
those with dysfunctional vital organs at 10.8 percent and hearing-impaired
persons at 10.7 percent.</P>
      <P>By age, the mentally challenged formed the bulk of the under-18 disabled
population, accounting for 37 percent of the total. In the over-18 category,
people with limb deficiencies outnumbered those with other disabilities, making
up 39 percent of the total.</P>
      <P>In terms of areas, Taitung County in eastern Taiwan had the highest disabled
population  at 8.9 percent,  followed by the southwestern county of Yulin at 7.9
percent and eastern Taiwan's Hualien County at 7.7 percent.</P>

      <P>The 40th annual  conference  of the Asia-Pacific Parliamentarians' Union (APPU)
will take place in Taipei next week as scheduled, despite the disruptions to
transportation services caused by Typhoon Morakot, organizers said Sunday.</P>
      <P>"The APPU annual conference will open in Taipei Tuesday as scheduled, " said an
official at the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan, which is organizing this
year's APPU meeting.</P>
      <P>It will be the first time that Taiwan's Legislature is sponsoring an APPU annual
conference.</P>
      <P>Although Morakot affected the country's ground, air and maritime transportation
services, many of the foreign parliamentarians invited to the APPU conference
have arrived in Taipei over the past couple of days without any glitches, the
official said.</P>
      <P>APPU, which comprises 21 Asia-Pacific countries, is the only international
parliamentary  organization  in which Taiwan has membership.</P>
      <P>Other members of the organization include Japan, South Korea, Thailand,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Mongolia, Laos and the Solomon Islands.</P>
      <P>About 100 lawmakers from 14 member countries are expected to take part in this
year's APPU conference, the official said, adding that the meeting will focus on
the theme of protection of human safety.</P>
      <P>According to the work schedule, a welcome party will be held Monday evening
ahead of the grand opening set for Tuesday morning. The curtain will come down
on the event at noon Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Japan-based APPU grew out of the Asia Parliamentarians' Union which was
created during the Cold War era with the aim of maintaining regional peace and
stability.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said recently that the opportunity to
host the APPU annual conference will allow Taiwan's legislators to strengthen
their friendship and exchanges with their foreign counterparts.</P>
      <P>In addition,  the participation of Taiwan's legislators in international events
will help to expand Taiwan's presence in the international arena, giving the
country an opening to free itself from the diplomatic isolation imposed by
China, Wang said.</P>
      <P>"Parliamentary diplomacy is a path that can lead Taiwan back to the
international community," Wang said.</P>
      <P>At present, more than 50 countries and regions have set up Taiwan friendship
groups within their parliaments, while there are 34 inter-parliamentary  groups
in the Legislative Yuan to promote friendship with their foreign counterparts,
he noted.</P>

      <P>Torrential downpours brought by Typhoon Morakot in the past couple of days have
smashed one-day precipitation records in many parts of Taiwan, Central Weather
Bureau (CWB) officials said Sunday.</P>
      <P>"Morakot has brought amazing record-setting volumes of rainfall to Taiwan, "
said Chen Yi-liang, a CWB section chief in charge of weather forecast.</P>
      <P>Several southern Taiwan counties recorded accumulated rainfall of more than 2000
mm Friday and Saturday, which caused the worst flooding in those areas in half a
century, the official said.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, the bureau's Weiliaoshan water station in the Sandimen  mountains
of Pingtung  County recorded  1403 mm of precipitation, a new high for a single
day of rainfall in Taiwan, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The volume broke the previous record set in 1997 when Typhoon Amber hit eastern
Taiwan's Hualien County, bringing 1222.5 mm of rain to the region in a single
day, according to CWB tallies.</P>
      <P>Moreover, 13 other CWB water stations also recorded more than 1000 mm of
rainfall Saturday, which was a record in itself for the number of areas
receiving such huge volumes of precipitation in a single day.</P>
      <P>"So far, nine out of the 10 highest single-day precipitation records at various
CWB stations around Taiwan were from Typhoon Morakot," Chen said.</P>
      <P>As of 11: 40 p.m. Saturday, Hsinan water station in Kaohsiung County had
recorded 1287 mm of rainfall, which was the second highest level ever recorded,
followed by Yuyoushan station in Kaohsiung County with 1267 mm.</P>
      <P>The 1222.5 mm of rainfall recorded at Bulouwan station in Hualien County during
Typhoon Amber in 1997 was pushed down to fourth place.</P>
      <P>The fifth through 10th highest levels of precipitation ever recorded in Taiwan
were 1181 mm at Hsinfa station in Kaohsiung County, 1174 mm at Matouhan station
in Chiayi County, 1163 mm at Majia station in Pingtung County, 1153.5 mm at
Fenchihu in Chiayi County, 1151.5 mm at Hsiakuanshan in Kaohsiung County, and
1147 mm at Shihpanlung in Chiayi County.</P>
      <P>Morakot hit the coastline of eastern Taiwan late Friday and traversed the island
Saturday before weakening into a tropical storm in the Taiwan Strait the
previous afternoon.</P>
      <P>The storm had left three persons dead, 19 injured and 31 unaccounted for as of 1

    <HEADLINE>Father and daughter reunited thanks to persistence of volunteers</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An elderly father in Taichung, who gave up his infant daughter for adoption some
30 years ago because of poverty, was reunited with her recently, thanks to
coincidence and the persistence of volunteers at a charity home.</P>
      <P>The two had been trying to find each other in recent years, and were finally
able to scientifically confirm, largely through the efforts of the volunteers at
the charity home where the child was placed, that they are father and daughter.</P>
      <P>Several months after he had given up the baby, the man began to have regrets and
he tried to get her back from the Daniel A. Poling Memorial Babies' Home in
Taichung City where he had taken her.</P>
      <P>However, he was told that his daughter had been adopted by an American couple
who had already returned to the United States.</P>
      <P>Five years ago, his wife, who was on her deathbed, implored him to find their
lost daughter at all costs.</P>
      <P>After his wife's death, he returned to the Daniel A. Poling Babies Home, which
was co-founded in 1953 by American Christian missionary Daniel Poling and
Taichung businessman and philanthropist Kuo Ting-shun.</P>
      <P>The man handed a slip of paper with his daughter's name on it to the volunteers
at the home, saying that he wanted to find her.</P>
      <P>However, the slip of paper did not help much because all the babies at the home
are usually given new names immediately upon admission.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, the volunteers kept the man's name and telephone number on file.</P>
      <P>About two years ago, a Taiwan-born U.S. citizen around the age of 30 visited the
home, saying that she wanted to know more about her biological roots.</P>
      <P>The woman, identified as Grace, knew very little about her origins. All she knew
was what her adoptive parents had told her -- that she was born in Taichung and
was adopted from the Daniel A. Poling Babies Home and taken to the U.S. as an
infant.</P>
      <P>Grace left her name, address and telephone number with the volunteers.</P>
      <P>Some time later, one of the volunteers had a brainwave. She had a faint
impression that Grace and the elderly man who had approached the home several
years back to find his daughter looked somewhat alike. The volunteer took a wild
guess that maybe they were related.</P>
      <P>"Nobody would lose anything if we try to connect the two," the volunteer
recalled thinking at the time.</P>
      <P>The home contacted the elderly man and asked him to send samples of his hair and
nail clippings to them for an investigation.</P>
      <P>The home mailed the samples to Grace in the United States so she could have DNA
tests done.</P>
      <P>Grace later responded that the DNA tests showed she was not related to the owner
of the samples.</P>
      <P>"Perhaps Grace did not take the exercise seriously and therefore had the DNA
tests done at a low cost facility," the volunteers speculated.</P>
      <P>The volunteers again contacted the man and this time asked him to send them
saliva swabs. The home then mailed the swabs to Grace. Several weeks later, the
volunteers received the news that the DNA tests showed a 99.9 probability that
the man was Grace's father.</P>
      <P>The father and daughter contacted each other by telephone about a year ago.
Grace flew to Taiwan at the end of last September, and the father and daughter
were reunited after more than 30 years of separation.</P>
      <P>The father told her tearfully that he had no alternative but to give her up
because "we were as poor as church mice." He said that he soon regretted the
decision but that it was too late to get her back.</P>
      <P>For her part, Grace, who is a well educated and highly-paid career woman, told
him via an interpreter that she does not blame him and harbors no resentment
against him.</P>

in central and southern Taiwan for another two days.</P>
      <P>CWB meteorologists said that although Typhoon Morakot is expected to move away
Sunday evening after wreaking havoc on Taiwan, its solid and vast skirt will
still bring heavy rainfall.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Water Resources Agency (WRA) said that severe flooding in
southern Taiwan had disrupted running water supply systems, leaving tens of
thousands of households without potable water.</P>
      <P>The agency is making every effort to the improve the water problem, WRA Deputy-
Director Wu Yue-hsi said, adding that the supply of clean running water will
resume gradually over the next seven days.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said, the agency is using some 346 pumping units to help pump

      <P>Despite the transportation disruptions caused by Typhoon Morakot, an abused dog
was put aboard a U.S.-bound flight at the last minute to receive psychotherapy

      <P>"Mico is scheduled to arrive in San Francisco this evening," said Chang Ya-hui,
a volunteer with the Animal Rescue Team Taiwan, a Kaohsiung-based animal
protection group.</P>
      <P>When he was spotted near an industrial park in Kangshan township in southern
Taiwan's Kaohsiung County in April, Mico had a rubber cord around his neck that
was strangling him, Chang said.</P>
      <P>His trachea was broken, his neck was as thin as a chicken's and his head was
swollen like a pig's, according to Chang.</P>
      <P>Although his life was saved by emergency surgery after the cord was removed, he
is still psychologically scarred, Chang said.</P>
      <P>"It seemed that he could not overcome the mental trauma. Whether he was in the
animal hospital or being taken by our volunteers from the shelter for a walk
outdoors, all he would do is curl up in a corner and tremble incessantly," Chang
recalled.</P>
      <P>Although Mico's eyes were full of terror, he was not aggressive, Chang said,
adding that after months of attentive care by the rescue team, it seemed that
Mico has regained some trust in humans.</P>
      <P>The Animal Rescue Team sought the help of an animal protection group in San

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) organized two emergency teams
Sunday to help with disinfection and epidemic prevention in flood-stricken
areas.</P>
      <P>Several central and southern counties have been deluged by record rainfall from
Typhoon Morakot in the past couple of days.</P>
      <P>Fearing epidemic outbreaks in the flood disaster zones, the DOH directed two of
its agencies -- the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) and the Centers
for Disease Control (CDC) -- to assign teams to assist with the work of
disinfection and epidemic prevention.</P>
      <P>"BNHI and CDC staff members will first collaborate with health officials from
Pingtung County, the hardest-hit region, to educate flood victims on the
importance of maintaining proper personal hygiene and disinfecting their living
environment, as part of the post-disaster work," said a DOH official.</P>
      <P>As part of its emergency operations, the official said, the CDC has urgently
allocated 20,000 cans of disinfectant for distribution in the county's most
seriously battered townships.</P>
      <P>Health officials will step up publicity campaigns to remind residents in flooded
regions to clear standing water in order to prevent outbreaks of mosquito-borne
diseases, such as dengue fever, the official added.</P>
      <P>Local residents are also welcome to report to the CDC any cases of infectious
diseases or problems with epidemic prevention, the official said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) launched a
fund-raising campaign Sunday to help finance post-disaster relief projects in
the flood-stricken regions.</P>
      <P>Describing the Aug.8 flooding as the most devastating natural disaster to hit
the southernmost county of Pingtung in 50 years, DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang
urged the central government to follow the precedent set in the post-Sept.21,
1999 earthquake relief operations, to help the victims of the latest flooding.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the counties of Pingtung, Kaohsiung, Tainan, Chiayi and
Taitung be listed as disaster-affected regions that would be entitled to special
central government aid for rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>Southern Taiwan has long been a DPP stronghold. Cheng said DPP Chairwoman Tsai
Ing-wen, a Pingtung native, has donated NT$1 million to help with the relief
work.</P>
      <P>In addition to cash, various relief goods, such as mineral water,
pharmaceuticals and lighting equipment, are also welcome, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Relief goods can either be sent to the auditorium of the Kaohsiung  City
Government  for distribution  or directly  to flood-stricken counties, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ruling Kuomintang (KMT) officials also took lead in making donations
to help with post-disaster relief projects.</P>
      <P>The KMT also demanded its members intending to run for seats on the party's
Central Committee suspend camapign activities and instead give priority to
helping with post-flooding relief work.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot lashed Taiwan with powerful winds and torrential downpours over
the weekend. It dumped a record 2500 mm or rain in the southernmost county of
Pingtung alone by early Sunday, flooding at least three coastal townships.</P>
      <P>As of 7 p.m. Sunday, the typhoon-induced flooding had left seven persons dead,
32 injured and 46 unaccounted for.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou and Premier Liu Chao-shiuan on Sunday pledged full scale
rescue and relief efforts, as they inspected areas in southern Taiwan that were
devastated by floods during Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>President Ma said in Chiayi County that the phenomenal rainfall from Typhoon
Morakot far exceeded the original forecasts, wreaking havoc in Kaohsiung,
Pingtung, Chiayi and Tainan.</P>
      <P>He said that he had a telephone discussion with Premier Liu Chao-shiuan on
setting up a southern Taiwan command post that will be headed by a ministerial-
level official in the morning.</P>
      <P>The government will also mobilize all available equipment for the rescue
efforts, the president said, adding that he has requested the use of Taipei
City's rubber boats for the rescue work in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He noted that the rainfall broke 50-year records in southern Taiwan, causing
widespread flooding.</P>
      <P>"Rescue and relief efforts will be our top priority," Ma said.</P>
      <P>The accumulated rainfall in the mountainous region of Fengchihu in Chiayi County
had reached 2587 mm as of Sunday noon, causing the overflow of two rivers
downstream -- the Pachang Creek and Niuchou Creek.</P>
      <P>Ma originally wanted to visit Taitung in eastern Taiwan, but canceled the trip
because the Taitung Airport was closed due to the effects of the typhoon. He
also canceled two scheduled activities in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Ma will visit Taimali and Jhihben in Taitung County Monday to inspect the damage
there, according to the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>A six-story hotel in Jhihben township in Taitung County tumbled into a river
around noon Sunday after it tilted on its foundations at an angle of 20 degrees
Sunday morning. The building was destabilized by a landslide and floods that
washed away a nearby 200-meter area.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Liu said on a tour of Pingtung County in southern Taiwan
Sunday that a disaster prevention center headed by Interior Minister Liao Liou-
yi would be set up.</P>
      <P>Liu also said that he would stay in southern Taiwan overnight before returning
to Taipei Monday.</P>
      <P>The premier said that in addition to the efforts of the Eighth Army Corps
stationed in southern Taiwan, other military units, including engineering and
chemical experts, would also pitch in.</P>
      <P>As of 8 p.m. Sunday, the Ministry of National Defense (MND) said it had deployed
2,877 military servicemen and 85 armored and other vehicles to assist in the
rescue and relief work. A total of 1,236 residents had been evacuated by the
military, the MND added.</P>
      <P>Liu went to the Pingtung County Reserve Command in the morning for a briefing on
the damage in the county and to mobilize the military to assist with the relief
work. He then visited Pingtung County's disaster emergency center for an update
on what kind of support was needed.</P>
      <P>In the afternoon, Liu rode on a rubber raft to Linbian township, which is
submerged in flood waters half-a-story high.</P>
      <P>Linbian has become a "water world," with rubber boats shuttling around, rescuing
stranded residents and delivering food and other necessities.</P>
      <P>Some of the township residents who have been unwilling to leave their homes
waved to the premier from the second floors, and Liu waved back.</P>
      <P>The raft that Liu was traveling on was towing a rubber boat filled with food and
other necessities, and some residents lowered baskets or waded through the
floodwaters to collect the supplies.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and Minister of Transportation and
Communications Mao Chi-kuo went to Kaohsiung to inspect the collapsed Shuangyuan
Bridge that connected Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties.</P>
      <P>Initial estimates put the number of collapsed bridges at around 20, the worst
infrastructure damage in a decade, National Central University said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The university's Center for Bridge Engineering Research said that the damage to
bridges was even worse than in September 1999 when Taiwan was struck by a
magnitude-7.3 earthquake.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the first group of rescue workers from Taipei City arrived in
Pingtung County at 6 a.m Sunday, and went immediately to Linbian.</P>
      <P>Taipei City has deployed 130 rescue workers and 38 motor boats and rubber
dinghies to southern Taiwan, while Taipei County has sent more than 100 rescue
personnel and large water pumps.</P>
      <P>The weather bureau forecast that rainfall from Typhoon Morakot will reach 2900
mm in Chiayi County and 2700 mm in Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties, all record
volumes in recorded history.</P>
      <P>Central Weather Bureau meteorologists have predicted more rain for the next two
days.</P>
      <P>Agricultural losses had topped NT$2.1 billion as of 2 p.m. Sunday, the Council
of Agriculture said.</P>
      <P>The storm, which swept through Taiwan Friday night, has left seven persons dead,
32 injured and 46 unaccounted for as of 7 p.m.</P>

million) as of Sunday morning, according to statistics released by the Cabinet-
level Council of Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>The COA said that Morakot, which pummeled Taiwan over the weekend, caused
serious damage to the agricultural sector in 11 counties, with Kaohsiung and
Pingtung counties in southern Taiwan and Hualien County in the east being the
hardest hit.</P>
      <P>The statistics show that damage to agricultural crops amounted to NT$894
million, as 23 percent of the crops on 14, 879 hectares of farmland were lost.</P>
      <P>Banana crops suffered the heaviest damage, with 2,172 hectares ravaged by strong
winds and flooding.</P>
      <P>Some NT$44.29 million worth of poultry perished in floods caused by the storm,
while losses in the aquaculture sector totaled NT$63.19 million, with 107
hectares of fish farms in Pingtung County's Jiadong and Gaoshu townships
damaged.</P>
      <P>Damage to agricultural facilities amounted to NT$85.53 million, and damage to
forestry was estimated at NT$8.58 million.</P>
      <P>Farmers in Kaohsiung, Pingtung and Hualien who suffered heavy losses can apply

      <P>Taiwan's disabled population is increasing steadily, with the number of
physically or mentally challenged women growing faster than the number of males
in this category, the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>The number of people holding MOI-issued disability certificates had reached
1,054,457 as of the end of June this year, the ministry said in a press
statement.</P>
      <P>The figure marked a 2.67 percent year-on-year rise and accounted for 4.57
percent of Taiwan's total population, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Males outnumbered females, 606,458 to 447,999, according to MOI statistics. But
MOI officials said that over the past 12 years, the disabled female population
has been growing faster than its male counterpart.</P>
      <P>"This phenomenon mainly stems from the fact that more women have been falling
victim to dementia or chronic mental disorders, " said an MOI official.</P>
      <P>According to MOI statistics, people with limb deficiencies accounted for the
largest percentage -- 37.6 percent -- of the disabled population, followed by
those with dysfunctional vital organs at 10.8 percent and hearing-impaired
persons at 10.7 percent.</P>
      <P>By age, the mentally challenged formed the bulk of the under-18 disabled
population, accounting for 37 percent of the total. In the over-18 category,
people with limb deficiencies outnumbered those with other disabilities, making
up 39 percent of the total.</P>
      <P>In terms of areas, Taitung County in eastern Taiwan had the highest disabled
population  at 8.9 percent,  followed by the southwestern county of Yulin at 7.9
percent and eastern Taiwan's Hualien County at 7.7 percent.</P>

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) issued "red alerts" Sunday for 452 locations in
11 counties around the country that are at high risk from rockslides or
mudslides as a result of Typhoon Morakot's heavy rains.</P>
      <P>A total of 452 riverside areas in 206 villages in the southern counties of
Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung and Pingtung, the eastern county of Taitung, the
central counties of Taichung, Nantou and Yunlin, the northern counties of
Taoyuan, Hsinchu and Miaoli were put on "red alert" because of their
vulnerability to soil saturation and landslides.</P>
      <P>The council said that after a "red alert" is issued, the local government  is
responsible  for warning  local  residents  and implementing evacuation
procedures if necessary.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the council also issued "yellow alerts" for 328 areas in 129 villages

    <HEADLINE>Asia-Pacific parliamentarians to meet in Taipei as scheduled</HEADLINE>

      <P>The 40th annual  conference  of the Asia-Pacific Parliamentarians' Union (APPU)
will take place in Taipei next week as scheduled, despite the disruptions to
transportation services caused by Typhoon Morakot, organizers said Sunday.</P>
      <P>"The APPU annual conference will open in Taipei Tuesday as scheduled, " said an
official at the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan, which is organizing this
year's APPU meeting.</P>
      <P>It will be the first time that Taiwan's Legislature is sponsoring an APPU annual
conference.</P>
      <P>Although Morakot affected the country's ground, air and maritime transportation
services, many of the foreign parliamentarians invited to the APPU conference
have arrived in Taipei over the past couple of days without any glitches, the
official said.</P>
      <P>APPU, which comprises 21 Asia-Pacific countries, is the only international
parliamentary  organization  in which Taiwan has membership.</P>
      <P>Other members of the organization include Japan, South Korea, Thailand,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Mongolia, Laos and the Solomon Islands.</P>
      <P>About 100 lawmakers from 14 member countries are expected to take part in this
year's APPU conference, the official said, adding that the meeting will focus on
the theme of protection of human safety.</P>
      <P>According to the work schedule, a welcome party will be held Monday evening
ahead of the grand opening set for Tuesday morning. The curtain will come down
on the event at noon Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Japan-based APPU grew out of the Asia Parliamentarians' Union which was
created during the Cold War era with the aim of maintaining regional peace and
stability.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said recently that the opportunity to
host the APPU annual conference will allow Taiwan's legislators to strengthen
their friendship and exchanges with their foreign counterparts.</P>
      <P>In addition,  the participation of Taiwan's legislators in international events
will help to expand Taiwan's presence in the international arena, giving the
country an opening to free itself from the diplomatic isolation imposed by
China, Wang said.</P>
      <P>"Parliamentary diplomacy is a path that can lead Taiwan back to the
international community," Wang said.</P>
      <P>At present, more than 50 countries and regions have set up Taiwan friendship
groups within their parliaments, while there are 34 inter-parliamentary  groups
in the Legislative Yuan to promote friendship with their foreign counterparts,
he noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Torrential downpours brought by Typhoon Morakot in the past couple of days have
smashed one-day precipitation records in many parts of Taiwan, Central Weather
Bureau (CWB) officials said Sunday.</P>
      <P>"Morakot has brought amazing record-setting volumes of rainfall to Taiwan, "
said Chen Yi-liang, a CWB section chief in charge of weather forecast.</P>
      <P>Several southern Taiwan counties recorded accumulated rainfall of more than 2000
mm Friday and Saturday, which caused the worst flooding in those areas in half a
century, the official said.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, the bureau's Weiliaoshan water station in the Sandimen  mountains
of Pingtung  County recorded  1403 mm of precipitation, a new high for a single
day of rainfall in Taiwan, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The volume broke the previous record set in 1997 when Typhoon Amber hit eastern
Taiwan's Hualien County, bringing 1222.5 mm of rain to the region in a single
day, according to CWB tallies.</P>
      <P>Moreover, 13 other CWB water stations also recorded more than 1000 mm of
rainfall Saturday, which was a record in itself for the number of areas
receiving such huge volumes of precipitation in a single day.</P>
      <P>"So far, nine out of the 10 highest single-day precipitation records at various
CWB stations around Taiwan were from Typhoon Morakot," Chen said.</P>
      <P>As of 11: 40 p.m. Saturday, Hsinan water station in Kaohsiung County had
recorded 1287 mm of rainfall, which was the second highest level ever recorded,
followed by Yuyoushan station in Kaohsiung County with 1267 mm.</P>
      <P>The 1222.5 mm of rainfall recorded at Bulouwan station in Hualien County during
Typhoon Amber in 1997 was pushed down to fourth place.</P>
      <P>The fifth through 10th highest levels of precipitation ever recorded in Taiwan
were 1181 mm at Hsinfa station in Kaohsiung County, 1174 mm at Matouhan station
in Chiayi County, 1163 mm at Majia station in Pingtung County, 1153.5 mm at
Fenchihu in Chiayi County, 1151.5 mm at Hsiakuanshan in Kaohsiung County, and
1147 mm at Shihpanlung in Chiayi County.</P>
      <P>Morakot hit the coastline of eastern Taiwan late Friday and traversed the island
Saturday before weakening into a tropical storm in the Taiwan Strait the
previous afternoon.</P>
      <P>The storm had left three persons dead, 19 injured and 31 unaccounted for as of 1
p.m. Sunday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Father and daughter reunited thanks to persistence of volunteers</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An elderly father in Taichung, who gave up his infant daughter for adoption some
30 years ago because of poverty, was reunited with her recently, thanks to
coincidence and the persistence of volunteers at a charity home.</P>
      <P>The two had been trying to find each other in recent years, and were finally
able to scientifically confirm, largely through the efforts of the volunteers at
the charity home where the child was placed, that they are father and daughter.</P>
      <P>Several months after he had given up the baby, the man began to have regrets and
he tried to get her back from the Daniel A. Poling Memorial Babies' Home in
Taichung City where he had taken her.</P>
      <P>However, he was told that his daughter had been adopted by an American couple
who had already returned to the United States.</P>
      <P>Five years ago, his wife, who was on her deathbed, implored him to find their
lost daughter at all costs.</P>
      <P>After his wife's death, he returned to the Daniel A. Poling Babies Home, which
was co-founded in 1953 by American Christian missionary Daniel Poling and
Taichung businessman and philanthropist Kuo Ting-shun.</P>
      <P>The man handed a slip of paper with his daughter's name on it to the volunteers
at the home, saying that he wanted to find her.</P>
      <P>However, the slip of paper did not help much because all the babies at the home
are usually given new names immediately upon admission.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, the volunteers kept the man's name and telephone number on file.</P>
      <P>About two years ago, a Taiwan-born U.S. citizen around the age of 30 visited the
home, saying that she wanted to know more about her biological roots.</P>
      <P>The woman, identified as Grace, knew very little about her origins. All she knew
was what her adoptive parents had told her -- that she was born in Taichung and
was adopted from the Daniel A. Poling Babies Home and taken to the U.S. as an
infant.</P>
      <P>Grace left her name, address and telephone number with the volunteers.</P>
      <P>Some time later, one of the volunteers had a brainwave. She had a faint
impression that Grace and the elderly man who had approached the home several
years back to find his daughter looked somewhat alike. The volunteer took a wild
guess that maybe they were related.</P>
      <P>"Nobody would lose anything if we try to connect the two," the volunteer
recalled thinking at the time.</P>
      <P>The home contacted the elderly man and asked him to send samples of his hair and
nail clippings to them for an investigation.</P>
      <P>The home mailed the samples to Grace in the United States so she could have DNA
tests done.</P>
      <P>Grace later responded that the DNA tests showed she was not related to the owner
of the samples.</P>
      <P>"Perhaps Grace did not take the exercise seriously and therefore had the DNA
tests done at a low cost facility," the volunteers speculated.</P>
      <P>The volunteers again contacted the man and this time asked him to send them
saliva swabs. The home then mailed the swabs to Grace. Several weeks later, the
volunteers received the news that the DNA tests showed a 99.9 probability that
the man was Grace's father.</P>
      <P>The father and daughter contacted each other by telephone about a year ago.
Grace flew to Taiwan at the end of last September, and the father and daughter
were reunited after more than 30 years of separation.</P>
      <P>The father told her tearfully that he had no alternative but to give her up
because "we were as poor as church mice." He said that he soon regretted the
decision but that it was too late to get her back.</P>
      <P>For her part, Grace, who is a well educated and highly-paid career woman, told
him via an interpreter that she does not blame him and harbors no resentment
against him.</P>

      <P>The Central Weather Bureau forecast Sunday that torrential rains will continue
in central and southern Taiwan for another two days.</P>
      <P>CWB meteorologists said that although Typhoon Morakot is expected to move away
Sunday evening after wreaking havoc on Taiwan, its solid and vast skirt will
still bring heavy rainfall.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Water Resources Agency (WRA) said that severe flooding in
southern Taiwan had disrupted running water supply systems, leaving tens of
thousands of households without potable water.</P>
      <P>The agency is making every effort to the improve the water problem, WRA Deputy-
Director Wu Yue-hsi said, adding that the supply of clean running water will
resume gradually over the next seven days.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said, the agency is using some 346 pumping units to help pump
flood waters out of low-lying areas in the southern counties of Chiayi, Tainan,

      <P>Despite the transportation disruptions caused by Typhoon Morakot, an abused dog
was put aboard a U.S.-bound flight at the last minute to receive psychotherapy
and find a new home there, animal rescue volunteers said Sunday.</P>
      <P>"Mico is scheduled to arrive in San Francisco this evening," said Chang Ya-hui,
a volunteer with the Animal Rescue Team Taiwan, a Kaohsiung-based animal
protection group.</P>
      <P>When he was spotted near an industrial park in Kangshan township in southern
Taiwan's Kaohsiung County in April, Mico had a rubber cord around his neck that
was strangling him, Chang said.</P>
      <P>His trachea was broken, his neck was as thin as a chicken's and his head was
swollen like a pig's, according to Chang.</P>
      <P>Although his life was saved by emergency surgery after the cord was removed, he
is still psychologically scarred, Chang said.</P>
      <P>"It seemed that he could not overcome the mental trauma. Whether he was in the
animal hospital or being taken by our volunteers from the shelter for a walk
outdoors, all he would do is curl up in a corner and tremble incessantly," Chang
recalled.</P>
      <P>Although Mico's eyes were full of terror, he was not aggressive, Chang said,
adding that after months of attentive care by the rescue team, it seemed that
Mico has regained some trust in humans.</P>
      <P>The Animal Rescue Team sought the help of an animal protection group in San
Francisco to arrange for Mico to receive professional psychotherapy.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) organized two emergency teams
Sunday to help with disinfection and epidemic prevention in flood-stricken
areas.</P>
      <P>Several central and southern counties have been deluged by record rainfall from
Typhoon Morakot in the past couple of days.</P>
      <P>Fearing epidemic outbreaks in the flood disaster zones, the DOH directed two of
its agencies -- the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) and the Centers

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou and Premier Liu Chao-shiuan on Sunday pledged full scale
rescue and relief efforts, as they inspected areas in southern Taiwan that were
devastated by floods during Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>President Ma said in Chiayi County that the phenomenal rainfall from Typhoon
Morakot far exceeded the original forecasts, wreaking havoc in Kaohsiung,
Pingtung, Chiayi and Tainan.</P>
      <P>He said that he had a telephone discussion with Premier Liu Chao-shiuan on
setting up a southern Taiwan command post that will be headed by a ministerial-
level official in the morning.</P>
      <P>The government will also mobilize all available equipment for the rescue
efforts, the president said, adding that he has requested the use of Taipei
City's rubber boats for the rescue work in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He noted that the rainfall broke 50-year records in southern Taiwan, causing
widespread flooding.</P>
      <P>"Rescue and relief efforts will be our top priority," Ma said.</P>
      <P>The accumulated rainfall in the mountainous region of Fengchihu in Chiayi County
had reached 2587 mm as of Sunday noon, causing the overflow of two rivers
downstream -- the Pachang Creek and Niuchou Creek.</P>
      <P>Ma originally wanted to visit Taitung in eastern Taiwan, but canceled the trip
because the Taitung Airport was closed due to the effects of the typhoon. He
also canceled two scheduled activities in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Ma will visit Taimali and Jhihben in Taitung County Monday to inspect the damage
there, according to the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>A six-story hotel in Jhihben township in Taitung County tumbled into a river
around noon Sunday after it tilted on its foundations at an angle of 20 degrees
Sunday morning. The building was destabilized by a landslide and floods that
washed away a nearby 200-meter area.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Liu said on a tour of Pingtung County in southern Taiwan
Sunday that a disaster prevention center headed by Interior Minister Liao Liou-
yi would be set up.</P>
      <P>Liu also said that he would stay in southern Taiwan overnight before returning
to Taipei Monday.</P>
      <P>The premier said that in addition to the efforts of the Eighth Army Corps
stationed in southern Taiwan, other military units, including engineering and
chemical experts, would also pitch in.</P>
      <P>As of 8 p.m. Sunday, the Ministry of National Defense (MND) said it had deployed
2,877 military servicemen and 85 armored and other vehicles to assist in the
rescue and relief work. A total of 1,236 residents had been evacuated by the
military, the MND added.</P>
      <P>Liu went to the Pingtung County Reserve Command in the morning for a briefing on
the damage in the county and to mobilize the military to assist with the relief
work. He then visited Pingtung County's disaster emergency center for an update
on what kind of support was needed.</P>
      <P>In the afternoon, Liu rode on a rubber raft to Linbian township, which is
submerged in flood waters half-a-story high.</P>
      <P>Linbian has become a "water world," with rubber boats shuttling around, rescuing
stranded residents and delivering food and other necessities.</P>
      <P>Some of the township residents who have been unwilling to leave their homes
waved to the premier from the second floors, and Liu waved back.</P>
      <P>The raft that Liu was traveling on was towing a rubber boat filled with food and
other necessities, and some residents lowered baskets or waded through the
floodwaters to collect the supplies.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and Minister of Transportation and
Communications Mao Chi-kuo went to Kaohsiung to inspect the collapsed Shuangyuan
Bridge that connected Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties.</P>
      <P>Initial estimates put the number of collapsed bridges at around 20, the worst
infrastructure damage in a decade, National Central University said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The university's Center for Bridge Engineering Research said that the damage to
bridges was even worse than in September 1999 when Taiwan was struck by a
magnitude-7.3 earthquake.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the first group of rescue workers from Taipei City arrived in
Pingtung County at 6 a.m Sunday, and went immediately to Linbian.</P>
      <P>Taipei City has deployed 130 rescue workers and 38 motor boats and rubber
dinghies to southern Taiwan, while Taipei County has sent more than 100 rescue
personnel and large water pumps.</P>
      <P>The weather bureau forecast that rainfall from Typhoon Morakot will reach 2900
mm in Chiayi County and 2700 mm in Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties, all record
volumes in recorded history.</P>
      <P>Central Weather Bureau meteorologists have predicted more rain for the next two
days.</P>
      <P>Agricultural losses had topped NT$2.1 billion as of 2 p.m. Sunday, the Council
of Agriculture said.</P>
      <P>The storm, which swept through Taiwan Friday night, has left seven persons dead,
32 injured and 46 unaccounted for as of 7 p.m.</P>

Sunday to help with disinfection and epidemic prevention in flood-stricken

      <P>The National Science Council's (NSC's) astronomy exhibition provides a good
opportunity for people to better understand the universe, Deputy Minister of
Education Lin Tsong-ming, said Monday.</P>
      <P>"The universe is so immense that human beings only know about a tiny part of it.
Therefore, I encourage students to leave the classroom, explore the sky and
treat nature as our best teacher," Lin said at the opening ceremony of the "400
Years of Heaven Gazing" exhibit.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, which is the major activity in the NSC's 10th scientific season,
is being held to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Galileo's first observation
of space and International Year of Astronomy 2009.</P>
      <P>Chen Tai-jen, vice president of National Taiwan University, said at the opening
ceremony that astronomy is both an ancient and a modern science that is closely
linked to literature, history and culture.</P>
      <P>"This exhibition, which utilizes Taiwan's advanced projection technology,  will
educate the public by presenting  scientific information in a form that is
easily understandable," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The exhibition has been organized by the NSC, Ministry of Education,
Astronomical Society of the Republic of China, Taipei City Government,  and
National  Taiwan  University's  Institute  of Astrophysics.</P>
      <P>The presentation is theatrical, featuring 3D projections, digital audio and
video displays and multi-touch interaction installations to showcase scientific
knowledge, according to the NSC.</P>
      <P>It is composed of 10 theme areas, such as the "Starlight Gallery, " "Solar
System Gallery, " "Conversations through Time and Space, " "Romantic Starlight,
" "The Leaning Tower of Pisa, " "Giant Eyes of the Astronomers, " "The Heavenly
Sound of Nature" and "Hands-On Activities -- Discovering the Universe, " the
council said.</P>
      <P>Seminars given by noted scientists from abroad will also provide a lively
experience for visitors, it added.</P>
      <P>The exhibition is scheduled to run though Sept. 13 at the Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall's Second and Third Display Rooms and Art Gallery. Admission to the
exhibit is free and more information is available at

    <HEADLINE>Water Resources Agency chief to assume responsibility for flooding</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Water  Resources  Agency  (WRA) Director-General Chen Shen-hsien pledged Monday
to assume political responsibility for the severe flooding caused by Typhoon
Morakot in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I'm always prepared. When the rescue work is finished, I'll assume
responsibility (for the disaster), " Chen told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks one day after President Ma Ying-jeou demanded that the WRA
critically examine whether the extensive flooding was the result of a natural
catastrophe or ineffective flood prevention efforts.</P>
      <P>Ma said the WRA should determine if the funds allocated for flood prevention
projects had been used properly, and the agency should not pass the buck.</P>
      <P>Chen promised that the WRA will definitely review the matter.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, while the eight-year, NT$80 billion flood prevention project
launched in 2006 targeted rivers within the jurisdiction of local governments,
the heavy rainfall triggered by Typhoon Morakot caused the rapid overflow of
larger rivers in areas that are under the central government.</P>
      <P>Every flood prevention project has its limits, he said.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, the flood prevention facilities built along rivers in
local government areas were designed to withstand 50-year floods, and those
constructed along rivers within central government areas were designed to
withstand 100-year events.</P>
      <P>"However, the rainfall brought by Typhoon Morakot exceeded the peak volume
expected for a 200-year flood," he said.</P>
      <P>The recurrence intervals refer to the average number of events over the
specified period of time. For example, a 100-year flood is one that has a 1
percent chance of occurring in any given year.</P>
      <P>To protect people from such disastrous flooding, it is important that rainfall
volumes are forecast accurately so that residents in flood-prone areas can be
evacuated early, Chen said.</P>

      <P>Teams from National Taiwan University (NTU) were the big winners in the 2009
National Robotics Contest, winning two of the three championships, a sponsor of
the competition said Monday.</P>
      <P>The contest was held at the Taipei International Robot Show, sponsored by the
Industrial Development Bureau, the Taiwan Shin Kong Security (SKS security) and
Hiwin Technologies Corp., held by the Precision Machinery Research Development
Center and directed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of
Education.</P>
      <P>It was divided into three main themes: home service robots, intelligent robotic
arms and security robots. The purpose of the contest was to incite student
creativity, discover new talent and stimulate academic and industry cooperation,
with the aim of spurring robot industry development in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 102 teams were competing for prize money totaling NT$3.18 million
(US$971,140).</P>
      <P>The NTU teams won the Intelligent Security Robot Contest held by SKS securities
and the Intelligent Robotic Arm Contest held by Hiwin Technologies Corp.</P>
      <P>Team Rambo, which won the championship, explained that their security robot was
tailor-made for the competition. It is a multi- sensor fusion-based wheeled
robot equipped with remote control, motion planning, obstacle avoidance, image
transmit and processing, automatic message sending, environment detection and
voice detection. In addition, the robot can also detect unauthorized intruders.</P>
      <P>Team Adam, the other winning NTU team, won the Intelligent Robotic Arm

    <HEADLINE>Modern-day 'Xu Xiakes' promote low-carbon travel</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.10  (CAN)
08/10/09  16:17:14

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of environmentally conscious scholars have formed an association to
promote a travel style that would have little impact on the natural environment,
academic sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Travel should not just mean eating sumptuously and staying in luxury
accommodations," said Tao Yi-huang, an associate professor at Tungnan University
in Shenkeng, Taipei, who is also chief executive of the Taiwan Society of Xu
Xiake.</P>
      <P>Tao took issue with the way mountain resorts are promoted, saying he is always
disgusted at TV commercials that feature a sport utility vehicle (SUV) driving
to a lush mountain and disgorging a family that barbecues and plays on riverside
rocks or lawns.</P>
      <P>"That is not a way to enjoy ecotourism, but rather a way to destroy the natural
ecology, " Tao said in a recent interview with a local paper.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of his association is to study and promote eco-friendly travel
styles, he said.</P>
      <P>The group is named after Xu Xiake (1587-1641) , a famous travel enthusiast  and
geographer  of ancient  China's  Ming  Dynasty (1368-1644).</P>
      <P>Xu Xiake, who began to travel when he was 22 years old, explored almost half of
China. His travel diary, "Travel Notes of Xu Xiake, " is the earliest such
record in China. It details geographical information on the regions he visited,
and is the world's earliest record of Karst landscapes and writings on how they
were formed.</P>
      <P>Xu was an environmentalist and an ecotourism expert who slammed the rulers of
his time for their slash-and-burn agricultural policies that decimated the
mountains and forests and he identified the adverse impact of mining, husbandry
and travel on the ecology and natural landscape, Tao said.</P>
      <P>On his long journeys, Xu endured many hardships and often slept in the open.</P>
      <P>"Our society needs to learn from Xu's spirit of overcoming hardships and turning
them into low-carbon, eco-friendly travel and lifestyles," he suggested.</P>
      <P>"When our group travels, our first choice is to walk or take public transport,"
Tao said.</P>
      <P>"We invariably choose to eat locally grown farm produce, " he added, arguing
that it is wrong for restaurants to always focus on offering delicacies from
around the world.</P>
      <P>Tao  said  his  group  would  never  stay  at hotels  or bed-and-breakfasts that
are built on slopes.</P>
      <P>"Such accommodations may offer beautiful mountain views, but their construction
is greatly detrimental  to water and soil conservation, " Tao said. "We like to
stay at places that were built with  locally  available  materials,  which
would  have saved transportation resources."</P>
      <P>Tao recalled that some of his students once asked his advice regarding a tour of
Cingjing Farm in central Taiwan that they were planning.</P>
      <P>"I told them to choose an affordable B&amp;B that is located in a legally
permitted area away from the main roads, properly equipped to treat garbage, and
adheres to water and soil conservation practices," Tao recalled.</P>
      <P>His students managed to find accommodation that met all those standards, but
only after an extensive online search, he said.</P>
      <P>"Travel planning should be part of students' education. Travel should not be
just for fun -- they should be able to learn something in the process of
arranging transportation and accommodation, " Tao added.</P>
      <P>With environmental and health consciousness growing, Tao said, low-carbon travel
is becoming increasingly popular in Taiwan, China and Hong Kong, and
consequently, interest in Xu Xiake is also widening.</P>
      <P>"Like-minded people in China and Hong Kong have also formed associations to
study and promote Xu's legacy," Tao said.</P>
      <P>According to Tao, his society maintains regular contact and has had academic
exchanges with various Xu Xiake groups in China and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Tao said his group usually organizes two to three local or overseas tours per
year.</P>
      <P>"Besides enjoying the natural scenery, we also evaluate whether the tourist
facilities and promotional approaches in the various countries adhere to the
spirit of low-carbon  use and energy conservation," he said.</P>
      <P>In his view, most of Taiwan's tourist spots are not sufficiently "low carbon" in
their operations.</P>
      <P>One of the exceptions is the Maoao community in Taipei County's Gongliao
township on the northeastern coast, he said.</P>
      <P>"Maoao's appeal lies in its low-profile development. It used to be a thriving
fishing town, but it lost its steam with the migration of its young residents.
It is re-emerging by developing ecotourism, " Tao said.</P>
      <P>Instead of building new tourist facilities, the local residents have converted
old houses into cafes and B&amp;Bs. The lands are being used for eco-friendly
farming and for the processing of locally produced seaweed into jellies and
health foods, he added.</P>

      <P>The local chapter of the Christian charity World Vision said Monday it has
launched a fund raising program and is providing immediate relief items such as
food and clean water for families in areas devastated by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>World Vision Taiwan said it will request more help from its headquarters in its
relief efforts.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot hovered over Taiwan Aug. 7-8, lashing the country with powerful
winds and torrential downpours. By early Sunday, it had dumped a record 2500 mm
of rain on the southernmost county of Pingtung,  causing severe flooding  in at
least three coastal townships.</P>
      <P>As of 8 a.m. Monday, flooding had left 12 persons dead, 32 injured and 52
unaccounted for islandwide.</P>
      <P>World Vision Taiwan said in a press release Monday that it had been working in
some of the affected areas for many years and already had resources in place to
quickly start relief work in the wake of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>In addition to food and cleaning supplies, emergency kits containing
flashlights, radios, raincoats, gloves, toothbrushes, toothpaste and towels were
also distributed, according to World Vision Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As of Sunday evening, World Vision had distributed 400 kits at an emergency
shelter in Taimali Township, Taitung, and 60 cases of mineral water and 284
packets of relief supplies at a shelter in Jiadung Township, Pingtung.</P>
      <P>"Many of the affected people live in remote areas and the roads there are in bad
condition. The roads and bridges are flooded or blocked by mudslides, fallen
trees and other large debris, " stated Wesley Chen, manager of World Vision's
Southern Area Office, in the press release.</P>
      <P>"We are working to find a way to bring aid to those who can't reach the
emergency shelters," he said.</P>
      <P>The charity said that as the scope of the damage is vast, it is calling for more
relief supplies, rescue vehicles and volunteers. It called on corporations and
individuals to join the effort by donating funds or relief resources.</P>
      <P>It has listed as priority items such as rice, instant noodles, canned food, oil,
cooking utensils, mineral water, clothes, blankets, mosquito nets, sleeping
bags, and cleaning materials.</P>
      <P>In addition, World Vision Taiwan has opened an account through its 30-Hour
Famine Campaign with the aim of raising NT$25 million (US$ 0.76 million) for
emergency relief and rehabilitation of families affected by the storm.</P>
      <P>Donations can be made to account number 15752467 (Account: World Vision
Taiwan)     or    online    at    http: //www.30hf.org.tw/English/Default.aspx,

      <P>The head of the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) said Monday that the aftermath of
Typhoon Morakot is not necessarily in line with or in direct ratio to CWB
weather forecasts that failed to predict the disaster.</P>
      <P>CWB Director Shin Tsai-chin said weather forecasting is a science, but the
aftermath of a typhoon involves assorted factors. He noted that a typhoon
forecast cannot be translated in a direct ratio to the scale of the disaster
caused by a typhoon.</P>
      <P>It is therefore unfair to lay the blame for the ballooning aftermath of Typhoon
Morakot at the feet of the weather bureau, Shin said.</P>
      <P>"The weather bureau does not take that kind of responsibility, " Shin pointed
out.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that the CWB makes its typhoon forecasts in accordance with
weather charts showing the storm system's direction and strength.</P>
      <P>The CWB's accuracy in forecasting a typhoon's strength and direction is about on
a par with that of the United States and Japan, Shin said, adding that the
bureau renews its typhoon forecasts every three hours and notifies every local
government rescue command center in a timely manner.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the CWB fulfilled its responsibilities in forecasting Morakot
and has made accurate precipitation forecasts, noting, for example, that the CWB
issued a sea warning for Morakot Aug. 5 and forecast that rainfall in
mountainous areas of southern Taiwan would reach 800 mm.</P>
      <P>On Aug. 7, he said, the weather bureau adjusted upward the rainfall forecast for
mountainous areas in southern Taiwan to 1,100 mm.</P>
      <P>Shin said weather forecasting is always plagued with uncertainty and added that
there is room for the CWB to improve its forecasting ability.</P>
      <P>"We will make greater efforts to forecast possible disasters, " Shin pledged.</P>
      <P>Shin made the remarks after local media had reported that day that President Ma
Ying-jeou had criticized the CWB for not having forecast Typhoon Morakot
"precisely."</P>

      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) confirmed Monday that regularly
scheduled direct cross-Taiwan Strait flights will begin Aug. 31.</P>
      <P>A CAA official said the arrangement was agreed upon between China and Taiwan
during the third round of cross-strait talks held in the Chinese city of Nanjing
April 26.</P>
      <P>The agreement allows for 270 regular flights per week between China and Taiwan,
a big increase compared to the existing 108 charter flights permitted each week.
In addition, China has agreed to open up six more destinations to Taiwanese
carriers, bringing to 27 the total number of Chinese destinations served by the
flights.</P>
      <P>Since the inauguration of daily chartered flights last December, they have
enjoyed great popularity due to high demand, but have also received severe
criticism for the high prices charged by the various carriers operating the
routes. With the advent of regular direct flights, the government hopes airfares
will become less expensive and already, carriers on both sides of the strait
have begun cutting fares in anticipation of the imminent opening.</P>

postponed for a week to Aug. 22, in view of the severe typhoon damage in the
southern regions, which is the worst in 50 years.</P>
      <P>During the one-week period, the 1,000-plus party delegates vying for the 315
posts will not be permitted to solicit votes or hold any other campaign
activities, he said.</P>
      <P>KMT Vice Chairman Wu Dun-yih said the party has opened a dedicated bank account
for typhoon relief donations by party members and other people in the society.</P>
      <P>Wu Poh-hsiung and Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng have already  donated
NT$2 million  (US$61,000)  and NT$1 million, respectively, while Wu Dun-yih has
given NT$200,000, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee said the KMT, along with its overseas chapters, hopes to work with the
public to help with the recovery work in southern Taiwan, and has informed its
members of the donation drive.</P>

      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (TSMC) reported consolidated net
sales of approximately NT$31.17 billion (US$949.75 million) in July,
representing a month-on-month growth of 17.6 percent, the company said in a
statement released Monday.</P>
      <P>The figure represented an 11-month high, thanks to increasing demand for
personal computers, mobile phones and other consumer electronics products.</P>
      <P>The world's largest contract chipmaker garnered NT$144.89 billion in revenues on
a consolidated basis in the first seven months of the year, a figure that
represented, however, a drop of 30.2 percent compared to the same period of
2008, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>TSMC anticipated that its sales would undergo drops in August and September
based on an earlier assessment that put its net sales in Q3 at between NT$88
billion and NT$90 billion.</P>
      <P>The company assessed that its Q3 products will generate a gross margin of
between 46.5 percent and 48.5 percent, marking a growth of 0.3 percent
points-2.3 percentage points compared with Q2.</P>
      <P>Its operating margin is expected to stand at between 35 percent and 37 percent
in Q3, also marking an increase from the 33.9 percent in Q2, the company said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Monday:</P>
      <P>Liberty Times: The government should be responsible for failing to relieve flood
victims effectively.</P>
      <P>The government of President Ma Ying-jeou has been trying to shift the
responsibility for the disastrous flooding caused by Typhoon Morakot to local
governments, claiming that they did not inform the central government of the
disaster in time.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is a tiny island, with easy access to any part of it, so why should the
disaster-relief work be divided between the local and central governments?</P>
      <P>The relief work should be carried out by one unified agency, which would be more
efficient.</P>
      <P>Also, flood prevention is more important than rescue operations afterward, and
the government's past flood-control efforts have concentrated on the dredging of
rivers and the building of levees.</P>
      <P>This has proved useless by the flooding caused by Morakot, and the government
should take into account the development of land, industry and cities while
addressing the flood problems in the long term.</P>
      <P>China Times: Flooding a problem that cannot be addressed even by the Control
Yuan.</P>
      <P>Just after the Control Yuan corrected 14 agencies at once for negligence in
their duties that led to last year's flooding, Typhoon Morakot triggered another
flood in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Inaccurate weather forecasting has been blamed as one reason for the disaster
because it failed to warn people of the approaching torrential rain brought by
the typhoon.</P>
      <P>The government's foot-dragging in managing the island's rivers properly is
another reason for the flooding, which is proved by the many hotels that have
sprouted in flood-prone areas around the country.</P>
      <P>Some low-lying areas are also predisposed to flooding because of land subsidence
caused by the overdrawing of underground water.</P>
      <P>We urge the country's political parties to unite to solve this problem.</P>
      <P>Apple Daily: A test of the quality of public projects</P>
      <P>We should not blame the government for the flooding in the wake of Typhoon
Morakot, as it was an act of God.</P>
      <P>However, the catastrophe gives us the chance to examine the quality of the
public infrastructure that collapsed or suffered damage during the storm.</P>
      <P>Did the contractors  collude  with  officials  during  the construction of these
projects? We urge the government to take this chance to stamp out corrupt
officials exposed by the disaster.</P>
      <P>United Daily News: Working together to help flood victims get back on their feet</P>
      <P>The flooding brought by Typhoon Morakot has proved that the country's  past
efforts at riverine management  have not been sufficient, so more needs to be
done to prevent future disasters from the point of view of land safety,
environmental protection and land management.</P>
      <P>The storm dumped more than 2,900 mm of rain on Taiwan in just three days -- the
equivalent of eight months' of rain for the island under normal circumstances --
so no wonder the precipitation resulted in such unprecedented flooding.</P>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau failed to foresee the storm's power, forecasting it
as a beneficial typhoon that would quench the drought-stricken island's thirst
for rain.</P>
      <P>The flooding  also bore out the fact that Taiwan's  land development has
exceeded natural limits and should be brought into check immediately.</P>
      <P>Man should learn from the disaster that he has to live with nature rather than
compete against it.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) thanked the Japanese government Monday
for expressing condolences for the stricken families in areas devastated by
Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Peter Tsai, secretary-general of the MOFA's Association of East Asian Relations,
told CNA that Naohiro Tsutsumi, director-general of the Taipei Office of the
Interchange Association -- the de facto Japanese embassy in Taiwan in the
absence of diplomatic relations -- called him Aug. 8 on behalf of the Japanese
government to express condolences over the situation, and offered help if
necessary, which MOFA deputy spokesman James Chang said would be taken up if
necessary.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot hovered over Taiwan Aug. 7-8, lashing parts of the country with
powerful wind and torrential rain. By early Sunday, it had dumped a record 2,500
mm of rain on the southernmost county of Pingtung,  causing severe flooding  in
at least three coastal townships.</P>
      <P>As of 12 p.m. Monday, the flooding there and elsewhere had left 14 people dead,
32 injured and 51 unaccounted for islandwide.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry also received  a letter from Japan's representative to
Taiwan, Masaki Saito, who expressed concern about the serious flooding in
southern Taiwan, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Tetsuya Hirose, secretary-general of the Japan-based Asia-Pacific
Parliamentarians' Union, which will hold its 40th annual conference in Taipei
Aug. 11, also expressed best wishes to the storm victims, according to Tsai.</P>
      <P>"We sincerely appreciate their gestures in the wake of the devastation caused by
Typhoon Morakot," Tsai added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) launched a remote health care center
Monday that will provide more timely care to high risk heart disease patients or
those with secondary risk factors.</P>
      <P>The center will enable case managers to monitor patients who have received
cardiosurgeries or have suffered from heart disease via equipment installed at
the patient's home.</P>
      <P>Dr. Ho Yi-lun, director of the NTUH Heart Failure Center and one of the
supporting doctors working at the Remote Health Care Center, said the patient
only needs to be hooked up to the equipment for eight minutes to have his or her
data transmitted to the center.</P>
      <P>The data will give a clear picture of the patient's condition, including blood
pressure, heart rate. blood oxygen, and blood sugar and also provide an
electrocardiogram, Ho said.</P>
      <P>Once they receive the data, case managers will in turn offer advice to the
patient or alert presiding doctors if further medical attention is necessary.</P>
      <P>Dr. Ke Wen-cheh, director of the NTUH Department of Trauma Medicine and another
of the doctors participating in the new center's operations, said the service
will be a big help to many recovering cardiosurgery patients who are afraid to
leave the hospital even if they are physically able to do so.</P>
      <P>"The equipment at home will allow such patients to have a clearer picture of
their post-surgical situations, and the center will help them determine whether
they should return to the hospital or just stay at home," Ke said.</P>
      <P>Even before Monday's official opening, the center already had 14 patients under
its care, including three in Shanghai, one in Xiamen and 10 in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A Mrs. Cheng, now living in Shanghai, has had her condition constantly monitored
through NTUH equipment installed at her Shanghai home, and she receives regular
advice from the center's case managers and doctors.</P>
      <P>Miss Wu in Taiwan, another NTUH patient who is taking medication to control her
coronary artery disease, said the remote health care service has allowed her to
live a normal life since she signed up for it last year.</P>
      <P>At a news conference Monday, Wu said that since being "connected" to the
center's monitoring system, she has felt less stress and more at peace, calling
the equipment at her home a"shepherd" through which doctors monitor her
condition without her having to go to the hospital.</P>
      <P>To get access to the monitoring system, a patient needs to pay a rental fee of
NT$3,000-NT$4,000 per month for the equipment and another NT$2,000 per month in
monthly management fees, according to a center spokeswoman.</P>

      <P>An estimated 500 to 600 people remain unaccounted for Monday after mudslides
triggered by Typhoon Morakot hit an isolated mountain village in southern
Taiwan's Kaohsiung County, according to rescued villagers.</P>
      <P>"Only 44 residents of Siaolin managed to avoid the mudslides, and the remaining
500 to 600 residents are unaccounted for, " said a family member of residents
believed to be trapped in the village and possible buried alive.</P>
      <P>The weeping family member urged the government to not waste even a second in
launching an operation to rescue the trapped villagers.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, two army helicopters managed to airlift 26 villagers from
Siaolin and two more from neighboring Tajin to safety.</P>
      <P>Army authorities originally planned to airlift all 44 of the Siaolin villagers
who managed to flee from their mudslide-struck homes, but rescue efforts were
suspended after four sorties due to bad weather and low visibility.</P>
      <P>The National Airborne Service Corps (NASC) was also forced to cancel  its plan
to deliver  relief  supplies  to two other mudslide-struck mountain villages --
Namasia and Taoyuan.</P>
      <P>The staggering amount of rainfall delivered by Morakot over the weekend led to
massive flooding and landslides that wreaked havoc in Kaohsiung County's
mountainous Maolin, Taoyuan, Namasia, and Jiasian villages and part of Liouguei,
cutting them off from the outside world.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing took an NASC flight Monday morning
to see for himself the situation in the isolated villages, but the helicopter
could not land when it flew to Siaolin because of poor weather.</P>
      <P>Some rescued villagers criticized Yang for failing to take timely precautionary
measures and procrastinating in organizing relief efforts, but Yang did not
directly respond.</P>
      <P>He simply said all-out rescue efforts could only begin after water levels in
major rivers had retreated, as all bridges and roads linking the mountainous
villages with the outside world have been severely damaged.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Minister  of the Interior Liao Liou-yi visited Kaoshiung County's
Chishan Junior High School, a post-disaster operation base.</P>
      <P>Some local officials complained that the central government was slow in
responding to the region's worst flooding in half a century. Liao said that he
has asked the military to enter the disaster zones, weather permitting, to
rescue stranded villagers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President not planning to issue emergency decree after typhoon</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has no plans at present to issue an emergency decree to
help clean up and rebuild parts of Taiwan that have been devastated by floods
triggered by Typhoon Morakot, the president's spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>The president believes existing government  mechanisms  are sufficient to deal
with the situation and will put the Executive Yuan in charge of the operation
rather than issuing an emergency decree, said Presidential Office spokesman Wang
Yu-chih.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, ruling Kuomintang (KMT) legislators urged Ma to issue such a
decree to help facilitate rescue and recovery missions in dealing with the
widespread destruction wreaked by Typhoon Marakot, which has left at least 15
people dead.</P>
      <P>KMT legislators, including Hung Hsiu-chu, Yang Chiung-ying and Wu Ching-chih,
suggested that the move would enable rescue operations to be conducted more
efficiently, without legal barriers, based on the experience of the Sept. 21,
1999 earthquake and the Aug. 7 floods of 1959.</P>
      <P>An emergency decree would permit government agencies at different levels to
raise funds to assist, accommodate or evacuate victims in a more flexible way in
case of an emergency, Hung said.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan's Constitution, the president is authorized, in line with a
resolution by the Executive Yuan, to issue an emergency decree in case of major
natural or economic disasters.</P>
      <P>The president must obtain the Legislative Yuan's approval within 10 days of
issuing the decree. It becomes invalid if the legislature fails to give its
consent.</P>
      <P>Yang also said the party's legislative caucus is thinking of holding an extra
meeting to discuss a possible supplemental budget to support post-typhoon
reconstruction work.</P>
      <P>In addition, many KMT legislators also donated a day of pay in line with a
donation drive launched by the party.</P>
      <P>Morakot, the worst typhoon in 50 years to pass through Taiwan, has caused huge
damage to southern Taiwan, particularly in Tainan, Kaohsiung and Pingtung
counties, as a result of massive mudslides triggered by the storm's staggering
amount of precipitation.</P>
      <P>Agricultural, farm and fisheries losses have so far amounted to NT$4.2 billion
(US$128 million), according to figures compiled by the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>As of Monday noon, 15 people were killed, 32 were injured, and 52 were missing,
but those numbers were likely to rise as some people in mountain villages still
remain unaccounted for.</P>
      <P>In one village in Kaohsiung County, called Siaolin, 400-600 hundred residents
are feared to have been buried alive by mudslides that completely covered their
houses Sunday night.</P>
      <P>An estimated 200 had been rescued as of Monday late afternoon. Roads leading to
the area have been cut off and continuing bad weather has prevented a bigger
rescue operation to be launched.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Animal Rescue Team Taiwan (ARTT) appealed to the public Monday for relief
supplies to save dogs kept in shelters that survived the flooding triggered by
Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>The group has created a new Chinese-language Web page at www.savedogs.org to
provide updated information on typhoon-affected privately-run shelters in
Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties, volunteer Nee Ching-tai told the Central News
Agency.</P>
      <P>At present, Nee said, the group has received reports that at least 10 shelters
were damaged, leaving over 1,000 dogs trapped by floods and more than 100 dogs
drowned or missing.</P>
      <P>"The survivors are mostly suffering from low temperatures after being rescued
from the floods," he said.</P>
      <P>Nee said other volunteers have visited the flooded shelters and taken pictures
to document how they have been affected by Morakot's strong winds and heavy
rains that pummeled southern Taiwan over the weekend.</P>
      <P>They hope that through the Web page, animal lovers will know how badly the dogs
and their caregivers need help, and what they need to survive, Nee said.</P>
      <P>The shelters' primary needs at present are medical supplies, old sheets,
drinking water, dog food and financial support, as well as volunteers who can
help shelter keepers rebuild the dogs' homes.</P>
      <P>ARTT volunteer Chen Tzai-han said humans have not been the only victims of the
disaster. Stray dog shelters have been devastated and suffered great losses but
the media and rescue personnel have ignored the dogs' plight, she complained.</P>
      <P>Nee warned that more dogs will die if the shelters do not quickly receive relief
supplies and help to restore and disinfect the shelters.</P>

      <P>More  than  100  survivors  from mudslide-battered Siaolin Village in southern
Taiwan's Kaohsiung County have been located, a rescued villager said Monday, but
the fate of hundreds more said to be trapped there remained unknown.</P>
      <P>"I received a phone call from my friend at the Ministry of the Interior saying a
military special warfare task force entered Siaolin by helicopter earlier in the
day and discovered 100-plus residents, including adults and children, taking
shelter at a cottage on an elevated platform," the villager said.</P>
      <P>In response, Kaohsiung County's disaster relief center said it will send a
helicopter Tuesday to inspect the situation and rescue survivors.</P>
      <P>Some 1,313 people have their household registration in the village, but only a
fraction of them live there year round. Because August is bamboo shoot
harvesting season, however, and many people returned for Father's Day on
Saturday, more people were thought to be there than usual.</P>
      <P>Rescued  villagers  estimated  there are still 300 to 400 individuals who remain
unaccounted for and are feared trapped in homes caught in mudslides.</P>
      <P>Siaolin was just one of the villages ambushed by flooding and landslides in
Kaohsiung County that were triggered by the staggering amount of rainfall
delivered by Morakot over the weekend.</P>
      <P>The natural disasters also affected the mountainous villages of Maolin, Taoyuan,
Namasia, and Jiasian and part of Liouguei, cutting them off from the outside
world.</P>
      <P>Most of the towns, including Siaolin, are accessible only by single mountain
roads that often cross or follow along rivers. The roads and connecting bridges
were unable to withstand the pressure of rampaging waters and buckled under the
pressure.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, two army helicopters managed to airlift 26 villagers from
Siaolin and two more from neighboring Tajin to safety.</P>
      <P>Army authorities originally planned to airlift all 44 of the Siaolin villagers
who managed to flee from their mudslide-struck homes, but rescue efforts were
suspended after four sorties due to bad weather and low visibility.</P>
      <P>Defense Vice Minister Huang Yi-ping said if weather permits, military servicemen
will enter Namasia and other isolated villages in the county's mountainous
region Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Responding to criticism that the military reacted slowly in providing post-
disaster relief, Huang said the criticism was not fair and that the military has
so far mobilized 6,079 service members to join rescue and relief operations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) said it has delivered
142,000 cans of disinfectant and nine disinfecting vehicles to flood-stricken
central, southern and eastern Taiwan for epidemic prevention and environmental
cleanup.</P>
      <P>As of noon Monday, the typhoon had left 14 people dead, 32 injured and 51
unaccounted for, according to government statistics.</P>

official said Monday.</P>
      <P>"The council and major farmers associations around the country have a total of
7,600 tons of refrigerated vegetables in stock, which will be enough to meet
domestic market demand, " said Cheng Shou-liang, director of the COA's
Statistics Department.</P>
      <P>The COA has 1,200 tons of cabbage and Chinese cabbage in inventory and will
gradually release the stock based on the amount available and prices prevailing
in the Taipei Fruit and Vegetable Market, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The remaining 6,400 tons are being stored by various farmers groups, and this
supply will be released to meet demand through various distribution channels, he
added.</P>
      <P>According to official statistics, the Taipei Fruit and Vegetable Market received
1,347 tons of vegetables for sale Aug. 5 when Morakot had yet to hit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>From Aug. 6-9, the daily supply was 1,333 tons, 1,573 tons, 1,036 tons and 1,168
tons, respectively. The market was closed Monday.</P>
      <P>The quantity available for sale Tuesday is estimated at around 1,050 tons,
roughly equivalent to the daily average of 1,200 tons.</P>
      <P>"Local residents shouldn't worry about a shortage of vegetables in the wake of
the typhoon disaster, " Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot lashed Taiwan with strong winds and staggering amounts of
rainfall over the weekend, causing severe damage to crops, with agricultural
losses topping NT$5.06 billion (US$153.33 million) as of 2 p.m. Monday.</P>
      <P>With more losses still expected, the NT$5.06 billion in losses already stands as
the seventh worst agricultural disaster in 18 years, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The worst agricultural disaster was caused by Typhoon Herbert in August 1996
when NT$18.08 billion in agricultural losses were recorded.</P>

      <P>The acceptance of bank cards issued by the China-based China UnionPay Co. in
Taiwan is expected to generate NT$10 billion (US$304 million) in spending in
local shops, a National Credit Card Center (NCCC) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yin Chieh-fang, the center's deputy president, made the forecast based on
estimated yearly spending of about NT$35 billion by Chinese visitors in Taiwan
-- which assumes 600,000 tourists per year will spend an average of US$290 per
day on five- to six-day tours.</P>
      <P>Should Chinese tourists make 30 percent of their purchases with their China
UnionPay bank cards, that would equate to some NT$10 billion per year, Yin
explained.</P>
      <P>Chinese cardholders have used the cards to spend NT$15 million since Taiwan
began allowing their use Aug. 7, she noted.</P>
      <P>Yin made the comments following a ceremony marking the acceptance of the cards
in Taiwan, which was also attended by Financial Supervisory Commission Chairman
Sean Chen and representatives from China.</P>
      <P>According to government statistics, 380,000 Chinese tourists have visited the
country since Taiwan opened its doors wider to them in July 2008, and they spent
an average of US$295 during the first six months of the opening.</P>
      <P>Chiu Fong-kai, a senior vice president at Taishin International Bank, was even
more optimistic than Yin, estimating Chinese tourists would make NT$30 billion
in purchases in Taiwan with the card every year.</P>
      <P>Xu Luode, president of China UnionPay, also suggested that Chinese tourist
spending in Taiwan is likely to rapidly increase thanks to the acceptance of its
bank cards in Taiwan's shops.</P>
      <P>Because of the potential commercial opportunity, the center predicted that the
number of merchants accepting China UnionPay bank cards will rise from some 500
now to 20,000 by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The bank cards are currently accepted mostly in popular tourist destinations,
such as Alishan, Sun Moon Lake, night markets and duty free shops at airports as
well as scenic spots in Hualien, Taitung and Pingtung counties.</P>
      <P>At the head of a delegation composed of executives from major Chinese banking
institutions, Xu arrived last week to jointly announce with the National Credit
Card Center the acceptance of the Chinese bank cards in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>China UnionPay is China's only national electronic payment network, an umbrella
network that covers more than 80 banking institutions. As the dominant player in
China's bank card industry, it currently has more than 1.9 billion cards in
circulation, which are accepted in 62 countries and regions outside China.</P>

      <P>Charity organizations and private business groups have begun efforts to collect
donations and ship relief supplies to areas in southern Taiwan that were
devastated by Typhoon Morakot over the weekend.</P>
      <P>As of noon Monday, the storm had left 14 people dead and caused agricultural
losses of over NT$5 billion, according to statistics released by the Central
Emergency Operation Center.</P>
      <P>Chen Shih-kuei, secretary-general of the Red Cross Society of the R.O.C., said
Monday that with money most needed in the affected areas, his organization has
arranged for 2,350 retail outlets around Taiwan to accept donations until Sept.
10.</P>
      <P>The Red Cross will collect the donations from the stores, using them on relief
and recovery efforts, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, FamilyMart, the second largest convenience store chain in Taiwan, is
cooperating with the Red Cross in the delivery of relief supplies to the
typhoon-affected area, including bread from the chain stores, a company
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>On Monday, the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation delivered enough
instant rice and noodles to feed 200,000 people in the affected areas of
Pingtung, Kaohsiung and Tainan counties.</P>
      <P>The food is expected to allow typhoon victims to have warm meals in the coming
days while they are busy restoring their homes, which have been badly damaged or
in some cases destroyed by flooding from the storm, according to Tzu Chi
volunteers.</P>
      <P>The Hualien County-based charity organization has also mobilized a large-scale
volunteer force to assist flood-hit families in cleaning their homes, they
added.</P>
      <P>In addition to Tzu Chi,  the Buddha's Light International Association has
donated NT$35 million (US$1.1 million) to relief efforts in southern Taiwan,
while the Hong Kong Buddhist Association donated 5 million Hong Kong dollars
(some NT$20 million).</P>
      <P>Other donors included the Far Eastern Group and its affiliates.</P>
      <P>Group headquarters donated NT$60 million to buy urgently needed supplies for the

      <P>Far Eastone Telecommunications Co., one of Taiwan's leading mobile phone service

      <P>Justice Minister Wang Ching-feng initiated a donation campaign on Monday,
encouraging officials and employees in the ministry to donate one day in pay to

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Animal Rescue Team Taiwan (ARTT) appealed to the public Monday for relief
supplies to save dogs kept in shelters that survived the flooding triggered by
Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>The group has created a new Chinese-language Web page at www.savedogs.org to
provide updated information on typhoon-affected privately-run shelters in
Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties, volunteer Nee Ching-tai told the Central News
Agency.</P>
      <P>At present, Nee said, the group has received reports that at least 10 shelters
were damaged, leaving over 1,000 dogs trapped by floods and more than 100 dogs
drowned or missing.</P>
      <P>"The survivors are mostly suffering from low temperatures after being rescued
from the floods," he said.</P>
      <P>Nee said other volunteers have visited the flooded shelters and taken pictures
to document how they have been affected by Morakot's strong winds and heavy
rains that pummeled southern Taiwan over the weekend.</P>
      <P>They hope that through the Web page, animal lovers will know how badly the dogs
and their caregivers need help, and what they need to survive, Nee said.</P>
      <P>The shelters' primary needs at present are medical supplies, old sheets,
drinking water, dog food and financial support, as well as volunteers who can
help shelter keepers rebuild the dogs' homes.</P>
      <P>ARTT volunteer Chen Tzai-han said humans have not been the only victims of the
disaster. Stray dog shelters have been devastated and suffered great losses but
the media and rescue personnel have ignored the dogs' plight, she complained.</P>
      <P>Nee warned that more dogs will die if the shelters do not quickly receive relief
supplies and help to restore and disinfect the shelters.</P>

      <P>More  than  100  survivors  from mudslide-battered Siaolin Village in southern
Taiwan's Kaohsiung County have been located, a rescued villager said Monday, but
the fate of hundreds more said to be trapped there remained unknown.</P>
      <P>"I received a phone call from my friend at the Ministry of the Interior saying a
military special warfare task force entered Siaolin by helicopter earlier in the
day and discovered 100-plus residents, including adults and children, taking
shelter at a cottage on an elevated platform," the villager said.</P>
      <P>In response, Kaohsiung County's disaster relief center said it will send a
helicopter Tuesday to inspect the situation and rescue survivors.</P>
      <P>Some 1,313 people have their household registration in the village, but only a
fraction of them live there year round. Because August is bamboo shoot
harvesting season, however, and many people returned for Father's Day on
Saturday, more people were thought to be there than usual.</P>
      <P>Rescued  villagers  estimated  there are still 300 to 400 individuals who remain
unaccounted for and are feared trapped in homes caught in mudslides.</P>
      <P>Siaolin was just one of the villages ambushed by flooding and landslides in
Kaohsiung County that were triggered by the staggering amount of rainfall
delivered by Morakot over the weekend.</P>
      <P>The natural disasters also affected the mountainous villages of Maolin, Taoyuan,
Namasia, and Jiasian and part of Liouguei, cutting them off from the outside
world.</P>
      <P>Most of the towns, including Siaolin, are accessible only by single mountain
roads that often cross or follow along rivers. The roads and connecting bridges
were unable to withstand the pressure of rampaging waters and buckled under the
pressure.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, two army helicopters managed to airlift 26 villagers from
Siaolin and two more from neighboring Tajin to safety.</P>
      <P>Army authorities originally planned to airlift all 44 of the Siaolin villagers
who managed to flee from their mudslide-struck homes, but rescue efforts were
suspended after four sorties due to bad weather and low visibility.</P>
      <P>Defense Vice Minister Huang Yi-ping said if weather permits, military servicemen
will enter Namasia and other isolated villages in the county's mountainous
region Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Responding to criticism that the military reacted slowly in providing post-
disaster relief, Huang said the criticism was not fair and that the military has
so far mobilized 6,079 service members to join rescue and relief operations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) said it has delivered
142,000 cans of disinfectant and nine disinfecting vehicles to flood-stricken
central, southern and eastern Taiwan for epidemic prevention and environmental
cleanup.</P>
      <P>As of noon Monday, the typhoon had left 14 people dead, 32 injured and 51
unaccounted for, according to government statistics.</P>

7,600 tons of refrigerated vegetables in stock, which will be enough to meet
domestic market demand, " said Cheng Shou-liang, director of the COA's
Statistics Department.</P>
      <P>The COA has 1,200 tons of cabbage and Chinese cabbage in inventory and will
gradually release the stock based on the amount available and prices prevailing
in the Taipei Fruit and Vegetable Market, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The remaining 6,400 tons are being stored by various farmers groups, and this
supply will be released to meet demand through various distribution channels, he
added.</P>
      <P>According to official statistics, the Taipei Fruit and Vegetable Market received
1,347 tons of vegetables for sale Aug. 5 when Morakot had yet to hit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>From Aug. 6-9, the daily supply was 1,333 tons, 1,573 tons, 1,036 tons and 1,168
tons, respectively. The market was closed Monday.</P>
      <P>The quantity available for sale Tuesday is estimated at around 1,050 tons,
roughly equivalent to the daily average of 1,200 tons.</P>
      <P>"Local residents shouldn't worry about a shortage of vegetables in the wake of
the typhoon disaster, " Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot lashed Taiwan with strong winds and staggering amounts of
rainfall over the weekend, causing severe damage to crops, with agricultural
losses topping NT$5.06 billion (US$153.33 million) as of 2 p.m. Monday.</P>
      <P>With more losses still expected, the NT$5.06 billion in losses already stands as
the seventh worst agricultural disaster in 18 years, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The worst agricultural disaster was caused by Typhoon Herbert in August 1996
when NT$18.08 billion in agricultural losses were recorded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Acceptance of Chinese bank cards expected to boost business</HEADLINE>

      <P>The acceptance of bank cards issued by the China-based China UnionPay Co. in
Taiwan is expected to generate NT$10 billion (US$304 million) in spending in
local shops, a National Credit Card Center (NCCC) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yin Chieh-fang, the center's deputy president, made the forecast based on
estimated yearly spending of about NT$35 billion by Chinese visitors in Taiwan
-- which assumes 600,000 tourists per year will spend an average of US$290 per
day on five- to six-day tours.</P>
      <P>Should Chinese tourists make 30 percent of their purchases with their China
UnionPay bank cards, that would equate to some NT$10 billion per year, Yin
explained.</P>
      <P>Chinese cardholders have used the cards to spend NT$15 million since Taiwan
began allowing their use Aug. 7, she noted.</P>
      <P>Yin made the comments following a ceremony marking the acceptance of the cards
in Taiwan, which was also attended by Financial Supervisory Commission Chairman
Sean Chen and representatives from China.</P>
      <P>According to government statistics, 380,000 Chinese tourists have visited the
country since Taiwan opened its doors wider to them in July 2008, and they spent
an average of US$295 during the first six months of the opening.</P>
      <P>Chiu Fong-kai, a senior vice president at Taishin International Bank, was even
more optimistic than Yin, estimating Chinese tourists would make NT$30 billion
in purchases in Taiwan with the card every year.</P>
      <P>Xu Luode, president of China UnionPay, also suggested that Chinese tourist
spending in Taiwan is likely to rapidly increase thanks to the acceptance of its
bank cards in Taiwan's shops.</P>
      <P>Because of the potential commercial opportunity, the center predicted that the
number of merchants accepting China UnionPay bank cards will rise from some 500
now to 20,000 by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The bank cards are currently accepted mostly in popular tourist destinations,
such as Alishan, Sun Moon Lake, night markets and duty free shops at airports as
well as scenic spots in Hualien, Taitung and Pingtung counties.</P>
      <P>At the head of a delegation composed of executives from major Chinese banking
institutions, Xu arrived last week to jointly announce with the National Credit
Card Center the acceptance of the Chinese bank cards in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>China UnionPay is China's only national electronic payment network, an umbrella
network that covers more than 80 banking institutions. As the dominant player in
China's bank card industry, it currently has more than 1.9 billion cards in
circulation, which are accepted in 62 countries and regions outside China.</P>

      <P>Hang Seng Investment Management Ltd. will begin offering its two dual-listed
exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) Aug. 14, the
company's chief investment officer said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>On July 29, Hang Seng Bank announced that two ETFs managed by fully owned
subsidiary Hang Seng Investment Management -- Hang Seng Index ETF and Hang Seng
H-Share Index ETF -- had been approved by Taiwan's Cabinet-level Financial
Supervisory Commission (FSC) for listing applications with the TWSE.</P>
      <P>The new cross-listing policy will allow Taiwanese investors to directly invest
in Hong Kong ETFs.</P>
      <P>Clement Ho, director and chief investment officer of Hang Seng Investment
Management, was bullish on the ETFs near-term prospects, saying stock markets in
both China and Hong Kong would retain their upward momentum into the second
quarter of 2010.</P>
      <P>Though some analysts fear credit risks and asset bubbles might compel the
Chinese government to change its moderately loose monetary policy, Ho thinks
China's monetary policy will remain unchanged, arguing that the timing is not
right.</P>
      <P>Unless China's exports increase  dramatically  and positive employment numbers
are seen, the government is unlikely to initiate a large-scale retrenchment
policy, Ho said.</P>
      <P>Hang Seng Bank said on July 29 the two ETFs were the first Hong Kong ETFs to
have obtained permission from the FSC to apply for dual-listing under a cross-
listing regime recently established by Hong Kong and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>HSBC Global Asset Management (Taiwan) Limited has been appointed the master
agent of the ETFs in Taiwan, and Yuanta Securities was the first firm to be

      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) reported Tuesday that Taiwan is still under the
influence of air currents from the southwest and could still experience heavy
rainfall after being battered by Typhoon Morakot over the weekend.</P>
      <P>Although Morakot left Taiwan Sunday, it has joined with Typhoon Goni, which has
lingered over China's Guangdong province, to form a low pressure system whose
rain clouds are being pushed toward Taiwan by a high pressure system from the
north,  according to CWB meteorologists.</P>
      <P>They said precipitation would be heavy in areas south of Miaoli County, and
warned that mountainous areas in central and southern Taiwan could be hit by
more torrential rains.</P>
      <P>From Monday midnight to Tuesday morning at 8:10, Taoyuan village in Kaohsiung
County had received 88mm of rainfall, the most anywhere in Taiwan, followed by
Syueling in Taichung County with 71mm and Liouguei in Kaohsiung County and
Weiliao in Pingtung County with 50 mm.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties were already battered by Typhoon Morakot  over

      <P>Typhoon Morakot, which pummeled Taiwan Aug. 7-9, will drag down the domestic
economy temporarily because of the the massive destruction it wreaked, a private
economic think-tank forecast Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The damage from the storm, which triggered the worst flooding in Taiwan in 50
years, will unavoidably impact adversely on the country's economy in the third
quarter of this year, particularly in the agricultural and tourism sectors, said
Liang Kuo-yuan, president of the Taipei-based Polaris Research Institute.</P>
      <P>Liang quoted some companies as predicting that economic losses from the typhoon
will reach NT$15 billion (US$457.32 million) , and that the domestic economy
will fall by 0.53 percentage points in Q3 as a result.</P>
      <P>However, the outlook for the GDP in the fourth quarter is not necessarily
"pessimistic, " given that huge governmental funds and resources  will be
channeled into post-disaster  reconstruction efforts, which might rev up
economic growth, he said.</P>
      <P>"The GDP might register positive growth in Q4 as rehabilitation work kicks off
at home and the global economies possibly start rebounding," Liang forecast.</P>
      <P>Citing the 2006 Hurricane Katrina in the United States and the 2008 killer
earthquake in China's Sichuan Province as examples, Liang said that government-
initiated reconstruction work in the wake of the natural disasters helped rev up
the local economies and turned the growth from negative to positive.</P>
      <P>The rehabilitation work will help generate new demand, investment and
employment, he added.</P>
      <P>He cautioned however, that apart from the physical damage caused by Typhoon
Morakot, there could be mental trauma among disaster victims, a type of damage
that would be hard to measure and would not be reflected in GDP figures.</P>

participants to observe a moment of silence in memory of the victims of Typhoon
Morakot.</P>
      <P>Over the weekend, the storm triggered the worst flooding in 50 years, and the
death toll of 41 continues to rise.</P>
      <P>In his speech, which he delivered in English, Ma touted his government's
achievement of improved relations between Taiwan and China and its adoption of a
flexible diplomacy policy.</P>
      <P>Ma also reiterated Taiwan's contribution to peace and democracy in the
international community.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, the chairman of the conference, said
that this year's APPU conference, which is being held under the theme of "human
security, " will focus on economic security, food safety, health safety and
environmental safety.</P>
      <P>He reminded the participants that the Asia-Pacific region, one of the largest in
the world, is home to more than half the world's population.</P>
      <P>Wang said the region therefore has a responsibility to pay attention to human
security issues, particularly as most people in the world have been under threat
over the past year as a result of the global financial crunch, the outbreak of
A(H1N1) influenza, and the occurrence of cross-boundary sandstorms.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan speaker also noted that many democratic countries attach
great importance to parliamentary diplomacy as it not only helps governments
address international issues, but also provides a platform for parliamentarians
to better represent the opinions of the citizens in their respective countries.</P>
      <P>Only by working together across national boundaries can the APPU members promote
the wellbeing of the people in the region, he said.</P>
      <P>The 40th APPU annual conference will conclude Wednesday with the signing of a
joint communique by the 14 participating APPU members.</P>
      <P>The APPU is comprised of 21 Asia-Pacific countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Agricultural losses from Morakot fourth-highest in 18 years</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Agricultural and fishery losses from Typhoon Morakot which swept Taiwan over the
weekend were estimated at NT$6.85 billion (US$208 million) as of Tuesday,
according to the newest government statistics.</P>
      <P>Tallies compiled by the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) showed that
the storm damage figure is the fourth-highest in 18 years.</P>
      <P>A total of 49,723 hectares of farmlands were devastated by Morakot, with banana
plantations on some 5,356 hectares suffering the biggest blow, followed by
papaya, guava, bamboo and vegetable farms.</P>
      <P>Poultry and animal losses amounted to NT$737.59 million, with 2.7 million
chickens and 709,000 ducks perishing in the storm. Pig farmers reportedly lost a
total of 80,815 pigs.</P>
      <P>Fisheries losses reached a new high of NT$2.91 billion, exceeding the NT$2.43
billion recorded when Typhoon Herbert hit in Aug. 1996, COA tallies showed.</P>
      <P>A combined 5,832 hectares of fish farms in southern Taiwan's Tainan, Pingtung
and Kaohsiung counties were badly damaged by Morakot -- the worst typhoon to hit
the south in 50 years.</P>
      <P>Losses in the forestry sector were estimated at NT$16.36 million, while
agricultural facilities suffered damage amounting to NT$168.32 million, and 73
hectares of farmland were washed away, according to the COA.</P>
      <P>Some 10 cities and counties -- Pingtung, Kaohsiung, Chiayi, Yulin, Tainan,
Hualien, Taitung and Taichung counties as well as Tainan and Chiayi cities --
are eligible to apply for COA cash subsides in view of the severe damage caused
by Morakot, the council said.</P>
      <P>Fourteen cities and counties, including the 10 mentioned above, are also
eligible to apply for low-interest loans, the COA said, adding that the other
four are Taichung, Changhua and Miaoli counties and Taichung City.</P>
      <P>As a result of the storm damage, vegetable supplies at the Taipei Vegetable and
Fruit Market on Tuesday fell to 1,090 tons, a decrease of 78 tons compared to
the last trading day on Sunday. The market was closed on Monday.</P>
      <P>Strong demand drove vegetable wholesale prices up to NT$32.9 per kilogram
Tuesday in the market -- an increase of 17.3 percent. Fruit supplies rose on
Tuesday by 192 tons to 562 tons.</P>
      <P>In view of the tight local supply of vegetables and the surging prices of staple
commodities in the world market, COA officials are concerned that the prices of
other food items, such as pork, chicken, eggs and fish, will soar in the coming
three weeks.</P>
      <P>The COA said it has been seeking to import vegetables from Southeast Asian
countries and Australia to meet local demand. It predicted that pork and chicken
prices will rise and remain at a relatively high level over the next six to nine
months.</P>
      <P>However, Cheng Shou-liang, director of the COA's Statistics Department,  said
Monday  that the council  and major farmers associations around the country have
a total of 7,600 tons of refrigerated vegetables in stock, which will be enough
to meet domestic market demand.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Liao Liou-yi called for hospitals Tuesday to allow
victims of Typhoon Morakot to receive medical attention on credit if they are
unable to produce their health insurance cards.</P>
      <P>Liao made the call after visiting an office of the Kaohsiung county government
in Cishan township, where some flood and mudslide victims complained to him that
when they were rushed to hospital for treatment, the hospital authorities
refused to treat them unless they could produce health insurance cards and pay
for registration.</P>
      <P>The victims complained that in the wake of the flooding and devastation brought
by Typhoon Morakot, they did not have enough time to bring with them health
insurance cards or money when they were evacuated.</P>
      <P>Liao later instructed that the victims should be given medical attention on
credit and that their medical bills should be erased once local government
offices issue documents proving that they are victims of the typhoon.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Cabinet-level Public Construction Commission said that Morakot
victims, as well as other members of the public, should visit a Government
Information Office (GIO) Web site set up to keep abreast  of  post-disaster
rescue  and  relief  work  at http://info.gio.gov.tw/mp.asp?mp=1.</P>
      <P>The site provides details about cash relief, subsidies, medical attention,
taxation, education and employment assistance in the wake of the devastation,
said the commission.</P>
      <P>According to the GIO, families whose loved ones have died or gone missing
because of the typhoon are eligible for condolence money of NT$1 million
(US$30,488) per casualty.</P>
      <P>Families whose members have suffered severe injury as a result of the typhoon
are also entitled to receive NT$250,000 per victim, the GIO said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, local governments will also provide relocation funding to families
whose homes have been destroyed by flooding or mudslides. The grants will amount
to NT$20,000 per person, to a maximum of NT$100,000 per household, the GIO said
in a statement.</P>
      <P>The Relief Disaster Foundation under the Ministry of the Interior is also
offering flood victims a choice of either NT$10,000 per person in relocation
funds for up to five people per household; NT$3,000 per person to rent a
property for up to six months, up to three people per household; or NT$20,000
per household in flood compensation.</P>
      <P>Those who believe themselves eligible should contact their local government
offices to gain access to the funding, a foundation official said.</P>
      <P>As of Tuesday morning, the storm had left 41 people dead, 35 people injured and
60 still unaccounted for, with agricultural losses estimated at over NT$5
billion, according to figures released by the Central Emergency Operation
Center.</P>

      <P>Twenty-four survivors in isolated villages in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung County
had been rescued as of early Tuesday, with hundreds more said to have been
buried alive by mudslides, the Central Emergency Operation Center (CEOC) said
that day.</P>
      <P>Two army helicopters had landed at the mudslide-battered Siaolin, Taoyuan and
Namasia villages and had airlifted 18 people to safety, according to the CEOC.</P>
      <P>The staggering amount of rainfall delivered by Typhoon Morakot over the weekend
led to massive flooding and landslides that wreaked havoc in Kaohsiung County's
mountainous villages, cutting them off from the outside world.</P>
      <P>Army servicemen sent to Siaolin found some 150 villagers and dropped some 1,300
kg of emergency food and water.</P>
      <P>The army said it would continue to send helicopters to mountain villages to
search for other survivors, the CEOC said, adding that some villagers upstream
from Siaolin had refused to evacuate but had demanded airdrops of food and

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) thanked the international community
Tuesday for its condolences for the stricken families in areas devastated by
Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>MOFA deputy spokesman James Chang said at a regular press briefing that both
Japan and the United States have expressed deep condolences for the typhoon
victims and their families and offered to help through all kinds of channels.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and the U.S. State
Department  contacted  the  foreign  ministry  and  its representative office in
Washington, respectively, to express concern over the situation, according to
Chang.</P>
      <P>In addition, the governments of France, Hungary and the Holy See, Taiwan's only
diplomatic ally in Europe, and a German parliamentary group friendly to Taiwan
also sent their condolences to the victims and their families, he added.</P>
      <P>El Salvador Ambassador Francisco Ricardo Santana, who is the acting head of the
diplomatic corps in Taiwan, also sent a letter on behalf of Taiwan's allies to
Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou that same day to express condolences for the
storm victims, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The deputy spokesman said the Foreign Ministry appreciated the U.S. and Japan's
offers to help but indicated that Taiwan would not request foreign assistance at
present because there are sufficient recourses and the disaster relief mechanism
is working well.</P>
      <P>The MOFA will serve as a channel between the Central Disaster Emergency
Operation Center and the international  community to communicate and coordinate
information and related relief needs, and will make an immediate request if
foreign aid is needed,Chang said.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot hovered over Taiwan Aug. 7-8, lashing parts of the country with
massive amounts of rain. It dumped a record 2,500mm of precipitation in Taiwan's
southernmost county of Pingtung, causing severe flooding in at least three
coastal townships.</P>
      <P>As of 10: 30 a.m. Tuesday, the flooding there and elsewhere and widespread
landslides had left 41 people dead, 35 injured and 60 unaccounted for
islandwide.</P>
      <P>Peter Tsai, secretary-general of the MOFA's Association of East Asian Relations,
told the Central News Agency a day earlier that Naohiro Tsutsumi, director-
general of the Taipei Office of the Interchange Association -- the de facto
Japanese embassy in Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic relations -- called him
Aug. 8 on behalf of the Japanese government to express the country's condolences
and offered help if necessary.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry also received  a letter from Japan's representative to
Taiwan, Masaki Saito, who expressed concerns about the serious flooding in
southern part of Taiwan, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>He added  that Tetsuya  Hirose,  secretary-general  of the Japan-based Asia-
Pacific ParliamentariansUnion, which opened its 40th annual conference in Taipei
Aug. 11, also expressed his best wishes to storm victims.</P>
      <P>AIT Press Officer Christopher Kavanagh told CNA Tuesday that the U.S. is looking
at what kind of assistance it could provide.</P>
      <P>We are concerned about the situation. On behalf of the American people, we would
like to convey our deepest sympathy for the victims and their families. The U.S.
is ready to provide assistance, Kavanagh said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan aborigines stage surprise protest at Japanese war shrine</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of indigenous people from Taiwan staged a surprise demonstration at the
Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo Tuesday in a fresh attempt to have the Japanese
government remove the names of their ancestors from the controversial shrine
that honors war dead.</P>
      <P>The group, led by Legislator Kao Chin Shu-mei, walked straight toward the
shrine's  main hall as soon as it arrived  there unexpectedly at 9: 30 a.m. The
protestors chanted slogans and carried banners,  demanding that the Japanese
side "give us back our ancestors' spirits."</P>
      <P>Despite attempts by the shrine's security guards to block the protesters and
seize their banners, the group managed to reach the square in front of the main
hall.</P>
      <P>Using a megaphone, Kao Chin called for the removal of the names of Taiwanese
aborigines who were forced to fight for the Japanese Imperial Army during World
War II and demanded that the Japanese government critically examine, apologize
and make reparation for Japan's war atrocities.</P>
      <P>Unless Japan redresses its wrongdoings, the indigenous people will visit the
shrine every year to demonstrate, she said.</P>
      <P>The demonstrators sang a song to pay their respects to their ancestors, before
ending their 30-minute protest and leaving the site.</P>
      <P>While Kao Chin has organized similar demonstrations over the past several years,
this was the first time that the protesters managed to enter the shrine.</P>
      <P>According to the legislator, in the past the protesters were always barred by
police from approaching the shrine, even though they had obtained permits in
advance from the Japanese police to do so. The police at the shrine would deny
the Taiwanese protestors access, on grounds that they could clash with Japanese
right-wingers who usually  gather  there  once  they  get wind  of the planned
demonstrations, she added.</P>
      <P>The Yasukuni Shrine is dedicated to the 2.5 million soldiers who died fighting
for Japan during World War II. More than 28,000 of them were from Taiwan, which
was under Japan's colonial rule at that time.</P>
      <P>The controversy stems from the fact that the shrine also honors executed
Japanese war criminals who committed atrocities in China, Korea and many other
countries in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin and the Taiwanese protesters, who arrived in Japan Aug. 7, departed
Tuesday afternoon to return to Taiwan.</P>

      <P>According to Kuo, World Vision Taiwan is planning to set up seven daycare
centers in areas devastated by the storm to take some of the burden off the
families.</P>
      <P>The children will receive psychological therapy through play and consultation,
and World Vision Taiwan will also provide tuition aid and books to those in
need, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>The estimated budget for the program is around NT$130 million (US$4 million) and

      <P>Financial losses suffered by Taiwan's aquaculture sector as a result of Typhoon
Morakot had increased to NT$2.91 billion (US$88.72 million) as of Tuesday, the
worst on record for a single typhoon over the past 18 years, according to
statistics released Tuesday by the Council of Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>Fish farms with a combined area of 5,832 hectares were affected by the storm,
with those in Tainan, Pingtung and Kaohsiung counties, as well as Tainan City,
among the hardest-hit, the COA said.</P>
      <P>In Pingtung's Jiadong and Linbian areas, for example, many grouper ponds have
been swamped by severe flooding triggered by the typhoon, allowing the expensive
fish to be washed away by the overflowing water, leaving rotting fish all over
the place when the floodwater began to subside later that day.</P>
      <P>Lin Yi-wei, a local fish farmer, estimated that the typhoon has caused at least
NT$20 million in losses to every fish farm in Jiadong and Linbian.</P>
      <P>Besides aquaculture losses, Typhoon Morakot has also led to crop losses totaling
more than NT$2.78 billion around Taiwan, the COA said.</P>
      <P>The COA statistics show that 49,723 hectares of farmland lost an average 27
percent of expected harvests, with the hardest-hit crops listed as papayas,
guavas, bamboo shoots and leafy vegetables.</P>
      <P>Livestock losses were valued at NT$737.59 million, with 80,815 hogs, 2.7 million
chickens and 709,000 ducks killed, the COA said, adding that forestry losses
were estimated at NT$16.35 million.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Tuesday:
China Times:</P>
      <P>Inaccurate weather forecast and bungled rescue attempts lead to disaster</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot's dumping of nearly 2900 mm of rain on Taiwan in three days --
almost half a year's precipitation -- caught the island off guard.</P>
      <P>The weathermen failed in their duty when they advised the public to be on the
alert against torrential rains, without giving any details of what to expect.</P>
      <P>In addition, inadequate communication between the central and local governments
resulted in a quarrel between the minister of the interior and the magistrate of
Pingdong County over who should be blamed for the government's slow response to
the flood victims' calls for help.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Why did southern Taiwan flood despite the billions spent by the government on
flood prevention?</P>
      <P>The administration of ex-President Chen Shui-bian had earmarked NT$80 billion to
prevent flooding, and that budget was later increased to NT$160 billion.
However, low-lying areas in southern Taiwan were swamped during Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>The first reason why the efforts failed is because the government was busy
building new flood-prevention projects and ignored the maintenance of what was
already in place. The collapse of the levees during the storm is one example.</P>
      <P>The second reason is that the flood-prevention projects were executed by
powerful officials who nonetheless had no relevant expertise, and the experts at
the Water Resources Agency had little say in the drafting of the projects.</P>
      <P>The third reason is that the work on the projects was shoddy, which points to
corruption.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Rescue operation allows no excuses to pass the buck</P>
      <P>The government will lose its raison d'etre if it fails to guarantee the security
of its people and their property.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou is trying to shirk responsibility for the disaster caused
by Typhoon Morakot by first blaming the Central Weather Bureau for failing to
forecast the precipitation brought by the storm.</P>
      <P>Then he told journalists that the rescue operation should be carried out by
local governments with support from the central government.</P>
      <P>Ma's tenure as mayor of Taipei City was marred by natural and man-made disasters
and he is applying his failing Taipei experience to the nation.</P>
      <P>The fact that local cable TV stations have been overwhelmed with calls for help
from flood victims has demonstrated that the people have no faith in Ma's
administration.</P>
      <P>Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>Government fails to do its duty</P>
      <P>Government officials are ascribing blame for the disaster caused by Typhoon
Morakot, as they always do in the event of disasters.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is predisposed to earthquakes and storms owing to its location, and its
government should be accustomed to dealing with such adversity.</P>
      <P>But what we have seen is an administration as naive as a backward African state
in its dealing with the flooding brought by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Its naivety is shown in the fact that the government sat on its hands for almost
seven or eight hours when the scale of the disaster first became apparent, while
the interior minister and the magistrate of Pingdong County blamed each other
for the failure to address the catastrophe.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President instructs centralized operation for relief distribution</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou instructed the mayors and magistrates of 11 cities and
counties in central and northern Taiwan Tuesday that all local government relief
resources for typhoon-devastated areas will be managed by the National Fire
Agency under the Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>While most counties north of Taichung did not suffer as much as southern and
eastern Taiwan from the onslaught of Typhoon Morakot, the governments of these
cities and counties have been coordinating among themselves to provide resources
for people in the south and on the east coast whose livelihoods have been left
in jeopardy by calamitous floods and landslides.</P>
      <P>Ma expects all manpower, relief resources and rescue equipment to be centralized
and properly distributed, according to Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-
chi.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, referring to a proposal for the issuing of an emergency decree, Wang
said the government has no plans to issue such a decree at present, since all
necessary emergency measures have been brought into force in line with the
Disaster Prevention and Rescue Law that was approved in 2000, one year after the
Sept. 21, 1999 earthquake.</P>
      <P>In reply to a suggestion by Legislator Huang Wei-che of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party that the government should adopt special provisions
for reconstruction work in the wake of the flooding, Wang said the government
will dedicate all its efforts toward relief work before addressing plans for
reconstruction.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Control Yuan President Wang Chien-hsuen directed four committees --
interior affairs, national defense and information, finance and economy, and
transportation and procurement -- under the nation's highest watchdog body to
investigate possible negligence by government agencies in relation to the
disaster.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government urged the Taiwan Water Corp. (TWC) Tuesday to fix
within a week the city's water supply problems resulting mainly from high
turbidity levels in water from the Kaoping river diversion weir, which supplies
around 60 percent of the city's water.</P>
      <P>Some 200,000 households in the Kaohsiung area were without water that day, with
the high turbidity caused by heavy rain brought by Typhoon Morakot making the
water unfit for human consumption, prompting the company to cut supplies.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu directed the city's Police Bureau to convert police
vehicles equipped with anti-riot water cannons into water-dispensing vehicles
and asked the Kaohsiung branch of TWC and the Kaohisung Refinery of the Chinese
Petroleum Corp. (CPC) to help set up 30 water supply stations in northern parts
of the city.</P>
      <P>The Chengching reservoir, which also supplies water to the Kaohsiung area, can
at best provide about four days of water to the community if the turbidity
problems cannot be resolved quickly, Chen said.</P>
      <P>She made the remarks during an inspection of the Kaoping weir in neighboring
Kaohsiung County in which she heard a briefing by the Kaohsiung branch of TWC.</P>
      <P>Luang Tung-hsiung, an official of the TWC, said the company was working hard to
repair 12 water pumps inundated by mud and silt, but was facing difficulties.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the city government was collaborating with the water company to seek
other water resources from wells in Shoujinliao in Kaohsiung County, said Liu
Shin-zeng, chief of the city's Economic Development Bureau, who added that the
water supply problems are expected to be resolved in three to seven days.</P>

airborne rescue team that rushed to the site, according to the National Airborne

      <P>The wreckage was located at about 4: 30 p.m., one hour after the crash,  by
another  search and rescue helicopter  on a steep mountainside some 500
kilometers west of an aboriginal settlement that is part of Wutai township.</P>
      <P>The pilot of the rescue helicopter said it was impossible to land or to lift the
wreckage or bodies because of the steepness of the slope.</P>
      <P>"It appears that the three crew members were killed in the accident, " the pilot

      <P>The 49,575 households still without power were mainly located in the southern
counties of Pingtung, Kaohsiung and Chiayi, the company said, adding that
efforts to restore electricity supplies were delayed mainly because floodwater
in some areas of the affected counties had not subsided and roads in mountainous
regions were still impassable.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, statistics compiled by the National Communications Commission (NCC)
show that more than 3,000 mobile phone base stations were damaged by the
typhoon, the highest number on record for a single typhoon over the past 10

      <P>The number of patients infected with the A(H1N1) flu virus in Taiwan might have
surpassed the 10,000 mark after an estimated 6,000 new mild cases were reported
last week, with an epidemic likely as soon as the end of August, Centers for
Disease Control Director-General Kuo Hsu-sung said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has seen a sharp increase in cases of flu-like illness over the past
three weeks, with confirmed flu cases accounting for 21 percent of the total and
cases of A(H1N1) flu accounting for 90 percent of those, according to Kuo.</P>
      <P>The number of patients infected with the new flu virus is expected to register a
further surge in the next two to three weeks, one month ahead of the seasonal
flu peak season, he noted.</P>
      <P>On June 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) upgraded its A(H1N1) alert level
to phase six, which indicates that a global pandemic is underway.</P>
      <P>Although it also said that "the pandemic is moderate in terms of severity with
the majority of patients experiencing only mild symptoms and a full recovery, "
the new strain spreads easily from one person to the next and there is no
vaccine presently available that offers protection, Kuo went on.</P>
      <P>Anyone experiencing flu-like symptoms should immediately seek medical treatment,
Kuo warned.</P>
      <P>The state-sponsored Adimmune Corp., the country's only producer of A(H1N1) flu
vaccine, which won a bid last month to produce 5 million doses of A(H1N1)
vaccine at NT$199 each, will begin mass production of the vaccine once clinical
trials are complete, according to Chen Hui-fang, a CDC official who is part of

    <HEADLINE>Huashan turns to its past to flourish after 921 earthquake</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/12/09  10:24:33</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>When a magnitude 7.3 earthquake rocked central Taiwan on Sept. 21, 1999, the
village of Huashan in Yunlin County's Gukeng Township was initially spared, far
enough away from the quake's epicenter to withstand the blow.</P>
      <P>But in the hours and days that followed, Huashan was battered by a series of
landslides. The earthquake had shaken loose soil and trees on nearby mountain
slopes, and powerful typhoons sent them cascading down into the village and the
surrounding area.</P>
      <P>Roads crumbled and houses, buildings and bridges collapsed under the weight of
the buckling mountains.</P>
      <P>Despite the destruction, Huashan has since pulled itself out of its nightmare to
become a prosperous community, fueled by a crop that had been the town's
trademark decades and even centuries earlier: coffee beans.</P>
      <P>The coffee trade has enabled Huashan to reposition itself as a tourist
destination with its famous Taiwan Coffee Festival, splendid night views and
mountain forest landscapes, beautiful walkways and Koji pottery art.</P>
      <P>With the help of the Yunlin County government and NT$600 million from the Soil
and Water Conservation Bureau, the township also built the country's first
debris flow education garden in Huashan three years after successive disasters.</P>
      <P>The garden, which features natural landscapes and new equipment, such as flood
drainage facilities, is a model for the control and prevention of debris flow,
according to Yunlin County Councilor Hsieh Su-ya, who played an important role
in Huashan's rebirth as head of Gukeng Township between 1998 and 2006.</P>
      <P>The unique showcase not only helps protect the safety of local residents but
also gives provides a boost to the local economy, she said.</P>
      <P>Many of the park's water conservation features, such as sabo dams, slit dams,
and sediment control dams, were environmentally engineered and built with
locally available mud and gravel to prevent flooding, Hsieh explained.</P>
      <P>Though the garden is one of the area's landmarks and has had a positive economic
effect, it's coffee that sparked Huashan's economic revival.</P>
      <P>"The transformation of Gukeng to prosperity did not happen overnight, " Hsieh
said, recalling how hard she tried to create a unique agricultural brand for the
township even before the earthquake hit.</P>
      <P>She considered oranges, bamboo shoots, and tea, but after a meeting in 1998 with
Chang Lai-en, a local coffee farmer in Gukeng's Hebaoshan region and a pioneer
in the coffee business, Hsieh embraced the crop's potential because it evoked
memories of Gukeng as a coffee growing town.</P>
      <P>"Suddenly the answer arrived as though a gift from the gods," she says. "I
realized at that moment that coffee was the best fit for us to go from
traditional farming to recreational agriculture, or agrotourism."</P>
      <P>According to the 50-something Chang, Gukeng was already planting coffee when the
Dutch occupied Taiwan in the 17th century, and because of its high quality, it
was all shipped overseas.</P>
      <P>Hebaoshan, nicknamed 'Coffee Hill,' and the surrounding area used to be covered
by coffee plants, he said.</P>
      <P>The golden age of Taiwan's coffee industry started in 1902, when the colonial
Japanese government decided to develop this lucrative crop, mainly in Gukeng,
which had suitable soil and a subtropical climate.</P>
      <P>Though Hsieh had taken to the idea of coffee in 1998, little was done until the
township was shaken by the earthquake and subsequent landslides.</P>
      <P>Farmers were encouraged by the local government to plant coffee to protect the
topsoil, according to coffee grower Chung Chiu, who previously grew bamboo
shoots.</P>
      <P>"So we switched to coffee growing, " Chung said. "Coffee was our best hope to
pull us together after the disasters."</P>
      <P>It wasn't until four years later, however, that the community really made a name
for itself when Hsieh launched the "Taiwan Coffee Festival" at a cost of NT$3
million.</P>
      <P>Aside from raising the visibility of the rural township and putting a spotlight
on the coffee industry, the event also generated NT$200 million for the local
economy. Revenue from the festival soared the next two years to about NT$400
million and NT$1 billion, respectively.</P>
      <P>Building on the success of the festival, the Gukeng Farmers' Association
inaugurated a recreational agricultural center in October 2003, designed to hold
training sessions on making coffee and special exhibitions, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Another draw, the Literature Walkway, a brainchild of writer Ku Meng-jen, was
inaugurated in 2004 when Ku was chief of the Yunlin County Cultural Affairs
Department. A year later, Ku launched the Huashan Poet Festival.</P>
      <P>The walkway stretches a distance of more than 600 meters and matches works of
famous writers set in Yunlin County with the beautiful surrounding landscape.</P>
      <P>The combination of nature and literature, along with the lure of locally grown
coffee, attracted an estimated 1 million tourists a year to the mountain village
of 35,000 inhabitants for much of the decade -- and the commercial impact is
clearly evident.</P>
      <P>More than 100 coffee shops and homestays have been set up in the greater Huashan
region, earning a good share of the hundreds of millions of Taiwan dollars from
tourists that pour into the area annually.</P>
      <P>"Our business is booming, with a good influx of visitors who come to Huashan
just to enjoy a cup of coffee, " said Lai Song-chi, a coffee shop operator who
settled down in Huashan after the 921 earthquake.</P>
      <P>Huashan's economic prosperity, however, has not been immune to the country's
economic slump, as tourist numbers have plummeted within the past year.</P>
      <P>Hsieh says the region must find innovative ways to revitalize itself again,
such as improving  coffee growing and roasting techniques, integrating
sightseeing resources, developing regional agricultural products and tour
itineraries, and improving the quality of tourist attractions.</P>
      <P>But is hard to believe that any of those measures will live up to the tremendous
boost the humble coffee bean gave to Huashan in pulling it out of its nightmare
after the earthquake in 1999.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Floods and landslides triggered by Morakot leave Taiwan in tears</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 12 (CNA)
08/12/09  11:37:30
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The calamitous floods and landslides precipitated by Typhoon Morakot have left
at least 62 people dead and dozens missing and caused at least NT$7 billion in
agricultural losses as of Tuesday evening.</P>
      <P>As the casualties and losses pile up after again being struck by nature, Taiwan
weeps and wonders what the future holds.</P>
      <P>Mud flows that buried a whole village in southern Taiwan, and floods that washed
away dozens of houses on the east coast were natural phenomena that people on an
island of extreme rainfall intensity, steep river slopes and brittle shaley
hills inevitably face.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the calamity, Fan Liang-hsiu, vice chairman of the National
Disaster Prevention and Protection Commission, suggested Tuesday that villagers
whose homes were destroyed by the mudflows over the weekend should be relocated
because mudslides in mountainous areas very often reoccurred in the same spots
in torrential rains.</P>
      <P>But most villagers, he said, refuse to leave the land they have lived on for
years, or even generations.</P>
      <P>In the past, the government has worked out plans for 26 mountain villages to be
relocated, but only two -- one in Taichung County and the other in Pingtung
County -- were moved to locations which are much safer in times of heavy
rainfall.</P>
      <P>The rest continue to brave areas that are most vulnerable to nature's powerful
forces, and they may face even more destructive mud and debris flows in the
future during typhoons as climate change renders the weather even more
unpredictable -- and volatile.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the Water Resources Agency under the Ministry  of
Economic  Affairs  indicate  that average  annual precipitation in Taiwan is
2,500 mm, but up to 80 percent of that comes between May and October, during the
summer typhoon season in particular.</P>
      <P>This uneven rainfall distribution was particularly evident last week, which
started with Taiwan wrestling over how to ration water amid a worsening  drought
and ended with a year's volume of precipitation pelting southern areas in three
days, triggering the worst flooding the country had seen in 50 years.</P>
      <P>As Typhoon Morakot hovered near and over Taiwan, it brought more than 2,000 mm
of rainfall to Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties between Aug. 6-8.</P>
      <P>In the southeastern county of Taitung, over 1,600 mm in rainfall in the
mountains triggered serious mudslides. Debris flows and rapids turned the rivers
into rampaging forces that swept away anything in their path.</P>
      <P>That led to a number of shocking scenes televised around the world, such as the
dramatic collapse of the Chin Shuai Hotel in the hot spring resort of Jhihben on
Aug. 9, after the floodwaters eroded the river bank on which it stood.</P>
      <P>While there is sure to be plenty of finger-pointing during the post-disaster
period, former Water Resources Agency director Huang Ching-san said that human
efforts to control water flows could be in vain when facing the extreme amount
of rainfall seen in recent days.</P>
      <P>He suggested that while the government has invested heavily in regulating rivers
and channeling water to prevent floods, equally important  tasks will be to
avoid reckless  land development, especially in mountainous areas, and reinforce
soil and water conservation efforts.</P>

      <P>These villages include Jiamu, Dawu, Ali, and Yila in Wutai Township as well as
Dewun Village in Sandimen Township.</P>
      <P>All six villages in Wutai Township have been cut off because all bridges and
roads linking the mountainous villages with the outside world have been severely
damaged.</P>
      <P>Most of the villages are accessible only by single mountain roads that often
cross or follow riverbeds. The roads and connecting bridges have buckled under
the pressure of floodwaters precipitated by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Wutai township has a total population of 600. More than half of them will be
evacuated by helicopters by Wednesday, according to the county's government.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) maintained its heavy rain warning
for southern Taiwan Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The bureau said that mountainous areas in central and northern Taiwan could also
be hit by more torrential rains.</P>
      <P>The CWB also warned that residents in mountain areas should be on the alert for
falling rocks, mudslides and landslides.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Satellite images released Tuesday demonstrated just how powerful the floods and
mudslides unleashed by Typhoon Morakot were as they devastated much of southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>One of the most stunning images obtained by the Center for Space and Remote
Sensing Research (CSRSR) under National Central University was the explosive
expansion of the Taimali River in Taitung.</P>
      <P>The images showed that the upper stream of the river, which originally was
barely more than 10 meters wide, spread to more than 800 meters as large amounts
of mud were washed down the mountain by heavy rainfall.</P>
      <P>Chang Chung-pai, an associate professor at the center, said the mudslides
observed in this typhoon have been the largest on record both in terms of length
and scale.</P>
      <P>"Mudflows that we observed in the past usually filled about 10 kilometers of the
river. But the entire Taimali River was filled with mudflows in this typhoon, "
he said of the 31-kilometer long river.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, both the toppled Chinshuai Hotel in Taitung's Jhihben
hotspring area and the collapsed Shuangyuan Bridge in Kaohsiung County were
located on the outer edge of a river bend, where the water's momentum and
erosive potential are the strongest.</P>
      <P>Comparing the bridge's satellite images taken Jan. 14 and Aug. 11, the CSRSR
found that the bridge broke up over the west side of Gaoping River, the point
where the water was deeper and flow rate was faster.</P>
      <P>Torrential rainfall from Typhoon Morakot, which battered Taiwan over the
weekend, triggered the worst flooding in 50 years, leaving at least 62 dead, 35
injured and 57 unaccounted for, according to the Central Emergency Operation
Center. Also, many became homeless when their homes were buried by mudslides.</P>

      <P>Medical workers have finally entered flood- and landslide-ravaged villages in
remote mountainous areas of southern Taiwan to offer emergency medical services,
medical sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Medical staff from Kaohsiung's Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and I-Shou
University Hospital were airlifted to Kaohsiung County's Namasia Village Tuesday
afternoon to man an emergency health care station, the sources said.</P>
      <P>The station housed at the Presbyterian Church in the village has extended first-
aid treatment for injured villagers rescued from homes buried by mudslides, the
sources said, adding that some ailing villagers  were also given emergency
treatment  before  being transferred to referral hospitals.</P>
      <P>An I-Shou spokesman said the hospital has also sent physicians and surgeons to
the Department of Health-run Cishan Hospital in nearby Cishan township to
provide care to newly rescued villagers.</P>
      <P>A number of mountainous villages in Kaohsiung County, including Siaolin,
Taoyuan, Maolin, Namasia, Jiasian and part of Liouguei were cut off from the
oustide world after Typhoon Morakot delivered staggering amounts of rainfall to
southern Taiwan Aug. 7-9.</P>
      <P>Most of the towns are accessible only by single mountain roads that often cross
or run parallel to rivers. Unable to withstand the pressure of rampaging waters,
the roads and bridges buckled under the pressure, hampering rescue efforts.</P>
      <P>Medical professionals managed to enter the devastated villages by helicopter
only after continuing downpours subsided Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang Gung Hospital said a team of its medical staff was airlifted to Jiasian
from Cishan Junior High School in neighboring Cishan township Wednesday morning
to set up an emergency medical station to serve rescued villagers. Hundreds of
residents have been trapped in Jiasian since Aug. 7.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  a villager  from Namasia  Village urged health authorities to step
up disinfection operations because a foul smell is permeating his hometown.</P>
      <P>"I am afraid that if we delay disinfection efforts, epidemics may break out, a
situation that would aggravate our current woes, " said Lin Nan-chi, who was
resuced late Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung County-based Fo Guang Shan Monastery has also sent medical service
vehicles to the stricken southern counties of Chiayi, Pingtung, Kaohsiung and
Tainan to offer health care and mental counseling for traumatized flood victims,
a spokesman for one of Taiwan's most famous Buddhist organizations said.</P>
      <P>As of Tuesday, the typhoon had left 62 people dead, 35 injured and 57
unaccounted for, according to statistics released by the Central Emergency
Operation Center.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials
Wednesday:</P>
      <P>UNITED DAILY NEWS:</P>
      <P>Is it preposterous to evacuate 50,000 residents?</P>
      <P>After Typhoon Morakot brought unexpected precipitation last weekend, and several
villages in southern Taiwan were "buried" by mudslides, a much-blamed county
chief blurted out that to evacuate up to 50,000 residents is a daunting task.</P>
      <P>The official even asked what official would dare to order an all-out evacuation
when a forecast called for 1,000 mm of rainfall.</P>
      <P>But as the death tolls continue to rise, would the magistrate still think it
absurd to evacuate 50,000 villagers and mitigate the disaster?</P>
      <P>As a local chief, the magistrate should know the vulnerability of the county's
soil and water conservation and has more authority and responsibility for risk
assessment.</P>
      <P>The mindset of officials should change, especially at a time when climate change
in recent years has become unpredictable and "extreme" phenomena can happen.</P>
      <P>LIBERTY TIMES:</P>
      <P>President Ma, please show more concern for this land</P>
      <P>The devastation caused by Typhoon Morakot has exposed the fallacy of the Ma
administration's guiding principle.</P>
      <P>His principle, in a nutshell, is "cross-strait relations is paramount and
supersedes all else."</P>
      <P>President Ma has been keen on the so-called 1992 consensus, the resumption of
cross-strait talks and has even hinged Taiwan's economic development to China,
despite it being a sugar-coated toxin.</P>
      <P>With his mind set on China, it is natural that he would ignore this land. Last
year's Typhoon Kalmaegi already gave sufficient warning to Ma that the island's
infrastructure  is miserably inadequate.</P>
      <P>But regrettably, Ma's only concern is China. He has no regard for his land and
its people so that the tragedies of bridges collapsing, rivers overflowing, and
foundations eroding have been repeated again and again.</P>
      <P>APPLE DAILY:</P>
      <P>North-South perception gap in government rescue operations</P>
      <P>The slow or even obtuse response by the Ma administration to Typhoon Morakot is
related to the administration being located in Taipei and its Taipei-oriented
perception.</P>
      <P>It had no empathy for the serious flooding in southern Taiwan as northern Taiwan
only experienced relatively mild rains when the typhoon battered Taiwan over the
weekend.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is not diverse geographically, and the differences in northern and
southern Taiwan lie mainly in other areas, such as fashion, language and their
reactions to situations.</P>
      <P>The consciousness  gap has regrettably  widened  with each election's political
maneuvering.</P>
      <P>Taipei, as the capital of Taiwan, s the power center, which has given rise to
its cultural supremacy and the phenomenon of slighting people in southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But Taiwan is small, and whether people live in southern or northern Taiwan,
they have identical memories. Their differences have been augmented by political
factors, which are hidden at a subconscious level until exposed at critical
moments.</P>
      <P>Taiwan needs to think deeply about this hidden bias so as to forge a national
consensus that we are all in the same boat.</P>
      <P>CHINA TIMES:</P>
      <P>Face China and you can get hold of the world</P>
      <P>Want Daily, the first Taiwanese daily devoted to China news, was launched
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The emergence of China is a fact that one can no longer ignore, and the birth of
the daily reflects the new trend: know China and you can get hold of the world.</P>
      <P>According to a Want Daily public opinion poll, 57 percent of local people think
China is important to Taiwan's future development, but only 28 percent said they
know China, and up to 72 percent said they have insufficient knowledge of it.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait exchanges over the past two decades have not been enough to close
the gap in cross-strait political, cultural and social aspects created by four
decades of isolation between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Taiwan needs to face China and learn about it again. We have to face what we may
be unwilling to admit. China has really undergone change. Taiwan cannot be
complacent about what it has achieved over the past six decades and continue to
ignore it.</P>

      <P>Rescuers have recovered the bodies of three crew members who were killed a day
earlier when their helicopter crashed in mountainous Wutai Township in Pingtung
County, the Central Emergency Operation Center said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The bodies were first removed from a mountain slope, where they were found, to a
valley before being airlifted to the National Nei-Pu Senior Agricultural-
Industrial Vocational High School, according to National Fire Agency Director-
General Huang Chi-min.</P>
      <P>Huang said the victims showed no signs of life when they were discovered by an
airborne rescue team Tuesday afternoon soon after the accident. The team did not
airlift the bodies out of the area at that time because it was getting dark, he
added.</P>
      <P>The UH-1H helicopter belonging to the National Airborne Service Corps hit a
mountainside and crashed into a valley near the aboriginal settlement of
Sandimen at 3:30 p.m. Tuesday while carrying out a mission to help victims of
natural disasters triggered by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Following the accident, the corps grounded all UH-1H helicopters for inspection.</P>

      <P>Users of PTT, a terminal-based bulletin board system (BBS) based in Taiwan, have
launched a fund raising drive that has already provided relief supplies such as
food and clean water for people living in areas hard-hit by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>PTT, the largest BBS in the country with more than 1.5 million registered users,
said it will request more help from its users and coordinate its relief efforts
with local charity organizations such as World Vision and the Tzu Chi
Foundation.</P>
      <P>"We raised more than NT$100,000 (US$3,041) in one hour and purchased relief
supplies online," said Liao Chi-cheng, the initiator of the "PTT users disaster

      <P>Liao added that relief supplies, including food, water, rain shoes, sleeping
bags and bleach, have been delivered to Pingtung County by online suppliers and
will be distributed by World Vision.</P>
      <P>"When those online suppliers realized the orders were for typhoon victims, they
also made donations immediately, " Liao said.</P>
      <P>Some PTT users in Kaohsiung are cooperating with Tzu Chi and the Kaohsiung

      <P>A group of northern Taiwan-based politicians and medical professionals formed an
alliance Wednesday to pool resources to help flood-  and mudslide-ravaged
aboriginal villages in southern Taiwan get back on track.</P>
      <P>"As many people in Taipei City are anxious to extend a helping hand, the
alliance decided to take direct action and adopt hard-hit aboriginal villages in
southern Taiwan, " said Lee Shin, a ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Taipei City
councilor.</P>
      <P>The "88 Taiwan Warmth Delivery Alliance" will enlist physicians, nurses,
pharmacists and social workers to enter the most severely impacted villages in
mountainous areas of southern Taiwan, most of which are home to indigenuous
tribal people, Lee said at a news conference held at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>"If all goes smoothly, our medical relief workers will set off before this
coming Sunday to undertake post-disaster rehabilitation operations in affected
zones," Lee said.</P>
      <P>He also urged more like-minded people to join the alliance and make donations to
sponsor rehabilitation projects in devastated aboriginal villages.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Hou Chin-chu, head of Shihzih Township in the
southernmost county of Pingtung, said floods and landslides triggered by Typhoon
Morakot had hurt the county's aboriginal communities far more than has been
reported in the media.</P>
      <P>"Many villages, such as Wutai, Sandimen, Majia, Taiwu and Laiyi, have all been
isolated after extremely heavy rainfall delivered by Morakot knocked out roads
and bridges connecting them to the outside world, " Hou said.</P>
      <P>He added that many village residents believed to be trapped were in desperate
need of help.</P>
      <P>Huang Sung-hsiung, a physician from the New Taiwanese Cultural Foundation who is
also a member of the "88 Alliance, " said the alliance will organize teams of
doctors, nurses, pharmacists and public health experts to visit disaster areas
in southern Taiwan later this week.</P>
      <P>They will offer survivors professional medical services and mental counseling as
well as help with the environmental cleanup to prevent outbreaks of communicable
diseases.</P>
      <P>Another alliance member, KMT Legislator Lo Shu-lei, said the disaster zones now
need not only instant noodles but also detergents and medical supplies, such as
surgical masks.</P>
      <P>"The alliance has sent 2,000 masks to Kaohsiung County to meet the demand, "
said Lo, who also urged others to join the new alliance to assist in post-
disaster rehabilitation operations.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for Althea Medical Resources Integrated Service said the company has
decided to join the alliance and help in getting medical aid to flood survivors.</P>
      <P>"We will dispatch well-equipped medical vehicles to assist medical personnel
sent to disaster zones by government authorities in providing medical attention
to flood victims," said the spokesman.</P>

      <P>The Taipei-based American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) donated US$250,000 Wednesday
to the stricken families in areas devastated by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>"The people of the United States of America have been moved by the humanitarian
tragedy in Taiwan caused by Typhoon Morakot. On behalf of the American people,
AIT would like to convey its deepest sympathy for the victims and their
families," the AIT said in a press release.</P>
      <P>"At the same time, we are struck by the courage, determination and unity of
purpose of the Taiwan people in responding to this crisis," it added.</P>
      <P>In support of the response to the disaster, the AIT donated the money to the Red
Cross Society of the Republic of China. The money, provided by the U.S. Agency
for International Development, will be used to provide immediate assistance to
households affected by the typhoon, according to the AIT, which serves as the de
facto U.S. embassy in Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>"We are confident the Red Cross will use our contribution in the most efficient
and effective manner possible to alleviate the suffering and hardship of the
typhoon victims," the AIT said.</P>
      <P>The United States and the AIT have supported the humanitarian work of Taiwan's
Red Cross in previous natural disasters, according to the U.S. agency, adding
that it deeply appreciates the assistance Taiwan has provided for victims of
natural disasters in the United States, including during Hurricane Katrina in
2005.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot hovered over Taiwan Aug. 7-8, lashing parts of the country with
massive amounts of rain. It dumped a record 2,500mm of precipitation in Taiwan's
southernmost county of Pingtung, causing severe flooding in at least three
coastal townships.</P>
      <P>As of 12: 00 p.m. Wednesday, the flooding there and elsewhere, along with
widespread landslides, had left 67 people dead, 45 injured and 61 unaccounted
for. The casualties included three rescuers who were killed a day earlier  when
their helicopter  crashed in mountainous Wutai township in Pingtung County.</P>

      <P>Charity organizations have begun to help clean up areas that suffered  major
damage from flooding and landslides triggered by Typhoon Morakot over the
weekend.</P>
      <P>Leading the way are the Dharma Drum Mountain Social Welfare and Charity
Foundation (DDMSWCF) , the Tzu Chi Foundation and the Eden Social Welfare
Foundation (ESWF).</P>
      <P>On Tuesday they organized volunteer teams to help clean up typhoon stricken
areas as floodwaters began to recede.</P>
      <P>The DDMSWCF, a Buddhist charity foundation, has targeted its cleanup efforts at
the coastal towns of Linbian and Jiadong in Pingtung County. Groups of eight
volunteers were led at dawn by masters from Dharma Drum Monastery in cleaning
debris and shattered houses in the areas.</P>
      <P>In addition, volunteers, who made their way to disaster areas at their own
expense, also formed investigation teams to survey the area and learn more about
the needs of local residents.</P>
      <P>The foundation said that by clearing the typhoon wreckage, it was also clearing
the minds of the disaster victims and helping lift away their heavy spirits
caused by the natural disaster.</P>
      <P>The Tzu Chi Foundation, another Buddhist charity organization, appealed to
volunteers to join their local Tzu Chi cleanup team and said residents in
Tainan, Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties can sign up at the foundation's
meditation halls.</P>
      <P>The Eden Social Welfare Foundation said it has been deploying professional
volunteers to disaster areas since the typhoon hit to provide counseling and
prepare the victims to rebuild their homes.</P>
      <P>It will also organize groups to engage in cleanup operations.</P>
      <P>The charity foundations have also engaged in other relief efforts. The DDMSWCF
began sending drinking water, sleeping bags, lunch boxes and flashlights to
shelters on Aug. 8, the day after the storm dropped much of its rain on Taiwan,
benefiting 15,000 people.</P>
      <P>The Tzu Chi Foundation recruited 15,000 volunteers who have passed out over
200,000 hot lunches through Tuesday to disaster victims. It also plans to dole
out grants ranging from NT$5,000 to NT$10,000 to help 12,000 victimized
households.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot hovered over Taiwan Aug. 7-8, lashing parts of the country with
powerful winds and torrential rains. The storm dumped a record 2,500 mm of rain
on Pingtung County, causing severe flooding in at least three coastal townships.</P>
      <P>As of 11 a.m Wednesday, flooding and landslides triggered by the typhoon had
left 67 people dead, 45 injured and 61 missing.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou inspected Jiadong and Linbian townships in Pingtung
County Wednesday, both of which are in one of the hardest-hit regions after
Typhoon Morakot swept southern Taiwan over the weekend.</P>
      <P>Ma instructed officials accompanying him to do their utmost to help with the
county's recovery work and promised that the government will help the victims
rebuild their homes and allow them to get back to their normal lives.</P>
      <P>He also instructed that sick and elderly people, as well as women and children,
should be evacuated from danger areas first.</P>
      <P>In Jiadong township, which relies heavily on grouper aquaculture, Ma and his
entourage were intercepted by a group of local residents who appealed for help.
The president listened to several villagers emotionally decrying their losses
and gave his assurance that the government will assist all the typhoon victims.</P>
      <P>He also ordered the military, local governments and central government agencies,
including the Council of Agriculture, to fully cooperate in rescue and
reconstruction tasks.</P>
      <P>Pingtung Magistrate Chao Chi-hung and Vice Secretary-General to the President
Lai Feng-wei accompanied Ma on his tour, braving the stench of the thousands of
rotten fish that had been washed from the area's fishponds into the flooded
streets.</P>
      <P>Chao said the top priority was to clean up the dead fish to prevent disease and
he called for heavy machinery to pump the floodwater out of local townships.</P>
      <P>Later that same day, the president proceeded to neighboring Kaohsiung County,
which was also severely damaged by mudslides caused by the extreme precipitation
brought by Morakot.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by military generals and Kaohsiung Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing on a
tour of Cishan Junior High School, which was being used as an emergency staging
post for victims evacuated from nearby mountain townships, Ma said rescue
helicopters would be mobilized to rescue other villagers still stranded in the
mountains and added that the military will deliver relief materials to them in
the meantime.</P>
      <P>He added that the government will mandate forced evacuation if some of them are
unwilling to leave their homes.</P>
      <P>He also pledged that the government will take full responsibility for the
victims' accommodation and medical treatment once they are transported to safety
and that the government will provide subsidies for their property and
agricultural losses.</P>
      <P>According to the latest government statistics, 67 people had been killed,
including three crew members of a helicopter that crashed while on a relief
mission in Wutai township in Pingtung County, with 61 missing and 45 injured in
the wake of Typhoon Morakot -- the worst to hit southern Taiwan in 50 years.</P>
      <P>Nearly 100 bridges in central and southern Taiwan damaged by Morakot remained
closed as of Wednesday noon, with no expectation that traffic would be resumed
any time soon, the Directorate-General of Highways reported.</P>

      <P>The principal of a Pingtung County elementary school said Wednesday that first
lady Chow Mei-ching has been keeping a low-profile eye on the school following
Typhoon Morakot, e-mailing the school every day to show her concern.</P>
      <P>Wu Li-hua, principal of the Taiwu Elementary School, told CNA that Chow always
e-mails whenever a natural catastrophe occurs.</P>
      <P>The school was severely damaged by Morakot, which drew Chow's attention, Wu
said.</P>
      <P>Wu said Chow e-mailed her every day even before the typhoon hit, and was very
concerned about the school's graduates who attend junior high school in
neighboring Laiyi township, which was also hit hard by the typhoon, offering to
help obtain assistance for them, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Chow first visited the school in 2008 when she made a trip to the remote
indigenous Taiwu township with two university professors to inspect local
education facilities. During the trip, Chow promised to help raise NT$160,000 to
finance a summer lunch program for students there.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile that day, the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China, of which
Chow is honorary chairwoman, said the organization was studying the possibility

      <P>Agricultural and fishery losses from Typhoon Morakot, which hit Taiwan directly
last weekend, had reached an estimated NT$7.8 billion (US$237 million) as of
Wednesday, according to the latest government statistics.</P>
      <P>Figures complied by the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) showed that
the storm damage estimate was the second-highest in the 18 years since the COA
started to keep such records.</P>
      <P>The worst agricultural disaster was caused by Typhoon Herbert in August 1996
when NT$18.08 billion in agricultural losses were recorded, according to the
COA.</P>
      <P>The statistics showed that damage to crops amounted to nearly NT$3.17 billion,
with 27 percent of the crops on 55,050 hectares of farmland lost.</P>
      <P>Bananas suffered the heaviest damage, with 5,605 hectares ravaged by strong
winds and flooding, followed by papayas, guavas, sweetsops,rice, bamboo shoots

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 1,000 residents of flood- and mudslide-ravaged villages in mountainous
areas of southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung County were still awaiting evacuation
Wednesday, according to military authorities.</P>
      <P>"Army rescue teams who managed to reach isolated mountainous villages in
Kaohsiung County had located nearly 1,000 villagers as of Wednesday morning,"
said Maj. Gen. Hu Jui-chou, the political warfare chief of the 8th Army Corps.</P>
      <P>"I received a satellite phone call from one of our rescue teams Tuesday night
saying that more than 500 residents from Namasia township's Minchuan and Mintsu
villages, and 200 each from Taoyuan township's Chinho village and Jiasian
township's Siaolin village had been found, " Hu said at a news conference held
at an army base in neighboring Pingtung County.</P>
      <P>"The following morning, 70 more residents were also located in Wulipu, near
Siaolin," Hu went on.</P>
      <P>"All of the rescued villagers are safe and do not face any life-threatening
dangers," Hu continued, adding that military rescue teams had provided them with
ready-to-serve rations and drinking water.</P>
      <P>The military had also assigned 18 UH-1H choppers, two CH-47SD and five B-234
transport helicopters to evacuate the disaster victims from their mudslide-
devastated hometowns, Hu said.</P>
      <P>"So long as weather permits, the military aircraft will fly up to 136 sorties
today to evacuate all stranded typhoon victims, " Hu added.</P>
      <P>Wednesday's  rescue efforts were centered  around Kaohsiung County's Jiasian,
Taoyuan, Maolin, Namasia and Liouguei townships, all of which were cut off by
Typhoon Morakot-triggered devastation Aug. 7-9.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Maj. Tsai Tsung-you, one of the leading officers
in the previous day's mountain rescue operations, said the Chinho village chief
was picking wild edible plants when he spotted the arriving military rescue
party.</P>
      <P>According  to  Tsai,  the  chief  was  surprised  by  the earlier-than-expected
arrival of rescue personnel.</P>
      <P>"Given the massive scale of the devastation, the village chief said he
originally guessed that it would take at least a week or more for rescue teams
to arrive," said Tsai.</P>
      <P>The chief further said that he evacuated all of the Chinho residents to the
village's activity center when Typhoon Morakot struck Aug. 8</P>
      <P>"This timely evacuation helped save the lives of all the villagers," Tsai noted.</P>
      <P>Maj. Tang Teng-kai, who led a rescue team into Siaolin, another typhoon-battered
village, said more than 200 villagers there were evacuated to an elevated hut
inhabited by nearby construction workers before the onslaught of the typhoon.</P>
      <P>The Siaolin villagers had become a focus of media attention over the previous
two days, as some survivors who left the village earlier told the media that
they were afraid many of their neighbors might have been buried alive by
mudslides triggered by Morakot-induced torrential rain.</P>
      <P>The typhoon delivered staggering amounts of rainfall to southern Taiwan Aug.
7-9,  taking out roads and bridges connecting many mountainous villages in the
region with the outside world, leaving many villagers trapped and hampering
rescue efforts.</P>
      <P>The storm had left 67 people dead, 61 missing and 45 injured as of noon
Wednesday, according to statistics released that day by the Central Emergency
Operation Center.</P>

      <P>The United States is standing by to offer assistance such as equipment and
technology to help the stricken families in areas devastated by Typhoon Morakot
over the weekend, the acting director of the Taipei-based American Institute in
Taiwan (AIT) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Robert Wang made the remarks at a donation ceremony in which the U.S. government
offered US$250,000 dollars to Republic of China Red Cross Society Secretary-
General Steven Chen in support of the response to the natural disaster.</P>
      <P>The money,  provided by the U.S. Agency for International Development,  will be
used to provide immediate assistance to households affected by the typhoon,
according to Wang.</P>
      <P>"We are so touched by the relief efforts by the public and the government and
admire very much the courage of all the rescuers. Therefore, the United States
decided to make a quick response to disaster relief efforts by making this small
contribution in the hope that it will help the victims," Wang said.</P>
      <P>The AIT, which serves as the de facto U.S. embassy in Taiwan in the absence of
formal diplomatic relations, also contacted various government agencies in
Taiwan, including the National Security Council and the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA), and expressed its willingness to provide more assistance if
necessary, according to Wang.</P>
      <P>"We will do our best to help if the Taiwanese authorities have any needs, which
can be made to the AIT directly," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Red Cross appreciated the AIT donation and will make best use of
the money to help the victims.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Henry Chen said earlier in the day that the Foreign Ministry
appreciates the support and concern expressed by the international community but
indicated that Taiwan will not request foreign assistance at present because so
far, the country is capable of handling the disaster relief work on its own.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot hovered over Taiwan Aug. 7-8, lashing parts of the country with
massive amounts of rain. It dumped a record 2,500mm of precipitation in Taiwan's
southernmost county of Pingtung, causing severe flooding in at least three
coastal townships.</P>
      <P>As of 12: 00 p.m. Wednesday, the flooding there and elsewhere, along with
widespread landslides, had left 67 people dead, 45 injured and 61 unaccounted
for islandwide. The casualties included three rescuers who were killed a day
earlier when their helicopter crashed in mountainous Wutai township in Pingtung
County.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Tzu Chi Foundation, a Buddhist charity, said Wednesday it is planning to
build 95 prefabricated housing units in Taitung, eastern Taiwan, for victims of
Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>According to Tzu Chi, 95 residents in Taitung's Taimali and Jinfeng village have
been rendered homeless by the typhoon, which scored a direct hit on Taiwan last
weekend.</P>
      <P>The charity promised to erect 95 prefab units, using a similar approach as after
the 921 earthquake in 1999, to house the homeless families by the end of August.</P>
      <P>Tzu Chi said it has already conferred with the Taitung County Government on the
plan and has begun to scout for suitable sites. Other locations for the erection
of more emergency prefab houses are still being considered, as landownership
issues are involved, it said.</P>
      <P>As the scope of the damage from Typhoon Morakot gradually emerged, the Tzu Chi
Foundation outlined a three-phase emergency relief plan, with the building of
prefab houses being phase one.</P>
      <P>The next two stages will be rehabilitation of the disaster victims, and
psychotherapy under a "Project Hope" plan, it said.</P>
      <P>Tzu Chi has been actively involved in international disaster relief work since
1991.</P>
      <P>In related news, Chunghwa Telecom reported Wednesday that it had restored 40,000
telephone lines knocked out by the storm and still had 69,000 more to go.</P>
      <P>The damage to phone lines was mostly scattered across central and southern
Taiwan, it said.</P>
      <P>In Linbian township in Pingtung County, the most severely affected area, 21 free
temporary telephones have been installed and the base stations there have been
repaired, the company said.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot hovered over Taiwan Aug. 7-8, lashing parts of the country with

      <P>A private senior high school in eastern Taiwan's Hualien County announced a six-
day closure Wednesday after seven of its students were confirmed to have come
down with swine flu, officially known as influenza A(H1N1).</P>
      <P>A spokesman for Stella Maris Ursuline High School in Sincheng township said 23
of its students had shown flu-like symptoms since the school began its summer
study program Aug. 6</P>
      <P>The school reported the situation  to the county's health department out of
concern that it might have fallen victim to a swine flu cluster infection, the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Follow-up laboratory tests confirmed that seven of the students had indeed
contracted A(H1N1) , the spokesman said, adding that all the students had
already been discharged  from hospital after recovering.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, we decided to suspend school from today through Aug. 17 for
environmental disinfection and cleanup, " said the spokesman.</P>
      <P>Lin Nan-yueh, director of the Hualien County Health Bureau, said all seven
students  were mild cases and did not need to be quarantined.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has seen a sharp increase in cases of flu-like illness over the past
three weeks, with confirmed flu cases accounting for 21 percent of the total and
cases of A(H1N1) flu accounting for 90 percent of those, an official of the
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The number of patients infected with the A(H1N1) virus in Taiwan might have
surpassed the 10,000 mark after an estimated 6,000 new mild cases were reported
last week, with an epidemic likely as soon as the end of August," said CDC
Director-General Kuo Hsu-sung.</P>
      <P>According to Kuo, the number of patients infected with the new flu virus might
register a further surge in the next two to three weeks, one month ahead of the
seasonal flu peak season.</P>

      <P>The workers' union of Nan Shan Life, the Taiwanese unit of the American
International Group (AIG) which is facing auction, demanded Wednesday that the
company guarantee job security for its nearly 40,000 employees in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Nan Shan Life is open to bidding until Aug. 28, when AIG will close the bid and
announce the new owner of the life insurance company, which has an extensive
network of 35,000 agents serving 4 million policy holders in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Nan Shan workers' union adopted a series of resolutions in a meeting
Wednesday, including one to seek assistance from the Council of Labor Affairs
and the Financial Supervisory Commission to ensure the job security of Nan Shan
employees and to secure their pension fund.</P>
      <P>A union source said that the pension fund, amounting to NT$14 billion (US$437
million), should not be counted as part of the company's assets.</P>
      <P>The union, which is planning to hold a public hearing to discuss employees'
rights and welfare, said it is awaiting responses to its requests from the
company and relevant government agencies, and it will not rule out the
possibility of taking to the streets if it does not receive favorable responses.</P>
      <P>Since AIG's financial crisis was exposed last October, reports regarding the
company's plan to auction its overseas businesses have worried Nan Shan's
employees as well as policy holders.</P>
      <P>The company revealed the auction plan in July and several international private
equity funds are reportedly teaming up with financial holding companies in
Taiwan to make the bid.</P>
      <P>As of May 2009, Nan Shan's total assets amounted to NT$1.5 trillion, and the
policies in force totaled 7.94 million, according to company statistics.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) announced Wednesday that it is recruiting 10,000
college and university students to join a campaign to clean up and rebuild
schools and babysit children in areas devastated by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Education Lu Mu-lin made the announcement following an
emergency ministry meeting.</P>
      <P>The MOE plans to recruit 100 students from each college and university to help
with the rehabilitation of typhoon-hit schools in central and southern Taiwan
and the care of elementary school students prior to the start of the new
semester in late August or early September, Lu said.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the ministry also hopes that the experience will help to
foster social responsibility among college students, he explained.</P>
      <P>Lu urged the public to donate relief supplies such as water containers, cooking
appliances and computers to schools in areas of south and central Taiwan
devastated by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the MOE, Lu said that 1,211 schools, including
1,048 elementary and junior high schools, had reported damage estimated at
NT$1.1 billion (US$33.54 million) as of Wednesday afternoon.</P>

      <P>Individual and corporate donors from home and abroad continued Wednesday to
donate funds for rehabilitation work, in the wake of serious flooding wrought by
Typhoon Morakot in southern Taiwan over the weekend.</P>
      <P>Eighteen corporate board members of China's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) donated a total of about NT$530 million (US$16.06 million)
to help with post-disaster relief work.</P>
      <P>ARATS Vice President Zheng Lizhong said at a donation ceremony in Beijing that
the funds convey the Chinese people's goodwill and concern for Taiwanese flood
victims.</P>
      <P>Zheng said the money will be handed over to Taiwanese authorities through the
ARATAS' counterpart in Taiwan, the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>ARATS and SEF are intermediary bodies established by their respective
governments  to handle cross-strait  exchanges  and negotiations in the absence
of official ties.</P>
      <P>SEF Deputy Secretary-General Ma Shao-chang, on behalf of the Taiwan people and
flood victims in particular, expressed gratitude to the ARATS board members for
their generous donations.</P>
      <P>"We believe this humanitarian aid from China during our time of hardship will
contribute to the future development of cross-strait ties," Ma added.</P>
      <P>The SEF has also received cash donations from major China-based Taiwanese trade
associations and individual businessmen operating there.</P>
      <P>As mainstream Chinese news media have given prominent coverage to Morakot-
triggered flooding and mudslides in mountainous regions in central and southern
Taiwan, many Chinese Internet users have also launched online appeals for aid
for typhoon victims in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, major expatriate groups in the Greater New York area have raised more
than US$110,000 in relief funds for flood victims in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, Evergreen Group Chairman Chang Jung-fa and member companies in the
group donated a total of NT$520 million for post-disaster rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>The group said it will also encourage its local and overseas employees to donate
to the relief efforts.</P>
      <P>Typhoon victims in need of relief supplies are also welcome to contact the Chang
Jung-fa Foundation, an Evergreen Group spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Another blue-chip company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., also
announced its decision to donate NT$150 million for rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>In addition, the world's largest computer chip foundry will allocate NT$50
million in relief funds for its employees affected by the Morakot-triggered
flooding and mudslides.</P>
      <P>Many other local companies and individuals have also opened their heart and
wallets to help typhoon victims, as the bank accounts opened by the Ministry of
the Interior have received donations worth over NT$700 million in the past two
days, according to an official.</P>
      <P>With the aim of helping typhoon victims return to normal life as soon as
possible, the Central Personnel Administration said it has directed all
government agencies to encourage their staff members to donate one day's pay to
the post-disaster rehabilitation drive.</P>
      <P>As of 6 p.m. Wednesday, the typhoon death toll had risen to 71, while 61 people
remained missing and 45 were reported injured.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NT$40 billion available for post-disaster rehabilitation: premier</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Wednesday that the government can redirect more
than NT$40 billion (US$1.21 billion) from its annual budget toward
rehabilitation projects, in the wake of Typhoon Morakot which wreaked havoc in
southern Taiwan over the weekend.</P>
      <P>"The Executive Yuan can take more than NT$40 billion from its 2009 budget for
certain programs and use it to finance more urgent post-disaster reconstruction
work," said Liu at a news conference held after he met with Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and caucus whips of the ruling and opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Liu said he briefed Wang and the legislative whips of various political parties
on the progress of the post-typhoon rescue and relief operations.</P>
      <P>"I told them that the executive branch will decide how much it should spend on
rehabilitation, based on the scale of destruction caused by Morakot-triggered
flooding and mudslides," Liu said.</P>
      <P>A more detailed estimate of the damage will be available by Thursday afternoon,
Liu said, adding that by then, the executive branch will have a basis on which
to calculate how much money will be needed for rehabilitation projects.</P>
      <P>If necessary, Liu said, the Executive Yuan will draft special legislation to
pave the way for a budget bill specifically to finance relief and reconstruction
efforts.</P>
      <P>"If it comes to that, we believe the Legislature will pass the special budget
bill," Liu said.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang controls an absolute majority in the Legislature.</P>
      <P>As to whether President Ma Ying-jeou should declare a state of emergency to
facilitate rehabilitation in the wake of the worst flooding disaster in southern
Taiwan in half a century, Liu said he sees no need for that.</P>
      <P>"When the Sept. 21, 1999 earthquake occurred, we did not have a disaster relief
act in place, therefore, then-President Lee Teng-hui had to declare a state of
emergency to facilitate the relief work.</P>
      <P>Today, we have a Disaster Prevention and Relief Act, therefore, such a decree is
not necessary, " Liu said, adding that Wang and many other lawmakers shared his
view on the issue.</P>
      <P>Responding to a U.S. State Department offer to assist in the post-typhoon rescue
and relief operations in Taiwan, Liu said that if Taiwan needs foreign help in
this regard, it will not hesitate to accept the offer.</P>
      <P>Noting that rescue efforts in the past few days had been hampered mainly by bad
weather, Liu said Taiwan has sufficient manpower and equipment to rescue
residents trapped in several villages in remote mountainous regions in southern
Taiwan ravaged by floods and mudslides.</P>
      <P>Lu said he and Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng will travel to the hardest-hit
Kaohsiung County Thursday to assess the damage caused by Morakot and to boost
the morale of rescue workers there.</P>
      <P>Rebutting criticism that military personnel were slow to get off the mark in the
relief and rescue work, Liu said such criticism is unfair and untrue.</P>
      <P>"Our military service members are efficient in their rescue operations," Liu
argued.</P>
      <P>According to military authorities, 34,214 servicemen have been mobilized to help
evacuate 4,136 people stranded by floods in the past five days.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of National Defense said it will deploy an additional
4,056 servicemen in order to complete the post-disaster rescue work in a week.</P>

stationery and toys to comfort the children there.</P>
      <P>The plan will see the foundation providing long-term care and school sponsorship

      <P>Financial losses suffered by Taiwan's agricultural sector as a result of Typhoon
Morakot had exceeded NT$9 billion (US$272.7 million) as of 3 p.m. Wednesday,
according to statistics released by the Council of Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>The figure was the second highest since 1991 when the COA started to keep such
records, officials of the Cabinet-level council said.</P>
      <P>The worst agricultural disaster in Taiwan was caused by Typhoon Herbert in
August 1996 when agricultural losses of NT$18.08 billion were recorded.</P>
      <P>Morakot-triggered damage to crops and animal husbandry production alone
accounted for NT$7.94 billion, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Damage to crops amounted to NT$3.24 billion, with 27 percent of the crops on
57,071 hectares of farmland lost, according to COA estimates.</P>
      <P>Bananas suffered the worst damage, with 5,605 hectares ravaged by strong winds
and flooding; followed by papayas, guavas, sweetsops, rice, bamboo shoots and
leafy vegetables.</P>
      <P>Poultry and livestock losses amounted to NT$1.24 billion, with 106,370 hogs, 5.4
million chickens and 962,000 ducks perishing in the storm.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 684 hectares of farmland, worth an estimated NT$665.7 million, were
washed away, with the eastern county of Taitung suffering the most with 524
hectares buried under debris or eroded.</P>
      <P>The agricultural losses also included an estimated NT$174 million in damage to
farming facilities.</P>
      <P>The COA statistics also showed that the aquaculture sector incurred an estimated
NT$3.49 billion in financial losses, a new 18-year high for losses in a single
storm.</P>
      <P>A combined 6,094 hectares of fish farms in southern Taiwan were severely damaged
by Morakot, the worst typhoon to hit the south in half a century. Of the damaged
aquaculture farm areas, 1,231 hectares were coastal fish ponds.</P>

      <P>Individual and corporate donors from home and abroad continued Wednesday to
donate funds for rehabilitation work, in the wake of serious flooding wrought by
Typhoon Morakot in southern Taiwan over the weekend.</P>
      <P>Eighteen corporate board members of China's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) donated a total of about NT$530 million (US$16.06 million)
to help with post-disaster relief work.</P>
      <P>ARATS Vice President Zheng Lizhong said at a donation ceremony in Beijing that
the funds convey the Chinese people's goodwill and concern for Taiwanese flood
victims.</P>
      <P>Zheng said the money will be handed over to Taiwanese authorities through the
ARATAS' counterpart in Taiwan, the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>ARATS and SEF are intermediary bodies established by their respective
governments  to handle cross-strait  exchanges  and negotiations in the absence
of official ties.</P>
      <P>SEF Deputy Secretary-General Ma Shao-chang, on behalf of the Taiwan people and
flood victims in particular, expressed gratitude to the ARATS board members for
their generous donations.</P>
      <P>"We believe this humanitarian aid from China during our time of hardship will
contribute to the future development of cross-strait ties," Ma added.</P>
      <P>The SEF has also received cash donations from major China-based Taiwanese trade
associations and individual businessmen operating there.</P>
      <P>As mainstream Chinese news media have given prominent coverage to Morakot-
triggered flooding and mudslides in mountainous regions in central and southern
Taiwan, many Chinese Internet users have also launched online appeals for aid
for typhoon victims in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, major expatriate groups in the Greater New York area have raised more
than US$110,000 in relief funds for flood victims in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, Evergreen Group Chairman Chang Jung-fa and member companies in the
group donated a total of NT$520 million for post-disaster rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>The group said it will also encourage its local and overseas employees to donate
to the relief efforts.</P>
      <P>Typhoon victims in need of relief supplies are also welcome to contact the Chang
Jung-fa Foundation, an Evergreen Group spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Another blue-chip company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., also
announced its decision to donate NT$150 million for rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>In addition, the world's largest computer chip foundry will allocate NT$50
million in relief funds for its employees affected by the Morakot-triggered
flooding and mudslides.</P>
      <P>Many other local companies and individuals have also opened their heart and
wallets to help typhoon victims, as the bank accounts opened by the Ministry of
the Interior have received donations worth over NT$700 million in the past two
days, according to an official.</P>
      <P>With the aim of helping typhoon victims return to normal life as soon as
possible, the Central Personnel Administration said it has directed all
government agencies to encourage their staff members to donate one day's pay to
the post-disaster rehabilitation drive.</P>
      <P>As of 6 p.m. Wednesday, the typhoon death toll had risen to 71, while 61 people
remained missing and 45 were reported injured.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NT$40 billion available for post-disaster rehabilitation: premier</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Wednesday that the government can redirect more
than NT$40 billion (US$1.21 billion) from its annual budget toward
rehabilitation projects, in the wake of Typhoon Morakot which wreaked havoc in
southern Taiwan over the weekend.</P>
      <P>"The Executive Yuan can take more than NT$40 billion from its 2009 budget for
certain programs and use it to finance more urgent post-disaster reconstruction
work," said Liu at a news conference held after he met with Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and caucus whips of the ruling and opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Liu said he briefed Wang and the legislative whips of various political parties
on the progress of the post-typhoon rescue and relief operations.</P>
      <P>"I told them that the executive branch will decide how much it should spend on
rehabilitation, based on the scale of destruction caused by Morakot-triggered
flooding and mudslides," Liu said.</P>
      <P>A more detailed estimate of the damage will be available by Thursday afternoon,
Liu said, adding that by then, the executive branch will have a basis on which
to calculate how much money will be needed for rehabilitation projects.</P>
      <P>If necessary, Liu said, the Executive Yuan will draft special legislation to
pave the way for a budget bill specifically to finance relief and reconstruction
efforts.</P>
      <P>"If it comes to that, we believe the Legislature will pass the special budget
bill," Liu said.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang controls an absolute majority in the Legislature.</P>
      <P>As to whether President Ma Ying-jeou should declare a state of emergency to
facilitate rehabilitation in the wake of the worst flooding disaster in southern
Taiwan in half a century, Liu said he sees no need for that.</P>
      <P>"When the Sept. 21, 1999 earthquake occurred, we did not have a disaster relief
act in place, therefore, then-President Lee Teng-hui had to declare a state of
emergency to facilitate the relief work.</P>
      <P>Today, we have a Disaster Prevention and Relief Act, therefore, such a decree is
not necessary, " Liu said, adding that Wang and many other lawmakers shared his
view on the issue.</P>
      <P>Responding to a U.S. State Department offer to assist in the post-typhoon rescue
and relief operations in Taiwan, Liu said that if Taiwan needs foreign help in
this regard, it will not hesitate to accept the offer.</P>
      <P>Noting that rescue efforts in the past few days had been hampered mainly by bad
weather, Liu said Taiwan has sufficient manpower and equipment to rescue
residents trapped in several villages in remote mountainous regions in southern
Taiwan ravaged by floods and mudslides.</P>
      <P>Lu said he and Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng will travel to the hardest-hit
Kaohsiung County Thursday to assess the damage caused by Morakot and to boost
the morale of rescue workers there.</P>
      <P>Rebutting criticism that military personnel were slow to get off the mark in the
relief and rescue work, Liu said such criticism is unfair and untrue.</P>
      <P>"Our military service members are efficient in their rescue operations," Liu
argued.</P>
      <P>According to military authorities, 34,214 servicemen have been mobilized to help
evacuate 4,136 people stranded by floods in the past five days.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of National Defense said it will deploy an additional
4,056 servicemen in order to complete the post-disaster rescue work in a week.</P>

    <DATELINE>08/13/09  10:31:44</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Longan was traditionally an unremarkable village in central Taiwan, lacking the
scenic vistas or a distinct historical and cultural heritage to set it apart
from other communities and make outsiders take note.</P>
      <P>That all changed on Sept. 21, 1999. A destructive magnitude 7.3 earthquake shook
the village to its very foundations in the middle of the night, with many local
residents killed by their collapsing homes.</P>
      <P>Also jarred forever was Longan's anonymity and nondescript past, as survivors
united and refused to surrender  to the blast's devastation, rebuilding their
community with the help of a team of architects headed by Luo Shi-wei, director
of Tunghai University's Department of Architecture.</P>
      <P>Luo's contributions  continue to this day,  in Longan and throughout Jhongliao
Township in which the village is located, and the new institutions built and
sustained since the earthquake have given the area newfound visibility.</P>
      <P>Recalling the aftermath of the second deadliest earthquake in Taiwan's recorded
history, Luo said he rushed to the area three days after the quake hit with more
than NT$2 million (US$61,000) in donations from students, teachers and alumni of
the department.</P>
      <P>He wanted to use the money to build prefabricated housing units to shelter those
rendered homeless by the quake, and he and his team of architects scoured the
area for land on which they could install the pre-fab units.</P>
      <P>They searched most of the worst-hit areas -- Nantou County's Caotun, Guosing,
Puli, Jiji and Jhongliao townships, and Taichung County's Sinshe, Shihgang and
Dongshih townships -- but had little success, stymied by land ownership and
building construction issues.</P>
      <P>Finally, one township lent a helping hand.</P>
      <P>"We needed land to accommodate the shelters, and during those chaotic days, only
Jhongliao Township chief Wu Chao-feng was willing to help us. He eventually
contacted a local landowner who was willing to offer us his land near the Pingxi
River to build the shelters, " Luo said.</P>
      <P>Jhongliao is an agricultural township set in the mountains that had 4,829
households and 17,925 residents prior to the earthquake in 1999. It was an aging
community, with many young people leaving home for the city to find work and
live a more modern life.</P>
      <P>The earthquake, centered in the neighboring township of Jiji, hit it as hard as
any township in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A total of 178 lives were lost in Jhongliao, the highest number in proportion to
its population of any township in the country, as 2,528 homes crumbled and
another 1,417 were severely damaged. Most of the damaged homes were old brick
houses.</P>
      <P>Luo's prefabricated  houses,  which differed from the many temporary shelters
being erected in the area at the time, offered every homeless household an
independent living space of 427 square feet.</P>
      <P>The distinction was critical to earthquake victims, Luo said, because what they
needed was not just a short-term shelter but a place where they could start
making a living again. The homeless families refused to see themselves as
"refugees."</P>
      <P>In the first several years after the destructive earthquake, Luo spent most of
his time in the northern part of Jhongliao. Under his guidance,  Cingshuei
Village was relocated and rebuilt over a four-year period on solid ground, its
new structures sturdily constructed to resist future quakes.</P>
      <P>While the relocation of Cingshuei earned him many accolades, Luo believes his
most influential restoration project in the shattered township was the
establishment of a community educational center and a public kitchen for the
elderly in Longan.</P>
      <P>Opened May 7, 2000, the Lungyenlin community educational center was housed in
the office of a local forestry conservation association and a bamboo factory. It
offered classes to help local victims of the earthquake learn professional
skills that enabled them to rebuild their homes and their lives.</P>
      <P>In the center's first semester, area residents could choose from courses on
computers, photography,  English,  medicinal plants, woodworking, and
construction materials, Luo says.</P>
      <P>The formation of the educational center was part of a broader rebuilding
process, encompassing spatial, social and industrial reconstruction, in which it
was hoped people would learn not only how to appreciate the place where they
lived but also how to use local resources to improve their living environment
and livelihoods.</P>
      <P>Luo's initiatives  fulfilled  these goals,  triggering  the re-engineering and
transformation of the aging community.</P>
      <P>With knowledge learned at the center, some local farmers evolved into successful
operators of competitive leisure-oriented farms. Others launched new businesses
by growing medicinal plants.</P>
      <P>Luo and his team also built a unique kitchen for Longan village that turned into
a communal gathering ground for senior citizens to eat and converse together.</P>
      <P>Opened in May 2001, the kitchen offered fresh and cheap lunches and dinners on a
daily basis to seniors who were unable to care for themselves following the
earthquake.</P>
      <P>It also delivered meals to elderly people living alone in remote mountain areas,
a service that eventually became a way to keep tabs on the health of these older
residents, says village chief Liao Chen-yi.</P>
      <P>The kitchen for seniors -- the only one of its kind in Taiwan -- and the
Longyenlin community educational center have not been closed for even a day
since they opened nearly a decade ago and continue to serve local residents
today.</P>
      <P>They have even become tourist attractions, their stories becoming legends that
have caught the attention of outsiders and put the small village on the map,
along with the area's new recreational farms and hiking paths.</P>
      <P>Luo insists that his role was of trifling importance, saying he was just one of
many people including historians, cultural workers and the local residents
themselves, who helped the village rise again from the ashes.</P>
      <P>In fact, he is thankful for all that he has learned from the restoration
process,  in which he witnessed  severly  scarred individuals and communities go
through some intense soul-searching before learning to care for their living
environment.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government of Taiwan has set up a dedicated bank account to accept overseas
donations for disaster relief in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot, the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Office in New York said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Expatriates wishing to contribute to the fund can remit their donations to the
"Ministry of the Interior Donation Account" at Mega International Commercial
Bank. The account number is 007-09-087816, and the swift code is ICBCTWTP007,
the office said.</P>
      <P>Donors can also mail checks directly to the Ministry of the Interior in Taipei
or take them to any of Taiwan's overseas missions, the office said.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot battered Taiwan last week with strong winds and heavy rains that
led to severe flooding and mudslides in some areas in central and southern
Taiwan. The death toll from the disaster had climbed to at least 103 as of
Wednesday, with 45 injured and 61 still missing, according to the Central
Emergency Operation Center.</P>
      <P>With the situation drawing wide attention in the international community, Japan
has donated 10 million yen to Taiwan, and the United States has indicated its
intention to make donations to help in the aftermath of the storm.</P>
      <P>Also, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Hungary, Israel, South Korea and
South Africa have expressed their concerns. Many of Taiwan's diplomatic allies
have expressed sympathy through their U.N. missions in New York over the past
three days.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, various fundraising campaigns have been launched by Taiwanese-
American organizations in New York, including the Chinese Consolidated
Benevolent Association, the Taiwan Center, the New York branch of the Tzu Chi
Foundation, and the New York branch of the Buddha's Light International
Association.</P>
      <P>In the United Kingdom, the Global Federation of Chinese Business Women will hold

      <P>A storm survivor who has been stranded for six days in a township in the eastern
country of Taitung sent out an email appeal Thursday saying that some 1,000
survivors of a killer mudslide in the mountainous area were on the verge of
starvation.</P>
      <P>"Even greens and taros gathered in the wild have been consumed, " said Lin Feng-
shu, an elementary school teacher in Taitung County's Jinfong township, in the
email.</P>
      <P>Lin got the email out Thursday after Taiwan Power Co. and Chunghwa Telecom
managed to restore Internet services, which were disrupted by Typhoon Morakot
after it hit last Friday.</P>
      <P>"Please help us quickly, " the letter stated. According to Lin, vast areas of
Jinfong township -- a mountainous area that is traditionally home to aborigines
-- have been without drinking water or electricity  for six days and roads have
been blocked by landslides.</P>
      <P>Relief supplies, including bottled water, canned foods, instant noodles,
powdered milk and basic daily necessities, are urgently needed, the school
teacher said.</P>
      <P>There are about 1,000 people stranded in the Jinfong area, she said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, as of Thursday morning, many residents in the tribal communities of
Taitung County's southern Dawu township remained cut off from the outsie world
and still had no access to basic supplies.</P>
      <P>Electricity was restored in some places in Dawu, but roads were still blocked,
which meant that food and other items could not be supplied to the villages.</P>
      <P>Residents there have begun to clean up their homes with their bare hands and on
empty stomachs, according to a staff member of a local government office.</P>
      <P>In the mountainous Lidao township -- a stop on the Southern Cross-Island Highway
-- residents were living in constant fear of rockfalls triggered by the record-
high rainfull brought by Typhoon Morakot, according to Wang Hsi-chun, an
elementary school teacher based in Lidao.</P>
      <P>"The Lidao Reservoir could break at any minute as the landslides continue," Wang
said in an email.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot deluged parts of the country with massive volumes of rainfall
Aug. 7-9, causing the worst flooding in Taiwan in half a century. It dumped a
record 2,500mm of precipitation on Taiwan's southernmost county of Pingtung,
causing severe flooding in at least three coastal townships.</P>
      <P>As of 9 p.m. Wednesday, the storm had left at least 103 people dead, 45 people
injured and 61 still unaccounted for islandwide. The casualties included three
rescuers who were killed Tuesday when their helicopter crashed in the
mountainous Wutai township in Pingtung County.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has not rejected offers of foreign assistance in the wake of Typhoon
Morakot, and in fact the government has accepted relief aid from several
countries,  President Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday during an inspection tour of
Tainan County -- one of the four worst-hit regions in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks in response to questions from reporters while in Madou
township, where the pomelo harvest was almost totally wiped out by Morakot over
the weekend.</P>
      <P>According to the president, as of Wednesday evening, the United States, Japan,
Singapore and China had offered money and other aid to Taiwan and the government
had accepted.</P>
      <P>Speaking after a Cabinet meeting later Thursday, Vice Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung
said the president gave him instructions by phone that morning to have the
relevant agencies immediately compile a list of the relief items needed from
abroad.</P>
      <P>Citing Premier  Liu Chao-shiuan's  remarks in the meeting, Government

it needs and will ask for international assistance to improve its rescue and
relief operations.</P>
      <P>"The  list might  include  personnel,  aircraft  and heavy machinery," he added.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou paid his respects Thursday to a deceased village
administrator who slipped to his death during a daring effort to save his
village in Yunlin County on a night when Typhoon Morakot was raging.</P>
      <P>Ma visited the home of Miu Jung-tang, head of the Chinghan Village Office in
Yunlin County's Kouhu township, and offered his condolences to Miu's family.</P>
      <P>Miu, 47, is survived by his wife, their four children and his 80-year-old father
who has been confined to a sick bed for years.</P>
      <P>Miu braved strong winds and heavy rains on the night of Aug. 9 to climb onto a
drainage channel near the coastal area of Chinghan Village to close the water
gate and thus prevent the village from being inundated by waves kicked up by the
typhoon.</P>
      <P>However, immediately after closing the water gate, he slipped and fell into the
channel where he drowned.</P>
      <P>Praising Miu's efforts as heroic, Ma said Miu showed great courage in the face
of danger and was a national role model.</P>
      <P>Ma said he will see to it that Miu's family receives good condolence
compensation from the government.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Yunlin County government in southern Taiwan presented a special
certificate of commendation for bravery to Miu's family Wednesday and renamed

      <P>The Cabinet will study the possibility of drawing up a special budget to meet

said Thursday.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan has instructed concerned agencies
under the Cabinet to complete their estimates of the typhoon damage by Thursday
afternoon and send their reports to the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics, said spokesman Su Jun-pin after a Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>An estimate by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications puts
transportation damage alone at more than NT$22 billion, Su said.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Liu issued a directive for the repair work on the
transportation networks to continue and for the efforts to rescue stranded
typhoon victims to be speeded up.</P>
      <P>The number of airborne missions should also be increased to quickly evacuate the
victims and deliver supplies to isolated communities, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Authorities should respond early to the possibility of more heavy rains and
strikes by other typhoons and should find proper places to relocate victims, Liu

      <P>He also urged the Fair Trade Commission and the Consumer Protection Commission

      <P>Data provided by the Cabinet showed that a total of 2,877 victims in the

evacuation by air to safer places.</P>
      <P>There were also 308 injured or sick residents who needed to be airlifted to

    <HEADLINE>Mechanism in place to request international aid: MOFA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has a mechanism in place to make immediate requests for international aid
for disaster relief efforts whenever such needs are made known by the Central
Disaster Emergency Operation Center, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>"We welcome all international  assistance and will request international aid
through the existing mechanism as soon as the government ascertains the needs of
stricken areas, " MOFA deputy spokesman James Chang said at a regular press
briefing.</P>
      <P>"We will make sure international aid reaches the devastated areas as soon as it
arrives," he added.</P>
      <P>Chang's response came after the ministry was lambasted by the media for
declining offers of foreign assistance in the wake of Typhoon Morakot. Chang
pointed out that the ministry was simply waiting for the central government to
assess levels of need before approaching the international community.</P>
      <P>The previous day, MOFA had said that while Taiwan appreciates the support and
concern expressed by the international community, it had decided to hold off on
requesting foreign assistance because the country is capable of handling the
disaster relief work on its own.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the MOFA is maintaining close contact with the Central
Disaster Emergency Operation Center and is communicating with the Taipei-based
American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) to clarify the country's needs and what kinds
of equipment and supplies the United States can offer.</P>
      <P>The U.S. donated US$250,000 a day earlier to the Republic of China Red Cross
Society in response to the disaster and expressed willingness to offer more
assistance if necessary, such as providing machinery and technology.</P>
      <P>Peter Tsai, secretary-general of the MOFA's Association for East Asian
Relations, said at the briefing that in addition to a donation of 10 million

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan desperately needs large helicopters, prefab housing</HEADLINE>

      <P>What needs most at present in terms of disaster relief assistance is
prefabricated housing and helicopters that can carry heavy-duty gravel trucks
and excavators into disaster areas to help speed up post-disaster relief and
rehabilitation operations, an official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"What we need is a way of getting 32-ton gravel trucks and excavators into
mountainous villages ravaged by floods and mudslides triggered  by Typhoon
Morakot Aug. 7-9,  " said Huang Chi-min, director-general of the National Fire
Administration under the Ministry of the Interior (MOI).</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks after the Executive Yuan directed all central government
agencies to come up with lists of items that they need foreign countries to
donate or supply to facilitate rescue and rehabilitation efforts in the hardest-
hit villages in the mountains of southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) was the first to come
up with a report, saying that it urgently needs helicopters capable of handling
extra-heavy payloads.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the largest chopper used by Taiwan's military is the CH-47,
which can transport a maximum of 12 tons of cargo and has a maximum lift
capacity of only about 6 tons.</P>
      <P>As a result, Huang said, the MOTC was able to deliver only two light excavators
to a mudslide-ruined village in the southern county of Kaohsiung the previous
day.</P>
      <P>Noting that the most efficient way to repair damaged mountain roads is to work
simultaneously from both ends of the damaged sections, Huang said borrowing
large helicopters to airlift heavy machinery into disaster zones is desperately
needed to accelerate the reconstruction work.</P>
      <P>However, a military flight instructor later pointed out that the maximum
handling capacity of the biggest choppers in existence at the moment is only
about 20-plus tons, adding that the U.S.-built CH-54 and the Russian MI-26 can
accept such payloads.</P>
      <P>"We can deliver  medium-sized  machinery  if there are no helicopters capable of
carrying heavy-duty equipment, " said an MOTC official.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the MOI's Construction and Planning Agency came up with a report
saying it hopes foreign countries can provide 1,000 prefabricated houses to help
shelter displaced typhoon victims.</P>
      <P>The Central Disaster Emergency Operation Center also said it welcomes foreign
search and rescue teams willing to come to Taiwan to assist  in locating  people
who remain unaccounted  for after Morakot-triggered mudslides tore through
several remote mountain villages in central, southern and eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As of 3 p.m. Thursday, the storm had left 108 people dead, 45 injured and 58
unaccounted for. The casualties included three rescuers who were killed Tuesday
when their helicopter crashed in mountainous Wutai township in Pingtung County.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials
Thursday:</P>
      <P>Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>It's unreasonable for President Ma to refuse foreign aid.</P>
      <P>President Ma's administration has rejected offers by foreign countries to assist
in the disaster relief work, as China did after the Sichuan earthquake to heavy
international criticism.</P>
      <P>It is considered unwise for Ma to refuse foreign aid, as such assistance can
accelerate the rescue operations and afford Taiwan an opportunity to share the
disaster relief skills and experience of other countries.</P>
      <P>It would also give the international community a chance to better understand the
country, so why turn down the offers?.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times: President Ma should abandon his 'three noes' ostrich policy and
face reality</P>
      <P>The flooding caused by typhoon Morakot has severely damaged the country. The
disaster has received wide coverage in the international media. Some experts
have called it "the worst disaster in Taiwan in 50 years." However, in this time
of crisis, our president is not handling his responsibilities and meeting the
challenges as a leader of Taiwan should. Instead, he has adopted a bizarre
"three noes" ostrich policy.</P>
      <P>His first "no" is to foreign aid. Taiwan has been struggling with the disaster
rescue work because of limited resources. The country has very few helicopters
and the ones it has are ancient models. Because of this problem, many disaster
victims are still stranded on dangerous mountainsides and three crew members
have died in a helicopter crash.</P>
      <P>The U.S. has been showing deep concern over the conditions in Taiwan ever since
the typhoon hit. U.S. Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs Philip J. Crowley
has offered his country's formidable resources to help in the rescue and relief
operations. However, President Ma has not accepted the offer. The U.S. State
Department said that it has not received any requests for help from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Chen Ming-cheng said that "Taiwan can
handle the disaster, and will ask for help only if international support is
needed."</P>
      <P>The second "no" is to declaring a state of emergency. Complaints of inefficiency
in the rescue and relief work have been buzzing around the country since the
disaster occurred. Rescue equipment was found lying idle and there have been
reports of uneven distribution of resources and slow rescue teams. Many local
government chiefs have proposed an emergency decree that would allow for greater
efficiency in rescue operations, as there would be fewer legal hurdles. However,
President Ma has rejected this proposal, saying that the existing government
mechanisms are sufficient to deal with the situation.</P>
      <P>The third "no" is to a special budget. It is obvious that the relief and
reconstruction work after a disaster of this scale would require a huge budget.
Thus it is baffling why President Ma could allocate NT$800 million for a
questionable consumer voucher program, but denies the need for a special
disaster budget, arguing that the current allocation of NT$40 billion would be
enough.</P>
      <P>Ma's decisions make it clear that he not yet faced the fact that Taiwan is in a
serious crisis right now. If Ma wants to prevent further damage, he should
immediately abandon his "three noes" policy, apologize to the pubic, and
cooperate swiftly with the local governments and the international community to
rebuild the country.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Comparing governments' responses after Aug. 8 flooding and Pachang Creek
incident.</P>
      <P>Why did a medium-strength typhoon, against which there were warnings, wreak such
havoc in Taiwan?</P>
      <P>We would like to compare the Kuomintang government's performance in dealing with
the Typhoon Morakot disaster and the Democratic Progressive Party
administration's handling of the Pachang Creek incident in 2000.</P>
      <P>In the Pachang Creek incident, four workers stranded in a surging river in
Chiayi were washed away and drowned after waiting two hours for rescue while TV
cameras rolled.</P>
      <P>Two days later, then Vice Premier Yu Shi-kun resigned to take responsibility for
the incident and many other officials were disciplined.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the Ma administration lags far behind the DPP government, as no
officials have so far taken responsibility for the disaster caused by Morakot.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Mother Nature's warning to Taiwan</P>
      <P>At the height of Typhoon Morakot's fury, Siaolin, a small village in the
mountains of Kaohsiung County, was buried by mudslides caused by the swelling of
a creek that runs through the village.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture claimed that it had put the village on a red alert
against mudslides, but it seems that this was nothing more than a perfunctory
warning designed to shield the council from criticism rather than alert the
villagers to danger.</P>
      <P>In addition to the torrential rain, over-development of mountain areas in surely
one of the factors that made the island vulnerable to mudslides.</P>
      <P>When people used hoes to farm the mountain slopes, the impact on the environment
was much less than now when bulldozers being are used to develop land in the
mountains. This kind of development tips the balance between economic
development and nature.</P>
      <P>We hope the disaster caused by Morakot will prompt people to think twice about
development in the mountainous areas of the country.</P>

      <P>Financial losses suffered by Taiwan's agricultural sector as a result of Typhoon
Morakot had exceeded NT$9.78 billion (US$272.7 million) as of Thursday,
according to statistics released that day by the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>The figure is the second-highest since 1991, when the council started to keep
such records, COA officials said, adding that the worst agricultural disaster
was caused by Typhoon Herb in 1996, when agricultural losses of NT$18.08 billion
were incurred.</P>
      <P>Damage to crops amounted to NT$3.33 billion as a result of Morakot, with 26
percent of the crops on 62,574 hectares of farmland lost, according to COA
estimates.</P>
      <P>Bananas suffered the worst damage, with 5,649 hectares ravaged by strong winds
and flooding, followed by papayas, guavas, custard apples, rice, bamboo shoots
and leafy vegetables.</P>
      <P>Poultry and livestock losses amounted to NT$1.32 billion, with 118,143 hogs,
5,714,000 chickens and 1,065,000 ducks perishing in the storm.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 684 hectares of farmland worth an estimated NT$665.7 million were
washed away, with the eastern county of Taitung suffering the most with 524
hectares buried under debris or carried away by floodwater.</P>
      <P>The agricultural losses also included an estimated NT$174 million in damage to
farming facilities.</P>
      <P>The COA statistics also show that the aquaculture sector incurred an estimated
NT$3.93 billion in financial losses, an 18- year high for losses resulting from
a single storm.</P>
      <P>A combined 8,381 hectares of fish farms in southern Taiwan were severely damaged
by Morakot, the worst typhoon to hit the south in half a century. Of the damaged
aquaculture farm areas, 1,231 hectares were coastal fish ponds.</P>
      <P>According to the COA Minister Chen Wu-hsiung, farmers in 13 cities and counties
will be entitled to cash relief, with those in 14 cities and counties also
eligible for low-interest disaster loans.</P>
      <P>In addition,  those with existing agricultural  credit and low-interest disaster
loans will be able to extend their principal and interest loan terms for one
more year, while the Agricultural Trust Fund guarantees for 90 percent.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that vegetable and rice production will resume production in
three weeks, once the floodwater has receded.</P>
      <P>Poultry,  livestock and aquaculture, which suffered heavier damage, might take
longer to recover, Chen said, adding that the COA estimates about five to six
weeks for poultry farmers to resume production, while pig farmers and
aquaculturists might not return to full speed for six months.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials said Thursday that it had forwarded
a checklist of items that Taiwan needs for international assistance to improve
its rescue and relief operations in the wake of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>The Government Information Office released the list later that day bearing the
items the country most needs from the international community, especially heavy-
lift helicopters capable of carrying gravel trucks and excavators.</P>
      <P>"The list was forwarded to the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and to Japan's
Interchange Association by Deputy Foreign Minister Andrew Hsia as soon as it was
released, " MOFA spokesman Henry Chen told CNA.</P>
      <P>"In addition, the Foreign Ministry has requested all its overseas representative
offices to pass on the list to their respective host governments to seek help,"
he added.</P>
      <P>The AIT confirmed with CNA later in the day that it had received the list and
said it would immediately make a report to the U.S. State Department.</P>
      <P>"We are looking at it and will be working with Washington to see what we can
provide," said AIT Press Officer Christopher Kavanagh.</P>
      <P>The United States and Japan had already donated US$250,000 and 10 million
Japanese yen, respectively, in response to the disaster, and both have expressed
willingness  to offer more assistance  if necessary, such as providing machinery
and technology.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry was lambasted by the media for declining offers of foreign
assistance in the wake of Typhoon Morakot. The previous day, MOFA had said that
while Taiwan appreciates the support and concern expressed by the international
community, it had decided to hold off on requesting foreign assistance because
the country is capable of handling the disaster relief work on its own.</P>
      <P>The ministry said in its own defense Thursday that it was simply waiting for the
central government to assess levels of need before approaching the international
community.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot lashed Taiwan Aug. 7-8, dumping massive amounts of rain over
southern parts of the country, with the southernmost county of Pingtung
receiving a record 2,500mm of precipitation, causing severe flooding in at least
three coastal townships.</P>
      <P>As of 3 p.m. Thursday, the flooding there and elsewhere around the country,
along with widespread landslides, had left 108 people dead, 45 injured and 58
unaccounted for. The casualties included three rescuers who were killed Tuesday
when their helicopter crashed in mountainous Wutai township in Pingtung County.</P>

      <P>Residents of Wutai and Sandimen townships in the southernmost country of
Pingtung, one of the two hardest-hit regions when Typhoon Morakot pummeled
Taiwan Aug. 7-9, are planning a mass exodus in the wake of the storm's
devastation.</P>
      <P>"We hope to see all 600 of Wutai's residents, most of whom belong to the Rukai
Tribe, airlifted out of the mountains to safety, " said Tseng Chih-yung, head of
the Aboriginal Affairs Department under the Pingtung county government.</P>
      <P>Rescue helicopters authorized by the Central Emergency Operation Center made
over 30 sorties to three villages in Wutai township Thursday, evacuating some
280 villagers to safety.</P>
      <P>Of the three villages, 76 of the 80 residents of Ali village had been airlifted
out as of Thursday, with only four young men left behind to clean up the area

      <P>Roads leading to neighboring Dawu village were all cut off by floods and
landslides and were not expected to be fully reopened for two years, according

      <P>According to Lege-ai, a Sandimen township representative who navigated debris
and broken roads on foot for seven hours to reach Dashe village the previous

      <P>The two most prestigious museums on either side of the Taiwan Strait have
finally struck a deal on co-hosting an exhibition in Taipei in October that will
feature artworks from the Qing Dynasty's Yongzheng period, museum sources said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The National Palace Museum (NPM) in suburban Taipei and the Palace Museum in
Beijing struck the agreement via a third party -- the Taipei-based United Daily
News Cultural Foundation -- the sources said,  adding that the two museums will
make a formal joint announcement in a teleconference to be held Friday.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the agreement, the Beijing Palace Museum will loan a
collection artifacts and documents from the Yongzheng Emperor period for the
exhibition at the NPM scheduled to open Oct. 7 and run through Jan. 10, 2010.</P>
      <P>The exhibition will mark the first time that ancient Chinese art treasures held
by the two museums have ever been displayed under the same roof since Taiwan and
China split in 1949 following a civil war.</P>
      <P>The intermediary third party was retained in an effort to avoid sensitive
political issues, as the Beijing museum would not sign any agreement directly
with the Taiwanese museum, which carries the word "national" as part of its
name, according to NPM sources.</P>
      <P>China claims sovereignty over Taiwan and despite significant improvements in
cross-strait relations in the past year under President Ma Ying-jeou's
conciliatory approach toward cross-strait ties, China still refuses to give any
impression that it recognizes Taiwan as a sovereign state.</P>
      <P>The two museums reached a nine-point consensus in March this year on promoting
exchanges and cooperation in museum management, artworks preservation,  academic
study and arts exhibitions,  including establishing a mechanism that would allow
for co-hosting exhibitions.</P>
      <P>"The upcoming exhibition of Yongzheng period artworks owned by both museums
embodies the realization of the consensus we reached earlier this year, " said
an NPM curator who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>The NPM -- one of the world's most famous museums -- has the world's largest
collection of Chinese historical artifacts, which total more than 700,000
pieces.</P>
      <P>The October exhibition in Taipei will showcase aspects of the life of Yongzheng
Emperor, who ruled China for 13 years from 1722 to 1735. He was a tough and
hard-working emperor who opposed corruption and was bent on clean, effective
government. During his reign, the Manchu Empire became a great power and a
peaceful country.</P>

      <P>Legislators of both the ruling and opposition parties said Thursday that the
government urgently needs to enact a law enforcing measures to restore the
balance of Taiwan's natural environment.</P>
      <P>With mountain villages buried in mud and debris triggered by torrential rain and
houses along the east coast washed into the Pacific by flash flooding when
Typhoon Morakot swept across Taiwan Aug. 7-9, the growing extent of the damage
caused by the disaster has raised concern among legislators regarding the
government' s land restoration policy.</P>
      <P>Although the Cabinet approved a land restoration and conservation action plan in
January 2005 and there has been discussions in the Legislative Yuan on drafting
a law on land restoration, the issue was mostly neglected until the latest
natural disaster wreaked its devastation.</P>
      <P>In the wake of Morakot, Legislator Wu Yu-sheng of the ruling Kuomintang
suggested a land restoration law, a proposal that was echoed by lawmakers of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>While scholars have warned time and again of the danger of unregulated building
catering to the tourist trade in mountain areas, of draining underground water
and of using coastline and riverbank areas for fish farms, the government tends
to remain laissez-faire on the issue until a serious natural disaster strikes,
according to the legislators.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lu hsueh-chang suggested that when discussing the restructuring
of the government in the next legislative session, one important task will be to
clarify the responsibilities of government agencies in land restoration and
management.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Wang Hsin-nan said that the DPP caucus will draft a new law based
on the draft of land restoration and conservation provisions already on the
shelf and will submit it in the coming legislative session.</P>

      <P>Voters in Penghu County will go to the polls Sept. 26 to decide the fate of a
controversial proposal that the outlying island county legalize the
establishment of tourist casinos, a county official announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Members of the county's Election Commission unanimously agreed at a meeting
convened earlier in the day that a public referendum on the long-discussed
tourist casino proposal should be held Sept. 26, " Chang Jui-tung, the
commission's secretary-general, said at a news conference.</P>
      <P>"The referendum will ask voters whether they either agree or disagree with
setting up an international recreation area in which casinos will be allowed to
operate, " Chang said.</P>
      <P>A one-hour public hearing will take place Sept. 16 to allow proponents of and
opponents to the plan to air their views, Chang went on, adding that the hearing
will be televised live by a local cable TV station and broadcast several times
in the runup to the vote.</P>
      <P>As of July 31, the commission had received 3,853 signatures from local residents
endorsing the referendum petition, exceeding the required minimum number of
3,522, Chang said.</P>
      <P>In the 2008 presidential election, the county had 72,170 eligible voters.</P>
      <P>According to the Referendum Act, more than half of the eligible voters will need
to cast their ballots for the referendum to be counted valid and more than half
of them will have to cast "yes" votes for the casino proposal to become reality.</P>
      <P>Gambling has long been banned in Taiwan, but the Legislative Yuan passed
legislation on Jan. 12 to legalize casino gambling on outlying islands.</P>
      <P>While some local politicians  and businessmen  welcome the proposal, as they
believe it will reinvigorate the county's sluggish economy, many others oppose
the proposal out of concern about damage to the county's beautiful scenery,
natural environment and social mores.</P>
      <P>Consisting of some 90 small isles, the Penghu archipelago is seated off the
western coast of Taiwan in the Taiwan Strait. Tourism has been an important
source of revenue for the county of 93,000 residents.</P>

      <P>Four more cluster infections of swine flu -- known formally as influenza A(H1N1)
-- were confirmed Thursday, bringing to 34 the number of such cases recorded in
Taiwan, a Department of Health (DOH) official reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>"All of those involved in the latest cluster infections are mild cases, " said
Wang Chung-hsi, director of the public affairs department of the DOH Centers for
Disease Control (CDC).</P>
      <P>Two of the new cluster infections involve schools in Taipei and in eastern
Taiwan, while the other two involve military servicemen stationed in central and
southern parts of the island, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Among the 34 confirmed A(H1N1) cluster infections, 19 cases have been reported
on school campuses, five in summer camps, five in military barracks, two among
long-term caregivers, and one each involving migrant factory workers, hospital
staff and incoming visitors.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,630 people showed flu-like symptoms in the cluster infections, but
only 207 of the 324 people who had samples taken for testing were confirmed to
have contracted the A(H1N1) virus.</P>
      <P>"All of them were mild cases," Wang added.</P>
      <P>As of Thursday, only 21 severe A(H1N1) cases had been recorded in Taiwan,  with
one fatality.  Nine of the patients were still hospitalized and the remaining 11
had already been discharged after recovering, he noted.</P>

      <P>Financial losses suffered by Taiwan's agricultural sector as a result of Typhoon
Morakot had exceeded NT$9.78 billion (US$272.7 million) as of Thursday,
according to statistics released that day by the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>The figure is the second-highest since 1991, when the council started to keep
such records, COA officials said, adding that the worst agricultural disaster
was caused by Typhoon Herb in 1996, when agricultural losses of NT$18.08 billion
were incurred.</P>
      <P>Damage to crops amounted to NT$3.33 billion as a result of Morakot, with 26
percent of the crops on 62,574 hectares of farmland lost, according to COA
estimates.</P>
      <P>Bananas suffered the worst damage, with 5,649 hectares ravaged by strong winds
and flooding, followed by papayas, guavas, custard apples, rice, bamboo shoots
and leafy vegetables.</P>
      <P>Poultry and livestock losses amounted to NT$1.32 billion, with 118,143 hogs,
5,714,000 chickens and 1,065,000 ducks perishing in the storm.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 684 hectares of farmland worth an estimated NT$665.7 million were
washed away, with the eastern county of Taitung suffering the most with 524
hectares buried under debris or carried away by floodwater.</P>
      <P>The agricultural losses also included an estimated NT$174 million in damage to
farming facilities.</P>
      <P>The COA statistics also show that the aquaculture sector incurred an estimated
NT$3.93 billion in financial losses, an 18- year high for losses resulting from
a single storm.</P>
      <P>A combined 8,381 hectares of fish farms in southern Taiwan were severely damaged
by Morakot, the worst typhoon to hit the south in half a century. Of the damaged
aquaculture farm areas, 1,231 hectares were coastal fish ponds.</P>
      <P>According to the COA Minister Chen Wu-hsiung, farmers in 13 cities and counties
will be entitled to cash relief, with those in 14 cities and counties also
eligible for low-interest disaster loans.</P>
      <P>In addition,  those with existing agricultural  credit and low-interest disaster
loans will be able to extend their principal and interest loan terms for one
more year, while the Agricultural Trust Fund guarantees for 90 percent.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that vegetable and rice production will resume production in
three weeks, once the floodwater has receded.</P>
      <P>Poultry,  livestock and aquaculture, which suffered heavier damage, might take
longer to recover, Chen said, adding that the COA estimates about five to six
weeks for poultry farmers to resume production, while pig farmers and
aquaculturists might not return to full speed for six months.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials said Thursday that it had forwarded
a checklist of items that Taiwan needs for international assistance to improve
its rescue and relief operations in the wake of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>The Government Information Office released the list later that day bearing the
items the country most needs from the international community, especially heavy-
lift helicopters capable of carrying gravel trucks and excavators.</P>
      <P>"The list was forwarded to the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and to Japan's
Interchange Association by Deputy Foreign Minister Andrew Hsia as soon as it was
released, " MOFA spokesman Henry Chen told CNA.</P>
      <P>"In addition, the Foreign Ministry has requested all its overseas representative
offices to pass on the list to their respective host governments to seek help,"
he added.</P>
      <P>The AIT confirmed with CNA later in the day that it had received the list and
said it would immediately make a report to the U.S. State Department.</P>
      <P>"We are looking at it and will be working with Washington to see what we can
provide," said AIT Press Officer Christopher Kavanagh.</P>
      <P>The United States and Japan had already donated US$250,000 and 10 million
Japanese yen, respectively, in response to the disaster, and both have expressed
willingness  to offer more assistance  if necessary, such as providing machinery
and technology.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry was lambasted by the media for declining offers of foreign
assistance in the wake of Typhoon Morakot. The previous day, MOFA had said that
while Taiwan appreciates the support and concern expressed by the international
community, it had decided to hold off on requesting foreign assistance because
the country is capable of handling the disaster relief work on its own.</P>
      <P>The ministry said in its own defense Thursday that it was simply waiting for the
central government to assess levels of need before approaching the international
community.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot lashed Taiwan Aug. 7-8, dumping massive amounts of rain over
southern parts of the country, with the southernmost county of Pingtung
receiving a record 2,500mm of precipitation, causing severe flooding in at least
three coastal townships.</P>
      <P>As of 3 p.m. Thursday, the flooding there and elsewhere around the country,
along with widespread landslides, had left 108 people dead, 45 injured and 58
unaccounted for. The casualties included three rescuers who were killed Tuesday
when their helicopter crashed in mountainous Wutai township in Pingtung County.</P>

      <P>Residents of Wutai and Sandimen townships in the southernmost country of
Pingtung, one of the two hardest-hit regions when Typhoon Morakot pummeled
Taiwan Aug. 7-9, are planning a mass exodus in the wake of the storm's
devastation.</P>
      <P>"We hope to see all 600 of Wutai's residents, most of whom belong to the Rukai
Tribe, airlifted out of the mountains to safety, " said Tseng Chih-yung, head of
the Aboriginal Affairs Department under the Pingtung county government.</P>
      <P>Rescue helicopters authorized by the Central Emergency Operation Center made
over 30 sorties to three villages in Wutai township Thursday, evacuating some
280 villagers to safety.</P>
      <P>Of the three villages, 76 of the 80 residents of Ali village had been airlifted
out as of Thursday, with only four young men left behind to clean up the area

      <P>Roads leading to neighboring Dawu village were all cut off by floods and
landslides and were not expected to be fully reopened for two years, according

      <P>According to Lege-ai, a Sandimen township representative who navigated debris
and broken roads on foot for seven hours to reach Dashe village the previous

    <TEXT>
      <P>The two most prestigious museums on either side of the Taiwan Strait have
finally struck a deal on co-hosting an exhibition in Taipei in October that will
feature artworks from the Qing Dynasty's Yongzheng period, museum sources said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The National Palace Museum (NPM) in suburban Taipei and the Palace Museum in
Beijing struck the agreement via a third party -- the Taipei-based United Daily
News Cultural Foundation -- the sources said,  adding that the two museums will
make a formal joint announcement in a teleconference to be held Friday.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the agreement, the Beijing Palace Museum will loan a
collection artifacts and documents from the Yongzheng Emperor period for the
exhibition at the NPM scheduled to open Oct. 7 and run through Jan. 10, 2010.</P>
      <P>The exhibition will mark the first time that ancient Chinese art treasures held
by the two museums have ever been displayed under the same roof since Taiwan and
China split in 1949 following a civil war.</P>
      <P>The intermediary third party was retained in an effort to avoid sensitive
political issues, as the Beijing museum would not sign any agreement directly
with the Taiwanese museum, which carries the word "national" as part of its
name, according to NPM sources.</P>
      <P>China claims sovereignty over Taiwan and despite significant improvements in
cross-strait relations in the past year under President Ma Ying-jeou's
conciliatory approach toward cross-strait ties, China still refuses to give any
impression that it recognizes Taiwan as a sovereign state.</P>
      <P>The two museums reached a nine-point consensus in March this year on promoting
exchanges and cooperation in museum management, artworks preservation,  academic
study and arts exhibitions,  including establishing a mechanism that would allow
for co-hosting exhibitions.</P>
      <P>"The upcoming exhibition of Yongzheng period artworks owned by both museums
embodies the realization of the consensus we reached earlier this year, " said
an NPM curator who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>The NPM -- one of the world's most famous museums -- has the world's largest
collection of Chinese historical artifacts, which total more than 700,000
pieces.</P>
      <P>The October exhibition in Taipei will showcase aspects of the life of Yongzheng
Emperor, who ruled China for 13 years from 1722 to 1735. He was a tough and
hard-working emperor who opposed corruption and was bent on clean, effective
government. During his reign, the Manchu Empire became a great power and a
peaceful country.</P>

      <P>Legislators of both the ruling and opposition parties said Thursday that the
government urgently needs to enact a law enforcing measures to restore the
balance of Taiwan's natural environment.</P>
      <P>With mountain villages buried in mud and debris triggered by torrential rain and
houses along the east coast washed into the Pacific by flash flooding when
Typhoon Morakot swept across Taiwan Aug. 7-9, the growing extent of the damage
caused by the disaster has raised concern among legislators regarding the
government' s land restoration policy.</P>
      <P>Although the Cabinet approved a land restoration and conservation action plan in
January 2005 and there has been discussions in the Legislative Yuan on drafting
a law on land restoration, the issue was mostly neglected until the latest
natural disaster wreaked its devastation.</P>
      <P>In the wake of Morakot, Legislator Wu Yu-sheng of the ruling Kuomintang
suggested a land restoration law, a proposal that was echoed by lawmakers of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>While scholars have warned time and again of the danger of unregulated building
catering to the tourist trade in mountain areas, of draining underground water
and of using coastline and riverbank areas for fish farms, the government tends
to remain laissez-faire on the issue until a serious natural disaster strikes,
according to the legislators.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lu hsueh-chang suggested that when discussing the restructuring
of the government in the next legislative session, one important task will be to
clarify the responsibilities of government agencies in land restoration and
management.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Wang Hsin-nan said that the DPP caucus will draft a new law based
on the draft of land restoration and conservation provisions already on the
shelf and will submit it in the coming legislative session.</P>

      <P>As of July 31, the commission had received 3,853 signatures from local residents
endorsing the referendum petition, exceeding the required minimum number of
3,522, Chang said.</P>
      <P>In the 2008 presidential election, the county had 72,170 eligible voters.</P>
      <P>According to the Referendum Act, more than half of the eligible voters will need
to cast their ballots for the referendum to be counted valid and more than half
of them will have to cast "yes" votes for the casino proposal to become reality.</P>
      <P>Gambling has long been banned in Taiwan, but the Legislative Yuan passed
legislation on Jan. 12 to legalize casino gambling on outlying islands.</P>
      <P>While some local politicians  and businessmen  welcome the proposal, as they
believe it will reinvigorate the county's sluggish economy, many others oppose
the proposal out of concern about damage to the county's beautiful scenery,
natural environment and social mores.</P>
      <P>Consisting of some 90 small isles, the Penghu archipelago is seated off the
western coast of Taiwan in the Taiwan Strait. Tourism has been an important
source of revenue for the county of 93,000 residents.</P>

      <P>Four more cluster infections of swine flu -- known formally as influenza A(H1N1)
-- were confirmed Thursday, bringing to 34 the number of such cases recorded in
Taiwan, a Department of Health (DOH) official reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>"All of those involved in the latest cluster infections are mild cases, " said
Wang Chung-hsi, director of the public affairs department of the DOH Centers for
Disease Control (CDC).</P>
      <P>Two of the new cluster infections involve schools in Taipei and in eastern
Taiwan, while the other two involve military servicemen stationed in central and
southern parts of the island, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Among the 34 confirmed A(H1N1) cluster infections, 19 cases have been reported
on school campuses, five in summer camps, five in military barracks, two among
long-term caregivers, and one each involving migrant factory workers, hospital
staff and incoming visitors.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,630 people showed flu-like symptoms in the cluster infections, but
only 207 of the 324 people who had samples taken for testing were confirmed to
have contracted the A(H1N1) virus.</P>
      <P>"All of them were mild cases," Wang added.</P>
      <P>As of Thursday, only 21 severe A(H1N1) cases had been recorded in Taiwan,  with
one fatality.  Nine of the patients were still hospitalized and the remaining 11
had already been discharged after recovering, he noted.</P>

      <P>A total of 1,282 schools in central and southern  Taiwan  were  demolished  or
damaged  by  Typhoon Morakot-triggered landslides and flooding, with accumulated
losses estimated to have reached NT$1.8 billion (US$56.2 million) , Vice
Education Minister Wu Tsai-shun said Thursday.</P>
      <P>After an inspection tour to Tainan County earlier in the day, Wu said most of
the school damage in the south had been caused by floodwater.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the ministry's Department of Compulsory Education
indicate that schools in Kaohsiung County suffered the most severe damage, with
the losses estimated to have reached NT$520 million, followed by Tainan County
with NT$510 million-worth of damage, and Pingtung County with NT$290 million-
worth.</P>
      <P>While several elementary schools in remote mountain villages were leveled or
buried in mud and debris, the ministry needs to find ways to accommodate
students of the 22 most seriously damaged schools before the end of August, in
order to fulfill its pledge of enabling all schools to start the new semester
according to schedule.</P>
      <P>In a meeting of high school principals the previous day in Kaohsiung City, Wu
had suggested that these schools could temporarily conduct classes in
prefabricated housing units.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, universities and colleges around the island launched a campaign to
mobilize at least 10,000 students to provide voluntary services at the damaged
schools.</P>
      <P>As of late Thursday, more than 10,000 students had volunteered. They will be
assigned to 119 schools in two seven-day shifts over the coming two weeks to
help clean classrooms and schoolyards and look after the children.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China government has officially requested the assistance of the
United States and Canada to help with disaster relief in the aftermath of
Typhoon Morakot, Taiwanese officials posted in North America said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chang Ta-tung, Taiwan's deputy representative to the United States, said his
office had submitted a list detailing the items that the country hopes to
obtain.</P>
      <P>The U.S. State Department had announced a day earlier that US$250,000 had been
donated through the U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance to the ROC Red Cross
Society, and State Department Spokesman Philip Crowley said the government will
do everything it can to help Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"And we've indicated that if there are additional requirements, we would be very
supportive," he said.</P>
      <P>According to a list released by Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, items most
needed include specialized helicopters and pilots capable of transporting very
heavy payloads such as excavators and heavy gravel trucks, as well as 1,000
prefabricated houses to provide temporary refuge for homeless flood victims.</P>
      <P>In addition, the country is requesting 100,000 bottles of phenolic disinfectant
or Benzyl-p-chloropherno, 200,000 Aquatab water purification tablets,  100,000
liters of sterilizing agent for sanitation, 1,000 portable sterilizers and 500
automatic sterilizers.</P>
      <P>Meng Fan-peng, chief of the Information Division at Taiwan's representative
office in Canada, said the office has asked the Canadian authorities to provide
prefabricated houses, disinfectant and sterilizers.</P>
      <P>Wang Kuo-jan, director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Toronto,
said the office is currently coordinating fundraising efforts among the
Taiwanese expatriate community in Canada and has provided three dedicated bank
accounts to accept their donations.</P>
      <P>Also, the income from a golf competition slated for Sept. 26 will be donated to
typhoon relief, Wang said, estimating that the amount to be generated will total
in the region of US$10,000.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot battered Taiwan last week with strong winds and torrential rain
that led to severe flooding and mudslides in some areas of central and southern
Taiwan. The death toll from the disaster had risen to at least 116 as of 10 p.m.
Thursday, with 45 injured and 59 reported missing, according to the Central

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has released a detailed list of items
that Taiwan needs in terms of international assistance for its rescue and
rehabilitation efforts in the wake of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Items most needed include specialized helicopters and pilots capable of
transporting very heavy payloads such as excavators and heavy gravel trucks, as
well as 1,000 prefabricated houses to provide temporary refuge for homeless
flood victims, according to a MOFA press release.</P>
      <P>In addition, the country is requesting 100,000 bottles of phenolic disinfectant

liters of sterilizing agent for sanitation, 1,000 portable sterilizers and 500
automatic sterilizers.</P>
      <P>The MOFA also said it has dispatched officials who will be stationed in the
Central Disaster Emergency Operation Center all day to serve as communication
windows and coordinate international assistance.</P>
      <P>"On behalf of the government and people of the Republic of China, we would like
to express our most sincere appreciation for all the support and concern
expressed by the countries and international organizations," the MOFA said in
the press release.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Henry Chen said a day earlier that his ministry had forwarded the
list to the Taipei-based American Institute in Taiwan and to Japan's Interchange
Association, both of which have made donations and expressed willingness to
offer more assistance. The Foreign Ministry's overseas representative offices
had also been instructed to pass on the list to their respective host
governments, Chen added.</P>
      <P>According to the MOFA, as of Aug. 13, a total of 50 countries, the  European
Union  and  five  international  non-government organizations (I-NGOs) had
expressed condolences to Taiwan on the natural disaster.</P>
      <P>Morakot lashed Taiwan Aug. 7-9, dumping massive amounts of rain over southern
parts of the country, with the southernmost county of Pingtung receiving a
record 2,500mm of precipitation, causing severe flooding in at least three
coastal townships.</P>
      <P>As of 10 p.m. Thursday, the flooding there and elsewhere around the country,

unaccounted for. The casualties included three rescuers who were killed Tuesday
when their helicopter crashed in mountainous Wutai township in Pingtung County.</P>

      <P>Naval frigates will be deployed to beef up relief efforts in coastal areas of
Taitung County that are still cut off from the outside world a week after
Typhoon Morakot pummeled the island, a Republic of China Navy source said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Capt. Lee Lu-tai, commander of Fleet 151, said the vessels, which will be loaded
with heavy vehicles for transport and clean-up jobs, as well as other relief
supplies, will anchor off Jhihben Saturday. The equipment will be destined for
three townships in southern parts of the county where more than 20,000 residents
remained stranded without food or potable water.</P>
      <P>The fleet was called in after the Taitung county government convened an
emergency meeting with navy and coast guard authorities a day earlier.</P>
      <P>County government officials said that some ravines and deep valleys were still
completely cut off from rescue or relief efforts because access roads were out
as a result of massive landslides caused by Morakot.</P>
      <P>They said the navy emergency aid is urgently needed as relief goods brought to
the stranded people via helicopters or systems of ropes and pulleys have been
scarce or even lacking altogether seven days into the disaster.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA apologizes for turning down foreign disaster relief aid</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) apologized Friday for telling its
overseas representative offices to politely decline international assistance
such as supplies and rescuers in the wake of Typhoon Morakot, describing it as a
technical error made out of negligence.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry issued instructions Aug. 11 to all MOFA's foreign
representative  offices to politely decline their host governments if they
should offer supplies or rescuers to help the country with disaster relief
efforts in the wake of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>"It was a technical error in that we did not make clear that it should have read
`temporarily' decline international assistance. If such negligence has caused
any bad public perception, I solemnly apologize to the public on behalf of the
ministry," Deputy Foreign Minister Andrew Hsia said.</P>
      <P>"As the acting foreign minister, I will take full responsibility and accept any
disciplinary action, " Hsia said. Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou is out of
the country attending a meeting.</P>
      <P>Hsia also noted that neither the Presidential Office nor the Executive Yuan were
aware of the telegram.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry has been lambasted by the media over the past few days for
declining offers of foreign assistance in the wake of Morakot. The United
States, Japan, Singapore and other countries have made donations and have
expressed willingness to provide additional assistance.</P>
      <P>However, until the previous day, the MOFA had said that while Taiwan appreciates
the support and concern expressed  by the international community, it had
decided to hold off on requesting foreign assistance because the country is
capable of handling the disaster relief work on its own.</P>
      <P>The MOFA said in its own defense that it was waiting for the Central Disaster
Emergency Operation Center to clarify the needs of victims and rescuers before
approaching the international community.</P>
      <P>The central government later released a list of items that Taiwan needs from the
international community for its rescue and relief operations, including
specialized helicopters capable of transporting very heavy payloads, and
sanitation supplies.</P>
      <P>Noting that the list was immediately forwarded to the U.S. and Japan, both of
which are most capable of providing such specialized machinery, Hsia said
Australia has also offered to provide some of the listed items, with China
Airlines charged with transporting them to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based Israel Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei told CNA that the
country has decided to provide water purification devices and water tank systems
to make sure that the stricken typhoon victims can have access to clean water.</P>
      <P>Quantities and details of these devices had yet to be confirmed but were
expected to arrive in Taiwan later in the day, the Israeli office said.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Work began early Friday to evacuate residents living along the Laonong River in
a mountainous area of northern Kaohsiung County out of fear that a big barrier
lake created by mudslides and torrents over the past week could burst at any
minute.</P>
      <P>Rock- and mudslides as a result of the extreme torrential rain triggered by
Typhoon Morakot have created choked-up lakes of various sizes in areas along the
river, with the largest one covering some 6 hectares, according to the Kaohsiung
County Emergency Operation Center.</P>
      <P>Fearing that the lake could burst at any minute, rescue officials alerted
residents of Taoyuan, Baolai and Liouguei townships, warning them to prepare for
evacuation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, helicopters had made 32 sorties as of 10 a.m. that day to airlift
supplies to stranded villagers in these townships and ferry people to safety.
Over 400 flood victims had been carried out of their mud-encased homes as of
that morning.</P>
      <P>Further south in Pingtung County, more than 200 villagers in Wutai township --
one of the hardest-hit of the county's townships -- had been airlifted to safety
as of 11 a.m. that day, with some 100 more awaiting additional helicopter
sorties.</P>
      <P>However, some 250 residents of Wutai village, the most densely settled part of
the township, refused to be evacuated as the weather had cleared and the rain
had subsided.</P>
      <P>At a senior high school in Neipu village, members of 10 volunteer or charity
organizations who had been there for several days to console the evacuees, were
continuing their efforts to cheer up the flood victims, playing with the
children and offering career or medical consultations to the adults.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taitung county officials called a halt to a mass evacuation plan for
villagers stranded in three villages on the banks of the Taimali River.</P>
      <P>The evacuation plan, drawn up the night before, was called off after a group of
specialists got a bird's-eye view from a helicopter of a giant barrier lake that
had been created over the past several days in the Baosheng community, located
about 24 km west of the coastal township of Taimali.</P>
      <P>The specialists said that the "crisis had been defused" as the water level of
the new lake was much lower than the previous day.</P>
      <P>Taitung Deputy Magistrate Peng Teh-cheng said that evacuation plans would be
halted temporarily while work to repair the South-Link Railway and the South-
Link Highway should be resumed immediately.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan might approach U.N. bid issue differently: deputy FM</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Friday that Taiwan might resort to a
different approach than last year in Taiwan's bid for representation in the
United Nations.</P>
      <P>The 64th U.N. General Assembly session is scheduled to open Sept. 15 at U.N.
headquarters in New York, and Taiwan must submit a bid proposal to the U.N.
Secretariat through a diplomatic ally 30 days before then for it to be
considered for the General Assembly agenda.</P>
      <P>Pressed by reporters on whether it means that Taiwan will not make any bid if it
does not act before the Aug. 15 deadline, Deputy Foreign Minister Andrew Hsia
said that was not necessarily the case, as there are many different ways to
approach Taiwan's U.N. bid.</P>
      <P>"If no proposal is made on that day (Aug. 15), then we might have a different
bid than last year. We will have a new approach, said Hsia without elaborating
what it would be.</P>
      <P>I'm sure you will get an answer (next week),he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has not been represented in the U.N. since 1971 when the Republic of
China's seat was given to the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Its annual efforts to rejoin the body since 1993 have failed, as have its
attempts to be part of U.N.-affiliated organizations, mainly because of China's
obstruction.</P>
      <P>But with relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait thawing since
President Ma Ying-jeou's administration took office last year, Taiwan was
invited to attend the World Health Assembly -- the decision-making  arm of the
U.N.-affiliated  World  Health Organization -- in May as an observer.</P>
      <P>Last year, in a departure from the high-profile push in 2007 for full membership
in the United Nations under the name Taiwan, the country proposed that it be
allowed to "participate meaningfully in the activities of U.N. specialized
agencies."</P>
      <P>That approach was in line with President Ma's "modus vivendi" or flexible
diplomatic strategy, which favors a moderate and pragmatic approach to expanding
Taiwan's international space.</P>
      <P>Although the request failed to make the agenda of the 63rd session of the U.N.
General Assembly last year, it was well received by major countries such as the
United States, Japan, and some European Union countries, which issued statements
in support of the effort.</P>

      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Salute to heroes who go all-out to rescue flood victims</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot brought about the most serious flooding of last five decades in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Unprecedented heavy rain of course was the main culprit behind the disaster,
while the government has drawn fire, with accusations of having bungled the
relief operation.</P>
      <P>However, many people plunged headfirst into the rescue operation without
complaint, struggling to reach remote mountainous settlements accessible only on
foot, carrying heavy relief supplies.</P>
      <P>The disaster has also brought out the best in many people, who have silently
donated services, money and materials to help with the rescue operation.</P>
      <P>We know the country's economic development is based on the exploitation of
nature and we should therefore be prepared to bear the disastrous results of our
behavior.</P>
      <P>We should understand that nature's backlash is non-partisan and is equally
likely to fall on any administration, whatever its political persuasion.</P>
      <P>We don't need politicians indulging themselves in political maneuvering, or TV
commentators babbling inanities. We need people who are prepared to walk into
the remote areas to help the stranded people.</P>
      <P>Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>Be ready for more fatalities if the government keeps allowing unlimited use of
hillsides</P>
      <P>The disaster caused by Typhoon Morakot was the result of extremely heavy rain
coupled with the unrestricted use of hillside lands.</P>
      <P>Global warming is responsible for the unpredictable torrential rains, but the
unlimited use of mountain lands is dereliction of duty on the part of the
government.</P>
      <P>Unless the government tightens control on the development of mountain areas,
more mudslides and heavier death tolls could be expected in the future.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Should the president declare a state of emergency?</P>
      <P>Lawmakers of both the ruling and opposition parties have urged President Ma
Ying-jeou to declare a state of emergency to deal with the devastation caused by
Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>They said that under a state of emergency, the president would be given carte
blanche to carry out the post-disaster reconstruction work.</P>
      <P>However, Ma and Premier Liu Chao-shiuan have rejected the proposal, claiming
that they have enough leeway under the existing laws to do what needs to be
done.</P>
      <P>We have to say that this is more of a political than a a legal matter, and the
president should have the political wisdom to accommodate the lawmakers' calls.</P>
      <P>By declaring a state of emergency, the president would show that he is very much
concerned about the crisis and this will reassure and encourage the public to
rally behind him in his post-disaster efforts.</P>
      <P>There are administrations in the world that have been undermined as a result of
disasters, but there are also administrations that have emerged from crises more
powerful than before. The difference lies is how the crisis is handled.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Confused command system contributes to disaster</P>
      <P>The administration's bungled attempts to rescue flood victims in the wake of
Typhoon Morakot have irritated scholars,  retired generals, and people who took
part in the rescue operation after the earthquake on Sept. 21, 1999.</P>
      <P>The performance of the administration in the last few days has shown that
President Ma Ying-jeou's administration didn't learn anything from the country's
ordeal in 1999.</P>
      <P>Ma's persistence to stick to a regular command system rather than declaring a
state of emergency and take the leadership in coping with the disaster has
demonstrated that he is only interested in following the letter of the law
rather than considering the big picture.</P>

      <P>The Israel Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei (ISECO) said Friday that the
government of Israel has arranged a shipment of water tanks and purification
devices, scheduled to arrive in Taiwan later in the day, for victims of Typhoon
Morakot.</P>
      <P>"When the scale of disaster caused by Typhoon Morakot began to unfold, ISECO
took the initiative to approach the Executive Yuan with the idea of shipping
water devices that might be useful in the situation," the Israeli office said in
a press release.</P>
      <P>According to ISECO, the Executive Yuan welcomed the idea and immediately
directed ISECO to the Ministry of the Interior, and then to the Taiwan Water
Corp. in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Among a variety of solutions suggested by the ISECO, products from WaterSheer,
an Israeli company that specializes in water purification, were selected.</P>
      <P>The shipment will include two SOS Tank Systems to transport water to remote
disaster-hit areas and hundreds of SulisPPD, a personal and simple-to-use device
to purify flood and murky water into drinking water, the Israeli office said.
Each SulisPPD can produce 700 liters of drinking water, which would be enough
for a large family or a group of people, he added.</P>
      <P>The shipment left Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv Thursday night
aboard an EL AL flight. The supplies were donated by the Israeli Foreign
Ministry with additional support from Giza Venture Capital of Israel and Huang
Lung Engineering Co., Ltd., a Taiwanese company that has Israeli business
partners.</P>
      <P>The shipment was scheduled to arrive in Taiwan later in the day and Israeli
Representative to Taiwan Raphael Gamzou was slated to oversee the direct
transfer to the Taiwan Water Corp. in Kaohsiung, the ISECO said.</P>
      <P>Gamzou also intends to be in Kaohsiung Aug. 15 to observe the efficiency of the
devices, it added.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot lashed Taiwan Aug. 7-9, dumping massive amounts of rain on the
southern parts of the country. The southernmost county of Pingtung received a
record 2500mm of rainfall, which caused severe flooding in at least three
coastal townships.</P>
      <P>As of 3 p.m. Friday, the flooding there and elsewhere around the country, along
with widespread landslides, had left 117 people dead, 45 injured and 59
unaccounted for. The casualties included three rescuers who were killed Tuesday
when their helicopter crashed in the mountainous township of Wutai in Pingtung
County.</P>

      <P>The official death toll from Typhoon Morakot had climbed to 117 as of 10 a.m.
Friday, with 59 people listed as missing and 45 injured, the Central Emergency
Operation Center has reported.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung County had the greatest number of fatalities, with 66, followed by
Tainan County with 24, Pingtung County with 16, Chiayi County with five, Nantou
County with four and one each in Changhua and Yunlin counties.</P>
      <P>The death toll is likely to rise, however, as an undetermined number of people
in remote villages, especially Siaolin in Kaohsiung County, are thought to have
died in massive landslides.</P>
      <P>In terms of water and electricity supplies, the center said over 363,000
households in the southern counties of Tainan, Kaohsiung and Pingtung were still
without running water as of 10 a.m. Friday and more than 19,000 households were
still suffering from power outages.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to the center, 14,960 telephone lines remained to be
recovered and 242 mobile phone base stations needed to be fixed.</P>
      <P>Islandwide, coastal Dongshih township in Chiayi County was still inundated, with
floodwaters 30-50 centimeters high, said a center official, adding that with 19
pumping systems continuously working around-the-clock for days, the flooding was
expected to end by 10 a.m. Saturday.</P>
      <P>Two villages in Pingtung County's Jiadong township remained encased in mud, with
mudflows reaching as high as 100 centimeters.</P>
      <P>A total of 48 pumping systems had been mobilized to Pingtung County's Linbian
and Donggang townships to pump water out of low-lying areas, where floodwaters
were still about 30 centimeters high.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Typhoon Morakot's toll on Taiwan's agricultural sector reached
NT$10.72 billion as of Friday morning, with Pingtung, Kaohsiung and Tainan
counties suffering the most, in that order.</P>
      <P>Only Typhoon Herb in 1996 has proved more destructive in the past 18 years,
causing over NT$18 billion in agricultural losses.</P>
      <P>Of the damage sustained in Typhoon Morakot, the aquaculture sector suffered
NT$3.6 billion in losses, also with Pingtung, Kaohsiung  and Tainan counties
being the most battered areas, according to the center.</P>
      <P>In related news, the National Police Agency said Friday that it has notified
local government offices in Kaohsiung County that a total of 37 corpses or
fragments of human remains had been gathered around the county to be identified.</P>
      <P>The agency called for relatives of people who had lost contact with their
families since Typhoon Morakot to have their DNA taken at police stations to
facilitate the search for those who have died or gone missing.</P>
      <P>In related news, the Presidential Office denied a media report that relevant
officials had done nothing after President Ma Ying-jeou promised an excavator to
a man from Taitung County's Taimali township who was searching for the body of
his father.</P>
      <P>Two days later, after failing to receive any response from officials, the man,
Lee Yu-ying, was forced to rent his own equipment to dig out his father's mud-
encased car, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Discounting the report,  the Presidential  Office said the government has
mobilized 200 people every day to search for bodies of those missing around
areas along the Taimali River.</P>
      <P>"The report was groundless and off base, " the Presidential Office said.</P>
      <P>President Ma offers his deepest sympathy to Lee and families of other missing
people, but is also grateful to rescuers for their selfless efforts in searching
and rescuing people around-the-clock without rest, the Presidential Office said.</P>

      <P>Financial losses suffered by Taiwan's agricultural sector as a result of Typhoon
Morakot had exceeded NT$10.66 billion (US$324.6 million) as of Friday, according
to statistics released by the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>The figure is the second-highest since 1991, when the council started to keep
such records, COA officials said, adding that the worst agricultural disaster
was caused by Typhoon Herb in 1996, when agricultural losses of NT$18.08 billion
were incurred.</P>
      <P>Damage to crops amounted to NT$3.58 billion as a result of Morakot, with 26
percent of the crops on 65,566 hectares of farmland lost, according to COA
estimates.</P>
      <P>Bananas suffered the worst damage, with 5,800 hectares ravaged by strong winds
and flooding, followed by papayas, guavas, custard apples, rice, bamboo shoots
and leafy vegetables.</P>
      <P>Poultry and livestock losses amounted to NT$1.34 billion, with 119,476 hogs,
5,738,000 chickens and 1,088,000 ducks perishing in the storm.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 684 hectares of farmland worth an estimated NT$1.37 billion were
washed away, with the eastern county of Taitung and Kaohsiung suffering the
most. A total of 1,474 hectares of land in the two counties were buried under
debris or carried away by floodwater.</P>
      <P>The agricultural losses also included an estimated NT$192 million in damage to
farming facilities.</P>
      <P>The COA statistics also show that the aquaculture sector incurred an estimated
NT$3.81 billion in financial losses, an 18-year high for losses resulting from a
single storm.</P>
      <P>A combined 6,470 hectares of fish farms in southern Taiwan were severely damaged
by Morakot, the worst typhoon to hit Taiwan in half a century. Of the damaged
aquaculture farm areas, 1,531 hectares were coastal fish ponds.</P>
      <P>According to COA Minister Chen Wu-hsiung, farmers in 13 cities and counties will
be entitled to cash relief, while those in 15 cities and counties will also be
eligible to obtain low-interest disaster loans.</P>
      <P>The cash relief program will require roughly NT$100 billion, which will be taken
from the Rural Development Foundation and other sources. The low-interest loans
will be handled by the Bureau of Agricultural Finance.</P>
      <P>In addition, farmers with existing agricultural credit and low- interest
disaster loans will be able to extend their principal and interest loan terms
for one year, with the Agricultural Trust Fund guaranteeing 90 percent.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that vegetable and rice production will resume in three weeks,
once the floodwater has receded.</P>
      <P>Poultry,  livestock and aquaculture, which suffered heavier damage, might take
longer to recover, Chen said. The COA estimates that poultry farmers will be
able to resume production in about five to six weeks, but pig farmers and
aquaculturists might not get up to full speed for another six months, he said.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou directed central and local governments Friday to set up
post-disaster reconstruction committees to restore communications and
transportation in affected areas in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot and deal
with compensation issues.</P>
      <P>Ma issued the directive -- one of a total of nine -- at the first high-level
national security meeting he has convened since taking office in May 2008,
according to Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi after the meeting.</P>
      <P>The president also said that because of the severity of the impact of Typhoon
Morakot, the government should set up a national mobilization mechanism for
post-disaster relief, relocation and reconstruction efforts to help victims
return to normality.</P>
      <P>He requested the Cabinet to draw up relocation plans and complementary measures
for villages ravaged by floods or mudslides with the help of geography and
meteorology experts.</P>
      <P>The typhoon triggered the country's worst flooding in half a century and had
claimed an estimated 500 lives as of Friday noon, including an estimated 380
people buried by a landslide in the southern Taiwan village of Siaolin,
according to Ma.</P>
      <P>It has also caused an estimated NT$50 billion (US$1.52 billion) in property
losses.</P>
      <P>Saying that post-disaster relief and recovery operations are currently underway
simultaneously, Ma noted that no matter how difficult the tasks, his
administration was duty bound to carry out the mission, according to Wang.</P>
      <P>He said Ma has asked the Ministry of Economic Affairs to allocate at least NT$3
billion in two years for flood prevention, and instructed  the Department of
Health to provide mental health consultation services for the health of the
survivors.</P>
      <P>Ma also instructed the Executive Yuan to inform the public on disaster relief
operation procedures and methods, clearly divide the responsibility between
central and local governments in relief efforts, and help enhance local-level
disaster relief capabilities.</P>
      <P>The president said the reconstruction committees at various levels should be set
up to come up with compensation arrangements for disaster affected industries,
and quickly restore communications and transportations in affected regions.</P>
      <P>He also demanded that the disaster response center should release accurate and
real-time information and make good use of donations.</P>
      <P>Touching on an initiative by the Ministry of the Interior to draft a land
restoration law to restore the balance of Taiwan's natural environment, the
president said the ministry should first hold hearings to survey public opinion.</P>
      <P>Ma also directed the National Police Agency to send police cadets to help with
post-disaster reconstruction and demanded the Ministry of National Defense to
dispatch 10,000 more servicemen to help in relief efforts.</P>
      <P>Recognizing the rescue efforts already made by the military and the National
Airborne Service Corps, Ma said they airlifted 2,200 stranded villagers to
safety Thursday, the highest daily total since the typhoon hit Taiwan over the

    <HEADLINE>Government plans to hire more hydraulic engineers</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 14 (CNA)

      <P>The Examination Yuan confirmed Friday that it will hold examinations to help the
Water Resources Agency (WRA) recruit an additional 104 hydraulic engineers over
the next two years, after the WRA was censured by the Control Yuan for its lack
of expertise.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan, the branch of Taiwan's government responsible for monitoring
the behavior of government officials, censured the WRA and 13 other central and
local government agencies on Aug. 5 for their poor performance and lack of
expertise that led to disastrous consequences during Typhoon Kalmaegi in July
2008.</P>
      <P>The storm caused flooding and landslides in the central and southern areas of
the country, leaving 20 people dead and causing NT$1.05 billion (US$34.57
million) in agricultural losses.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's flood control and water management problems -- and the need for more
expertise -- were further exposed in the past week as torrential rains from
Typhoon Morakot led to the flooding of over one-quarter of the country's land
area and heavy losses of life and property.</P>
      <P>Following the censure, the WRA requested the Examination Yuan to help it recruit
hydraulic engineers.</P>
      <P>The Examination Yuan, responsible for civil service recruitment and management,
will organize special civil service examinations and will require qualified
engineers to commit to the WRA for six years before they can work for anybody
else.</P>
      <P>At a press conference Thursday morning,  Examination  Yuan President Kuan Chung
reflected that the government has been bombarded with criticism since Typhoon
Morakot hit Taiwan for inaccurate weather forecasting, poor flood control,  a
lack of hydraulic engineers, and its slow response to disaster relief.</P>
      <P>He hoped that the government  would take these criticisms seriously, saying, "a
civil service system should be sympathetic and responsive to the sorrows of the
people. This must be the fundamental attitude of all civil servants."</P>
      <P>Dung Bau-tscheng, the deputy chief of the Ministry of Examination under the
Examination Yuan, said his agency will meet soon with the WRA, and after
understanding its needs will immediately organize the exam.</P>
      <P>He also announced  that once disaster  relief efforts are concluded, the
Ministry of Examination will contact local governments in eastern and southern
Taiwan to find out more about what types of people are needed to prevent future
disasters.</P>
      <P>Aside from hydraulic engineers, the government also lacks experts in land
restoration and organization, disaster relief and soil and water conservation,
and Tung said the Ministry of Examination will soon organize other examinations
to meet this demand.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Examination Yuan has encouraged its staff to donate  one  day  of
pay  to relief  efforts,  while  Deputy Secretary-General Lee Jih-Shyan and his
disaster relief squad arrived at the disaster relief center at Cishan Senior
High School in Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>They reported that people there were in urgent need of relief volunteers, daily
commodities and trauma therapy. The second relief squad will bring medical
assistance to the south on Friday.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot battered Taiwan last weekend, dumping a year's worth of rainfall
on some areas in three days, triggering severe flooding and deadly landslides.</P>
      <P>The death toll from the disaster had risen to at least 116 as of 10 p.m.
Thursday, with 45 injured and 59 reported missing, according to the Central
Emergency Operation Center.</P>

      <P>The Air Force Command Headquarters said Friday that all of its 11 S-70C
helicopters have been deployed for rescue work in the aftermath of Typhoon
Morokat, and have not been reserved for use by the president and government
officials, as the media has reported.</P>
      <P>The statement came in response to a report Friday in the China Times, which
claimed that two of the S-70Cs had been pulled from the rescue operations and
were being kept on standby to transport President Ma Ying-jeou and Minister of
Defense Chen Chao-min.</P>
      <P>One of the helicopters left from Songshan Air Force Base on Thursday night and
the other on Friday morning for the Chiayi Air Force Base from where they both
embarked on missions to rescue stranded typhoon victims, according to the
command headquarters.</P>
      <P>The China Times claimed that this action was taken in reaction to its attempts
Thursday night to confirm with the command headquarters the information in its
news report.</P>
      <P>The command headquarters said that airspace and air traffic in the disaster
areas have become congested and it had therefore issued air traffic rules for
its helicopters to regulate landings and takeoffs.</P>
      <P>Since Typhoon Morakot hit Taiwan on Aug. 8, the Air Force has sent out 363
flights, rescued 1,254 stranded victims, flown 103 patients to hospital, and
transported 143 medical personnel and 60,785 kilos of relief supplies, the
command headquarters said.</P>
      <P>However, it only mentioned the number of flights, but not the actual number of
aircraft flying the missions.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan public has become quite sensitive to rescue aircraft issues since
helicopter accident occurred three days ago. The UH-1H rescue helicopter from
the National Airborne Service Corps hit a mountainside and crashed into a valley
near the aboriginal settlement of Sandimen at 3:30 p.m., killing the three crew
members aboard.</P>
      <P>Following the accident, the corps grounded all of its UH-1H helicopters for
inspection.</P>

      <P>Government officials in southern counties ravaged by Typhoon Morakot have urged
local residents to stop donating relief supplies as their warehouses are now
full of goods.</P>
      <P>"We stopped accepting relief supply donations today as our storage centers are
filled with many kinds of daily necessities, such as bottled water, instant
noodles and powdered milk, " said an official with the Pingtung County
government's  Social Affairs Department Friday.</P>
      <P>The county has opened 26 temporary shelters to accommodate 1,700-plus displaced
typhoon victims after Morakot-triggered flooding swamped its coastal towns and
landslides overran its mountainous villages, the official said.</P>
      <P>"Steady streams of donated relief supplies have continued flowing into our
disaster response centers from around Taiwan after the news media gave prominent
coverage to typhoon victims' woes," the official said. "Now we have sufficient
supplies of relief goods and no longer need any donations."</P>
      <P>The county government has also received NT$100 million in cash donations, the
official said.</P>
      <P>"To help those who were rendered homeless by the natural disaster to rebuild
their homes, cash donations are still welcome, " said the official, who also
appealed for more volunteers to clean up the environment.</P>
      <P>"Some 300 volunteers have joined the cleanup and disinfection drive, but we need
more, " the official said. He also asked for people to contribute cleaning
equipment to speed up the recovery effort.</P>
      <P>Neighboring Kaohsiung County,  which was also hit hard by Morakot-triggered
flooding and landslides, echoed Pingtung's call to halt donations of daily
necessities.</P>
      <P>"If we need any special disaster relief equipment, such as life-saving equipment
and generators, we will post the information on our official Web site, " said Wu
Li-hsueh, director of the county government's Social Affairs Department.</P>
      <P>The Red Cross Society also said it has collected enough supplies for typhoon-
affected people in major disaster zones, including the southern counties of
Chiayi, Tainan, Pingtung and Kaohsiung as well as the eastern county of Taitung.</P>
      <P>"We will deliver all relief goods to affected regions through our volunteers as
soon as possible," said a spokesman for the charity.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's share prices continued their winning streak Friday to close 0.49
percent higher, on hopes that the Cabinet's plan to allocate a special budget of
NT$200 billion for disaster relief in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot would
give a boost to the country's economy.</P>
      <P>The weighted index, the market's key barometer, gained 34.55 points to close at
7,069.51.</P>
      <P>Although Morgan Stanley Capital International decreased its weight on the Taiex,
the local bourse opened high at 7,091.82 in line with Wall Street's overnight
gains and the rallies of regional stock markets.</P>
      <P>The Taiex later reached  the day's high of 7,132.33  but subsequently retreated
to the day's low of 7,062.49 due to the emergence of selling pressure.</P>
      <P>The local market has added 176 points in the week since southern Taiwan was hit
by Typhoon Morakot, which triggered the most severe flooding in the country in
50 years.</P>
      <P>A total of 4.55 billion shares changed hands on market turnover of NT$124.04
billion (US$3.78 billion).</P>
      <P>Six of the eight major stock categories gained ground, with textile shares
moving up the most at 3.2 percent. Cement stocks rose 1.8 percent, foodstuff
issues and plastics and chemicals shares each advanced 1.7 percent, construction
shares surged 1.6 percent, and machinery and electronics shares moved up 0.1
percent.</P>
      <P>Paper and pulp issues remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>Only one of the eight major stock categories, banking and financial shares, lost
ground with a 0.4 percent drop.</P>
      <P>Gainers outnumbered losers 1,243 to 1,118, with 192 stocks remaining unchanged.</P>
      <P>Foreign institutional investors were net buyers of NT$5.03 billion worth of
shares.</P>
      <P>One analyst said that although the index rebounded to above 7,000 and moved
toward this year's high of 7,185, the market would advance further only if
turnover rises above NT$160 billion.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Villagers in Chiayi County's Meishan township, who have been stranded for seven
days since Typhoon Morakot, raised smoke signals Friday in an attempt to attract
attention and be evacuated.</P>
      <P>Being cut off from the outside world for days and their supply of food and
potable water exhausted, the villagers in the remote community of Chuantsaiser
sent the smoke signals, which in the past were used only to issue warnings or
war alarms, said a local resident surnamed Yeh via a civil band radio.</P>
      <P>To their chagrin, their smoke signals did not draw any rescue helicopters to
their location. They returned to their muddy homes and made plans for their next
meal -- probably bamboo shoots that they planned to dig up, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang Ching-hui, formerly a rescuer, said he has lived in Taihe
Village in Meishan township for nearly half a century but had never seen any
natural disaster as devastating as the flooding and landslides triggered by
Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Wang said as far as he knew, four residents in the tribal community of
Youcheliao had been buried alive by mudslides and their bodies were still there,
while some 80 tribal people in the Chengmikao community remained stranded
without any supply of food or water.</P>
      <P>He said some deep valleys were still completely cut off from rescue or relief
efforts because massive landslides knocked out roads in the area. If villagers
need to venture out, they will have to travel by foot from Meishan township via
neighboring Yunlin or Nantou counties.</P>
      <P>To reach Youcheliao and Chengmikao communities -- the hardest-hit areas in
Meishan township -- rescuers would have to cross the Chingshui River first and
then navigate through broken mountain roads for another two hours, Wang said.</P>
      <P>As of 10 a.m. Friday, the storm had left 117 people dead, 45 people injured and
59 still unaccounted  for islandwide.  The casualties included three rescuers
who were killed Tuesday when their helicopter crashed in mountainous Wutai
township in Pingtung County.</P>

      <P>Over 300 residents in Namasia, a remote mountainous township in southern Taiwan,
were finally evacuated Friday after being trapped for several days in their
Typhoon Morakot-devastated homeland, but many others refused to depart.</P>
      <P>Many of the 362 Namasia evacuees broke down in tears as they bade farewell to
their small town in Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>They were airlifted by military helicopters to the county's Cishan township in
several groups.</P>
      <P>An emotional old man, surnamed Hsu, was dismayed at having to leave his
hometown.</P>
      <P>"I have grown up on this land. I am sad to leave. I will definitely return some
day," he grumbled as the chopper he was aboard drifted away from the typhoon-
battered town that faced another threat Friday -- the possible bursting of a big
barrier lake in its vicinity.</P>
      <P>Some 600 other people living in neighboring towns along the Laonong River in the
county's mountainous region were also evacuated Friday  out of concern  that
the barrier  lake  created  by Morakot-triggered mudslides and torrents over the
past week could rupture at any minute.</P>
      <P>Although the aboriginal Namasia township was almost ruined by the recent storm,
several hundreds of its residents still refused to be evacuated.</P>
      <P>Most of them are residing in the township's Minsheng First and Minsheng Second
villages.</P>
      <P>"They do not know that only their two villages were left relatively unscathed by
Morakot while all other villages were inundated by mudflows and debris, " said
Chu Wen-hua, a Namasia villager who was evacuated earlier in the day. "If a new
storm comes, I'm afraid the two villages won't be able to withstand it."</P>
      <P>Therefore, Chu said, eight influential Namasia residents will return to their
town Saturday to persuade other people living in the town to evacuate to safety
as early as possible.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Friday that the Executive Yuan will create an ad
hoc committee next week to coordinate  various  reconstruction  programs  in
southern  and southeastern Taiwan, which have been devastated by Typhoon
Morakot.</P>
      <P>The executive branch will also draft a special budget bill to finance post-
disaster rehabilitation and reconstruction projects as financial losses from the
typhoon damage have topped an estimated NT$110 billion (US$3.33 billion), Liu
said.</P>
      <P>Because figure is far more than the Executive Yuan can draw on from its annual
budget, the Cabinet will draft a budget bill in accordance with the existing
Disaster Relief and Response Act to finance various rehabilitation and
reconstruction projects, the premier said.</P>
      <P>The draft budget bill will be ready for a review at the Executive Yuan's weekly
meeting next Thursday and will then be referred to the Legislature for
screening, Liu said.</P>
      <P>According to the premier, Legislative Yuan Wang Jin-pyng has promised to push
for lawmakers to screen the budget bill as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In response, Wang said the Legislature will decide whether to convene an
extraordinary meeting to deliberate the special budget bill after receiving it

      <P>Liu said Wednesday that the government can redirect more than NT$40 billion
(US$1.21 billion) from its annual budget toward post-disaster rehabilitation
projects.</P>
      <P>But damage from the typhoon has far exceeded the original estimates, he said,
necessitating the drafting of a special budget.</P>
      <P>As of 3 p.m., the official death toll from Morakot had surged to 118, with 57
listed as missing and 45 injured, according to statistics released by the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Deputy Foreign Minister Andrew Hsia on Friday rebutted an earlier statement by
the defense minister that the U.S. and Japan had declined to provide Taiwan with
helicopters to assist in disaster relief efforts, saying that the two countries
were still assessing the possibility.</P>
      <P>Defense Minister Chen Chao-min said earlier Friday that the U.S. and Japan would
not offer Taiwan specialized helicopters capable of transporting heavy payloads
because they did not have the range to fly to Taiwan from Guam, where the U.S.
helicopters are stationed, or Japan.</P>
      <P>But Hsia said the two countries  have initially responded positively to Taiwan's
requests for assistance to help with rescue and relief operations in the wake of
Typhoon Morakot, and that the helicopters were still on the table.</P>
      <P>From what I know, they are still assessing the possibilities. The U.S. and Japan
did not say that such a requirement is not doable. Everything is still under
negotiation, Hsia told reporters after attending a ceremony to celebrate
Singapore's 44th National Day.</P>
      <P>Asked how the international community is responding to Taiwans list of disaster
relief needs, Hsia said that the Foreign Ministry has received a very positive
response but will wait for individual governments to announce what they can
provide.</P>
      <P>Naohiro Tsutsumi, director-general of the Taipei Office of the Interchange
Association -- the de facto Japanese embassy in Taiwan in the absence of
diplomatic relations -- told the Central News Agency that he would not comment
on specific listed items but said Japan is weighing all the requirements.</P>
      <P>Japan is now in the process of considering the possibility of our response to
the requirements. We have to wait for Tokyo to reach a conclusion,Tsutsumi said.</P>
      <P>Japan responded quickly to news of the devastation that Typhoon Morakot wrought
in southern Taiwan by expressing condolences to the victims, making a donation
of 10 million Japanese yen to disaster relief efforts and offering to provide
additional assistance if necessary.</P>
      <P>After being lambasted by the media over the past few days for declining offers
of foreign assistance, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs  (MOFA)  apologized
Friday  for telling  its overseas representative offices to politely decline
international assistance such as supplies and rescuers in the wake of Typhoon
Morakot, describing it as a technical error made out of negligence.</P>
      <P>Tsutsumi, however, dismissed media reports that Japan's offer of aid was
rejected by Taiwan, saying that his country always understood that Taiwan would
have to first clarify its needs before approaching the international community.</P>
      <P>He noted that Junzo Yamamoto, the Japanese delegation leader of the Japan-based
Asia-Pacific ParliamentariansUnion that opened its 40th annual conference in
Taipei Aug. 11, told President Ma Ying-jeou earlier in the week that Japan had
the intention to help, an offer that was well received by Ma, who thanked Tokyo
for the offer.</P>
      <P>"It's very strange to interpret Ma's response as a rejection, Tsutsumi said.We
don't think so.</P>
      <P>"Japan remains very willing and happy to help Taiwan, as it is one of the most
important and friendly countries of Japan in the region,he added.</P>

      <P>A policeman in flood- and landslide- ravaged Liouguei township in Kaohsiung
County, who was airlifted to safety after being stranded on the roof of his
police station for four days, said Friday that he was able to cheat death with
the help of his strong will, devout beliefs and a police raincoat.</P>
      <P>Chang Hui-cheng, resting in a hospital after being rescued Aug. 11, said the
ordeal started Aug. 7, when Typhoon Morakot began dumping heavy rain on his
village of Nanshalu in Namasia township.</P>
      <P>He persuaded tourists in the mountainous area to flee to plains areas as soon as
possible, and they all followed his advice, Chang recalled.</P>
      <P>But villagers were more reluctant to follow his instructions to evacuate,
refusing initially to do so because they believed that Christ would bless them
and they would be OK, Chang lamented.</P>
      <P>But Chang's sense that a calamity that would destroy people's homes would soon
occur unfortunately came to pass.</P>
      <P>He said that when he tried to get some rest after helping with evacuation
efforts, the torrential rain broke windows in the first floor of the police
station, sending him rushing to grab his raincoat and run up to the roof of the
three-story building.</P>
      <P>Quickly realizing the roof did not provide any shelter against the storm, he
simply sat there and relied on the raincoat for protection from the rain, while
holding steel columns to prevent himself from being washed away by floodwaters.</P>
      <P>During his four-day ordeal, he sometimes felt a desire to sleep, but he realized
that if he succumbed to the temptation, he would die. "The waterproof raincoat
saved my life, as it kept me warm, " Chang said.</P>
      <P>After having a bowl of instant noodles Aug. 7 noon, Chang did not consume
anything except rainwater until when he was rescued.</P>
      <P>"Aside from God, there was nobody I could ask for help when I was trapped, "
Chang stressed. He said he continuously prayed to God to protect the police
station while he was on the roof.</P>
      <P>His opportunity to end his ordeal came on Aug. 11, when he saw a helicopter
flying by. He attracted its attention by waving a red cloth and was flown to
safety.</P>
      <P>Almost at the same time, Chang's wife, children and a number of villagers were
also airlifted to safety, Chang added.</P>
      <P>The policeman, who applied to retire in April, said the first thing he wants to
do after retiring will be to rebuild his home.</P>

daily giftware sales during an exhibition of artworks from the Qing Dynasty's
Yongzheng period for post-Typhoon Morakot recovery projects.</P>
      <P>NPM Director Chou Kung-shin unveiled the donation program at a news conference
in which she joined with Zheng Xinmiao, director of the Palace Museum in
Beijing, in announcing via a teleconference the two museums' first cooperation
deal -- co-hosting the Yongzheng period arts exhibition at the NPM in suburban
Taipei in October.</P>
      <P>The Yongzheng exhibition, which is scheduled to open Oct. 7 and run through Jan.
10, 2010, will mark the first time that ancient Chinese art treasures held by
the two museums have ever been displayed under the same roof since the People's
Republic of China was established in 1949.</P>
      <P>During the Yongzheng exhibition period, Chou said the NPM's giftware shop will
donate 15 percent of its daily revenues for the post-typhoon reconstruction and
rehabilitation projects.</P>
      <P>"An estimated NT$25 million is expected to be raised from the program during the
exhibition period for the relief cause, " Chou said.</P>
      <P>The museum also donated Friday's income of its food and beverage sales
department, worth about NT$1 million, for post-typhoon relief projects.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a Red Cross Society box was installed at the museum's gift shop
Friday to accept donations by visitors to the museum, which is one of Taiwan's
most popular tourist attractions among visitors from other countries around the
world.</P>
      <P>"Many Chinese tourists contributed funds into the box this afternoon," said an
NPM staff member.</P>
      <P>The NPM -- one of the world's most famous museums -- has the world's largest
collection of Chinese historical artifacts, which total more than 700,000
pieces.</P>
      <P>The Beijing Palace Museum will loan a collection of artifacts and documents
from the Yongzheng  Emperor period for the October exhibition at the NPM.</P>
      <P>The exhibition in Taipei will showcase aspects of the life of Yongzheng Emperor,
who ruled China for 13 years from 1722 to 1735.</P>

    <HEADLINE>People evacuated as barrier lake expected to burst</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Aug.  14 (CNA)
08/14/09  14:48:07
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Work began early Friday to evacuate residents living along the Laonong River in
a mountainous area of northern Kaohsiung County out of fear that a big barrier
lake created by mudslides and torrents over the past week could burst at any
minute.</P>
      <P>Rock- and mudslides as a result of the extreme torrential rain triggered by
Typhoon Morakot have created choked-up lakes of various sizes in areas along the
river, with the largest one covering some 6 hectares, according to the Kaohsiung
County Emergency Operation Center.</P>
      <P>Fearing that the lake could burst at any minute, rescue officials alerted
residents of Taoyuan, Baolai and Liouguei townships, warning them to prepare for
evacuation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, helicopters had made 32 sorties as of 10 a.m. that day to airlift
supplies to stranded villagers in these townships and ferry people to safety.
Over 400 flood victims had been carried out of their mud-encased homes as of
that morning.</P>
      <P>Further south in Pingtung County, more than 200 villagers in Wutai township --
one of the hardest-hit of the county's townships -- had been airlifted to safety
as of 11 a.m. that day, with some 100 more awaiting additional helicopter
sorties.</P>
      <P>However, some 250 residents of Wutai village, the most densely settled part of
the township, refused to be evacuated as the weather had cleared and the rain
had subsided.</P>
      <P>At a senior high school in Neipu village, members of 10 volunteer or charity
organizations who had been there for several days to console the evacuees, were
continuing their efforts to cheer up the flood victims, playing with the
children and offering career or medical consultations to the adults.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taitung county officials called a halt to a mass evacuation plan for
villagers stranded in three villages on the banks of the Taimali River.</P>
      <P>The evacuation plan, drawn up the night before, was called off after a group of
specialists got a bird's-eye view from a helicopter of a giant barrier lake that
had been created over the past several days in the Baosheng community, located
about 24 km west of the coastal township of Taimali.</P>
      <P>The specialists said that the "crisis had been defused" as the water level of
the new lake was much lower than the previous day.</P>
      <P>Taitung Deputy Magistrate Peng Teh-cheng said that evacuation plans would be
halted temporarily while work to repair the South-Link Railway and the South-
Link Highway should be resumed immediately.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan might approach U.N. bid issue differently: deputy FM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 14 (CNA)
08/14/09  16:52:32
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Friday that Taiwan might resort to a
different approach than last year in Taiwan's bid for representation in the
United Nations.</P>
      <P>The 64th U.N. General Assembly session is scheduled to open Sept. 15 at U.N.
headquarters in New York, and Taiwan must submit a bid proposal to the U.N.
Secretariat through a diplomatic ally 30 days before then for it to be
considered for the General Assembly agenda.</P>
      <P>Pressed by reporters on whether it means that Taiwan will not make any bid if it
does not act before the Aug. 15 deadline, Deputy Foreign Minister Andrew Hsia
said that was not necessarily the case, as there are many different ways to
approach Taiwan's U.N. bid.</P>
      <P>"If no proposal is made on that day (Aug. 15), then we might have a different
bid than last year. We will have a new approach, said Hsia without elaborating
what it would be.</P>
      <P>I'm sure you will get an answer (next week),he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has not been represented in the U.N. since 1971 when the Republic of
China's seat was given to the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Its annual efforts to rejoin the body since 1993 have failed, as have its
attempts to be part of U.N.-affiliated organizations, mainly because of China's
obstruction.</P>
      <P>But with relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait thawing since
President Ma Ying-jeou's administration took office last year, Taiwan was
invited to attend the World Health Assembly -- the decision-making  arm of the
U.N.-affiliated  World  Health Organization -- in May as an observer.</P>
      <P>Last year, in a departure from the high-profile push in 2007 for full membership
in the United Nations under the name Taiwan, the country proposed that it be
allowed to "participate meaningfully in the activities of U.N. specialized
agencies."</P>
      <P>That approach was in line with President Ma's "modus vivendi" or flexible
diplomatic strategy, which favors a moderate and pragmatic approach to expanding
Taiwan's international space.</P>
      <P>Although the request failed to make the agenda of the 63rd session of the U.N.
General Assembly last year, it was well received by major countries such as the
United States, Japan, and some European Union countries, which issued statements
in support of the effort.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Friday:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Salute to heroes who go all-out to rescue flood victims</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot brought about the most serious flooding of last five decades in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Unprecedented heavy rain of course was the main culprit behind the disaster,
while the government has drawn fire, with accusations of having bungled the
relief operation.</P>
      <P>However, many people plunged headfirst into the rescue operation without
complaint, struggling to reach remote mountainous settlements accessible only on
foot, carrying heavy relief supplies.</P>
      <P>The disaster has also brought out the best in many people, who have silently
donated services, money and materials to help with the rescue operation.</P>
      <P>We know the country's economic development is based on the exploitation of
nature and we should therefore be prepared to bear the disastrous results of our
behavior.</P>
      <P>We should understand that nature's backlash is non-partisan and is equally
likely to fall on any administration, whatever its political persuasion.</P>
      <P>We don't need politicians indulging themselves in political maneuvering, or TV
commentators babbling inanities. We need people who are prepared to walk into
the remote areas to help the stranded people.</P>
      <P>Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>Be ready for more fatalities if the government keeps allowing unlimited use of
hillsides</P>
      <P>The disaster caused by Typhoon Morakot was the result of extremely heavy rain
coupled with the unrestricted use of hillside lands.</P>
      <P>Global warming is responsible for the unpredictable torrential rains, but the
unlimited use of mountain lands is dereliction of duty on the part of the
government.</P>
      <P>Unless the government tightens control on the development of mountain areas,
more mudslides and heavier death tolls could be expected in the future.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Should the president declare a state of emergency?</P>
      <P>Lawmakers of both the ruling and opposition parties have urged President Ma
Ying-jeou to declare a state of emergency to deal with the devastation caused by
Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>They said that under a state of emergency, the president would be given carte
blanche to carry out the post-disaster reconstruction work.</P>
      <P>However, Ma and Premier Liu Chao-shiuan have rejected the proposal, claiming
that they have enough leeway under the existing laws to do what needs to be
done.</P>
      <P>We have to say that this is more of a political than a a legal matter, and the
president should have the political wisdom to accommodate the lawmakers' calls.</P>
      <P>By declaring a state of emergency, the president would show that he is very much
concerned about the crisis and this will reassure and encourage the public to
rally behind him in his post-disaster efforts.</P>
      <P>There are administrations in the world that have been undermined as a result of
disasters, but there are also administrations that have emerged from crises more
powerful than before. The difference lies is how the crisis is handled.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Confused command system contributes to disaster</P>
      <P>The administration's bungled attempts to rescue flood victims in the wake of
Typhoon Morakot have irritated scholars,  retired generals, and people who took
part in the rescue operation after the earthquake on Sept. 21, 1999.</P>
      <P>The performance of the administration in the last few days has shown that
President Ma Ying-jeou's administration didn't learn anything from the country's
ordeal in 1999.</P>
      <P>Ma's persistence to stick to a regular command system rather than declaring a
state of emergency and take the leadership in coping with the disaster has
demonstrated that he is only interested in following the letter of the law
rather than considering the big picture.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Israel Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei (ISECO) said Friday that the
government of Israel has arranged a shipment of water tanks and purification
devices, scheduled to arrive in Taiwan later in the day, for victims of Typhoon
Morakot.</P>
      <P>"When the scale of disaster caused by Typhoon Morakot began to unfold, ISECO
took the initiative to approach the Executive Yuan with the idea of shipping
water devices that might be useful in the situation," the Israeli office said in
a press release.</P>
      <P>According to ISECO, the Executive Yuan welcomed the idea and immediately
directed ISECO to the Ministry of the Interior, and then to the Taiwan Water
Corp. in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Among a variety of solutions suggested by the ISECO, products from WaterSheer,
an Israeli company that specializes in water purification, were selected.</P>
      <P>The shipment will include two SOS Tank Systems to transport water to remote
disaster-hit areas and hundreds of SulisPPD, a personal and simple-to-use device
to purify flood and murky water into drinking water, the Israeli office said.
Each SulisPPD can produce 700 liters of drinking water, which would be enough
for a large family or a group of people, he added.</P>
      <P>The shipment left Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv Thursday night
aboard an EL AL flight. The supplies were donated by the Israeli Foreign
Ministry with additional support from Giza Venture Capital of Israel and Huang
Lung Engineering Co., Ltd., a Taiwanese company that has Israeli business
partners.</P>
      <P>The shipment was scheduled to arrive in Taiwan later in the day and Israeli
Representative to Taiwan Raphael Gamzou was slated to oversee the direct
transfer to the Taiwan Water Corp. in Kaohsiung, the ISECO said.</P>
      <P>Gamzou also intends to be in Kaohsiung Aug. 15 to observe the efficiency of the
devices, it added.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot lashed Taiwan Aug. 7-9, dumping massive amounts of rain on the
southern parts of the country. The southernmost county of Pingtung received a
record 2500mm of rainfall, which caused severe flooding in at least three
coastal townships.</P>
      <P>As of 3 p.m. Friday, the flooding there and elsewhere around the country, along
with widespread landslides, had left 117 people dead, 45 injured and 59
unaccounted for. The casualties included three rescuers who were killed Tuesday
when their helicopter crashed in the mountainous township of Wutai in Pingtung
County.</P>

      <P>The official death toll from Typhoon Morakot had climbed to 117 as of 10 a.m.
Friday, with 59 people listed as missing and 45 injured, the Central Emergency
Operation Center has reported.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung County had the greatest number of fatalities, with 66, followed by
Tainan County with 24, Pingtung County with 16, Chiayi County with five, Nantou
County with four and one each in Changhua and Yunlin counties.</P>
      <P>The death toll is likely to rise, however, as an undetermined number of people
in remote villages, especially Siaolin in Kaohsiung County, are thought to have
died in massive landslides.</P>
      <P>In terms of water and electricity supplies, the center said over 363,000
households in the southern counties of Tainan, Kaohsiung and Pingtung were still
without running water as of 10 a.m. Friday and more than 19,000 households were
still suffering from power outages.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to the center, 14,960 telephone lines remained to be
recovered and 242 mobile phone base stations needed to be fixed.</P>
      <P>Islandwide, coastal Dongshih township in Chiayi County was still inundated, with
floodwaters 30-50 centimeters high, said a center official, adding that with 19
pumping systems continuously working around-the-clock for days, the flooding was
expected to end by 10 a.m. Saturday.</P>
      <P>Two villages in Pingtung County's Jiadong township remained encased in mud, with
mudflows reaching as high as 100 centimeters.</P>
      <P>A total of 48 pumping systems had been mobilized to Pingtung County's Linbian
and Donggang townships to pump water out of low-lying areas, where floodwaters
were still about 30 centimeters high.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Typhoon Morakot's toll on Taiwan's agricultural sector reached
NT$10.72 billion as of Friday morning, with Pingtung, Kaohsiung and Tainan
counties suffering the most, in that order.</P>
      <P>Only Typhoon Herb in 1996 has proved more destructive in the past 18 years,
causing over NT$18 billion in agricultural losses.</P>
      <P>Of the damage sustained in Typhoon Morakot, the aquaculture sector suffered
NT$3.6 billion in losses, also with Pingtung, Kaohsiung  and Tainan counties
being the most battered areas, according to the center.</P>
      <P>In related news, the National Police Agency said Friday that it has notified
local government offices in Kaohsiung County that a total of 37 corpses or
fragments of human remains had been gathered around the county to be identified.</P>
      <P>The agency called for relatives of people who had lost contact with their
families since Typhoon Morakot to have their DNA taken at police stations to
facilitate the search for those who have died or gone missing.</P>
      <P>In related news, the Presidential Office denied a media report that relevant
officials had done nothing after President Ma Ying-jeou promised an excavator to
a man from Taitung County's Taimali township who was searching for the body of
his father.</P>
      <P>Two days later, after failing to receive any response from officials, the man,
Lee Yu-ying, was forced to rent his own equipment to dig out his father's mud-
encased car, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Discounting the report,  the Presidential  Office said the government has
mobilized 200 people every day to search for bodies of those missing around
areas along the Taimali River.</P>
      <P>"The report was groundless and off base, " the Presidential Office said.</P>
      <P>President Ma offers his deepest sympathy to Lee and families of other missing
people, but is also grateful to rescuers for their selfless efforts in searching
and rescuing people around-the-clock without rest, the Presidential Office said.</P>

      <P>Financial losses suffered by Taiwan's agricultural sector as a result of Typhoon
Morakot had exceeded NT$10.66 billion (US$324.6 million) as of Friday, according
to statistics released by the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>The figure is the second-highest since 1991, when the council started to keep
such records, COA officials said, adding that the worst agricultural disaster
was caused by Typhoon Herb in 1996, when agricultural losses of NT$18.08 billion
were incurred.</P>
      <P>Damage to crops amounted to NT$3.58 billion as a result of Morakot, with 26
percent of the crops on 65,566 hectares of farmland lost, according to COA
estimates.</P>
      <P>Bananas suffered the worst damage, with 5,800 hectares ravaged by strong winds
and flooding, followed by papayas, guavas, custard apples, rice, bamboo shoots
and leafy vegetables.</P>
      <P>Poultry and livestock losses amounted to NT$1.34 billion, with 119,476 hogs,
5,738,000 chickens and 1,088,000 ducks perishing in the storm.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 684 hectares of farmland worth an estimated NT$1.37 billion were
washed away, with the eastern county of Taitung and Kaohsiung suffering the
most. A total of 1,474 hectares of land in the two counties were buried under
debris or carried away by floodwater.</P>
      <P>The agricultural losses also included an estimated NT$192 million in damage to
farming facilities.</P>
      <P>The COA statistics also show that the aquaculture sector incurred an estimated
NT$3.81 billion in financial losses, an 18-year high for losses resulting from a
single storm.</P>
      <P>A combined 6,470 hectares of fish farms in southern Taiwan were severely damaged
by Morakot, the worst typhoon to hit Taiwan in half a century. Of the damaged
aquaculture farm areas, 1,531 hectares were coastal fish ponds.</P>
      <P>According to COA Minister Chen Wu-hsiung, farmers in 13 cities and counties will
be entitled to cash relief, while those in 15 cities and counties will also be
eligible to obtain low-interest disaster loans.</P>
      <P>The cash relief program will require roughly NT$100 billion, which will be taken
from the Rural Development Foundation and other sources. The low-interest loans
will be handled by the Bureau of Agricultural Finance.</P>
      <P>In addition, farmers with existing agricultural credit and low- interest
disaster loans will be able to extend their principal and interest loan terms
for one year, with the Agricultural Trust Fund guaranteeing 90 percent.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that vegetable and rice production will resume in three weeks,
once the floodwater has receded.</P>
      <P>Poultry,  livestock and aquaculture, which suffered heavier damage, might take
longer to recover, Chen said. The COA estimates that poultry farmers will be
able to resume production in about five to six weeks, but pig farmers and
aquaculturists might not get up to full speed for another six months, he said.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou directed central and local governments Friday to set up
post-disaster reconstruction committees to restore communications and
transportation in affected areas in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot and deal
with compensation issues.</P>
      <P>Ma issued the directive -- one of a total of nine -- at the first high-level
national security meeting he has convened since taking office in May 2008,
according to Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi after the meeting.</P>
      <P>The president also said that because of the severity of the impact of Typhoon
Morakot, the government should set up a national mobilization mechanism for
post-disaster relief, relocation and reconstruction efforts to help victims
return to normality.</P>
      <P>He requested the Cabinet to draw up relocation plans and complementary measures
for villages ravaged by floods or mudslides with the help of geography and
meteorology experts.</P>
      <P>The typhoon triggered the country's worst flooding in half a century and had
claimed an estimated 500 lives as of Friday noon, including an estimated 380
people buried by a landslide in the southern Taiwan village of Siaolin,
according to Ma.</P>
      <P>It has also caused an estimated NT$50 billion (US$1.52 billion) in property
losses.</P>
      <P>Saying that post-disaster relief and recovery operations are currently underway
simultaneously, Ma noted that no matter how difficult the tasks, his
administration was duty bound to carry out the mission, according to Wang.</P>
      <P>He said Ma has asked the Ministry of Economic Affairs to allocate at least NT$3
billion in two years for flood prevention, and instructed  the Department of
Health to provide mental health consultation services for the health of the
survivors.</P>
      <P>Ma also instructed the Executive Yuan to inform the public on disaster relief
operation procedures and methods, clearly divide the responsibility between
central and local governments in relief efforts, and help enhance local-level
disaster relief capabilities.</P>
      <P>The president said the reconstruction committees at various levels should be set
up to come up with compensation arrangements for disaster affected industries,
and quickly restore communications and transportations in affected regions.</P>
      <P>He also demanded that the disaster response center should release accurate and
real-time information and make good use of donations.</P>
      <P>Touching on an initiative by the Ministry of the Interior to draft a land
restoration law to restore the balance of Taiwan's natural environment, the
president said the ministry should first hold hearings to survey public opinion.</P>
      <P>Ma also directed the National Police Agency to send police cadets to help with
post-disaster reconstruction and demanded the Ministry of National Defense to
dispatch 10,000 more servicemen to help in relief efforts.</P>
      <P>Recognizing the rescue efforts already made by the military and the National
Airborne Service Corps, Ma said they airlifted 2,200 stranded villagers to
safety Thursday, the highest daily total since the typhoon hit Taiwan over the
weekend.</P>
      <P>In addition, President Ma thanked Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng for his
support for a special budget proposal to fund disaster relief efforts in the
aftermath of the typhoon.</P>
      <P>Also attending the meeting to discuss contingency measures to cope with the
aftermath of the typhoon were Vice President Vincent Siew, Presidential Office
Secretary-General Chan Chuen-po, National Security Council Secretary-General Su
Chi, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, Vice Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung  Legislative  Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, ruling Kuomintang Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung and the heads of

      <P>The Examination Yuan confirmed Friday that it will hold examinations to help the
Water Resources Agency (WRA) recruit an additional 104 hydraulic engineers over
the next two years, after the WRA was censured by the Control Yuan for its lack

      <P>The Control Yuan, the branch of Taiwan's government responsible for monitoring

2008.</P>
      <P>The storm caused flooding and landslides in the central and southern areas of
the country, leaving 20 people dead and causing NT$1.05 billion (US$34.57

      <P>Taiwan's flood control and water management problems -- and the need for more
expertise -- were further exposed in the past week as torrential rains from
Typhoon Morakot led to the flooding of over one-quarter of the country's land
area and heavy losses of life and property.</P>
      <P>Following the censure, the WRA requested the Examination Yuan to help it recruit
hydraulic engineers.</P>
      <P>The Examination Yuan, responsible for civil service recruitment and management,
will organize special civil service examinations and will require qualified
engineers to commit to the WRA for six years before they can work for anybody
else.</P>
      <P>At a press conference Thursday morning,  Examination  Yuan President Kuan Chung
reflected that the government has been bombarded with criticism since Typhoon
Morakot hit Taiwan for inaccurate weather forecasting, poor flood control,  a
lack of hydraulic engineers, and its slow response to disaster relief.</P>
      <P>He hoped that the government  would take these criticisms seriously, saying, "a
civil service system should be sympathetic and responsive to the sorrows of the
people. This must be the fundamental attitude of all civil servants."</P>
      <P>Dung Bau-tscheng, the deputy chief of the Ministry of Examination under the
Examination Yuan, said his agency will meet soon with the WRA, and after
understanding its needs will immediately organize the exam.</P>
      <P>He also announced  that once disaster  relief efforts are concluded, the
Ministry of Examination will contact local governments in eastern and southern
Taiwan to find out more about what types of people are needed to prevent future
disasters.</P>
      <P>Aside from hydraulic engineers, the government also lacks experts in land
restoration and organization, disaster relief and soil and water conservation,
and Tung said the Ministry of Examination will soon organize other examinations
to meet this demand.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Examination Yuan has encouraged its staff to donate  one  day  of
pay  to relief  efforts,  while  Deputy Secretary-General Lee Jih-Shyan and his
disaster relief squad arrived at the disaster relief center at Cishan Senior
High School in Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>They reported that people there were in urgent need of relief volunteers, daily
commodities and trauma therapy. The second relief squad will bring medical
assistance to the south on Friday.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot battered Taiwan last weekend, dumping a year's worth of rainfall
on some areas in three days, triggering severe flooding and deadly landslides.</P>
      <P>The death toll from the disaster had risen to at least 116 as of 10 p.m.
Thursday, with 45 injured and 59 reported missing, according to the Central
Emergency Operation Center.</P>

    <HEADLINE>All S-70C helicopters deployed for rescue work: Air Force</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Air Force Command Headquarters said Friday that all of its 11 S-70C
helicopters have been deployed for rescue work in the aftermath of Typhoon
Morokat, and have not been reserved for use by the president and government
officials, as the media has reported.</P>
      <P>The statement came in response to a report Friday in the China Times, which
claimed that two of the S-70Cs had been pulled from the rescue operations and
were being kept on standby to transport President Ma Ying-jeou and Minister of
Defense Chen Chao-min.</P>
      <P>One of the helicopters left from Songshan Air Force Base on Thursday night and
the other on Friday morning for the Chiayi Air Force Base from where they both
embarked on missions to rescue stranded typhoon victims, according to the
command headquarters.</P>
      <P>The China Times claimed that this action was taken in reaction to its attempts
Thursday night to confirm with the command headquarters the information in its
news report.</P>
      <P>The command headquarters said that airspace and air traffic in the disaster
areas have become congested and it had therefore issued air traffic rules for
its helicopters to regulate landings and takeoffs.</P>
      <P>Since Typhoon Morakot hit Taiwan on Aug. 8, the Air Force has sent out 363
flights, rescued 1,254 stranded victims, flown 103 patients to hospital, and
transported 143 medical personnel and 60,785 kilos of relief supplies, the
command headquarters said.</P>
      <P>However, it only mentioned the number of flights, but not the actual number of
aircraft flying the missions.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan public has become quite sensitive to rescue aircraft issues since
helicopter accident occurred three days ago. The UH-1H rescue helicopter from
the National Airborne Service Corps hit a mountainside and crashed into a valley
near the aboriginal settlement of Sandimen at 3:30 p.m., killing the three crew
members aboard.</P>
      <P>Following the accident, the corps grounded all of its UH-1H helicopters for
inspection.</P>

      <P>Government officials in southern counties ravaged by Typhoon Morakot have urged
local residents to stop donating relief supplies as their warehouses are now
full of goods.</P>
      <P>"We stopped accepting relief supply donations today as our storage centers are
filled with many kinds of daily necessities, such as bottled water, instant
noodles and powdered milk, " said an official with the Pingtung County
government's  Social Affairs Department Friday.</P>
      <P>The county has opened 26 temporary shelters to accommodate 1,700-plus displaced
typhoon victims after Morakot-triggered flooding swamped its coastal towns and
landslides overran its mountainous villages, the official said.</P>
      <P>"Steady streams of donated relief supplies have continued flowing into our
disaster response centers from around Taiwan after the news media gave prominent
coverage to typhoon victims' woes," the official said. "Now we have sufficient
supplies of relief goods and no longer need any donations."</P>
      <P>The county government has also received NT$100 million in cash donations, the
official said.</P>
      <P>"To help those who were rendered homeless by the natural disaster to rebuild
their homes, cash donations are still welcome, " said the official, who also
appealed for more volunteers to clean up the environment.</P>
      <P>"Some 300 volunteers have joined the cleanup and disinfection drive, but we need
more, " the official said. He also asked for people to contribute cleaning
equipment to speed up the recovery effort.</P>
      <P>Neighboring Kaohsiung County,  which was also hit hard by Morakot-triggered
flooding and landslides, echoed Pingtung's call to halt donations of daily
necessities.</P>
      <P>"If we need any special disaster relief equipment, such as life-saving equipment
and generators, we will post the information on our official Web site, " said Wu
Li-hsueh, director of the county government's Social Affairs Department.</P>
      <P>The Red Cross Society also said it has collected enough supplies for typhoon-
affected people in major disaster zones, including the southern counties of
Chiayi, Tainan, Pingtung and Kaohsiung as well as the eastern county of Taitung.</P>
      <P>"We will deliver all relief goods to affected regions through our volunteers as
soon as possible," said a spokesman for the charity.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's share prices continued their winning streak Friday to close 0.49
percent higher, on hopes that the Cabinet's plan to allocate a special budget of
NT$200 billion for disaster relief in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot would
give a boost to the country's economy.</P>
      <P>The weighted index, the market's key barometer, gained 34.55 points to close at
7,069.51.</P>
      <P>Although Morgan Stanley Capital International decreased its weight on the Taiex,
the local bourse opened high at 7,091.82 in line with Wall Street's overnight
gains and the rallies of regional stock markets.</P>
      <P>The Taiex later reached  the day's high of 7,132.33  but subsequently retreated
to the day's low of 7,062.49 due to the emergence of selling pressure.</P>
      <P>The local market has added 176 points in the week since southern Taiwan was hit
by Typhoon Morakot, which triggered the most severe flooding in the country in
50 years.</P>
      <P>A total of 4.55 billion shares changed hands on market turnover of NT$124.04
billion (US$3.78 billion).</P>
      <P>Six of the eight major stock categories gained ground, with textile shares
moving up the most at 3.2 percent. Cement stocks rose 1.8 percent, foodstuff
issues and plastics and chemicals shares each advanced 1.7 percent, construction
shares surged 1.6 percent, and machinery and electronics shares moved up 0.1
percent.</P>
      <P>Paper and pulp issues remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>Only one of the eight major stock categories, banking and financial shares, lost
ground with a 0.4 percent drop.</P>
      <P>Gainers outnumbered losers 1,243 to 1,118, with 192 stocks remaining unchanged.</P>
      <P>Foreign institutional investors were net buyers of NT$5.03 billion worth of
shares.</P>
      <P>One analyst said that although the index rebounded to above 7,000 and moved
toward this year's high of 7,185, the market would advance further only if
turnover rises above NT$160 billion.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Villagers in Chiayi County's Meishan township, who have been stranded for seven
days since Typhoon Morakot, raised smoke signals Friday in an attempt to attract
attention and be evacuated.</P>
      <P>Being cut off from the outside world for days and their supply of food and
potable water exhausted, the villagers in the remote community of Chuantsaiser
sent the smoke signals, which in the past were used only to issue warnings or
war alarms, said a local resident surnamed Yeh via a civil band radio.</P>
      <P>To their chagrin, their smoke signals did not draw any rescue helicopters to
their location. They returned to their muddy homes and made plans for their next
meal -- probably bamboo shoots that they planned to dig up, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang Ching-hui, formerly a rescuer, said he has lived in Taihe
Village in Meishan township for nearly half a century but had never seen any
natural disaster as devastating as the flooding and landslides triggered by
Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Wang said as far as he knew, four residents in the tribal community of
Youcheliao had been buried alive by mudslides and their bodies were still there,
while some 80 tribal people in the Chengmikao community remained stranded
without any supply of food or water.</P>
      <P>He said some deep valleys were still completely cut off from rescue or relief
efforts because massive landslides knocked out roads in the area. If villagers
need to venture out, they will have to travel by foot from Meishan township via
neighboring Yunlin or Nantou counties.</P>
      <P>To reach Youcheliao and Chengmikao communities -- the hardest-hit areas in
Meishan township -- rescuers would have to cross the Chingshui River first and
then navigate through broken mountain roads for another two hours, Wang said.</P>
      <P>As of 10 a.m. Friday, the storm had left 117 people dead, 45 people injured and
59 still unaccounted  for islandwide.  The casualties included three rescuers
who were killed Tuesday when their helicopter crashed in mountainous Wutai
township in Pingtung County.</P>

      <P>Over 300 residents in Namasia, a remote mountainous township in southern Taiwan,
were finally evacuated Friday after being trapped for several days in their
Typhoon Morakot-devastated homeland, but many others refused to depart.</P>
      <P>Many of the 362 Namasia evacuees broke down in tears as they bade farewell to
their small town in Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>They were airlifted by military helicopters to the county's Cishan township in
several groups.</P>
      <P>An emotional old man, surnamed Hsu, was dismayed at having to leave his
hometown.</P>
      <P>"I have grown up on this land. I am sad to leave. I will definitely return some
day," he grumbled as the chopper he was aboard drifted away from the typhoon-
battered town that faced another threat Friday -- the possible bursting of a big
barrier lake in its vicinity.</P>
      <P>Some 600 other people living in neighboring towns along the Laonong River in the
county's mountainous region were also evacuated Friday  out of concern  that
the barrier  lake  created  by Morakot-triggered mudslides and torrents over the
past week could rupture at any minute.</P>
      <P>Although the aboriginal Namasia township was almost ruined by the recent storm,
several hundreds of its residents still refused to be evacuated.</P>
      <P>Most of them are residing in the township's Minsheng First and Minsheng Second
villages.</P>
      <P>"They do not know that only their two villages were left relatively unscathed by
Morakot while all other villages were inundated by mudflows and debris, " said
Chu Wen-hua, a Namasia villager who was evacuated earlier in the day. "If a new
storm comes, I'm afraid the two villages won't be able to withstand it."</P>
      <P>Therefore, Chu said, eight influential Namasia residents will return to their
town Saturday to persuade other people living in the town to evacuate to safety

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Friday that the Executive Yuan will create an ad
hoc committee next week to coordinate  various  reconstruction  programs  in
southern  and southeastern Taiwan, which have been devastated by Typhoon
Morakot.</P>
      <P>The executive branch will also draft a special budget bill to finance post-
disaster rehabilitation and reconstruction projects as financial losses from the
typhoon damage have topped an estimated NT$110 billion (US$3.33 billion), Liu
said.</P>
      <P>Because figure is far more than the Executive Yuan can draw on from its annual
budget, the Cabinet will draft a budget bill in accordance with the existing
Disaster Relief and Response Act to finance various rehabilitation and
reconstruction projects, the premier said.</P>
      <P>The draft budget bill will be ready for a review at the Executive Yuan's weekly
meeting next Thursday and will then be referred to the Legislature for
screening, Liu said.</P>
      <P>According to the premier, Legislative Yuan Wang Jin-pyng has promised to push
for lawmakers to screen the budget bill as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In response, Wang said the Legislature will decide whether to convene an
extraordinary meeting to deliberate the special budget bill after receiving it

      <P>Liu said Wednesday that the government can redirect more than NT$40 billion
(US$1.21 billion) from its annual budget toward post-disaster rehabilitation
projects.</P>
      <P>But damage from the typhoon has far exceeded the original estimates, he said,
necessitating the drafting of a special budget.</P>
      <P>As of 3 p.m., the official death toll from Morakot had surged to 118, with 57
listed as missing and 45 injured, according to statistics released by the

      <P>Deputy Foreign Minister Andrew Hsia on Friday rebutted an earlier statement by
the defense minister that the U.S. and Japan had declined to provide Taiwan with
helicopters to assist in disaster relief efforts, saying that the two countries
were still assessing the possibility.</P>
      <P>Defense Minister Chen Chao-min said earlier Friday that the U.S. and Japan would
not offer Taiwan specialized helicopters capable of transporting heavy payloads
because they did not have the range to fly to Taiwan from Guam, where the U.S.
helicopters are stationed, or Japan.</P>
      <P>But Hsia said the two countries  have initially responded positively to Taiwan's
requests for assistance to help with rescue and relief operations in the wake of
Typhoon Morakot, and that the helicopters were still on the table.</P>
      <P>From what I know, they are still assessing the possibilities. The U.S. and Japan
did not say that such a requirement is not doable. Everything is still under
negotiation, Hsia told reporters after attending a ceremony to celebrate
Singapore's 44th National Day.</P>
      <P>Asked how the international community is responding to Taiwans list of disaster
relief needs, Hsia said that the Foreign Ministry has received a very positive
response but will wait for individual governments to announce what they can
provide.</P>
      <P>Naohiro Tsutsumi, director-general of the Taipei Office of the Interchange
Association -- the de facto Japanese embassy in Taiwan in the absence of
diplomatic relations -- told the Central News Agency that he would not comment
on specific listed items but said Japan is weighing all the requirements.</P>
      <P>Japan is now in the process of considering the possibility of our response to
the requirements. We have to wait for Tokyo to reach a conclusion,Tsutsumi said.</P>
      <P>Japan responded quickly to news of the devastation that Typhoon Morakot wrought
in southern Taiwan by expressing condolences to the victims, making a donation
of 10 million Japanese yen to disaster relief efforts and offering to provide
additional assistance if necessary.</P>
      <P>After being lambasted by the media over the past few days for declining offers
of foreign assistance, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs  (MOFA)  apologized
Friday  for telling  its overseas representative offices to politely decline
international assistance such as supplies and rescuers in the wake of Typhoon
Morakot, describing it as a technical error made out of negligence.</P>
      <P>Tsutsumi, however, dismissed media reports that Japan's offer of aid was
rejected by Taiwan, saying that his country always understood that Taiwan would
have to first clarify its needs before approaching the international community.</P>
      <P>He noted that Junzo Yamamoto, the Japanese delegation leader of the Japan-based
Asia-Pacific ParliamentariansUnion that opened its 40th annual conference in
Taipei Aug. 11, told President Ma Ying-jeou earlier in the week that Japan had
the intention to help, an offer that was well received by Ma, who thanked Tokyo
for the offer.</P>
      <P>"It's very strange to interpret Ma's response as a rejection, Tsutsumi said.We
don't think so.</P>
      <P>"Japan remains very willing and happy to help Taiwan, as it is one of the most
important and friendly countries of Japan in the region,he added.</P>

      <P>A policeman in flood- and landslide- ravaged Liouguei township in Kaohsiung
County, who was airlifted to safety after being stranded on the roof of his
police station for four days, said Friday that he was able to cheat death with
the help of his strong will, devout beliefs and a police raincoat.</P>
      <P>Chang Hui-cheng, resting in a hospital after being rescued Aug. 11, said the
ordeal started Aug. 7, when Typhoon Morakot began dumping heavy rain on his
village of Nanshalu in Namasia township.</P>
      <P>He persuaded tourists in the mountainous area to flee to plains areas as soon as
possible, and they all followed his advice, Chang recalled.</P>
      <P>But villagers were more reluctant to follow his instructions to evacuate,
refusing initially to do so because they believed that Christ would bless them
and they would be OK, Chang lamented.</P>
      <P>But Chang's sense that a calamity that would destroy people's homes would soon
occur unfortunately came to pass.</P>
      <P>He said that when he tried to get some rest after helping with evacuation
efforts, the torrential rain broke windows in the first floor of the police
station, sending him rushing to grab his raincoat and run up to the roof of the
three-story building.</P>
      <P>Quickly realizing the roof did not provide any shelter against the storm, he
simply sat there and relied on the raincoat for protection from the rain, while
holding steel columns to prevent himself from being washed away by floodwaters.</P>
      <P>During his four-day ordeal, he sometimes felt a desire to sleep, but he realized
that if he succumbed to the temptation, he would die. "The waterproof raincoat
saved my life, as it kept me warm, " Chang said.</P>
      <P>After having a bowl of instant noodles Aug. 7 noon, Chang did not consume
anything except rainwater until when he was rescued.</P>
      <P>"Aside from God, there was nobody I could ask for help when I was trapped, "
Chang stressed. He said he continuously prayed to God to protect the police
station while he was on the roof.</P>
      <P>His opportunity to end his ordeal came on Aug. 11, when he saw a helicopter
flying by. He attracted its attention by waving a red cloth and was flown to
safety.</P>
      <P>Almost at the same time, Chang's wife, children and a number of villagers were
also airlifted to safety, Chang added.</P>
      <P>The policeman, who applied to retire in April, said the first thing he wants to
do after retiring will be to rebuild his home.</P>

      <P>The National Palace Museum (NPM) said Friday it will donate 15 percent of its
daily giftware sales during an exhibition of artworks from the Qing Dynasty's
Yongzheng period for post-Typhoon Morakot recovery projects.</P>
      <P>NPM Director Chou Kung-shin unveiled the donation program at a news conference
in which she joined with Zheng Xinmiao, director of the Palace Museum in
Beijing, in announcing via a teleconference the two museums' first cooperation
deal -- co-hosting the Yongzheng period arts exhibition at the NPM in suburban
Taipei in October.</P>
      <P>The Yongzheng exhibition, which is scheduled to open Oct. 7 and run through Jan.
10, 2010, will mark the first time that ancient Chinese art treasures held by
the two museums have ever been displayed under the same roof since the People's

      <P>During the Yongzheng exhibition period, Chou said the NPM's giftware shop will
donate 15 percent of its daily revenues for the post-typhoon reconstruction and
rehabilitation projects.</P>
      <P>"An estimated NT$25 million is expected to be raised from the program during the
exhibition period for the relief cause, " Chou said.</P>
      <P>The museum also donated Friday's income of its food and beverage sales
department, worth about NT$1 million, for post-typhoon relief projects.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a Red Cross Society box was installed at the museum's gift shop
Friday to accept donations by visitors to the museum, which is one of Taiwan's
most popular tourist attractions among visitors from other countries around the
world.</P>
      <P>"Many Chinese tourists contributed funds into the box this afternoon," said an

      <P>Ron Libby, a coordinator with the U.S. Agency for International Development

Friday to evaluate the devastation Typhoon Morakot had wrought on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During his stay, Libby will travel to regions hardest hit by Morakot-triggered
flooding and landslides, including Pingtung and Kaohsiung counties in southern
Taiwan, according to a statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA).</P>
      <P>Libby is scheduled to stay for three to four days, during which he will assess
the extent and scale of the destruction the storm brought to Taiwan and the
resources, facilities or equipment that foreign countries can contribute  to
post-disaster  relief and rehabilitation operations.</P>
      <P>His assessment will serve as a basis for the U.S. government to determine how to
help Taiwan, the MOFA statement added.</P>

      <P>A policeman in flood- and landslide- ravaged Liouguei township in Kaohsiung
County, who was airlifted to safety after being stranded on the roof of his
police station for four days, said Friday that he was able to cheat death with
the help of his strong will, devout beliefs and a police raincoat.</P>
      <P>Chang Hui-cheng, resting in a hospital after being rescued Aug. 11, said the
ordeal started Aug. 7, when Typhoon Morakot began dumping heavy rain on his
village of Nanshalu in Namasia township.</P>
      <P>He persuaded tourists in the mountainous area to flee to plains areas as soon as
possible, and they all followed his advice, Chang recalled.</P>
      <P>But villagers were more reluctant to follow his instructions to evacuate,
refusing initially to do so because they believed that Christ would bless them
and they would be OK, Chang lamented.</P>
      <P>But Chang's sense that a calamity that would destroy people's homes would soon
occur unfortunately came to pass.</P>
      <P>He said that when he tried to get some rest after helping with evacuation
efforts, the torrential rain broke windows in the first floor of the police
station, sending him rushing to grab his raincoat and run up to the roof of the
three-story building.</P>
      <P>Quickly realizing the roof did not provide any shelter against the storm, he
simply sat there and relied on the raincoat for protection from the rain, while
holding steel columns to prevent himself from being washed away by floodwaters.</P>
      <P>During his four-day ordeal, he sometimes felt a desire to sleep, but he realized
that if he succumbed to the temptation, he would die. "The waterproof raincoat
saved my life, as it kept me warm, " Chang said.</P>
      <P>After having a bowl of instant noodles Aug. 7 noon, Chang did not consume
anything except rainwater until when he was rescued.</P>
      <P>"Aside from God, there was nobody I could ask for help when I was trapped, "
Chang stressed. He said he continuously prayed to God to protect the police
station while he was on the roof.</P>
      <P>His opportunity to end his ordeal came on Aug. 11, when he saw a helicopter
flying by. He attracted its attention by waving a red cloth and was flown to
safety.</P>
      <P>Almost at the same time, Chang's wife, children and a number of villagers were
also airlifted to safety, Chang added.</P>
      <P>The policeman, who applied to retire in April, said the first thing he wants to
do after retiring will be to rebuild his home.</P>

      <P>The National Palace Museum (NPM) said Friday it will donate 15 percent of its

exhibition period for the relief cause, " Chou said.</P>

department, worth about NT$1 million, for post-typhoon relief projects.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Experts urged the government Saturday to prohibit people from living in areas at
risk of mudslides.</P>
      <P>The experts told CNA that as the typhoon season is not yet over, people who have
been evacuated from their settlements in mountainous areas in the wake of
Typhoon Morakot should be banned from returning to their homes because of the
danger that remains of further mudslides.</P>
      <P>Morakot, which battered the island Aug. 7-9, dumped about 2,500mm of
precipitation -- the equivalent of a whole year's rainfall -- on southern
Taiwan, triggering the most serious flooding and mudslides in five decades.</P>
      <P>In terms of the government's efforts to seek foreign help with its search and
rescue operation, Hung Hung-chih, a professor in the Department of Real Estate
and Built Environment of National Taipei University, said the efforts have come
too late.</P>
      <P>"The best window of opportunity to find survivors is within 72 hours of a
disaster," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>The government has come under increasing fire for rejecting foreign aid in the
immediate aftermath of the disaster and for waiting several days before flip-
flopping on its decision.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has amassed a lot of experience in relief operations since the earthquake
of Sept. 21, 1999, Hung went on, adding that unfortunately, this experience has
not been translated into standard operating  procedures  that could help the
country enrich its experience and drive performance improvements.</P>
      <P>"As a result, the government has failed to deal with the present tragedy
effectively," he said.</P>
      <P>The top priority now is to accommodate those people whose settlements have been
destroyed by mudslides.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsu Shi-jung, a professor in the Department of Land Economics at
National Chengchi University in Taipei, alerted the government to the many
barrier lakes formed in valleys by the mudslides.</P>
      <P>"They could burst under the weight of the water they are holding back, leading
to more flooding," he noted.</P>
      <P>Both Hung and Hsu warned the administration against letting the evacuees return
to their mudslide-destroyed settlements, at least during the next three months,
when the island is still vulnerable to typhoons.</P>
      <P>It will take five years for the terrain in the devastated areas to firm up and
only after then should reconstruction even be considered, the experts said.</P>
      <P>They suggested that the government relocate residents of these areas to safe
places and help them resettle by finding them jobs so that they do not have to
move back into their dangerous mountain settlements.</P>

      <P>The Institute of Forensic Medicine under the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) has been

what they see as administrative inefficiency in the methods used to do the DNA
testing on the remains of people drowned or killed by landslides.</P>
      <P>The MOJ said the district prosecutors offices in the Kaohsiung, Tainan and

      <P>The United States has received Taiwan's request for additional relief assistance
in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot and is evaluating how to best to provide
help as quickly as possible, a U.S. State Department official said Friday.</P>
      <P>"We are currently considering how best to assist Taiwan with its urgent
humanitarian needs," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said during a
daily press briefing.</P>
      <P>"We'll compare what we are able to provide with what might be flowing from other
countries in the region," he added.</P>
      <P>According to a list released by Taiwan's Foreign Ministry, items most needed
include specialized helicopters and pilots capable of transporting very heavy
payloads such as excavators and heavy gravel trucks, as well as 1,000
prefabricated houses to provide temporary refuge for homeless flood victims.</P>
      <P>In addition, the country is requesting 100,000 bottles of phenolic disinfectant
or Benzyl-p-chloropherno, 200,000 Aquatab water purification tablets,  100,000
liters of sterilizing agent for sanitation, 1,000 portable sterilizers and 500
automatic sterilizers.</P>
      <P>Jason Yuan, Taiwan's representative to the United States, told a news conference
held in the U.S. capital that he was deeply touched that Washington is taking
Taiwan's request very seriously.</P>
      <P>According to Yuan, the U.S. government called an inter-agency meeting to discuss
the matter immediately after receiving Taiwan's request for assistance, in the
hope that a feasible resolution could be reached by the end of the week.</P>
      <P>Although the U.S. side indicated that it does not have the kind of helicopters
requested by Taiwan, it is studying the possibility of dismantling excavators
and airlifting them in pieces to the disaster areas, Yuan said.</P>
      <P>Yuan said Washington was impressed by Taiwan's generous donations in the
aftermath of Hurricane Katrina that battered the United States in 2005 and is
very concerned about the disaster brought about by Morakot in Taiwan last week.</P>
      <P>Besides donating US$250,000 to the Republic of China Red Cross Society,
Washington has also sent an official in charge of disaster response assistance

Morakot had reached nearly NT$11.8 billion (US$358.8 million) as of Saturday,
according to statistics released that day by the Council of Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>The figure came close to that of the NT$18.8 billion lost in 1996 when Typhoon
Herb devastated Taiwan, bringing the worst agricultural disaster in the
country's history.</P>
      <P>Morakot-triggered damage to crops and animal husbandry production alone had
accounted for nearly NT$5.1 billion, according to the latest COA statistics.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the aquaculture sector incurred an estimated NT$4.1 billion in
financial losses, a new 18-year high for losses due to a single storm.</P>
      <P>The statistics show that 6,925 hectares of fish farms in southern Taiwan were
severely damaged by Morakot, the worst typhoon to hit the south in 50 years. Of
this area, 1,231 hectares comprised coastal fishponds, the COA said.</P>
      <P>The COA estimated that damage to crops had amounted to NT$3.74 billion, with 27
percent of the crops on 68,202 hectares of farmland lost.</P>
      <P>Bananas suffered the worst damage, with 5,849 hectares ravaged by strong winds
and flooding; followed by papayas, guavas, rice, sweetsops, jujubes, bamboo
shoots and leafy vegetables.</P>
      <P>Poultry and livestock losses amounted to NT$1.36 billion, with 120,633 hogs, 5.9
million chickens and 1.17 million ducks perishing in the storm.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 2,106 hectares of farmland, worth an estimated NT$1.9 billion, were
washed away, with the eastern county of Taitung suffering the most with 646
hectares buried under debris or washed away.</P>
      <P>The volume of washed-away farmland had reached 628 hectares in Pingtung County
and 451 hectares in Kaohsiung County.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Sponsorship from Taiwan changes lives: African beneficiaries</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Three African beneficiaries under World Vision Taiwan's sponsorship program have
traveled to Taiwan to express their appreciation and share how Taiwanese people
have helped them change their lives.</P>
      <P>World Vision Taiwan, the local chapter of the international Christian charity
group, invited the three special guests from Ethiopia, Rwanda and Sierra Leone
to attend its 20th 30-Hour Famine 2009, a two-day event that opened Saturday at
the National Taiwan Sport University.</P>
      <P>Two of the visitors told CNA in a recent interview that the assistance they
received from Taiwan not only brought hope to their devastated lives but also
helped them get back on their feet and out of danger and poverty.</P>
      <P>"It is very difficult for me to tell my story. I owe so much to the Taiwanese
people who helped me and every day I pray for God's blessings for them," said
Alex Gahigi, a survivor of the 1994 Rwanda genocide.</P>
      <P>Gahigi, who was only eight when the genocide happened, was forced to shoulder
the responsibility of taking care of his nine-month-old brother and two-year-old
sister after his parents were killed.</P>
      <P>Hunger was a common occurrence for Gahigi, who said that a single meal a day for
him and his siblings would be considered a luxury. The only thing they could do
was beg for food or do simple chores in exchange for food, he added.</P>
      <P>"I could not see what my future held after losing my parents, but God was so
merciful that I and my brother and sister survived the humanitarian disaster by
fleeting to Congo, " said Gahigi, whose expressionless face bears testament to
his harsh and difficult past.</P>
      <P>After joining the Orphan and Vulnerable Children project under World Vision's
Buliza Area Development Program six years ago, Gahigi trained to become a
carpenter and could finally make a decent living making furniture. He is now
married with two children of his own.</P>
      <P>Mohamed Tamba Kambo, a 19-year-old from Sierra Leone, has a difference
experience to that of most people. Instead of being included in the program as
an underprivileged child, Kambo ran into a delegation from World Vision Taiwan
in May while he was looking for diamonds to scrape a living.</P>
      <P>Because of poverty, he was forced to drop out of school and spend 10 hours a day
in a deserted diamond mine looking for something valuable. However, he found
only one tiny rock worth just US$3 in two weeks.</P>
      <P>Kambo told CNA that World Vision Taiwan not only helped him go back to school
but also set his life back on the right track.</P>
      <P>"Education is very important because it brings hope to people for a better
future, " said Kambo, who majors in English and who aspires to become a teacher
or doctor.</P>
      <P>Asked what messages they would like to tell the participants in the 30-Hour
Famine, Kambo said that without experiencing hunger, one just takes abundant
food for granted, while Gahigi noted that "when you are hungry, you are
vulnerable to everything."</P>

      <P>World Vision Taiwan, the local chapter of the international Christian charity,
kicked off Saturday its 20th 30-Hour Famine 2009, which was attended by some
15,000 people seeking to promote public awareness of the need to combat the
global food crisis.</P>
      <P>This year's rally is of special meaning in the wake of Typhoon Morakot, which
brought devastation to southern areas of Taiwan the previous week, and the
participants will be praying for the typhoon survivors and appealing for more
funds for relief and rehabilitation efforts.</P>
      <P>"Over the years, whenever disaster has struck, World Vision has responded
swiftly, bringing urgently needed food and supplies to children and families
faced with crisis," World Vision Taiwan said in a press release.</P>
      <P>"The number of 30 Hour Famine participants has increased annually and the
campaign has touched countless lives," it added.</P>
      <P>Now in its 20th year, the rally this year is taking place at gymnasium of
National Taiwan Sport University and will run a full 30 hours.</P>
      <P>Artists from major record labels have also geared up to support the event, which
is part of the group's global movement to involve people, especially youngsters,
who fast for 30 hours to raise money for people suffering from famine in poor
countries, according to World Vision Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Various celebrities and spokespeople, including 30 Hour Famine "ambassador" Wang
Lee-hom and several news anchors were taking part to cheer on the fasters and
share their experiences, as well as to encourage the participants to continue
their support for people affected by humanitarian crises in Taiwan and around
the world, according to World Vision Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The program is one of World Vision Taiwan's three principal fund-raising
activities, the other two being a child sponsorship program that helps poor
children in Taiwan and abroad and a program that assists local and overseas
development projects.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan chapter of World Vision was established 43 years ago.</P>

      <P>The United States will send heavy-lift helicopters along with other relief
supplies to Taiwan in the coming days in the wake of Typhoon Morakot, the
Taipei-based American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>"The U.S.  has agreed to provide  U.S.  personnel-operated heavy-lift
helicopters and other materials to support the relief operation," AIT Press
Officer Christopher Kavanagh told CNA.</P>
      <P>Details such as the number of choppers and when and from where they will be
dispatched were still being worked out, he added.</P>
      <P>In addition to a donation of US$250,000 made by the U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID) Aug. 12,  Ron Libby,  a coordinator with USAID
in charge of disaster response assistance and support, arrived in Taiwan Friday
and was scheduled to travel to regions hardest hit by Morakot, including
Pingtung and Kaohsiung counties in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Libby is tasked with assessing the extent and scale of the destruction and the
resources, facilities and equipment that foreign countries can contribute to
post-disaster relief and rehabilitation operations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been receiving all various humanitarian care from friendly countries
worldwide in the wake of the typhoon, with assistance and resources from the
international community continuing to pour into the country.</P>
      <P>The Australian government announced that day that it will donate
US$168,600-worth of emergency supplies to assist the storm victims and pledged
to provide sanitation supplies to combat water-borne diseases caused by
flooding.</P>
      <P>According to a press statement released by the Australian Agency for
International Development, the donation will include 200,000 water purification
tablets, 5,000 large buckets for treating water and for general household use,
100 sanitizer spray packs that hold disinfectant and repellent for spraying
around buildings to stop disease, insects and rodents.</P>
      <P>China Airlines will transport the shipment, which is scheduled to arrive in the

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government announced Saturday schooling and aid measures for students
affected by Typhoon Morakot to ensure their education is not interrupted.</P>
      <P>Information provided by the Central Emergency Operation Center shows that due to
damage wrought by the typhoon, 20 elementary and junior high schools will not be
able to reopen in time for the start of the new school year in September.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, students from these schools will be allowed to attend
schools in areas in which where their relatives live, in other counties or
cities, or near their temporary shelters, without being subject to normal school
district restrictions, said Deputy Minister of Education Wu Tsai-shung.</P>
      <P>If none of these three options fit the students' needs, the Ministry of
Education (MOE) will open temporary classrooms at the various shelters, Wu said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the MOE will provide a variety of subsidies for the affected
students.</P>
      <P>Elementary and junior high school students will each receive NT$1,500 (US$45.73)
to NT$1,600 per semester for up to three years in general subsidies  and
NT$1,500 per month in lunch subsidies, according to the MOE.</P>
      <P>Senior high school, college and university students will be able to postpone
their enrollment and will be granted full tuition and miscellaneous fee waivers
for up to three years.</P>
      <P>While senior high school students will each receive NT$23,600 per semester in
living cost subsidies for up to three years, college and university students
will get full dormitory fee waivers for one year.</P>
      <P>For all levels of students, the relief allowance will range from NT$5,000 to
NT$10,000, while subsidies ranging from NT$10,000 to NT$60,000 will be provided
on the death or injury of students or their parents, the MOE said.</P>

      <P>Villagers who survived the destruction of Siaolin village in Kaohsiung County
went back to the site of the destroyed village Saturday to pay tribute to the
hundreds of villagers buried under mud and debris.</P>
      <P>Five days after last Friday's disaster, Kaohsiung Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing had
said that some 300 villagers were still missing and that rescue teams reckoned
there was no hope of finding anyone else alive.</P>
      <P>Following the folk custom in which the spirits of the deceased should be
comforted on the seventh day of their departure, families of the victims
prepared slippers and food for the dead on their journey to the other world.</P>
      <P>While the heartbroken villagers prayed that the bodies dead will not be
disturbed, Yang agreed to investigate the possibility of establishing a memorial
park on the site of Siaolin, a river valley scenic spot.</P>
      <P>Siaolin was not the only village in the county to be devastated as a result of
Typhoon Morakot. Hundreds of residents of Liukuei village were also still
missing, and rescuers have turned from rescuing survivors to unearthing corpses.</P>
      <P>Although there were still hundreds of villagers in remote mountain regions
facing the threat of further mudslides, the presence of the police and military
had somewhat alleviated their fear of being cut off again.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, President Ma Ying-jeou, who visited the damaged village of Shuili in
Nantou County Saturday, apologized for the government's failure to do a quicker
and better job.</P>
      <P>He said that there were limitations and difficulties, while the rainy weather
had delayed the evacuation of isolated villagers.</P>
      <P>He elaborated that in the first four days following the disaster, only 1,500
villagers were rescued because bad weather restricted the operations of the
helicopters. As the weather improved, however, 4,700 villagers were evacuated
over the following two days.</P>
      <P>To help residents in the devastated areas clean up and resettle the homeless,
cadets from military schools and the police academy had also been mobilized, in
addition to volunteers from religious and social welfare groups.</P>

      <P>Fifty-nine countries around the world, as well as 19 international organizations
and foreign civic groups have made donations for the relief of flood-stricken
families in southern Taiwan, the Central Emergency Operation Center (CEOC) said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>The accumulated donations had reached NT$54.72 million (US$1.66 million) as of 3
a.m. Saturday, the CEOC said, citing statistics from the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.</P>
      <P>Twenty-two countries that maintain diplomatic ties with the Republic of China
had offered their condolences for those who died in the worst flooding in 50
years in southern Taiwan over the past week, while 37 countries with no
diplomatic links with Taiwan, such as the United States,  Japan,  Canada and
Britain had also expressed condolences, the CEOC said.</P>
      <P>According to the CEOC, the international organizations that had expressed
concern about the flooding included the United Nations Office  for  the
Coordination  of Humanitarian  Affairs,  the Asian-Pacific Parliamentarians'
Union, Feed the Children and Food for the Poor.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Singapore had donated NT$1.14 million-worth of supplies  for
medical  treatment,  while  Israel  had donated water-cleaners and water
transport equipment, the CEOC said, noting that the U.S. Agency for
International Development had sent a representative to Taiwan to assess the
damage and the kinds of assistance it can offer.</P>
      <P>The European Union will send representatives to Taiwan Aug. 18 to conduct a
similar evaluation, the CEOC said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Pope Benedict XVI donated US$50,000 that day for the typhoon victims.</P>
      <P>The donation was handed over by Monsignor Paul Russell, charge d'affaires of the
Holy See Embassy, to Vice Minister of the Interior Tzeng Chung-ming. The Holy
See is the only country in Europe that has diplomatic links with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Roman Catholic Metropolitan Archdiocese of Taipei also held a ceremony at
the Holy Family Catholic Church in Taipei City earlier in the day to pray for
the flood victims, which was attended by Russell and Tzeng.</P>
      <P>Citing the pope, Russell said that "Taiwan has many friends. It is not a lonely
island."</P>
      <P>The prayers were initiated by Cardinal Shan Kuo-hsi, who also urged all
believers in Taiwan to make donations at the more-than 1,000 Catholic churches
around the island for the relief efforts.</P>
      <P>Archbishop of Taipei Hung Shan-chuan suggested that everyone in the country
should donate NT$1 each day and continue the donations for 64 days in a row to
remind themselves that their fellow countrymen were still suffering.</P>
      <P>In addition to the donation campaign, all Catholic medical institutes and social
welfare groups have dispatched volunteer teams to the affected areas to help the
rescue and relief efforts, according to Hung.</P>
      <P>Fatalities from Morakot had increased to 121 as of 8 a.m. Saturday, with 53
reported missing and 45 injured, according to official CEOC tallies, which did
not include those who might have been killed by landslides in Siaolin village in
Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>According to the CEOC, there were estimated 169 households in Siaolin, with 398
people believed to remain unaccounted for after the whole village was buried in
mud and debris. No efforts to begin digging the village out had begun as of
Saturday.</P>

      <P>Massive flooding caused by Typhoon Morakot in southern Taiwan since Aug. 8 has
badly damaged the scenic Alishan area -- one of the most popular tourist
attractions in Taiwan -- after flood and landslides  smashed  roads and buried
various sightseeing spots.</P>
      <P>The Alishan Highway, which is the main road to the Alishan forest recreation
area, suffered massive cave-ins and losses of the road bed, and the Directorate
General of Highways (DGH) estimated that part of the road could be fixed by
Sept. 5, although the road is not expected to reopen completely until the end of
September.</P>
      <P>Kuo Ching-shuei, a DGH official in charge of construction and repair of roads in
the area, was cited by a local newspaper that it would take at least six months
to one year before big tourist buses will be able to use the road.</P>
      <P>Damage to the Alishan forest railway was even worse, with Yen Mao-sheng, the
official in charge of railway construction affairs at the Chiayi Forest District
Office, assessing that it would take a year to restore the popular scenic
railway.</P>
      <P>Four townships in the Alishan scenic area, including Jhuci, Fanlu, Alishan and
Meishan, received nearly 3,000 mm of rain during the typhoon devastation last
week, the highest precipitation recorded anywhere in the country.</P>
      <P>Restoration of the townships is expected to take many years, as will recovery of
the agriculture and tourism sectors in the area, Fanlu township chief Lou Yin-
chang said.</P>
      <P>The number of tourists visiting the Alishan forest recreation area this year
alone reached 1 million Aug. 4, the highest figure since its inauguration in
1980, thanks to Taiwan's opening to visits by Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tourism Bureau officials noted, however, that most of the country's
other tourism destinations had escaped relatively unscathed from the
devastation.</P>

similar evaluation, the CEOC said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Pope Benedict XVI donated US$50,000 that day for the typhoon victims.</P>
      <P>The donation was handed over by Monsignor Paul Russell, charge d'affaires of the
Holy See Embassy, to Vice Minister of the Interior Tzeng Chung-ming. The Holy
See is the only country in Europe that has diplomatic links with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Roman Catholic Metropolitan Archdiocese of Taipei also held a ceremony at
the Holy Family Catholic Church in Taipei City earlier in the day to pray for
the flood victims, which was attended by Russell and Tzeng.</P>
      <P>Citing the pope, Russell said that "Taiwan has many friends. It is not a lonely
island."</P>
      <P>The prayers were initiated by Cardinal Shan Kuo-hsi, who also urged all
believers in Taiwan to make donations at the more-than 1,000 Catholic churches
around the island for the relief efforts.</P>
      <P>Archbishop of Taipei Hung Shan-chuan suggested that everyone in the country
should donate NT$1 each day and continue the donations for 64 days in a row to
remind themselves that their fellow countrymen were still suffering.</P>
      <P>In addition to the donation campaign, all Catholic medical institutes and social
welfare groups have dispatched volunteer teams to the affected areas to help the
rescue and relief efforts, according to Hung.</P>
      <P>Fatalities from Morakot had increased to 121 as of 8 a.m. Saturday, with 53
reported missing and 45 injured, according to official CEOC tallies, which did
not include those who might have been killed by landslides in Siaolin village in
Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>According to the CEOC, there were estimated 169 households in Siaolin, with 398
people believed to remain unaccounted for after the whole village was buried in
mud and debris. No efforts to begin digging the village out had begun as of
Saturday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Alishan tourism sector sustains severe typhoon damage</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Massive flooding caused by Typhoon Morakot in southern Taiwan since Aug. 8 has
badly damaged the scenic Alishan area -- one of the most popular tourist
attractions in Taiwan -- after flood and landslides  smashed  roads and buried
various sightseeing spots.</P>
      <P>The Alishan Highway, which is the main road to the Alishan forest recreation
area, suffered massive cave-ins and losses of the road bed, and the Directorate
General of Highways (DGH) estimated that part of the road could be fixed by
Sept. 5, although the road is not expected to reopen completely until the end of
September.</P>
      <P>Kuo Ching-shuei, a DGH official in charge of construction and repair of roads in
the area, was cited by a local newspaper that it would take at least six months
to one year before big tourist buses will be able to use the road.</P>
      <P>Damage to the Alishan forest railway was even worse, with Yen Mao-sheng, the
official in charge of railway construction affairs at the Chiayi Forest District
Office, assessing that it would take a year to restore the popular scenic
railway.</P>
      <P>Four townships in the Alishan scenic area, including Jhuci, Fanlu, Alishan and
Meishan, received nearly 3,000 mm of rain during the typhoon devastation last
week, the highest precipitation recorded anywhere in the country.</P>
      <P>Restoration of the townships is expected to take many years, as will recovery of
the agriculture and tourism sectors in the area, Fanlu township chief Lou Yin-
chang said.</P>
      <P>The number of tourists visiting the Alishan forest recreation area this year
alone reached 1 million Aug. 4, the highest figure since its inauguration in
1980, thanks to Taiwan's opening to visits by Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tourism Bureau officials noted, however, that most of the country's
other tourism destinations had escaped relatively unscathed from the
devastation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Post-disaster relief supplies donated by foreign countries continued flowing
into Taiwan Sunday as the country digs itself out of the devastation wrought by
Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>An Emirates Airlines flight arrived in Taipei early in the morning with a batch
of shelter boxes donated by Britain's Shelter Box Trust, which is administered
by the Helston-Lizard Rotary Club in Cornwall, disaster response officials said.</P>
      <P>The shelter boxes,  which will soon be delivered  to the hardest-hit disaster
zones, contain a 10-person tunnel tent, 10 sleeping bags, and accessories such
as a multifuel cooker, water purifier, a spade and rope.</P>
      <P>China Airlines, Taiwan's largest carrier, also airlifted a shipment of emergency
supplies donated by Australia to Taipei early Sunday free of charge.</P>
      <P>Richard Mathews, Australia's deputy representative in Taiwan, handed over the
supplies to Lee Shih-ming, director-general of the East Asian and Pacific
Affairs Department under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a donation ceremony
held at Taoyuan International Airport in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The supplies include 200,000 water purification tablets, 5,040 large buckets for
treating water and for general household use, 100 sanitizer spray packs that
hold disinfectant, and repellent to spray around buildings for disease
prevention.</P>
      <P>Australian  Representative  to Taiwan  Alice Cawte formally presented the
US$168,600 worth of water purification and disinfectant supplies at the Central
Emergency Operation Center in Taipei around noon Sunday to Minister of
Transportation of Communications Mao Chih-kuo.</P>
      <P>Mao, who concurrently serves as the post-disaster response commander, said
Taiwan's government and people are grateful for Australia's donation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Red Cross Society will help deliver the sanitation supplies to disaster
zones for distribution to affected families, Mao said.</P>
      <P>Cawte said the Australian government hopes its emergency supplies can allow
local typhoon victims to enjoy clean drinking water and help combat water-borne
diseases  caused  by Morakot-triggered flooding.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot dumped more than 2500 mm of precipitation -- the equivalent of a
whole year's rainfall -- in southern Taiwan Aug. 7-9, swelling rivers that
washed away bridges and spurring landslides that buried entire villages.</P>
      <P>The storm, one of the worst natural disasters to batter Taiwan in half a
century, had officially killed at least 124 people across Taiwan and left 45
injured and 56 otehrs unaccounted for as of 10 p.m. Saturday.</P>
      <P>Those numbers do not include the potentially hundreds of people believed to have
been buried in landslides in remote mountainous areas of southern Taiwan,
especially in Siaolin village in Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>Agricultural losses from Morakot has exceeded NT$12.24 billion (US$370.91
million) as of 9 a.m. Sunday, the second highest caused by asingle typhoon in
nearly 19 years.</P>
      <P>The amount was only second to NT$18.08 billion in agricultural losses caused by
Typhoon Herb, which rattled Taiwan in August 1996.</P>
      <P>Aquaculture losses as a result of flooding spurred by Morakot had broken all
previous records to top NT$4.13 billion as of Sunday morning.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 59 countries from around the world, as well as 19 international
organizations and foreign civic groups have made donations to help disaster-
stricken families in southern Taiwan, disaster response officials said.</P>
      <P>As of 3 a.m. Saturday, foreign entities had donated NT$54.72 million (US$1.66
million) to the cause, according to tallies released by the Central Emergency
Operation Center.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A team from Taitung County won the Pony League World Series championship
Saturday in Washington County, Pennsylvania, the sixth Taiwanese team to win the
title in the past sixteen years.</P>
      <P>The Taitung team defeated Riverside, California, 12-1 in the title game to
become the first team since 2001 to win the double elimination tournament after
losing its opening game.</P>
      <P>In the final against Riverside, Taiwan trailed 1-0 before erupting for four runs
in the bottom of the third inning. Catcher Ispalidev Lanihu's bases-loaded
single drove in the tying run, and Su Chih-chieh drove in two more with a single
to right. Lanihu scored the fourth run on a groundout.</P>
      <P>Taiwan put the game away in the fourth inning as Chang Yu-cheng's three-run
blast and Su Chih-chieh's two-run homer keyed an eight-run rally, putting the
team ahead 12-1.</P>
      <P>Lai Ta-kuan, who relieved starter Lan Chen-wei to start the fourth inning,
retired Riverside in order in the fifth, and the game was called because of the
10-run rule.</P>
      <P>About 200 Taiwanese expatriates from Pennsylvania and Maryland were there to
root for the Taitung team, composed of students from junior high schools in
rural areas of the southeastern county.</P>
      <P>Manager Wang Kuo-ching could barely hide his excitement over his team's triumph
and praised his team's will and indomitable spirit to come back after losing its
first game of the tournament.</P>
      <P>Taiwan fell to Toa Baja of Puerto Rico 3-1 on Aug. 8, but then beat Bay County,
Michigan, 13-9, and Johnstown, Pennsylvania, 7-3, to set up a showdown with Toa
Baja.</P>
      <P>Having to beat the Puerto Rican team twice in a row to reach the final, Taiwan
defeated Toa Baja 8-3 on Aug. 13, and then 4-2 a day later on a dramatic home
run by Chang Cheng-nan in extra innings.</P>
      <P>The Pony League tournament was for players 13 and 14 years old. Unlike Little
League, the Pony League is composed of two-year age brackets and different sized
diamonds for different age groups.</P>

      <P>At least one U.S. heavy-lift CH-53E helicopter  will arrive in Taiwan Monday to
assist in relief operations in the southern part of the country, which was
devastated by flooding and landslides from Typhoon Morakot, defense officials
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. military is now working to have its CH-53E helicopter take part in
humanitarian post-disaster relief efforts in Taiwan, " said an official with the
Ministry of National Defense (MND) , who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>According to the official, at least one CH-53E helicopter will be delivered by
an amphibious transport dock ship, also known as a landing platform dock, to
waters near Taiwan from where the chopper will fly to the Tainan air base in
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If all goes well, the official said, at least one CH-53E chopper will arrive in
Tainan Monday at the earliest.</P>
      <P>The official would not confirm, however, if the United States will provide one
or two such heavy-lift helicopters.</P>
      <P>"Our two sides are still in close contact to work out relevant details, " the
official said, adding that the Defense Ministry will inform the public once all
technical details are settled.</P>
      <P>As the CH-53E chopper can transport a 16-ton payload, its arrival is expected
to help with relief and rehabilitation  work in mountainous areas that were cut
off from the outside world in the storm, the official added.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot, which dumped more than 2500 mm of precipitation -- the
equivalent of a whole year's rainfall -- in some parts of Taiwan Aug. 7-9,
proved lethal in several remote villages that dot mountains in the southern
counties of Kaohsiung and Pingtung.</P>
      <P>A National Fire Administration official said earlier this week that Taiwan
urgently needs helicopters that can carry cranes and other heavy-duty  machinery
into flood-  and landslide-ravaged mountainous villages to help rescue those who
might still be stranded.</P>
      <P>The storm, one of the worst natural disasters to batter Taiwan in half a
century, had officially killed at least 124 people across Taiwan and left 45
injured and 56 others unaccounted for as of 10 p.m. Saturday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A United States military C-130 transport plane arrived Sunday at Tainan Air
Force Base with a cargo of plastic sheeting to help with reconstruction efforts
in the wake of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time that a U.S. military transport aircraft had landed in
Taiwan in the name of humanitarian aid since the United States switched
political recognition from the Republic of China to the People's Republic of
China in 1979.</P>
      <P>The aircraft arrived in Tainan at 2: 50 p.m. local time and flew back to Okinawa
immediately after discharging its cargo.</P>
      <P>Christopher Kavanagh, press officer of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) ,
told the Central News Agency that the C-130 aircraft took off from the U.S.
military base in Okinawa, Japan, at noon, carrying 120 rolls, or 15,200 pounds,
of plastic sheeting that can be used for temporary shelter during the
reconstruction process.</P>
      <P>We have been looking at what materials are available and what kind of services
we have to commute the items Taiwan needs,Kavanagh said.</P>
      <P>Asked when the heavy-lift helicopters that Washington has decided to send will
arrive, Kavanagh said that the mission is in progress but details have yet to be
confirmed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been receiving humanitarian aid from countries around the world in
recent days to help with disaster relief efforts after Typhoon Morakot battered
Taiwan Aug. 7-9, triggering massive flooding and deadly landslides throughout
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although the official death toll from the storm stood at 124 as of 10 p.m.
Saturday, hundreds more are feared to have been buried in landslides in remote

      <P>Pingtung County health officials reported Sunday two serious cases of swine flu,
including the first such case involving a pregnant woman in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Health officials said that of the two patients seriously affected by the H1N1
strain of the flu, one has recovered while the other -- a 25-year-old pregnant
woman -- is still in intensive care.</P>
      <P>The officials said the woman, 24 weeks pregnant, began to cough Aug. 9. She
developed a fever the following day and went to the hospital for emergency
treatment.</P>
      <P>She began to develop pneumonia Aug. 13, and was later confirmed to have been
infected with the new influenza A flu strain.</P>
      <P>Health officials said pregnant women are at the highest risk of contracting
swine flu and are more likely to develop serious complications from the virus
than the average patient.</P>
      <P>They also indicated that the flu progresses faster in pregnant women and noted
that the World Health Organization has suggested that pregnant women be the top
priority group to be vaccinated against the flu strain.</P>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported on Saturday that a six-year-old
girl had died from the H1N1 strain, the second person in Taiwan to have died
from the flu virus.</P>

      <P>The government is looking to raise more funds to rebuild and rehabilitate areas
in southern Taiwan that were devastated by Typhoon Morakot, a Ministry of
Finance (MOF) official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Funding provisions for flood control, disaster prevention and reconstruction in
the central government general budget and special budgets will be allocated on a
priority basis to the reconstruction of typhoon-affected areas, but more is
needed for a variety of uses.</P>
      <P>Among them: a disaster-related budget; emergency loans for post-disaster
rehabilitation; the Natural Disaster Aid Fund for Agriculture; subsidies for
city and county governments; the secondary reserve fund; and funding for
disaster preparation, the official said.</P>
      <P>One of the possibilities being considered to raise funds, the official noted,
was to sell shares in state-run enterprises at an appropriate time.</P>
      <P>The ministry is also considering creating resources through land management
strategies,  such as urban land rezoning and land expropriation, and will make
timely use of the general revenue sharing program to help meet the needs of
local governments, the official added.</P>
      <P>During a tour of flood-affected areas in Tainan County, Interior Minister Liao
Liou-yi also said the government is planning to earmark an extraordinary budget
to subsidize households that suffered flood damage to lessen the financial
burden on local governments.</P>
      <P>Under  the initial  plan,  each household  will  be given NT$5,000-NT$20,000 in
subsidies, with the criteria for qualification still under deliberation.</P>
      <P>Liao said his ministry is also considering raising funds to help flood-hit
households.</P>
      <P>In a related development, the Council of Agriculture said Sunday that rice
prices will remain stable in the short term thanks to a good harvest of this
year's first rice crop.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Wen-teh, the director-general of the COA's Agriculture and
Food Agency, Taiwan harvested over 830,000 tons of rice in the first harvest of
the season, up 7 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Along with 300,000 tons in inventory and access to imported rice, the country
will have an adequate supply of rice in the short term in the wake of Typhoon
Morakot.</P>
      <P>The storm may have an impact in the longer term, however. The typhoon's
onslaught coincided with the country's second rice seedling transplanting
period, and the COA said it is closely monitoring any damage to the seedlings
caused by the storm.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President wants to establish guidelines for compulsory evacuation</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday the Ministry of the Interior should establish
a compulsory evacuation system with clear guidelines that would better protect
residents of areas in imminent danger of a natural disaster.</P>
      <P>At present, there is no legal basis in Taiwan to force people to evacuate from a
potential danger area. Local governments can only urge residents to abandon
their homes if a disaster is foreseen.</P>
      <P>Ma said the existing Disaster Prevention and Response Act should be updated to
establish criteria that would trigger a compulsory evacuation to prevent a
repeat of the loss of human life and suffering caused by Typhoon Morakot Aug.
7-9.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while inspecting an ad hoc southern Taiwan
disaster response command center set up in Pingtung County, one of the regions
hardest-hit by Morakot-triggered flooding and landslides.</P>
      <P>Morakot, which dumped more than 2500 mm of rainfall -- the equivalent of a whole
year's precipitation -- in some parts of Taiwan, had its deadliest impact on
dozens of remote villages that dot mountains in Pingtung and neighboring
Kaohsiung counties.</P>
      <P>One such village,  Siaolin, was obliterated when Morakot's torrential rains sent
the faces of two nearby mountains tumbling down on the village's 200 or so
houses.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of residents are feared to have been buried alive in the killer
landslides, but their number may never be known because the village may not be
excavated.</P>
      <P>While many survivors in nearby villages along the Laonung River have been
evacuated to safety by military rescue helicopters, a combined total of 1,000
residents in those isolated villages still refuse to be evacuated.</P>
      <P>On mounting criticism that his administration has been slow and inefficient in
post-disaster rescue and relief operations, Ma said that as the country's head
of state, he is obligated to assume full responsibility.</P>
      <P>"I will fulfill my duty to do a good job, " he pledged.</P>
      <P>Arguing that disaster prevention should take precedence over disaster relief, Ma
said county and city governments should always prioritize precaution before the
onslaught of typhoons to minimize possible casualties and regularly conduct
disaster response training drills to enhance operational efficiency.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Ma inspected dikes in Pingtung County's Sinyuan township,
which almost burst when floodwaters swamped the Gaoping and Donggang River.
Fortunately,  some young residents repaired the ruptures in time.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the low-lying township was still inundated by flash flooding, with
floodwaters reaching 60 centimeters in most of the district.</P>
      <P>Pingtung County Magistrate Tsao Chi-hung, who accompanied Ma on the visit,
suggested that all flood prevention projects should be based on being able to
last 150 years or 200 years instead of the current 100 years in order to
reinforce criteria for relevant infrastructure construction.</P>
      <P>Ma agreed that standards should be upgraded in densely populated areas or
industrial zones.</P>
      <P>The president also inspected a temporary shelter for evacuated typhoon victims
set in the county's Neipu township.</P>
      <P>Many of the 200-plus aboriginal people evacuated from the partly ruined
mountainous  Wutai village told Ma that they need the government's help to
rebuild their hometown.</P>
      <P>The president pledged that the central government would fully support county
governments in resettling displaced typhoon victims and helping them find jobs
and assisting in their children's schooling.</P>
      <P>According to the county's magistrate, all evacuees will be resettled in two
weeks, suggesting that Radio Taiwan International's houses in Pingtung County
can be used to accommodate them. In the longer term, he said, prefabricated
housing will be built to house all displaced victims.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he said, the county government will hire evacuees to help with
environmental cleanup tasks and other rehabilitation operations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>1st shipment of China-donated prefab houses to arrive Tuesday</HEADLINE>

      <P>The first batch of 100 prefabricated houses donated by China is scheduled to
arrive at Kaohsiung Harbor in southern Taiwan early next week to help house
displaced typhoon victims, an official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>"The prefab housing will be loaded onto a vessel at Shenzhen in southern China's
Guangdong province Monday evening, and it is scheduled to arrive at Kaohsiung
Harbor around noon Tuesday," said Ma Shao-chang, deputy secretary-general of the
quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>China offered to assist in Taiwan's rehabilitation operation last week after
Typhoon Morakot wreaked havoc in certain parts of the island Aug. 7-9,
particularly the southern counties of Pingtung and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>After an evaluation, Taiwan's government said it hoped China could provide 1,000
prefab houses to facilitate resettlement of typhoon victims.</P>
      <P>Technical details involved in the donation are being handled by the SEF and its
Chinese counterpart -- the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) -- both of them quasi-official  intermediary bodies
founded by their respective governments to handle negotiations in the absence of
official ties.</P>
      <P>Noting that assembling the prefab housing is a professional job, Ma said the
Ministry of the Interior's Construction and Planning Agency (CPA) will send
officials to take delivery of the cargo when the shipment arrives Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Liu Te-hsun said the CPA already
informed Chinese authorities the specifications of prefab housing suitable for
Taiwan. The Cabinet-level MAC oversees SEF operations.</P>
      <P>"All the prefab hosuses will be distributed to typhoon victims in terms of their
demand," said Liu.</P>
      <P>Delivery of other relief supplies that China has offered Taiwan, including
10,000 blankets, 10,000 sleeping bags and 500 automated disinfecting machines,
will come later, Liu said.</P>

      <P>The Marine Corps mobilized 12,000 servicemen to help with post-typhoon cleanup
efforts in Pingtung County Sunday in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot, which
caused the most serious flooding in southern Taiwan in 50 years.</P>
      <P>The marines provided assistance in 14 townships in the southern Taiwan county,
focusing on cleaning mud and sludge from the streets and decomposing  fish from
fish ponds in Linbian and Jiadong townships.</P>
      <P>The two low-lying coastal towns were seriously inundated when the typhoon passed
through Taiwan Aug. 7-9. Floodwaters were about two-stories high at their peak.</P>
      <P>An old woman from Jiadong said "thanks, young men" when she saw a group of
servicemen busily cleaning out fish ponds and picking up debris from the
streets.</P>
      <P>The air was filled with the pungent smell of rotting fish, but the marines
braved the foul odor to shovel out the ponds with urgency under southern
Taiwan's sweltering  heat.  Chemical specialists followed by spraying
disinfectants in the area.</P>
      <P>The 66th Marine Brigade is in charge of the rescue and rehabilitation operation
in the two townships.</P>
      <P>Brigadier Chen Tze-fong said the military is proud to be able to pitch in to
help the typhoon affected areas.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration is also mobilizing 3,000 people,
including cleaning workers and volunteers, to help with the cleanup effort in
Linbian township under the military's direction.</P>
      <P>EPA official Chang Huan-chang said 10 villages in the township were inundated
during the typhoon, and water levels had receded slowly, most likely because of
blocked drainage systems, but he estimated the cleanup would be completed within
three to five days.</P>
      <P>As of Sunday, two villages -- Linbian and Chunglin -- were still submerged in
water.</P>
      <P>National Defense Minister Chen Chao-min instructed the military to clear the mud
on streets in areas where floodwaters had receded within two days, according to
vice chief of general staff Wu Da-peng,</P>
      <P>who was speaking at a news conference Sunday on the military's disaster relief
efforts.</P>
      <P>The military should complete the cleaning of areas where floodwaters have
receded in central Taiwan, Kaoshu in Pingtung County and Cishan in Kaohsiung
County by Aug. 18; Tainan City and County by Aug. 19; and Linbian in Pingtung
County by Aug. 20, Wu said.</P>
      <P>If rescue efforts are completed in the next two days, the military will then
move on to help with the next stages of resettlement and reconstruction.</P>
      <P>Chen also requested aerial monitoring of barrier lakes in Cishan, the Laonong
River area in Kaohsiung County and Taimali in Taitung County to prevent any
unexpected disasters, according to Wu.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's government was peppered with questions from the foreign media Sunday on
the administration's failure to act quickly enough in organizing rescue and
disaster relief operations in the wake of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>At a news conference with Mao Chi-kuo, the commander of the Central Emergency
Operation Center (CEOC), Western media and major Japanese news outlets all
focused on why Taiwanese authorities seemed to respond slowly to the disaster
while at the same time giving conflicting information on the death toll.</P>
      <P>Responding to the questions on and criticism of the government's performance and
its slow deployment of the military to help people stranded by the typhoon,
Transportation Minister Mao said the situation was different than that faced
following earthquakes and other disasters.</P>
      <P>Heavy rainfall, along with landslides, continued in the days after the typhoon
first began to affect Taiwan and resulted in damaged roads and bridges, which
impeded rescue operations by the armed forces, Mao said.</P>
      <P>Full-scale rescue operations could not begin until Aug. 10 when the weather
cleared up, at which point the military dispatched personnel by land and air to
affected areas, he added.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he agrees with public criticism that the government
isincompetentbased on its handling of the disaster, Mao said, "many of the
criticisms were actually a chain of mixed-information and that judging from the
information he received in the initial stages when the relief efforts began, the
government was well informed and in control of the situation."</P>
      <P>In terms of disaster relief, we can always do better and we understand that the
typhoon victims wished we did more and much quicker. We can only humbly accept
their criticism and work harder, Mao said.</P>
      <P>The foreign media were also very concerned about the exact number of deaths in
Siaolin village in the southern county of Kaohsiung, where some 380 people are
feared buried under the mudslides that destroyed the village during Typhoon
Morakot last week.</P>
      <P>"The government should be responsible and very careful when it comes to death
toll numbers. There is a certain procedure that we need to go through before
making any announcement," Mao said.</P>
      <P>Mao said the government is in the process of verifying the exact number of dead
and will consult with the families of the villagers on whether to start digging
the village out of the mud that buried it.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will adopt diversified measures to resettle people displaced by
flooding and landslides spurred by Typhoon Morakot, Government Information
Office Minister Su Jun-pin said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Su was speaking after Premier Liu Chao-shiuan convened a meeting of an ad hoc
post-disaster reconstruction committee to discuss feasible measures for
resettling displaced typhoon victims.</P>
      <P>Senior officials from the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of  National
Defense,  the  Ministry  of  Transportation  and Communications as well as other
relevant agencies took part in the brainstorming session, Su said.</P>
      <P>"During the meeting, Liu directed the Ministry of the Interior to form an inter-
agency task force to survey typhoon-affected people's preferences for
resettlement within a week," Su said.</P>
      <P>Noting that intermediate resettlement is an urgent task, Su said the government
may either offer subsidies for typhoon victims to rent houses on their own or
provide them with living expenses if they agree to live in the same selected
communities.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister-without-Portfolio Tsai Hsun-hsiuan said the intermediate
settlement period may last for a couple of months, a half year or up to two
years, depending on the extent and scale of destruction caused by the storm to
their original homes.</P>
      <P>"The amount of the proposed rental subsidy has yet to be decided, " Tsai said,
adding that the amount may be set at NT$3,600 per month.</P>
      <P>As to the living subsidy, the amount may be slightly higher than the figure
presently offered for low-income families, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Reconstruction, Tsai said, would be more complicated because if residents
insisted on rebuilding homes in their original hometowns, a comprehensive review
would be needed to determine whether the areas were still safe.</P>
      <P>If residents are willing to relocate to other areas to build their new homes,
Tsai said it will take time to select a safe and suitable plot of land for
reconstruction projects.</P>
      <P>"Professional  assessments and villagers' choices should be considered in
addressing these problems, " Tsai said, adding that the inter-ministerial task
force should come up with a report within a week.</P>
      <P>As many civic groups have organized volunteers to help with post-disaster
rehabilitation operation, Liu ordered the establishment of a platform to
integrate volunteer forces to enhance operational efficiency.</P>
      <P>The premier was also said to have directed the Ministry of National Defense to
designate various units to take charge of post-disaster response assistance in
specific districts in the future, a measure that is believed to facilitate
gaining disaster relief experience.</P>
      <P>"The premier also asked military authorities to organize a regular disaster
response force," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>In related developments, the Ministry of Education said 31 elementary and junio
high schools will not be able to reopen in time for the start of the new school
year in September.</P>
      <P>According to the ministry, 1,305 local schools were damaged during the onslaught
of the typhoon, with elementary and junior high schools taking the brunt of
destruction. Financial losses from the school damage were estimated at NT$1.95
billion.</P>

      <P>Post-disaster relief supplies donated by foreign countries continued flowing
into Taiwan Sunday as the country digs itself out of the devastation wrought by
Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>An Emirates Airlines flight arrived in Taipei early in the morning with a batch
of shelter boxes donated by Britain's Shelter Box Trust, which is administered
by the Helston-Lizard Rotary Club in Cornwall, disaster response officials said.</P>
      <P>The shelter boxes,  which will soon be delivered  to the hardest-hit disaster
zones, contain a 10-person tunnel tent, 10 sleeping bags, and accessories such
as a multifuel cooker, water purifier, a spade and rope.</P>
      <P>China Airlines, Taiwan's largest carrier, also airlifted a shipment of emergency
supplies donated by Australia to Taipei early Sunday free of charge.</P>
      <P>Richard Mathews, Australia's deputy representative in Taiwan, handed over the
supplies to Lee Shih-ming, director-general of the East Asian and Pacific
Affairs Department under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a donation ceremony
held at Taoyuan International Airport in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The supplies include 200,000 water purification tablets, 5,040 large buckets for
treating water and for general household use, 100 sanitizer spray packs that
hold disinfectant, and repellent to spray around buildings for disease
prevention.</P>
      <P>Australian  Representative  to Taiwan  Alice Cawte formally presented the
US$168,600 worth of water purification and disinfectant supplies at the Central
Emergency Operation Center in Taipei around noon Sunday to Minister of
Transportation of Communications Mao Chih-kuo.</P>
      <P>Mao, who concurrently serves as the post-disaster response commander, said
Taiwan's government and people are grateful for Australia's donation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Red Cross Society will help deliver the sanitation supplies to disaster
zones for distribution to affected families, Mao said.</P>
      <P>Cawte said the Australian government hopes its emergency supplies can allow
local typhoon victims to enjoy clean drinking water and help combat water-borne
diseases  caused  by Morakot-triggered flooding.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot dumped more than 2500 mm of precipitation -- the equivalent of a
whole year's rainfall -- in southern Taiwan Aug. 7-9, swelling rivers that
washed away bridges and spurring landslides that buried entire villages.</P>
      <P>The storm, one of the worst natural disasters to batter Taiwan in half a
century, had officially killed at least 124 people across Taiwan and left 45
injured and 56 otehrs unaccounted for as of 10 p.m. Saturday.</P>
      <P>Those numbers do not include the potentially hundreds of people believed to have

      <P>A team from Taitung County won the Pony League World Series championship
Saturday in Washington County, Pennsylvania, the sixth Taiwanese team to win the
title in the past sixteen years.</P>
      <P>The Taitung team defeated Riverside, California, 12-1 in the title game to
become the first team since 2001 to win the double elimination tournament after
losing its opening game.</P>
      <P>In the final against Riverside, Taiwan trailed 1-0 before erupting for four runs
in the bottom of the third inning. Catcher Ispalidev Lanihu's bases-loaded
single drove in the tying run, and Su Chih-chieh drove in two more with a single
to right. Lanihu scored the fourth run on a groundout.</P>
      <P>Taiwan put the game away in the fourth inning as Chang Yu-cheng's three-run
blast and Su Chih-chieh's two-run homer keyed an eight-run rally, putting the
team ahead 12-1.</P>
      <P>Lai Ta-kuan, who relieved starter Lan Chen-wei to start the fourth inning,
retired Riverside in order in the fifth, and the game was called because of the
10-run rule.</P>
      <P>About 200 Taiwanese expatriates from Pennsylvania and Maryland were there to
root for the Taitung team, composed of students from junior high schools in
rural areas of the southeastern county.</P>
      <P>Manager Wang Kuo-ching could barely hide his excitement over his team's triumph
and praised his team's will and indomitable spirit to come back after losing its
first game of the tournament.</P>
      <P>Taiwan fell to Toa Baja of Puerto Rico 3-1 on Aug. 8, but then beat Bay County,
Michigan, 13-9, and Johnstown, Pennsylvania, 7-3, to set up a showdown with Toa
Baja.</P>
      <P>Having to beat the Puerto Rican team twice in a row to reach the final, Taiwan
defeated Toa Baja 8-3 on Aug. 13, and then 4-2 a day later on a dramatic home
run by Chang Cheng-nan in extra innings.</P>
      <P>The Pony League tournament was for players 13 and 14 years old. Unlike Little
League, the Pony League is composed of two-year age brackets and different sized
diamonds for different age groups.</P>

      <P>At least one U.S. heavy-lift CH-53E helicopter  will arrive in Taiwan Monday to
assist in relief operations in the southern part of the country, which was
devastated by flooding and landslides from Typhoon Morakot, defense officials
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. military is now working to have its CH-53E helicopter take part in
humanitarian post-disaster relief efforts in Taiwan, " said an official with the
Ministry of National Defense (MND) , who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>According to the official, at least one CH-53E helicopter will be delivered by
an amphibious transport dock ship, also known as a landing platform dock, to
waters near Taiwan from where the chopper will fly to the Tainan air base in
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If all goes well, the official said, at least one CH-53E chopper will arrive in
Tainan Monday at the earliest.</P>
      <P>The official would not confirm, however, if the United States will provide one
or two such heavy-lift helicopters.</P>
      <P>"Our two sides are still in close contact to work out relevant details, " the
official said, adding that the Defense Ministry will inform the public once all
technical details are settled.</P>
      <P>As the CH-53E chopper can transport a 16-ton payload, its arrival is expected
to help with relief and rehabilitation  work in mountainous areas that were cut
off from the outside world in the storm, the official added.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot, which dumped more than 2500 mm of precipitation -- the
equivalent of a whole year's rainfall -- in some parts of Taiwan Aug. 7-9,
proved lethal in several remote villages that dot mountains in the southern
counties of Kaohsiung and Pingtung.</P>
      <P>A National Fire Administration official said earlier this week that Taiwan
urgently needs helicopters that can carry cranes and other heavy-duty  machinery
into flood-  and landslide-ravaged mountainous villages to help rescue those who
might still be stranded.</P>
      <P>The storm, one of the worst natural disasters to batter Taiwan in half a
century, had officially killed at least 124 people across Taiwan and left 45
injured and 56 others unaccounted for as of 10 p.m. Saturday.</P>
      <P>Those numbers do not include the potentially hundreds of people believed to have
been buried in landslides in remote mountainous areas of southern Taiwan,
especially in Siaolin village in Kaohsiung County.</P>

      <P>A United States military C-130 transport plane arrived Sunday at Tainan Air
Force Base with a cargo of plastic sheeting to help with reconstruction efforts
in the wake of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time that a U.S. military transport aircraft had landed in
Taiwan in the name of humanitarian aid since the United States switched
political recognition from the Republic of China to the People's Republic of
China in 1979.</P>
      <P>The aircraft arrived in Tainan at 2: 50 p.m. local time and flew back to Okinawa
immediately after discharging its cargo.</P>
      <P>Christopher Kavanagh, press officer of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) ,
told the Central News Agency that the C-130 aircraft took off from the U.S.
military base in Okinawa, Japan, at noon, carrying 120 rolls, or 15,200 pounds,
of plastic sheeting that can be used for temporary shelter during the
reconstruction process.</P>
      <P>We have been looking at what materials are available and what kind of services
we have to commute the items Taiwan needs,Kavanagh said.</P>

recent days to help with disaster relief efforts after Typhoon Morakot battered
Taiwan Aug. 7-9, triggering massive flooding and deadly landslides throughout

      <P>Pingtung County health officials reported Sunday two serious cases of swine flu,
including the first such case involving a pregnant woman in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Health officials said that of the two patients seriously affected by the H1N1
strain of the flu, one has recovered while the other -- a 25-year-old pregnant
woman -- is still in intensive care.</P>
      <P>The officials said the woman, 24 weeks pregnant, began to cough Aug. 9. She
developed a fever the following day and went to the hospital for emergency
treatment.</P>
      <P>She began to develop pneumonia Aug. 13, and was later confirmed to have been
infected with the new influenza A flu strain.</P>
      <P>Health officials said pregnant women are at the highest risk of contracting
swine flu and are more likely to develop serious complications from the virus
than the average patient.</P>
      <P>They also indicated that the flu progresses faster in pregnant women and noted
that the World Health Organization has suggested that pregnant women be the top
priority group to be vaccinated against the flu strain.</P>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported on Saturday that a six-year-old

      <P>The government is looking to raise more funds to rebuild and rehabilitate areas
in southern Taiwan that were devastated by Typhoon Morakot, a Ministry of
Finance (MOF) official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Funding provisions for flood control, disaster prevention and reconstruction in
the central government general budget and special budgets will be allocated on a
priority basis to the reconstruction of typhoon-affected areas, but more is
needed for a variety of uses.</P>
      <P>Among them: a disaster-related budget; emergency loans for post-disaster
rehabilitation; the Natural Disaster Aid Fund for Agriculture; subsidies for
city and county governments; the secondary reserve fund; and funding for
disaster preparation, the official said.</P>
      <P>One of the possibilities being considered to raise funds, the official noted,
was to sell shares in state-run enterprises at an appropriate time.</P>
      <P>The ministry is also considering creating resources through land management
strategies,  such as urban land rezoning and land expropriation, and will make
timely use of the general revenue sharing program to help meet the needs of
local governments, the official added.</P>
      <P>During a tour of flood-affected areas in Tainan County, Interior Minister Liao
Liou-yi also said the government is planning to earmark an extraordinary budget
to subsidize households that suffered flood damage to lessen the financial
burden on local governments.</P>
      <P>Under  the initial  plan,  each household  will  be given NT$5,000-NT$20,000 in
subsidies, with the criteria for qualification still under deliberation.</P>
      <P>Liao said his ministry is also considering raising funds to help flood-hit
households.</P>
      <P>In a related development, the Council of Agriculture said Sunday that rice
prices will remain stable in the short term thanks to a good harvest of this
year's first rice crop.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Wen-teh, the director-general of the COA's Agriculture and
Food Agency, Taiwan harvested over 830,000 tons of rice in the first harvest of
the season, up 7 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Along with 300,000 tons in inventory and access to imported rice, the country
will have an adequate supply of rice in the short term in the wake of Typhoon
Morakot.</P>
      <P>The storm may have an impact in the longer term, however. The typhoon's
onslaught coincided with the country's second rice seedling transplanting
period, and the COA said it is closely monitoring any damage to the seedlings
caused by the storm.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President wants to establish guidelines for compulsory evacuation</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Aug.16 (CNA)
08/16/09  19:35:48
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday the Ministry of the Interior should establish
a compulsory evacuation system with clear guidelines that would better protect
residents of areas in imminent danger of a natural disaster.</P>
      <P>At present, there is no legal basis in Taiwan to force people to evacuate from a
potential danger area. Local governments can only urge residents to abandon
their homes if a disaster is foreseen.</P>
      <P>Ma said the existing Disaster Prevention and Response Act should be updated to
establish criteria that would trigger a compulsory evacuation to prevent a
repeat of the loss of human life and suffering caused by Typhoon Morakot Aug.
7-9.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while inspecting an ad hoc southern Taiwan
disaster response command center set up in Pingtung County, one of the regions
hardest-hit by Morakot-triggered flooding and landslides.</P>
      <P>Morakot, which dumped more than 2500 mm of rainfall -- the equivalent of a whole
year's precipitation -- in some parts of Taiwan, had its deadliest impact on
dozens of remote villages that dot mountains in Pingtung and neighboring
Kaohsiung counties.</P>
      <P>One such village,  Siaolin, was obliterated when Morakot's torrential rains sent
the faces of two nearby mountains tumbling down on the village's 200 or so
houses.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of residents are feared to have been buried alive in the killer
landslides, but their number may never be known because the village may not be
excavated.</P>
      <P>While many survivors in nearby villages along the Laonung River have been
evacuated to safety by military rescue helicopters, a combined total of 1,000
residents in those isolated villages still refuse to be evacuated.</P>
      <P>On mounting criticism that his administration has been slow and inefficient in
post-disaster rescue and relief operations, Ma said that as the country's head
of state, he is obligated to assume full responsibility.</P>
      <P>"I will fulfill my duty to do a good job, " he pledged.</P>
      <P>Arguing that disaster prevention should take precedence over disaster relief, Ma
said county and city governments should always prioritize precaution before the
onslaught of typhoons to minimize possible casualties and regularly conduct
disaster response training drills to enhance operational efficiency.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Ma inspected dikes in Pingtung County's Sinyuan township,
which almost burst when floodwaters swamped the Gaoping and Donggang River.
Fortunately,  some young residents repaired the ruptures in time.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the low-lying township was still inundated by flash flooding, with
floodwaters reaching 60 centimeters in most of the district.</P>
      <P>Pingtung County Magistrate Tsao Chi-hung, who accompanied Ma on the visit,
suggested that all flood prevention projects should be based on being able to
last 150 years or 200 years instead of the current 100 years in order to
reinforce criteria for relevant infrastructure construction.</P>
      <P>Ma agreed that standards should be upgraded in densely populated areas or
industrial zones.</P>
      <P>The president also inspected a temporary shelter for evacuated typhoon victims
set in the county's Neipu township.</P>
      <P>Many of the 200-plus aboriginal people evacuated from the partly ruined
mountainous  Wutai village told Ma that they need the government's help to
rebuild their hometown.</P>
      <P>The president pledged that the central government would fully support county
governments in resettling displaced typhoon victims and helping them find jobs
and assisting in their children's schooling.</P>
      <P>According to the county's magistrate, all evacuees will be resettled in two
weeks, suggesting that Radio Taiwan International's houses in Pingtung County
can be used to accommodate them. In the longer term, he said, prefabricated
housing will be built to house all displaced victims.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he said, the county government will hire evacuees to help with
environmental cleanup tasks and other rehabilitation operations.</P>

      <P>The first batch of 100 prefabricated houses donated by China is scheduled to
arrive at Kaohsiung Harbor in southern Taiwan early next week to help house
displaced typhoon victims, an official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>"The prefab housing will be loaded onto a vessel at Shenzhen in southern China's
Guangdong province Monday evening, and it is scheduled to arrive at Kaohsiung
Harbor around noon Tuesday," said Ma Shao-chang, deputy secretary-general of the
quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>China offered to assist in Taiwan's rehabilitation operation last week after
Typhoon Morakot wreaked havoc in certain parts of the island Aug. 7-9,
particularly the southern counties of Pingtung and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>After an evaluation, Taiwan's government said it hoped China could provide 1,000
prefab houses to facilitate resettlement of typhoon victims.</P>
      <P>Technical details involved in the donation are being handled by the SEF and its
Chinese counterpart -- the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) -- both of them quasi-official  intermediary bodies
founded by their respective governments to handle negotiations in the absence of
official ties.</P>
      <P>Noting that assembling the prefab housing is a professional job, Ma said the
Ministry of the Interior's Construction and Planning Agency (CPA) will send
officials to take delivery of the cargo when the shipment arrives Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Liu Te-hsun said the CPA already
informed Chinese authorities the specifications of prefab housing suitable for
Taiwan. The Cabinet-level MAC oversees SEF operations.</P>
      <P>"All the prefab hosuses will be distributed to typhoon victims in terms of their
demand," said Liu.</P>
      <P>Delivery of other relief supplies that China has offered Taiwan, including
10,000 blankets, 10,000 sleeping bags and 500 automated disinfecting machines,
will come later, Liu said.</P>

      <P>The Marine Corps mobilized 12,000 servicemen to help with post-typhoon cleanup
efforts in Pingtung County Sunday in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot, which
caused the most serious flooding in southern Taiwan in 50 years.</P>
      <P>The marines provided assistance in 14 townships in the southern Taiwan county,
focusing on cleaning mud and sludge from the streets and decomposing  fish from
fish ponds in Linbian and Jiadong townships.</P>
      <P>The two low-lying coastal towns were seriously inundated when the typhoon passed
through Taiwan Aug. 7-9. Floodwaters were about two-stories high at their peak.</P>
      <P>An old woman from Jiadong said "thanks, young men" when she saw a group of
servicemen busily cleaning out fish ponds and picking up debris from the
streets.</P>
      <P>The air was filled with the pungent smell of rotting fish, but the marines
braved the foul odor to shovel out the ponds with urgency under southern
Taiwan's sweltering  heat.  Chemical specialists followed by spraying
disinfectants in the area.</P>
      <P>The 66th Marine Brigade is in charge of the rescue and rehabilitation operation
in the two townships.</P>
      <P>Brigadier Chen Tze-fong said the military is proud to be able to pitch in to
help the typhoon affected areas.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration is also mobilizing 3,000 people,
including cleaning workers and volunteers, to help with the cleanup effort in
Linbian township under the military's direction.</P>
      <P>EPA official Chang Huan-chang said 10 villages in the township were inundated
during the typhoon, and water levels had receded slowly, most likely because of
blocked drainage systems, but he estimated the cleanup would be completed within
three to five days.</P>
      <P>As of Sunday, two villages -- Linbian and Chunglin -- were still submerged in
water.</P>
      <P>National Defense Minister Chen Chao-min instructed the military to clear the mud
on streets in areas where floodwaters had receded within two days, according to
vice chief of general staff Wu Da-peng,</P>
      <P>who was speaking at a news conference Sunday on the military's disaster relief
efforts.</P>
      <P>The military should complete the cleaning of areas where floodwaters have
receded in central Taiwan, Kaoshu in Pingtung County and Cishan in Kaohsiung
County by Aug. 18; Tainan City and County by Aug. 19; and Linbian in Pingtung
County by Aug. 20, Wu said.</P>
      <P>If rescue efforts are completed in the next two days, the military will then
move on to help with the next stages of resettlement and reconstruction.</P>
      <P>Chen also requested aerial monitoring of barrier lakes in Cishan, the Laonong
River area in Kaohsiung County and Taimali in Taitung County to prevent any

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's government was peppered with questions from the foreign media Sunday on
the administration's failure to act quickly enough in organizing rescue and
disaster relief operations in the wake of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>At a news conference with Mao Chi-kuo, the commander of the Central Emergency
Operation Center (CEOC), Western media and major Japanese news outlets all
focused on why Taiwanese authorities seemed to respond slowly to the disaster
while at the same time giving conflicting information on the death toll.</P>
      <P>Responding to the questions on and criticism of the government's performance and
its slow deployment of the military to help people stranded by the typhoon,
Transportation Minister Mao said the situation was different than that faced
following earthquakes and other disasters.</P>
      <P>Heavy rainfall, along with landslides, continued in the days after the typhoon
first began to affect Taiwan and resulted in damaged roads and bridges, which
impeded rescue operations by the armed forces, Mao said.</P>
      <P>Full-scale rescue operations could not begin until Aug. 10 when the weather
cleared up, at which point the military dispatched personnel by land and air to
affected areas, he added.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he agrees with public criticism that the government
isincompetentbased on its handling of the disaster, Mao said, "many of the
criticisms were actually a chain of mixed-information and that judging from the
information he received in the initial stages when the relief efforts began, the
government was well informed and in control of the situation."</P>
      <P>In terms of disaster relief, we can always do better and we understand that the
typhoon victims wished we did more and much quicker. We can only humbly accept
their criticism and work harder, Mao said.</P>
      <P>The foreign media were also very concerned about the exact number of deaths in
Siaolin village in the southern county of Kaohsiung, where some 380 people are
feared buried under the mudslides that destroyed the village during Typhoon
Morakot last week.</P>
      <P>"The government should be responsible and very careful when it comes to death
toll numbers. There is a certain procedure that we need to go through before
making any announcement," Mao said.</P>
      <P>Mao said the government is in the process of verifying the exact number of dead
and will consult with the families of the villagers on whether to start digging
the village out of the mud that buried it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Diversified measures to be used to resettle typhoon victims</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.16  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will adopt diversified measures to resettle people displaced by
flooding and landslides spurred by Typhoon Morakot, Government Information
Office Minister Su Jun-pin said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Su was speaking after Premier Liu Chao-shiuan convened a meeting of an ad hoc
post-disaster reconstruction committee to discuss feasible measures for
resettling displaced typhoon victims.</P>
      <P>Senior officials from the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of  National
Defense,  the  Ministry  of  Transportation  and Communications as well as other
relevant agencies took part in the brainstorming session, Su said.</P>
      <P>"During the meeting, Liu directed the Ministry of the Interior to form an inter-
agency task force to survey typhoon-affected people's preferences for
resettlement within a week," Su said.</P>
      <P>Noting that intermediate resettlement is an urgent task, Su said the government
may either offer subsidies for typhoon victims to rent houses on their own or
provide them with living expenses if they agree to live in the same selected
communities.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister-without-Portfolio Tsai Hsun-hsiuan said the intermediate
settlement period may last for a couple of months, a half year or up to two
years, depending on the extent and scale of destruction caused by the storm to
their original homes.</P>
      <P>"The amount of the proposed rental subsidy has yet to be decided, " Tsai said,
adding that the amount may be set at NT$3,600 per month.</P>
      <P>As to the living subsidy, the amount may be slightly higher than the figure
presently offered for low-income families, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Reconstruction, Tsai said, would be more complicated because if residents
insisted on rebuilding homes in their original hometowns, a comprehensive review
would be needed to determine whether the areas were still safe.</P>
      <P>If residents are willing to relocate to other areas to build their new homes,
Tsai said it will take time to select a safe and suitable plot of land for
reconstruction projects.</P>
      <P>"Professional  assessments and villagers' choices should be considered in
addressing these problems, " Tsai said, adding that the inter-ministerial task
force should come up with a report within a week.</P>
      <P>As many civic groups have organized volunteers to help with post-disaster
rehabilitation operation, Liu ordered the establishment of a platform to
integrate volunteer forces to enhance operational efficiency.</P>
      <P>The premier was also said to have directed the Ministry of National Defense to
designate various units to take charge of post-disaster response assistance in
specific districts in the future, a measure that is believed to facilitate
gaining disaster relief experience.</P>
      <P>"The premier also asked military authorities to organize a regular disaster
response force," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>In related developments, the Ministry of Education said 31 elementary and junio
high schools will not be able to reopen in time for the start of the new school
year in September.</P>
      <P>According to the ministry, 1,305 local schools were damaged during the onslaught
of the typhoon, with elementary and junior high schools taking the brunt of
destruction. Financial losses from the school damage were estimated at NT$1.95
billion.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 31 junior high and elementary schools damaged by landslides and flooding
from Typhoon Morakot would probably not be able to reopen in time for the start
of the new school year in September, a Ministry of Education (MOE) official said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Because of the serious damage to the schools -- located in in Nantou County in
central Taiwan and in Chiayi, Kaohsiung and Pingtung in the south -- it is
feared that they will not be able to resume classes in time, according to Yang
Chang-yu, director of the MOE's Department of Elementary Education.</P>
      <P>However, it is not clear exactly how many students would be affected, as many
schools have lost contact with their students, Yang added.</P>
      <P>The ministry suggested that the schools try to locate these students and that
typhoon victims who have moved to other cities and counties inform the schools
of their children's whereabouts.</P>
      <P>Once home room teachers have certified such students as typhoon victims, the
families would be eligible for subsidies to cover the children's tuition and
lunch fees, Yang said.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,305 schools in central and southern Taiwan were demolished or
damaged by the typhoon, with accumulated losses estimated at NT$1.95 billion
(US$59.45 million) . Junior high and elementary schools were hit the hardest,
incurring losses in excess of NT$1.47 billion, according to MOE figures.</P>

      <P>An earthquake of magnitude 6.5 rattled Taiwan at 8:05 a.m. Monday, the strongest
quake to strike the island this year, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) reported.</P>
      <P>The epicenter  of the quake was located  187.7 kilometers east-southeast of
Hualien, at a depth of 11 kilometers below the Pacific Ocean floor, according to
the CWB's Seismology Center.</P>
      <P>The temblor was felt almost everywhere around the island. It registered an
intensity of 4.0 in Orchid Island off Taitung County and an intensity of 3.0 in
the eastern counties of Hualien and Yilan, as well as in the central counties of
Taichung, Changhua, Nantou and Yunlin, the seismologists said.</P>
      <P>Its intensity was measured at 2.0 in Taipei, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Miaoli, Chiayi,
Tainan, Kaohsiung, Pingtung and Penghu counties.</P>
      <P>No immediate injuries or damage had been reported as of 11 a.m. Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is located in a strongly oblique convergent zone between the Eurasian
Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate. Underground tectonic activity in this area
is responsible for 16,000 to 18,000 detectable earthquakes in Taiwan each year,
about 250 of which are up to magnitude 4.0, about 30 of which measure up to 5.0
on the Reichter scale, and two to three of which are magnitude 6.0 or bigger,
according to the Seismology Center.</P>
      <P>A magnitude 6.3 quake centered off Hualien rocked the country at 2: 05 a.m. July
14, the strongest temblor to strike Taiwan in nearly two years. No major
injuries or damage were reported as a result of that earthquake.</P>
      <P>Yilan in the northeast and Hualien in the east are the most earthquake-prone
counties in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan experienced its deadliest earthquake in five decades on Sept. 21, 1999,
when a 7.3 magnitude temblor struck central Taiwan, killing some 2,400 people,
leaving more than 10,000 injured, and causing immeasurable damage to property
and infrastructure.</P>

      <P>Agricultural losses from Typhoon Morakot had soared to NT$12.27 billion
(US$373.27 million) as of Monday morning, according to statistics released by
the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>The COA said that Morakot, which pummeled Taiwan Aug. 7-9, caused serious damage
to the agricultural sector in 11 counties, with Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties
in southern Taiwan and Hualien and Taitung counties in the east being the
hardest hit.</P>
      <P>The statistics show that damage to agricultural crops amounted to NT$3.99
billion, with 27 percent of the crops on 72,345 hectares of farmland wiped out.</P>
      <P>Banana crops suffered the heaviest damage, with 5,945 hectares ravaged by strong
winds and flooding.</P>
      <P>Damage to the aquaculture sector amounted to NT$4.13 billion, the heaviest loss
in 19 years, COA officials said. Stocks in some 8,845 hectares of ponds or beach
farms were washed away, it said.</P>
      <P>Some 138,000 pigs, nearly 600,000 chickens and more than 132,000 ducks perished
in floods caused by the storm, bringing the total livestock losses in these
three areas to NT$1.42 billion, the COA said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to COA tallies, a total of 2,256 hectares of farmlands were
either washed away or inundated, mostly in Taitung, Pingtung and Kaohsiung
counties.</P>
      <P>Farmers who suffered heavy losses can apply for cash relief or low-interest
loans from the government, in accordance with the Agricultural Natural Disaster
Relief Regulations, COA officials said.</P>

      <P>A U.S. heavy-lift CH-53E helicopter and a U.S. military C-130 transport plane
will give muscle to Taiwan's relief efforts in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot
when they arrive in Taiwan Monday, defense sources said.</P>
      <P>A U.S. heavy-lift CH-53E helicopter landed at Tainan Air Force Base in southern
Taiwan at 2: 25 p.m. to join the relief operations in the southern part of the
country, which was devastated by flooding and landslides from Typhoon Morakot,
Hung said.</P>
      <P>It is the first time that the U.S.  military is joining humanitarian aid efforts
in Taiwan since formal diplomatic relations between the two sides were severed
in 1979.</P>
      <P>The CH-53E chopper, which can transport a 16-ton payload, is expected to help
with the relief and rehabilitation work in the mountainous areas that were cut
off from the rest of the island in the storm.</P>
      <P>According to Mao Chih-kuo, chief of the Central Emergency Operations Center,
this helicopter is the first of four U.S. military aircraft transported by USS
Denver -- an amphibious transport dock ship -- to waters near Taiwan. From
there, the other three choppers will also fly to the Tainan Air Force Base to
join Taiwan's relief and rehabilitation operations.</P>
      <P>The three other U.S. military helicopters are another CH-53Es, more commonly
known as the Super Stallions, and two SH-60s, which are commonly known as
Seahawks, according to Christopher Kavanagh, press officer of the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT).</P>
      <P>"The four helicopters will return to USS Denver at night after their daily work
on the island," said Kavanagh.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, A C-130 transport plane, the second in two days, landed at Tainan Air
Force Base around noon Monday with a cargo of about a half ton of calcium
hypochlorite  tablets  for water sanitization, said Hung Wen-cheng, a spokesman
for the air force base.</P>
      <P>The calcium hyphchlorite tablets will be transferred to the Centers for Disease
Control under the Cabinet-level Department of Health, Hung said.</P>
      <P>A U.S. military C-130 transport plane arrived at Tainan Air Force Base Sunday,
delivering 120 rolls of plastic sheeting that can be used to build temporary
shelters during the reconstruction process.</P>
      <P>The aircraft arrived in Tainan at 2: 50 p.m. local time and flew back to Okinawa
immediately after discharging its cargo.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot, which dumped more than 2500 mm of precipitation -- the
equivalent of a whole year's rainfall -- on some parts of Taiwan Aug. 7-9,
proved lethal in several remote villages that dot mountains in the southern
counties of Kaohsiung and Pingtung.</P>
      <P>The storm, one of the worst natural disasters to batter Taiwan in half a
century, had officially killed at least 124 people across Taiwan and left 45
injured and 56 others unaccounted for as of 10 p.m. Saturday.</P>
      <P>Those numbers do not include the potentially hundreds of people believed to have
been buried in landslides in remote mountainous areas of southern Taiwan,
especially in Siaolin village in Kaohsiung County.</P>

      <P>More than 600 people who became unemployed as a result of the flooding caused by
Typhoon Morakot in southern Taiwan were offered temporary jobs Monday when the
Executive Yuan launched a new employment program to aid victims in 40 townships.</P>
      <P>Commander of the Central Emergency Operation Center Mao Chi-kuo announced that
the program, originally designed to last 14 days, will be extended to Sept. 17.</P>
      <P>Also, the number of job openings have been doubled to 220,000, he said.</P>
      <P>According to the Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) , the temporary
employment program will provide 200 jobs in each of the flood-affected
townships.</P>
      <P>Each employee will be paid an hourly wage of NT$100, or NT$800 a day, to help
clean up and restore flooded buildings and communities, the CLA said.</P>
      <P>The budget for the program, estimated at NT$200 million, will be taken from the
government's employment security fund, the CLA said in a statement released
Monday.</P>
      <P>Mao explained that the program was designed to help the flood victims by
providing them with work opportunities, instead of just giving them money.</P>
      <P>As soon as the initial one-month period expires, the workers will be given other
employment opportunities by the CLA, he said.</P>

      <P>Fourteen bridges on the island's major highways as well as 50 other bridges
collapsed or were damaged during the onslaught of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>It is the highest record of bridges damaged in a single storm. This high toll
occurred because the designers of the bridges knew little about hydrology.</P>
      <P>Bridge  designers  should  not only  take  hydrology  into consideration, but
should also should bear in mind that water currents under a bridge will change

administration in the hope that it will heed them and avoid other costly
mistakes.</P>
      <P>First, priority should be given to the rehabilitation of the flood victims, and
this should be done quickly without any red tape.</P>
      <P>Second, the cash donations pouring in from home and abroad should be used for
the victims, and not siphoned off by shrewd politicians and officials.</P>
      <P>Third, the rebuilding of some 70 bridges which were damaged or destroyed by
Typhoon Morakot should be done quickly and properly.</P>
      <P>Also, a scientific approach should be taken in the development of mountain
areas. Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>Taiwan' government efficiency requires further scrutiny</P>
      <P>It is a warm and welcoming sight to see the foreign aid that is flowing into
Taiwan in the aftermath of the flooding caused by Typhoon Morakot. It proves
that Taiwan is not the orphan of the international society, as we tend to think.</P>
      <P>However, the disaster has unveiled the seamy side of the Taiwan government. Its
inefficiency caused a major delay of the disaster rescue and relief efforts and
resulted in a massive death toll, injuries, and a shortage of relief supplies.</P>
      <P>Above all, President Ma is the one to be blamed. His inertia after the storm was
fully evident from the fact that a national security meeting was not convened
until seven days later.</P>
      <P>He also denied the need for declaring a state of emergency , not knowing that
without it, the Ministry of Defense, which has the most rescue resources, could
not take part in the local disaster relief efforts.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan and Minister of Defense Chen Chao-min also share the
blame. Why didn't Premier Liu contact Chen immediately after the disaster? And
why didn't Minister Chen command his army to join the rescue and relief work
immediately after the disaster?</P>
      <P>Local military commanders have the authority to deploy their troops for disaster
rescue and relief and notify their superiors later. However, in reality many
soldiers were put on standby, being told that they had to "wait for orders."</P>
      <P>Every year Taiwan is affected by typhoons and earthquakes, yet the government's
reaction to these disasters remains sluggish and bureaucratic. It seems it is
not only the disaster relief system that requires reevaluation, but also the
government system.</P>

      <P>A team from Taiwan's eastern Taitung County that won the Pony League World
Series championship Saturday celebrated their victory in New York Sunday before
heading home later that day.</P>
      <P>The players, all aged under 15 and from the Taiyuan Junior High School in
Taitung, arrived in New York City Sunday from Washington County, Pennsylvania,
where they competed in the 2009 Pony League Baseball World Series Aug. 7-15.</P>
      <P>They toured several major tourist attractions around New York City before
attending a dinner hosted by Liao Kang-min, Taiwan's top representative in New
York. d The team defeated Riverside, California, 12-1 in the title game Saturday
to become the first team since 2001 to win the double elimination tournament
after losing its opening game.</P>
      <P>Saturday's victory also marked the sixth Taiwanese team to win the title in the
past 16 years.</P>
      <P>At the dinner in honor of the young players, Liao said the Taitung students
demonstrated strong will and indomitable spirit by coming back after losing
their first game of the tournament.</P>
      <P>Taiwan fell to Toa Baja of Puerto Rico 3-1 Aug. 8, but then beat Bay County,
Michigan 13-9 and Johnstown, Pennsylvania 7-3, to set up a showdown with Toa
Baja.</P>
      <P>Having to beat the Puerto Rican team twice in a row to reach the final, Taiwan
defeated Toa Baja 8-3 Aug. 13, and then 4-2 a day later on a dramatic home run
by Chang Cheng-nan in extra innings.</P>
      <P>Manager Wang Kuo-ching could barely contain his excitement over his team's
triumph and praised his team's ability to come together after being defeated by
Puerto Rico and going on to win all ensuing five games and finally the title.</P>
      <P>The Pony League tournament is for players aged 13 and 14. Unlike Little League,
the Pony League is composed of two-year age brackets and different sized
diamonds for different age groups.</P>

      <P>President Ma will hold two press conferences, one in English and other in
Chinese, Tuesday on the issue of disaster relief in the aftermath of Typhoon
Morakot, the Presidential Office said Monday.</P>
      <P>The Ma administration has been bombarded with questions by the local and foreign
media alike over its slow reaction and rejection of foreign aid after Typhoon
Morakot hit Taiwan more than a week ago.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-ci said that during the news conferences
Ma will explain the government's position on post-disaster rescue and relief
work.</P>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew, Secretary-General to the President Chan Chuen-po
and two Deputy Secretary-Generals to the President Lai Feng-wei and Kao Lang
will also be at the press conferences, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The Mandarin-language press conference is scheduled to be held from 2: 30 p.m.
to 3: 30 p.m.,  followed immediately by the English-language segment from 3:50
p.m. to 4:50 p.m., Wang said.</P>
      <P>The president will make a short statement before taking questions from the
media, and will answer every question candidly, no matter how critical they
might be, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot battered Taiwan last week with strong winds and torrential rains
that led to severe flooding and mudslides in some areas of central and southern
Taiwan. The death toll from the disaster had risen to at least 116 as of 10 p.m.

      <P>The European Union is sending five disaster relief experts to help Taiwan as the
country tries to dig itself out of the devastation wrought by Typhoon Morakot, a
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>"The team of five EU experts will arrive later in the day to assess what the
27-member organization can assist Taiwan in terms of post-disaster response
operations, " said Chang Chi-ping, deputy director-general of the MOFA's
Information and Cultural Department.</P>
      <P>Chang said the EU relief specialists will visit the Central Emergency Operation
Center to get an overview of the casualties and destruction caused by Morakot,
one of the worst natural disasters to rattle Taiwan in half a century.</P>
      <P>They will also travel to southern Taiwan, the hardest-hit disaster zone, to see
for themselves the severity of the damage and evaluate what kind of help the EU
can offer Taiwan, Chang said.</P>
      <P>"The EU experts are expected to focus on assessing the need for assistance in
water sanitizing, relief supply distribution and the selection of sites to
accommodate prefabricated houses for displaced typhoon victims," Chang
elaborated.</P>
      <P>A batch of water purification tablets donated by the EU is scheduled to arrive
in Taipei Aug. 21, according to Chang. He added that the goods will be delivered
to the hardest-hit disaster zones upon their arrival.</P>
      <P>Nearly 32,000 people are without clean water, according the National Fire
Agency's disaster relief center. Water purification tablets are needed to ensure
they do not fall ill drinking the local area's water.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot dumped nearly 3,000 mm of rain -- half a year's or two-thirds of
a year's rainfall in many places in Taiwan -- in just four days from midnight
Aug. 6 to 4 a.m. on Aug. 10. in certain parts of Taiwan, swelling rivers that
washed away bridges and triggering landslides that buried entire villages.</P>
      <P>The storm killed at least 126 people across Taiwan and left 45 injured and 60
others unaccounted for as of 5 p.m. Monday.</P>
      <P>But the figure on the number of people killed does not include the nearly 400
people believed to have been buried in Siaolin Village, Kaohsiung County by a
mudslide and those buried in other villages whose bodies have not yet been
uncovered. The official number of missing also does not include around 100
people from Siaolin who still could not be contacted, including children who
study in the cities.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has said the total death toll could be more than 500.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Control Yuan, Taiwan's highest watchdog body, is set to open a probe into
the failings of government officials in the wake of Typhoon Morakot, one week
after the initial emergency stages of the relief operation wrap up, Control Yuan
President Wang Chien-shien said Monday.</P>
      <P>"The Control Yuan will launch the investigation in one week and will come up
with a report within one or two months, before it moves to correct and impeach
the wrongdoings of the Executive Yuan and its ministries and subordinate
agencies over any failings in the wake of Typhoon Morakot, which lashed Taiwan
Aug. 6-10, " Wang told a news conference.</P>
      <P>Wang said the Control Yuan investigation will not kick off immediately because
aid and relief operations are the government's top concerns at the present
stage.</P>
      <P>Assuring the typhoon victims that "you are not alone, " Wang pledged that the
Control Yuan will get to the bottom of the typhoon failings and will impeach any
officials found guilty of dereliction of duty.</P>
      <P>"An overall report on areas of Taiwan prone to the danger of flooding will also
be worked out in six months," he said.</P>
      <P>Pointing to a report on the state of national territory conducted by the Control
Yuan in 2001, Wang said angrily that the government sector did not pay heed to
the report, nor has it learned anything from its suggestions. "This negligence
has led to today's disaster, " he added.</P>
      <P>Control Yuan Vice President Chen Chin-li and Secretary-General Chen Feng-yi also
attended the news conference.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, Chen Chin-li has been appointed convener of an investigative
ad hoc group composed of members from four Control Yuan committees.</P>
      <P>Apart from probing dereliction of duty by government officials, the Control Yuan
chief said the investigation will focus on the government's long-term land and
soil conservation plans to explore why Taiwan is so prone to disaster every time
a typhoon hits and delve into the question of whether mountain and slopeland
areas are over-developed.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot brought torrential rain to southern Taiwan, especially Chiayi,
Kaohsiung, Pingtung and Taitung counties.</P>
      <P>Over 100 people had been reported killed and some 600 reported missing in the
typhoon, including hundreds believed to have been buried under mudslides in
Siaolin village in Kaohsiung County. Agricultural and farm losses totaling
NT$12.27 billion (US$371.9 million).</P>

      <P>There have been no reports of epidemics in southern Taiwan areas devastated by
the massive flooding from Typhoon Morakot, a senior official at the Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) said Monday.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director-General Lin Ting made the announcement after visiting flood-
affected regions. He said most of the sick in the affected areas are suffering
from either gastrointestinal diseases, common infections of the upper
respiratory tract, or skin problems due to poor hygiene in the wake of the
flooding.</P>
      <P>There have been no reports from affected  areas of group infections of influenza
A(H1N1) or other communicable diseases, he added.</P>
      <P>However, Lin noted an increase in the number of patients seeking treatment for
chronic diseases at the provisional medical stations set up for the typhoon
victims.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, there are no shortages of drug supplies at the medical
stations, as most of them are operated by regional medical centers.</P>
      <P>Lin's assertion, however, was criticized by Lu Chung-chien, a physician at the
National Taiwan University Hospital emergency treatment division.</P>
      <P>Lu, stationed in the disaster-affected Tawu township in Taitung County where he
is providing free treatment to flood victims under the auspices of the
Taiwanroot Medical Peace Crops (TRMPC), told CNA that many chronic disease
sufferers fled their homes without bringing their medicine with them.</P>
      <P>Some of them, suffering in the shelters from lack of sleep and nutrition, have
been unable to get proper treatment at the medical stations because they lack
the drugs they require.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, TRMPC-affiliated pharmacist Wu Ming-huei complained that the southern
rescue headquarters do not know about either what kinds of medicine for chronic
disease sufferers are needed in the flood-battered areas, or where the medical
supplies should be sent.</P>
      <P>"TRMPC has packed enough medication for 2,000 chronic patients, but does not
know where to ship the supplies to," Wu said.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that despite a great quantity of donations of medical supplies
from local drug manufacturers and foreign countries, the supplies are either
stockpiled in warehouses because there are no pharmacists available who can sort
them out, or shipped to places where they are not needed.</P>
      <P>Wu expressed concern over wastage due to the short shelf life of many of the
drugs.</P>
      <P>Rebutting this complaint, officials of the Department of Health Bureau of
Pharmaceutical Affairs said the National Cheng Kung University Hospital in
Tainan City has been assisting in the distribution of supplies.</P>
      <P>The officials urged those intending to donate drugs for flood victims to
register with the bureau, which will distribute the supplies to the places most
in need.</P>

      <P>With many young children affected by the devastation wrought by Typhoon Morakot
in southern Taiwan,  a children's welfare foundation said Monday that it will
subsidize relatives and friends who provide short-term homestays for children
who have lost their homes.</P>
      <P>Miguel Wang, executive director of the Taiwan Fund for Children and Families
(TFCF), said that for each child under their care, the relatives or friends will
receive a subsidy of NT$2,000 per month, for a period of up to six months.</P>
      <P>He noted that at present, the typhoon victims are staying in makeshift shelters
or are living with relatives or friends.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, the makeshift shelters are not the most ideal of places for
young children and moving in with relatives or friends is a better option for
them.</P>
      <P>Aware and concerned about the possible economic pressure on such host families
as a result of having extra mouths to feed, the foundation decided to subsidize
such relatives and friends willing to "care for and accommodate the young
victims so that they can return to normal life soon," Wang said.</P>

      <P>Air force sources said Monday that four U.S. heavy-lift helicopters will begin
to transport heavy-duty machinery into disaster zones Tuesday to help
mountainous areas in southern Taiwan dig themselves out of the rubble left by
Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Two MH-53Es and two SH-60 Seahawks are scheduled to arrive at the Tainan air
base early Tuesday, where they will prepare to airlift excavators and other
equipment into disaster zones cut off by landslides and flooding, said Hung Wen-
cheng, a spokesman for the air base.</P>
      <P>An MH-53E and SH-60 will first embark on trial flights to scan the flight routes
shortly after their arrival, Hung said.</P>
      <P>The four helicopters were transported by the USS Denver, an amphibious transport
dock ship, to waters near Taiwan from a U.S. naval base in Okinawa, Japan,
Monday.</P>
      <P>An MH-53E helicopter flew from the dock ship to the Tainan air base later that
day. It was originally scheduled to embark on a trial flight to a disaster zone
Monday afternoon, but was forced to abort the plan because of poor weather, Hung
said.</P>
      <P>The chopper returned to the dock ship and will fly to Taiwan Tuesday morning
along with the three other helicopters, according to military sources.</P>
      <P>It was just the second time that U.S. military aircraft had landed in Taiwan
since Washington switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing in 1979.</P>
      <P>The first time was to help with relief operations following an earthquake on
Sept. 21, 1999 that killed over 2,400 people.</P>
      <P>U.S. authorities reportedly want to keep a low profile in providing assistance
to Taiwan's post-disaster relief operations in consideration of the sensitivity
of Taiwan-U.S.-China ties.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot dumped staggering amounts of rainfall in Taiwan Aug. 7-9,
swelling rivers that washed away bridges and triggering landslides that buried
entire villages.</P>
      <P>Villages nestled in mountainous parts of the southern counties of Pingtung,
Kaohsiung and Chiayi were pounded especially hard by the storm.</P>
      <P>Taiwan desperately needs helicopters capable of transporting heavy-duty
machinery or equipment to these hard-hit areas that are not currently accessible
by roads,</P>
      <P>The United States agreed to provide U.S. personnel-operated heavy-lift
helicopters and other materials to meet Taiwan's desperate need to get heavy-
duty machinery into these areas cut off from the outside world to facilitate
post-disaster recovery, Hung said.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. heavy-duty choppers will airlift five excavators to disaster zones
Tuesday, " Hung said, but he was unable to identify the exact destinations.</P>
      <P>It was reported previously that the U.S. will dispatch CH-53E choppers to assist
Taiwan in its disaster relief efforts, but Hung said the MH models were upgraded
versions of the CH models.</P>
      <P>On Monday, a U.S. C-130 transport plane also airlifted about half a ton of
calcium hypochlorite tablets for water sanitization to help ward off water-borne
diseases in disaster zones.</P>
      <P>The delivery followed a similar mission Sunday when a C-130 delivered over
15,000 pounds of plastic tarpaulin that can be used to build temporary shelters
during the reconstruction process.</P>

      <P>The more than 2,150 soldiers, standing one next to another, relayed aid and
relief supplies by hand to the villagers in the mountainous area.</P>
      <P>The long line extended more than two kilometers and crossed the riverbed of the

      <P>Maolin township became isolated after the bridge, which connected Maolin in
Kaohsiung County and Kaoshu township in Pingtung County, was destroyed by
flooding and mudslides brought about by Morakot Aug. 6-10.</P>
      <P>The military deployed the troops on the labor-intensive food delivery mission
after discovering it was difficult to install Bailey bridges in places on both
sides of the mountain leading to Maolin where existing bridges collapsed.</P>
      <P>The first batch of foodstuffs  and other  materials  were transported by three
big trucks to the main gate of the Maolin National Scenic Area at 11 a.m.</P>
      <P>The troops immediately began delivering the supplies by hand and completed the

      <P>The military continued air-dropping supplies on Monday to 17 mountain villages
in Chiayi County that were cut off from the outside world by landslides and
flooding triggered by Typhoon Morakot from Aug. 6-10.</P>
      <P>Rescue teams from Chiayi Air Base began the operation at 4 a.m., supplying a

also airlifting 160 people from nine mountain tribes in the typhoon-battered

      <P>Chiayi County Magistrate Chen Ming-wen reiterated earlier in the day his
determination to deliver additional supplies to every typhoon victim in the
county. He also said his administration was outlining a short-term supply plan

      <P>According to the county government, the 17 cut-off villages include 11 in
Alishan township, one in Dapu township, two in Jhuci township, two in Fanlu
township and one in Meishan township.</P>
      <P>The townships are all situated in the Alishan area, which received nearly 3,000
mm of rain during the typhoon. The massive amount of precipitation, more than
usually falls in an entire year, created huge torrents of water that flooded
riverbanks.</P>
      <P>The rainfall also precipitated massive landslides, destroying the mountain roads

      <P>Nearly 400 alternative military servicemen in a military barrack in central

      <P>Canada will donate 50,000 Canadian dollars (US$45,454.55) to help with Taiwan's
post-typhoon relief efforts, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said in a
statement Monday.</P>
      <P>The Canadian representative to Taiwan, Ronald Macintosh, will deliver the money
contributed by the Canadian government to Taiwan's Red Cross Society Tuesday,
the statement said.</P>
      <P>Staff members of the Canadian Trade Office in Taipei have also chipped in to
help those affected by Typhoon Morakot, donating a total of NT$67,300
(US$2,039.39), which will also be delivered to the Red Cross Society.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Canadian government will also donate 200,000 water purification
tablets for use in disaster zones, which were battered by Morakot-triggered
deluge and landslides, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Nearly 32,000 people are without clean water, according to the National Fire
Agency's disaster relief center. Water purification tablets are needed to ensure
they do not fall ill drinking the local area's water.</P>
      <P>Several other countries, including Australia, the United States and the European
Union, have also donated such tablets to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On Monday, four EU disaster relief experts arrived in Taiwan to assess how
Europe can assist Taiwan's post-disaster response operations.</P>
      <P>The four EU experts, led by Roger Valberg of Sweden, will stay in Taiwan for 10
to 12 days to help with relief efforts, MOFA officials said.</P>
      <P>A fifth member of the EU team will arrive in the next few days to join the
relief operations, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a batch of disaster relief supplies, including 250 blankets, 42
sleeping bags and 32 tents, donated by Germany's civic group Aviation Without
Borders will be delivered to Taiwan Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Aviation Without Borders is the German branch of the European family of
aviation charities.</P>
      <P>China Airlines, Taiwan's largest carrier, will airlift the goods to Taiwan from
Germany free of charge, MOFA officials said.</P>
      <P>At least 59 countries from around the world, as well as 19 international
organizations and foreign civic groups have made donations to help disaster-
stricken families in southern Taiwan, disaster response officials said.</P>
      <P>As of 3 a.m. Saturday, foreign entities had donated NT$54.72 million (US$1.66
million) to the cause, according to tallies released by the Central Emergency
Operation Center.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot dumped nearly 3,000 mm of rain in just four days from midnight
Aug. 6 to 4 a.m. on Aug. 10. in certain parts of Taiwan, swelling rivers that
washed away bridges and triggering landslides that buried entire villages.</P>
      <P>The storm killed at least 126 people across Taiwan and left 45 injured and 60
others unaccounted for as of 5 p.m. Monday.</P>
      <P>But the official death toll does not include the nearly 400 people believed to
have been buried in Siaolin Village, Kaohsiung County, by a mudslide and those
buried in other villages whose bodies have not yet been uncovered.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has said the total death toll could be more than 500.</P>

      <P>Council of Agriculture (COA) Chairman Chen Wu-hsiung announced Monday that the
council will unveil a NT$2 billion (US$60 million) plan Tuesday to help certain
farmers and fishermen who sustained losses in Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, Chen said the new measures were devised mainly to
assist farmers and fishermen who might otherwise not qualify for subsidies under
existing regulations.</P>
      <P>"The council will put forward the additional measures to help some farmers and
fishermen who, due to land, property, or business ownership registration
problems, might not be eligible to apply for existing government subsidies,"
Chen said.</P>
      <P>The new plan could cover an estimated 25,000 farmers and fishermen and will be
effective from Aug. 18- 31, he said.</P>
      <P>Farmers will be subsidized NT$16,000 for each hectare of damaged rice paddies
and NT$60,000 for each hectare of damaged orchards. Hog raisers will also be
given NT$500 for each pig that they lost in the typhoon.</P>
      <P>The new measures will be implemented in 14 cities and counties that have already
been proclaimed by the COA as natural disaster areas qualifying for financial
aid in the wake of Typhoon Morakot, which lashed Taiwan Aug. 6-10.</P>
      <P>The 14 cities and counties are Kaohsiung, Hualien, Pingtung, Taitung, Tainan,
Yunlin, Chiayi, Changhua, Taichung, Nantou, Miaoli and Penghu counties, as well
as Tainan and Chiayi cities.</P>
      <P>Farmers and fishermen who sustained serious losses but who do not live in the
above mentioned localities are also entitled to the new measures as long as
local governments and COA officials jointly verify their losses on the spot.</P>

      <P>With Taiwan preoccupied with relief efforts in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakat,
top government officials are considering whether to cancel all activities
related to the National Day celebrations, government sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>The sources said that at a regular Monday meeting of five officials,  including
President  Ma Ying-jeou and Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, the participants agreed
that typhoon relief work should take precedence over everything else given the
number of casualties and tremendous property losses suffered in the storm.</P>
      <P>The five-member team therefore discussed canceling the National Day festivities,
just as the government did following a devastating magnitude 7.3 earthquake on
Sept. 21, 1999.</P>
      <P>An organizing committee for the National Day celebrations will convene a
provisional meeting Aug. 19.</P>
      <P>The sources said that if there is a consensus that the National Day celebrations
should be canceled, then it will still need the confirmation of the committee
meeting Wednesday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan shifts U.N. bid strategy, targets specialized agencies</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior Taiwanese diplomatic official argued Monday that the government has not
given up its bid for representation in the United Nations despite its inaction
to launch a new campaign by the U.N. deadline this year.</P>
      <P>"The inaction marks a significant change in our strategy to take part in U.N.
activities," said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>"We will focus on securing seats in selected U.N. specialized organizations, "
the official said, adding that the government will brief the public and
international society on its ultimate goal and changing strategy later.</P>
      <P>"The content of our new U.N. bid will be finalized and unveiled this week," he
elaborated.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, Taiwan had annually asked its diplomatic allies to come up with a
proposal asking the U.N. Steering Committee to include Taiwan's membership bid
on the agenda of the annual session of the U.N. General Assembly.</P>
      <P>Although the annual bid never succeeded due to China's vocal opposition, it
represented the government's determination to upgrade Taiwan's international
profile.</P>
      <P>According to U.N. regulations, Taiwan's membership bid should be filed with the
U.N. Secretariat one month before the opening of the annual session of the
General Assembly.</P>
      <P>This year's General Assembly session is scheduled to open Sept. 15 in New York,
but Taiwan's government did not ask any diplomatic ally to present the
membership bid proposal to the U.N. Secretariat before Aug. 15 as it had in the
past.</P>
      <P>"The inaction indicates that the government had no intention to come up with
such a proposal this time around," said the official.</P>
      <P>He stressed, however, that the inaction should not be interpreted as abandoning
the U.N. bid.</P>
      <P>"We will never forgo our goal of seeking meaningful participation in U.N.
activities in a pragmatic manner," the official said.</P>
      <P>Since President Ma Ying-jeou assumed office, his administration has pursued a
flexible diplomatic strategy to halt a diplomatic tug-of-war with China in
luring diplomatic allies with lucrative financial aid.</P>
      <P>"Although  this strategy has been effective in helping us consolidate relations
with our existing diplomatic allies, it doesn't mean we'll have a smooth ride in
pursuing representation in major international organizations, " the official
said.</P>
      <P>With China's tacit agreement, Taiwan managed to attend this year's World Health
Assembly -- the decision-making body of the World Health Organization -- in May
as an observer under the designation of Chinese Taipei.</P>
      <P>The official said the government will follow the similiar pragmatic strategy in
seeking representation  in selected U.N. specialized agencies that major foreign
countries will support and will serve Taiwan's major national interests.</P>
      <P>Thsoe organizations may include in the International Civil Aviation Organization
and the International Maritime Organization, the official said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. heavy-lift choppers to go into service Tuesday</HEADLINE>

      <P>Air force sources said Monday that four U.S. heavy-lift helicopters will begin
to transport heavy-duty machinery into disaster zones Tuesday to help
mountainous areas in southern Taiwan dig themselves out of the rubble left by
Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Two MH-53Es and two SH-60 Seahawks are scheduled to arrive at the Tainan air
base early Tuesday, where they will prepare to airlift excavators and other
equipment into disaster zones cut off by landslides and flooding, said Hung Wen-
cheng, a spokesman for the air base.</P>
      <P>An MH-53E and SH-60 will first embark on trial flights to scan the flight routes
shortly after their arrival, Hung said.</P>
      <P>The four helicopters were transported by the USS Denver, an amphibious transport
dock ship, to waters near Taiwan from a U.S. naval base in Okinawa, Japan,
Monday.</P>
      <P>An MH-53E helicopter flew from the dock ship to the Tainan air base later that
day. It was originally scheduled to embark on a trial flight to a disaster zone
Monday afternoon, but was forced to abort the plan because of poor weather, Hung
said.</P>
      <P>The chopper returned to the dock ship and will fly to Taiwan Tuesday morning
along with the three other helicopters, according to military sources.</P>
      <P>It was just the second time that U.S. military aircraft had landed in Taiwan
since Washington switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing in 1979.</P>
      <P>The first time was to help with relief operations following an earthquake on
Sept. 21, 1999 that killed over 2,400 people.</P>
      <P>U.S. authorities reportedly want to keep a low profile in providing assistance
to Taiwan's post-disaster relief operations in consideration of the sensitivity
of Taiwan-U.S.-China ties.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot dumped staggering amounts of rainfall in Taiwan Aug. 7-9,
swelling rivers that washed away bridges and triggering landslides that buried
entire villages.</P>
      <P>Villages nestled in mountainous parts of the southern counties of Pingtung,
Kaohsiung and Chiayi were pounded especially hard by the storm.</P>
      <P>Taiwan desperately needs helicopters capable of transporting heavy-duty
machinery or equipment to these hard-hit areas that are not currently accessible
by roads,</P>
      <P>The United States agreed to provide U.S. personnel-operated heavy-lift
helicopters and other materials to meet Taiwan's desperate need to get heavy-
duty machinery into these areas cut off from the outside world to facilitate
post-disaster recovery, Hung said.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. heavy-duty choppers will airlift five excavators to disaster zones
Tuesday, " Hung said, but he was unable to identify the exact destinations.</P>
      <P>It was reported previously that the U.S. will dispatch CH-53E choppers to assist
Taiwan in its disaster relief efforts, but Hung said the MH models were upgraded
versions of the CH models.</P>
      <P>On Monday, a U.S. C-130 transport plane also airlifted about half a ton of
calcium hypochlorite tablets for water sanitization to help ward off water-borne
diseases in disaster zones.</P>
      <P>The delivery followed a similar mission Sunday when a C-130 delivered over
15,000 pounds of plastic tarpaulin that can be used to build temporary shelters
during the reconstruction process.</P>

      <P>Canada will donate 50,000 Canadian dollars (US$45,454.55) to help with Taiwan's
post-typhoon relief efforts, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said in a
statement Monday.</P>
      <P>The Canadian representative to Taiwan, Ronald Macintosh, will deliver the money
contributed by the Canadian government to Taiwan's Red Cross Society Tuesday,
the statement said.</P>
      <P>Staff members of the Canadian Trade Office in Taipei have also chipped in to
help those affected by Typhoon Morakot, donating a total of NT$67,300
(US$2,039.39), which will also be delivered to the Red Cross Society.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Canadian government will also donate 200,000 water purification
tablets for use in disaster zones, which were battered by Morakot-triggered
deluge and landslides, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Nearly 32,000 people are without clean water, according to the National Fire
Agency's disaster relief center. Water purification tablets are needed to ensure
they do not fall ill drinking the local area's water.</P>
      <P>Several other countries, including Australia, the United States and the European
Union, have also donated such tablets to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On Monday, four EU disaster relief experts arrived in Taiwan to assess how
Europe can assist Taiwan's post-disaster response operations.</P>
      <P>The four EU experts, led by Roger Valberg of Sweden, will stay in Taiwan for 10
to 12 days to help with relief efforts, MOFA officials said.</P>
      <P>A fifth member of the EU team will arrive in the next few days to join the
relief operations, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a batch of disaster relief supplies, including 250 blankets, 42
sleeping bags and 32 tents, donated by Germany's civic group Aviation Without
Borders will be delivered to Taiwan Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Aviation Without Borders is the German branch of the European family of
aviation charities.</P>
      <P>China Airlines, Taiwan's largest carrier, will airlift the goods to Taiwan from
Germany free of charge, MOFA officials said.</P>
      <P>At least 59 countries from around the world, as well as 19 international
organizations and foreign civic groups have made donations to help disaster-
stricken families in southern Taiwan, disaster response officials said.</P>
      <P>As of 3 a.m. Saturday, foreign entities had donated NT$54.72 million (US$1.66
million) to the cause, according to tallies released by the Central Emergency
Operation Center.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot dumped nearly 3,000 mm of rain in just four days from midnight
Aug. 6 to 4 a.m. on Aug. 10. in certain parts of Taiwan, swelling rivers that
washed away bridges and triggering landslides that buried entire villages.</P>
      <P>The storm killed at least 126 people across Taiwan and left 45 injured and 60
others unaccounted for as of 5 p.m. Monday.</P>
      <P>But the official death toll does not include the nearly 400 people believed to
have been buried in Siaolin Village, Kaohsiung County, by a mudslide and those
buried in other villages whose bodies have not yet been uncovered.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has said the total death toll could be more than 500.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Council of Agriculture (COA) Chairman Chen Wu-hsiung announced Monday that the
council will unveil a NT$2 billion (US$60 million) plan Tuesday to help certain
farmers and fishermen who sustained losses in Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, Chen said the new measures were devised mainly to
assist farmers and fishermen who might otherwise not qualify for subsidies under
existing regulations.</P>
      <P>"The council will put forward the additional measures to help some farmers and
fishermen who, due to land, property, or business ownership registration
problems, might not be eligible to apply for existing government subsidies,"
Chen said.</P>
      <P>The new plan could cover an estimated 25,000 farmers and fishermen and will be
effective from Aug. 18- 31, he said.</P>
      <P>Farmers will be subsidized NT$16,000 for each hectare of damaged rice paddies
and NT$60,000 for each hectare of damaged orchards. Hog raisers will also be
given NT$500 for each pig that they lost in the typhoon.</P>
      <P>The new measures will be implemented in 14 cities and counties that have already
been proclaimed by the COA as natural disaster areas qualifying for financial
aid in the wake of Typhoon Morakot, which lashed Taiwan Aug. 6-10.</P>
      <P>The 14 cities and counties are Kaohsiung, Hualien, Pingtung, Taitung, Tainan,
Yunlin, Chiayi, Changhua, Taichung, Nantou, Miaoli and Penghu counties, as well
as Tainan and Chiayi cities.</P>
      <P>Farmers and fishermen who sustained serious losses but who do not live in the
above mentioned localities are also entitled to the new measures as long as
local governments and COA officials jointly verify their losses on the spot.</P>

      <P>With Taiwan preoccupied with relief efforts in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakat,
top government officials are considering whether to cancel all activities
related to the National Day celebrations, government sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>The sources said that at a regular Monday meeting of five officials,  including
President  Ma Ying-jeou and Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, the participants agreed
that typhoon relief work should take precedence over everything else given the
number of casualties and tremendous property losses suffered in the storm.</P>
      <P>The five-member team therefore discussed canceling the National Day festivities,
just as the government did following a devastating magnitude 7.3 earthquake on
Sept. 21, 1999.</P>
      <P>An organizing committee for the National Day celebrations will convene a
provisional meeting Aug. 19.</P>
      <P>The sources said that if there is a consensus that the National Day celebrations
should be canceled, then it will still need the confirmation of the committee
meeting Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The storm killed at least 126 people across Taiwan and left 45 injured and 60
others unaccounted for as of 5 p.m. Monday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan shifts U.N. bid strategy, targets specialized agencies</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior Taiwanese diplomatic official argued Monday that the government has not
given up its bid for representation in the United Nations despite its inaction
to launch a new campaign by the U.N. deadline this year.</P>
      <P>"The inaction marks a significant change in our strategy to take part in U.N.
activities," said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>"We will focus on securing seats in selected U.N. specialized organizations, "
the official said, adding that the government will brief the public and
international society on its ultimate goal and changing strategy later.</P>
      <P>"The content of our new U.N. bid will be finalized and unveiled this week," he
elaborated.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, Taiwan had annually asked its diplomatic allies to come up with a
proposal asking the U.N. Steering Committee to include Taiwan's membership bid
on the agenda of the annual session of the U.N. General Assembly.</P>
      <P>Although the annual bid never succeeded due to China's vocal opposition, it
represented the government's determination to upgrade Taiwan's international
profile.</P>
      <P>According to U.N. regulations, Taiwan's membership bid should be filed with the
U.N. Secretariat one month before the opening of the annual session of the
General Assembly.</P>
      <P>This year's General Assembly session is scheduled to open Sept. 15 in New York,
but Taiwan's government did not ask any diplomatic ally to present the
membership bid proposal to the U.N. Secretariat before Aug. 15 as it had in the
past.</P>
      <P>"The inaction indicates that the government had no intention to come up with
such a proposal this time around," said the official.</P>
      <P>He stressed, however, that the inaction should not be interpreted as abandoning
the U.N. bid.</P>
      <P>"We will never forgo our goal of seeking meaningful participation in U.N.
activities in a pragmatic manner," the official said.</P>
      <P>Since President Ma Ying-jeou assumed office, his administration has pursued a
flexible diplomatic strategy to halt a diplomatic tug-of-war with China in
luring diplomatic allies with lucrative financial aid.</P>
      <P>"Although  this strategy has been effective in helping us consolidate relations
with our existing diplomatic allies, it doesn't mean we'll have a smooth ride in
pursuing representation in major international organizations, " the official
said.</P>
      <P>With China's tacit agreement, Taiwan managed to attend this year's World Health
Assembly -- the decision-making body of the World Health Organization -- in May
as an observer under the designation of Chinese Taipei.</P>
      <P>The official said the government will follow the similiar pragmatic strategy in
seeking representation  in selected U.N. specialized agencies that major foreign
countries will support and will serve Taiwan's major national interests.</P>
      <P>Thsoe organizations may include in the International Civil Aviation Organization
and the International Maritime Organization, the official said.</P>

      <P>The military continued air-dropping supplies on Monday to 17 mountain villages
in Chiayi County that were cut off from the outside world by landslides and
flooding triggered by Typhoon Morakot from Aug. 6-10.</P>
      <P>Rescue teams from Chiayi Air Base began the operation at 4 a.m., supplying a
total of 17,050 kilograms of relief supplies to the villages during the day and
also airlifting 160 people from nine mountain tribes in the typhoon-battered
areas to safety.</P>
      <P>Chiayi County Magistrate Chen Ming-wen reiterated earlier in the day his
determination to deliver additional supplies to every typhoon victim in the
county. He also said his administration was outlining a short-term supply plan
to ensure that none of the victims suffered.</P>
      <P>According to the county government, the 17 cut-off villages include 11 in
Alishan township, one in Dapu township, two in Jhuci township, two in Fanlu
township and one in Meishan township.</P>
      <P>The townships are all situated in the Alishan area, which received nearly 3,000
mm of rain during the typhoon. The massive amount of precipitation, more than
usually falls in an entire year, created huge torrents of water that flooded
riverbanks.</P>
      <P>The rainfall also precipitated massive landslides, destroying the mountain roads
and bridges that connect the villages with the outside world, and the military
has began work to repair them, the Chiayi County government said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Hsinchu  City  Mayor  Lin Junq-tzer  said  his administration  will
directly  contact  authorities  of  the typhoon-devastated townships in southern
Taiwan, voluntarily offering its assistance in post-disaster restoration.</P>

      <P>Nearly 400 alternative military servicemen in a military barrack in central
Taiwan have shown influenza-like symptoms in the single largest cluster
infection in Taiwan, the Department of Health (DOH) reported Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin Ting, deputy director-general of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
, said 374 out of 2,700 servicemen have developed influenza symptoms.</P>
      <P>As of noon Monday, 81 had been tested positive for influenza A, and laboratory
screening confirmed some to have the H1N1 flu strain and others the seasonal H3
strain.</P>
      <P>"The patients are all mild cases and are being treated with Tamiflu," Lin said.</P>
      <P>"The CDC cannot rule out the possibility that the trainees have been infected
with the new flu, and we will also not rule out the possibility of more cases,"
he added.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the men were participating in three weeks of basic training due to
end Aug. 24.</P>
      <P>Leaves and family visits have been suspended because of the cluster infection,
Lin said, but it will not affect the dispatching of new trainees to the
military.</P>
      <P>The cluster infection came to light Aug. 10 when a spate of servicemen began to
develop fevers, coughs, sore throats and aches.</P>
      <P>The barrack notified the health authority the following day and an epidemic
investigation was conducted immediately.</P>
      <P>The 1922 hot line provided by the CDC for reporting the epidemic has since been
swamped  with calls by family members of the servicemen, many of whom protested
that they could not visit them.</P>
      <P>The CDC estimated that there were an additional 9,000 new flu cases through
community infection over the past week.</P>
      <P>The number of serious case increased to 25, and among them, three are still in
intensive care.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) is closely monitoring the potential spread of
disease in southern Taiwan areas devastated by flooding from Typhoon Morakot, a
senior official with the DOH's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said Monday.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director-General Lin Ting said that although there have been no
reports from affected areas of group infections of influenza A (H1N1) or other
diseases, the CDC will still closely monitor the situation there, as 10,000 new
cases of the H1N1 flu strain were reported in the past week around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin said the CDC has also prepared 23,000 doses of tetanus boosters to prevent
wounded disaster victims and relief workers in flood-affected areas from getting
lockjaw.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks after visiting flood-affected regions Monday. He said most
ailing people in the disaster areas are suffering from either gastrointestinal
diseases, infections of the upper respiratory tract, or skin problems due to
poor hygiene in the wake of the flooding.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said, the CDC will assess whether to include victims from the
flood-affected areas on the priority list of people entitled to receive
influenza A (H1N1) vaccines. The list currently includes pregnant women and
medical personnel.</P>
      <P>Concerns that the flu is becoming more widespread in Taiwan have mounted after
400 alternative military servicemen in a military barrack in central Taiwan
showed flu-like symptoms recently in the single largest cluster infection in the
country to date.</P>
      <P>As of noon Monday, according to Lin, 81 had been tested positive for influenza
A, and laboratory screening confirmed some to have the H1N1 flu strain and
others the seasonal H3 strain.</P>
      <P>"The patients are all mild cases and are being treated with Tamiflu," Lin said.</P>
      <P>In related news, five junior high school students from Hsinchu were tested
positive for the H1N1 flu strain Monday in South Korea. They have been put under
observation by Korean health authorities until Aug. 23.</P>
      <P>The five students were among 150 students and teachers from two Hsinchu junior
high schools who were on a performance tour on Jeju Island. They were originally
scheduled to conclude their trip Aug. 18.</P>

      <P>Deputy Foreign Minister Andrew Hsia has offered  to step  down  to take
responsibility  for declining international assistance in the early days after
Typhoon Morakot struck, Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Premier Liu Chao-shiuan has not yet made any decision on Hsia's resignation, "
Ou said, noting that he referred a letter of resignation submitted by Hsia to
the premier Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Ou, the premier asked him to first decide whether to accept Hsia's
resignation or not, a decision Ou said would be painful but one he would make
soon.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs apologized Aug. 14 for telling its overseas
representative offices to politely decline international assistance such as
supplies and rescuers in the wake of Typhoon Morakot, describing it as a
technical error made out of negligence.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry issued instructions Aug. 11 to all MOFA's foreign
representative offices to politely decline offers by host governments to provide
assistance in dealing with the massive flooding and landslides in southern
Taiwan triggered by the typhoon Aug. 7-9.</P>
      <P>"It was a technical error in that we did not make clear that it should have read
'temporarily' decline international assistance. If such negligence has caused
any bad public perception, I solemnly apologize to the public on behalf of the
ministry, " Hsia said that day.</P>
      <P>"As the acting foreign minister, I will take full responsibility and accept any
disciplinary action, " Hsia said. Ou was out of the country attending a meeting.</P>
      <P>Hsia also noted that neither the Presidential Office nor the Executive Yuan were
aware of the telegram.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry has been lambasted by the media over the past few days for
declining offers of foreign assistance in the wake of Morakot.</P>
      <P>The United States, Japan, Singapore and other countries have made donations and
have expressed willingness to provide additional assistance.</P>
      <P>The MOFA said in its own defense that it was waiting for the Central Disaster
Emergency Operation Center to clarify the needs of victims and rescuers before
approaching the international community.</P>
      <P>The central government later released a list of items that Taiwan needs from the
international community for its rescue and relief operations, including
specialized helicopters capable of transporting very heavy payloads, and
sanitation supplies.</P>

      <P>A tropical depression that has turned into a tropical storm over the West
Pacific early Tuesday morning may not pose a direct threat to Taiwan, Central
Weather Bureau (CWB) reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the CWB, as of 8 a.m., tropical storm Vamco was located some 1,000
kilometers southwest of Wake Island or more than 4,000 kilometers east of
Taiwan's southernmost tip of Eluanbi, moving in a north-northwesterly direction
at a speed of 16 kilometers per hour.</P>
      <P>Although it is unlikely  the storm will hit Taiwan,  CWB meteorologists said
they will still closely monitor the storm, given that the system's course or
strength could change in the following days.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile the hot weather in Taiwan will persist Tuesday, with temperatures
expected to reach 35 degrees Celsius in northern Taiwan, 34 degrees in central
and southern Taiwan and 33 degrees in the eastern part of the island, the CWB
said.</P>

      <P>Thailand and the Philippines made contributions Tuesday to help with Taiwan's
post-typhoon relief efforts,  donating NT$1,165,000  (US$35,000)  and NT$2
million, respectively, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).</P>
      <P>Arbhorn Manasvanich, the executive director of the Taipei-based Thailand Trade
and Economic Office, presented the Thai government's donation of NT$1 million
along with NT$165,000 contributed by Thai citizens to Matthew Lee, director-
general of the MOFA's Department of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, at a press
briefing.</P>
      <P>Manasvanich said that the money shows Thailand's heartfelt condolences and
sympathy for Taiwan's people, and she hoped it would help relieve their
suffering.</P>
      <P>We hope that the government and people of Taiwan will be successful in the
reconstruction and rehabilitation process, " Manasvanich said.</P>
      <P>Lee said countries in the Asia-Pacific region have all expressed deep concern
for the scale of the destruction caused by Typhoon Morakot, which devastated
southern Taiwan Aug. 7-9.</P>
      <P>In addition to Australia, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand and other countries,
the Philippines also donated NT$2 million the same day in the wake of the
natural disaster, Lee said.</P>
      <P>As of Tuesday, at least 72 countries from around the world, as well as 16
international organizations, have donated a total of NT$95 million to help
disaster-stricken families in southern Taiwan, according to the latest rallies
released by the foreign ministry.</P>
      <P>A five-member team from the European Union, who arrived in the country the
previous day, are scheduled to visit the Central Emergency Operations Center,
Vice Foreign Minister David Lin and the Red Cross Society of the Republic  of
China,  to develop an understanding of current relief operations, according to
the MOFA.</P>
      <P>The EU team will leave for southern Taiwan Aug. 19 to join the relief operations
and stay for 10-12 days to assess disaster relief needs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a batch of disaster relief supplies, including 250 blankets, 42
sleeping bags and 32 tents donated by Germany's civic group Aviation Without
Borders, arrived in Taiwan earlier Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot dumped nearly 3,000 mm of rain in just four days from midnight
Aug. 6 to 4 a.m. on Aug. 10. in certain parts of Taiwan, swelling rivers that
washed away bridges and triggering landslides that buried entire villages.</P>
      <P>As of 8: 30 a.m. Tuesday, the storm has killed at least 127 people across Taiwan
and left 45 injured and 307 others unaccounted for.</P>

      <P>Experience, educational background, and professional skills are the qualities
employers are looking for in resumes, and 89 percent of them also expect a
concise biography with the resume, according to a survey conducted by a local
employment agency.</P>
      <P>The employers responding to the 1111 Human Resources Bank survey said a resume
must make it through an average of three different internal checks before an
interview is scheduled and at least two interviews are needed for applicants to
get jobs.</P>
      <P>As for other parts of the job application process, the four main qualities
expected to be reflected in a biography are experience, past achievements,
ambition and character.</P>
      <P>In an interview, employers are looking for an ability to get along with others,
proper manners, verbal communication skills and interaction with the
interviewer.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that companies want people to be able to work alone,
communicate well with others, and have quick reactions.</P>
      <P>Sixty percent of respondents said they give written tests during interviews that
mainly focus on professional knowledge, adaptive tests, and linguistic ability.</P>
      <P>Wu Rui-ying, the deputy general manager of the online employment agency,
cautioned job seekers that applying for jobs is not like winning a lottery.</P>
      <P>Sending resumes out randomly will not increase the odds of getting an interview,
much less a job. The only way to get hired is to fully understand how companies
recruit and the positions they need to fill.</P>
      <P>Although survey respondents said experience and professional achievements should
be part of an applicant's biography, Wu said a biography should be concise and
only address points that were not detailed in the applicant's resume, such as
character or special talents or experience.</P>
      <P>The biography should also include an analysis of the applicant's strengths and
weaknesses and why the applicant is able to handle the job, revealing his or her
desire to be hired.</P>
      <P>The survey of human resource centers and managers of companies using the online
hiring firm was conducted between July 31 and Aug. 13. A total of 540 valid
responses were collected.</P>

      <P>Japan has decided to give more disaster relief aid to Taiwan following its
donation of 10 million yen last week, its Ministry of Foreign Affairs said
Monday.</P>
      <P>The Japan government will offer Taiwan additional aid amounting to 100 million
yen (NT$35 million or US$1.06 million) for urgent relief work, given that the
death toll and damage from Typhoon Morakot have escalated, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>Some 50 million yen will be donated in the form of cash, and the rest will be
given for disaster relief supplies and other needs, according to the ministry.</P>
      <P>It also said that the Japan International Cooperation Agency will sent a team to
the typhoon-affected areas of Taiwan Tuesday to assess how best Japan can help
the victims.</P>
      <P>Based on the team's report, Tokyo will decide what kind of relief supplies it
should send to Taiwan, according to the ministry.</P>
      <P>Japan was the first country in the world to donate money to Taiwan in the

NT$1 million (US$30,488) per casualty in condolence money.</P>
      <P>To date, however, only 35 families have received the money because of the

      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Golden 72 hours lost</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has recovered a little since his poor response to the
storm flood caused an uproar in the early stages of the ongoing relief
operations.</P>
      <P>His initial inadequate response sprung from the following flaws in his
character:</P>
      <P>First, he lacks a sense of empathy. He cannot identify with the feelings of
others, and he cannot hide this flaw.</P>
      <P>Second, he doesn't have the backbone to make quick and firm decisions. This was
demonstrated by his refusal to declare a state of emergency.</P>
      <P>He convened a meeting of the National Security Council four days after the
crisis, when things were getting out of control, and he came up with only some
trivial decisions.</P>
      <P>In the face of disaster, the head of state should be able to take extraordinary
action to lead the country out of crisis rather than stick to the legal
framework and system.</P>
      <P>Being meticulous about procedural details is an appropriate approach for other
officials, but not for a head of state.</P>
      <P>After the disaster, Ma had 72 hours to show his leadership, but he squandered
that time and there is no way to recover it now.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>What are the responsibilities of a president?</P>
      <P>President Ma told CNN that he will take full responsibility for the disaster
caused by Typhoon Morakot, by examining the mistakes his administration made and
disciplining the officials who failed in their duties.</P>
      <P>Ma's answer has exposed his ignorance of his responsibilities.</P>
      <P>No wonder, 82 percent of the people surveyed by CNN say Ma should step down.</P>
      <P>As president of the state and the supreme commander of the armed forces, he
should ask himself, did he order the armed forces to engage in the rescue
operations, and has the National Security Council fulfilled its functions?</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan and the National Security Council are the two executive arms
of the government, but both of them have failed to fulfill their duties.</P>
      <P>In order to show his determination to take responsibility, the president should
reshuffle his Cabinet and sack his national security chief.</P>
      <P>Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>Don't let down the people who donate cash generously to relief operations</P>
      <P>It is reported that the disaster areas in southern Taiwan have been flooded with
relief materials which pose a threat for another disaster.</P>
      <P>We urged people to donate cash instead of materials as cash is preferred by most
of the victims and would help them rebuild not only their lives but also their
mental ability.</P>
      <P>We also call the authorities to set up a transparent system to ensure that every
penny donated for the victims will be used for them.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>All aid from China and United States is humanitarian aid</P>
      <P>A U.S. military transport plane loaded with relief supplies landed in Taiwan
Aug. 16 for the first time since the two countries severed ties in 1979.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for China, which opposes any official contact between Washington and
Taipei, said it was humanitarian aid delivered via a civic channel.</P>
      <P>This comment contrasts sharply with Beijing's reaction in 1999 when an official
of China's Red Cross Society said that countries wishing to render aid to Taiwan
in the aftermath of a fatal earthquake should first seek Beijing's approval.</P>
      <P>It shows what a long way China has come in its understanding of humanitarianism,
and no explanation is required to identify which response is the wiser one.</P>
      <P>We hope the authorities will accept whatever aid China offers to Taiwan, even it
is not urgently needed, since it will help to improve the atmosphere across the
strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Identities of Typhoon Morakot victims to be confirmed quickly: MOJ</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Government offices will try to determine the identities of victims of Typhoon
Morakot as quickly as possible so as to help bring closure to bereaved families,
according to the head of Taiwan's Ministry of Justice Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister Huang Shih-min told a news conference that results of identity
tests, such as DNA tests, can be obtained within five days after the test is
conducted, denying local media reports that the process was moving at a snail's
pace.</P>
      <P>Death certificates can be issued three months after all the rescue work in the
aftermath of the typhoon have been completed, Huang said. They will be issued
for people who were either confirmed dead or listed as unaccounted for, but
later proven dead by district prosecutors.</P>
      <P>Huang denied reports that family members  of people missing in the typhoon and
feared dead will have to wait one year for an official declaration of death of
their loved ones.</P>
      <P>He said the ministry's Institute of Forensic Medicine and its Investigation
Bureau have been working together in giving DNA tests.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of people were buried in mud and debris washed down by landslides
triggered by torrential rain from Morakot, including 380 residents of Siaolin
village in Jiasian township, Kaohsiung County, who were believed to have been
buried in the mudslide. Another 100 people in the village are unaccounted for,
including people who could be studying or working in other cities.</P>
      <P>The survivors of the village have decided to leave their buried loved ones
untouched instead of excavating their bodies at the site where the village used
to be.</P>
      <P>As for the dead whose bodies cannot be found, Huang said prosecutors will launch
an investigation based on relevant family members' testimony before acting to
issue a death certificate -- an indispensable document for the victim's family
members to apply for government compensation for typhoon victims.</P>
      <P>According to the Executive Yuan, for each killed or missing from the typhoon,
the government will compensate their family NT$1 million, while offering
NT$250,000 for each severely-wounded survivor.</P>
      <P>As of 4 p.m. Tuesday, the total number of confirmed fatalities had risen to 128,
with 307 people missing and 45 injured, according to the National Fire Agency's
disaster relief center.</P>
      <P>The figures, however, do not include those believed buried in Siaolin Village
and 32 people buried in the Xinkai tribe of Taoyuan township, Kaohsiung County.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>- President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that a special budget amounting to NT$110
billion will be needed for post-typhoon reconstruction work after Typhoon
Morakot brought widespread destruction to the island.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference for foreign journalists, President Ma said that
the administration already has NT$40 billion of the total reconstruction budget
needed, but needs to ask the legislature to approve another NT$70 billion.</P>
      <P>The source of the money will likely come from debt borrowing, Ma said, adding
that Taiwan's amount of debt, currently at 32 percent of its gross domestic
product is still under the maximum ceiling allowed of 40 percent.</P>
      <P>While drafting special provisions and guidelines for the reconstruction work,
the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) under the Executive
Yuan has initially set the special budget at NT$100 billion, according to CEPD
Vice Chairman Hu Chung-ying.</P>
      <P>He said that the draft provisions have been submitted to the Cabinet for
screening. It is expected that the Cabinet will approve the provisions at its
Thursday meeting and forward the bill to the Legislative Yuan to be enacted.</P>
      <P>The draft provisions will allow local governments in hardest-hit counties to
submit budget plans to subsidize businesses that were battered by Typhoon
Morakot, particularly those in the tourism and agricultural sectors, Hu said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Hu said, efforts to help displaced people from the flood-affected
areas to find employment or receive vocational training will also be financed by
the central government in accordance with the draft bill.</P>
      <P>Much of the reconstruction budget will be used to rebuild damaged bridges, roads
and houses as well as to resettle thousands of people displaced.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou apologized Tuesday for the government's shortcomings in
dealing with the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot and pledged to punish any liable
officials by early September.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks at a news conference held to address mounting public
resentment and criticisms that the government's response to the disaster was
slow and its rescue efforts inefficient.</P>
      <P>Ma said that as the national leader, he will take responsibility for any
deficiencies on the part of the government.</P>
      <P>"I hereby offer my heartfelt apology to the entire nation, especially to those
who lost their loved ones in the disaster," he said.</P>
      <P>He said as the rescue operations are ending, the government will soon begin to
investigate and identify the deficiencies in handling the disaster aftermath and
will examine the administrative and political responsibilities of the officials
involved.</P>
      <P>Any punishments for those deemed liable and any Cabinet reshuffle decisions will
be announced by early September, he said.</P>
      <P>Ma stressed that the government has decided to hold off on the matter for a
couple of weeks so as not to dampen the morale of rescuers.</P>
      <P>"We are not trying to cover up our mistakes, but are only making a little
postponement," he said.</P>
      <P>Ruling out the possibility of stepping down over the matter, Ma said he must
shoulder the upcoming post-disaster reconstruction effort and cannot leave
office, as this would be an evasion of duty.</P>
      <P>On the public's doubts over his decision not to declare a state of emergency in
the aftermath of the storm, Ma explained that the Disaster Prevention and
Protection Act enacted in 2000 already empowers the government to take the
necessary steps to deal with emergency situations.</P>
      <P>He said the mechanisms provided under the law should be allowed to function,
although there may be room for improvement to these provisions.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government set up a rescue command center in southern Taiwan
immediately after the disaster,  he said that communication problems probably
contributed to the inefficiency of the rescue operations.</P>
      <P>The president explained that he activated the national security mechanism Aug.
14 because the government needed to prepare for the huge outlay of financial and
human resources that would be required in the post-disaster reconstruction
period.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Facing criticisms from home and abroad that his administration's rescue and
relief efforts were slow and flawed, President Ma Ying-jeou vowed Tuesday to
improve his performance and lead the country into recovery from the disaster
caused last week by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks at a news conference at the Presidential Office amid falling
approval ratings driven by his government's response in the aftermath  of
massive flooding and landslides triggered by the storm, particularly in Tainan,
Chiayi, Kaohsiung and Pingtung and Taitung counties in the south.</P>
      <P>He said that a disaster prevention and rescue agency will be established to
replace the National Fire Agency, which is in charge of rescue operations in the
country, and that the government will spend US$300 million to purchase rescue
helicopters.</P>
      <P>According to the president, the money will come from the budget originally
earmarked for the purchase of 60 Black Hawk helicopters from the United States.</P>
      <P>"The government has now decided to buy 45 Black Hawks instead, and the US$300
million left over will be used to purchase rescue helicopters and equipment to
better meet Taiwan's needs," he said.</P>
      <P>Replying to a question on the possibility of a Cabinet reshuffle, Ma said that
his administration will seek to identify the mistakes made and that, based on an
agreement between him and Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, any decisions pertaining to
personnel will be made in two weeks.</P>
      <P>As part of the government's  plan to improve  its rescue capability, disaster
prevention will be included as one of the priority missions of the military, he
added.</P>
      <P>"In the future,  the disaster prevention  concept must be integrated into the
nation's overall military strategy, military approach, military personnel
deployment, as well as its budget allocation and equipment and machinery
installation, " the president said.</P>
      <P>In addition, disaster prevention units will be set up in all local governments,
he said.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the government will force an evacuation if a similar disaster
should threaten, Ma replied in the affirmative and stressed that standard
operation procedures must be established to deal with any similar situations.</P>
      <P>"We will face up to and delve into the evacuation issue, despite predictable
difficulties due to the fact that some villagers will never be willing to leave
their homes in the mountains." he said.</P>
      <P>"A homeland safety law is being crafted to serve that end. Villagers must be
transported to safety early, in the event of similar flooding or disasters," the
president said.</P>
      <P>Aboriginal townships and settlements in Chiayi,  Kaohsiung, Pintung and Taitung
were the worst hit by Typhoon Morakot, with many of them cut off as mountain
roads and bridges collapsed during the storm which battered the island Aug.
6-10.</P>
      <P>Over 100 people have been killed and some 600 are reported missing in the
typhoon, including close to 500 believed to have been buried under mudslides in
Siaolin village. Most of the dead were indigenous people from mountain
settlements.</P>
      <P>Ma said that in view of the high death toll among aborigines and in an effort to
honor his campaign promise to build a safe homeland for them, his government
will allocate NT$50 billion over the next four years to mudslide prevention.</P>
      <P>"The Council for Economic Planning and Development has already budgeted NT$12.6
billion for that purpose," he said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the government's plans for rehabilitation and reconstruction in
the aftermath of the storm, Ma said it will need some NT$110 billion to fund
such projects in the devastated areas of southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The government has appropriated NT$40 billion from its special budgets and the
remaining NT$70 billion will be obtained through public borrowing, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Although agricultural and farm losses from Morakot have exceeded NT$12.2
billion, Ma said "Taiwan's economy would be only slightly affected, but its Q3
economic growth rate would become negative."</P>
      <P>In light of the devastation wrought by the storm and the magnitude of the work
ahead, the president said, he has canceled a planned trip to the South Pacific
for a summit with leaders of Taiwan allies in that region in October.</P>
      <P>He also announced a cancellation of National Day celebrations that are usually
held annually on October 10.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Evaluation of relief to be determined after reconstruction: president</HEADLINE>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou declined Tuesday to judge the performance of himself and
his government in the rescue and relief operations in the wake of Typhoon
Morakot, saying that the success of the disaster relief efforts should be
determined after the resettlement and reconstruction process is completed.</P>
      <P>"We have entered a new face of disaster relief, that is re-settlement and
recovery. We will try our best to do a better job. Certainly, we will do our job
right this time," Ma said at an international press conference held by the
Presidential Office, in which he apologized to the public for "the failure to
act faster and in a more orderly way."</P>
      <P>He pledged that the government will do whatever it can to correct its mistakes
and become efficient in the process of resettlement and reconstruction, which
the president said will determine the success of the entire post-typhoon
operation.</P>
      <P>Over the past week, Ma and his administration have come under fire for what is
perceived by the public and foreign media as slow and insufficient response in
the wake of the natural disaster, with several opinion polls, including a recent
one conducted by CNN, showing  strong  public  dissatisfaction  with the
government's performance.</P>
      <P>The questions of whether Ma exercised strong and competent leadership and how
his administration performed in the post-typhoon relief efforts, however, were
strongly questioned by the foreign media, as reporters from Time Magazine,
Japan's Kyodo News and other international media outlets all raised similar
questions in the press conference.</P>
      <P>"I think I have exercised strong leadership throughout the process by ordering
the armed forces to increase their participation in the disaster rescue
operation," Ma said, adding that the operation was "different from any other
natural disaster" because bad weather impeded the rescue efforts.</P>
      <P>"We are not blaming just the weather, but this is a fact, " he said.</P>
      <P>Ma said any review and punishment of the government's performance should be
carried out later, as it is more important for his government to focus on
resettlement and the reconstruction process.</P>
      <P>Pressed on whether he will make a Cabinet reshuffle and how he will take
responsibility as president, Ma did not respond directly, saying only that his
administration will review the performance of the government to identify the
mistakes and negligence by officials.</P>
      <P>The investigation and punishment process will take place no later than early
September, he added.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou denied Tuesday that China played a role in his
administration's decision to accept international assistance in the wake of
Typhoon Morakot, saying that all international assistance is "purely
humanitarian."</P>
      <P>"We consider this assistance humanitarian and we don't politicize the
assistance. Whatever the assistance is, we will take that attitude," Ma said at
a news conference for foreign media outlets.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, his government welcomed "all international assistance from the
very beginning" and all humanitarian aid is treated the same.</P>
      <P>"We accepted donations from the U.S., Japan, Singapore and China. We also
accepted donations of materials from other countries. We don't have any
political attitude, they are purely humanitarian," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma and his administration have been lambasted over the past week by the media,
both domestic and international, as well as typhoon victims and members of the
public, for declining offers of foreign assistance in the wake of the natural
disaster.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was panned in particular for issuing
instructions Aug. 11 to all MOFA's foreign representative offices to decline
offers by their host governments of aid supplies or rescuers.</P>
      <P>Media reports said that the rejection of foreign aid was for fear that it would
upset China, which claims sovereignty over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The issue caused Deputy Foreign Minister Andrew Hsia to tender his resignation
for what he called "a technical error made out of negligence." His superior,
Foreign Minister Francisco Ou, was out of the country at the time.</P>
      <P>Ma said that he and Premier Liu Chao-shiuan decided that Hsia should be
responsible for the negligence.</P>
      <P>"The resignation is now on the premier's desk and I believe he will approve it,"
the president said.</P>
      <P>Ma added that an overall review of blame of his government and the punishment of
relevant officials will be carried out in early September, as it is more
important at present to focus on the resettlement  of the typhoon  victims  and
the start  of the reconstruction process.</P>
      <P>Noting that the scale of destruction brought by Typhoon Morakot is unprecedented
and describing it as a result of global warming, Ma said Taiwan needs to take
more effective measures in the face of similar situations.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the government is drafting a Homeland Planning Act that will
divide the country into different regions and identify those areas that are
unsuitable for human habitation.</P>
      <P>In addition to making arrangements and providing incentives for those living in
dangerous zones to leave, the government will also work on public education on
the importance of evacuation in the face of mudslides.</P>
      <P>"We believe that disasters cannot be prevented but can only be mitigated," Ma
said.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing on Tuesday inspects several spots
for setting up prefabricated homes for victims hit hard by Typhoon Morakot which
lashed Taiwan from Aug. 6-10.</P>
      <P>Leading a group of public works and construction officials, Yang visited six
spots selected to serve that purpose and listened to the opinions and demands of
people displaced by the typhoon.</P>
      <P>"We hope to make a decision soon and start erecting prefabricated houses on
appropriate sites as soon as possible," Yang said.</P>
      <P>Huang I-hsiung, director of the Economic Development Department, said officials
have selected four sites, including a nine-hectare plot of land belonging to
Taiwan Sugar Company near Shanlin Junior High School, and a 0.6-hectare plot of
land in Wulipu, close to Siaolin Village.</P>
      <P>The village, the worst-affected in the typhoon, is covered in 20 to 30 meters of
mud following a mudslide, with more than 400 people believed buried. Some 50
villagers managed to escape.</P>
      <P>Huang said, two other places, one in Dashu township and another in Cishan, were
being considered for location of new dormitories to be constructed for students
who have to study at schools in other neighborhoods after Typhoon Morakot
damaged their schools.</P>
      <P>Although the six spots are being viewed as suitable to erect prefabricated
houses to accommodate typhoon victims and affected students, county officials
said the victims' needs and concerns must first be addressed.</P>
      <P>Later Monday, the Executive Yuan announced that the government and private
sector will cooperate to help victims build new homes and return to normal lives
as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>According to Executive Yuan officials, the National Property Administration
under the Ministry of Finance, within one week, will offer suitable state-owned
land plots for the Ministry of the Interior or local governments to select and
use.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has asked charitable organizations to adopt disaster areas in
line with the rehoming project, the officials said, adding that welfare
organizations will be allowed to first erect prefabricated homes or houses for
victims on these land plots before conducting legal procedures required by the
government.</P>
      <P>Typhoon victims will be eligible to rent these houses from the property
administration, but the rentals will be decided by the Executive Yuan, an
administration official said.</P>
      <P>The Red Cross Society of the Republic of China, Fo Guang Shan Monastery, Dharma
Drum Mountain, Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation and World Vision
Taiwan have agreed to take part in the plan, Executive Yuan officials said.</P>

      <P>Around 300 celebrities and entertainers from Hong Kong, China and Taiwan have

      <P>They include Jackie Chan and Hong Kong media mogul Sir Run Run Shaw, as well as
popular Hong Kong actors and singers Andy Lau, Aaron Kwok and Jackey Cheung.</P>
      <P>They led a fund-raising  show organized by the Hong Kong Performing Artistes

      <P>The entertainers, well-known in the Taiwan Strait region and other areas with
large Chinese societies, not only sang for the typhoon victims, but also donated
their own money.</P>

      <P>Agricultural losses from Typhoon Morakot had surged to NT$13 billion (US$394.4
million) as of Tuesday, an increase of NT$750 million from a day earlier,
according to statistics released by the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA).</P>
      <P>The COA said that Morakot, which pummeled Taiwan Aug. 7-9, caused serious damage
to the agricultural sector in 11 counties, with Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties
in southern Taiwan and Hualien and Taitung counties in the east the hardest hit.</P>
      <P>The statistics show that damage to crops had amounted to NT$4.13 billion, with
27 percent of the crops on 72,345 hectares of farmland wiped out.</P>
      <P>Banana crops suffered the heaviest damage, with 5,947 hectares ravaged by strong
winds and flooding.</P>
      <P>Over 140,000 pigs, nearly 6 million chickens and around 1.4 million ducks

    <HEADLINE>First shipment of Chinese prefab houses arrive in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

      <P>The first 100 of a donation of 1,000 prefabricated houses from China for the
displaced victims of Typhoon Morakot arrived at Kaohsiung Harbor in southern
Taiwan Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The prefab houses cleared Kaohsiung customs rapidly and were sent directly to
Jiadong township in Pingtung County, one of the areas hardest hit by Typhoon
Morakot.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-based Yang Ming Marine Transport Corp. transported the houses free of
charge from Guangdong Providence in southeastern China.</P>
      <P>Yang Ming will also help transport the remaining 900 units that China has
pledged to donate, according to a spokesman from the company.</P>
      <P>Addressing  misgivings  about possible excessive  levels of formaldehyde in the
houses, Chen Hung-yi, a section chief of the Construction and Planning Agency
(CPA) under the Ministry of the Interior, said that "all plastic products
contain formaldehyde," and said that as long as the products are put in well-
ventilated places, the toxic fumes will dissipate.</P>
      <P>He added, however, that officials will conduct inspections to ensure that the
units meet government safety requirements for temporary shelters.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration will also monitor the water drainage
systems and hygiene situations of the locations for the prefab houses.</P>
      <P>China offered to assist in Taiwan's rehabilitation operation last week after
Typhoon Morakot wreaked havoc in parts of the country Aug. 7-9, particularly the
southern counties of Pingtung and Kaohsiung, prompting the government to request
the housing units.</P>
      <P>In a related development, the Executive Yuan is planning to cooperate with five
private groups to resettle typhoon-affected victims.</P>
      <P>Among them, the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China said Taiwan is
capable of assembling 2,000 prefab houses and expressed the hope that hard-hit
cities and counties will make requests for the housing.</P>
      <P>Red Cross Society Secretary-General Chen Shih-kuei said all five groups, which
also include the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, World Vision
Taiwan, Dharma Drum Mountain and the Fuokuangshan Foundation, support the
government's efforts to resettle the displaced victims.</P>
      <P>"But except for Taitung County, which has requested 153 prefab houses, no other
cities or counties have made any requests, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to the Red Cross, 2,000 prefab houses built in Taiwan, combined with
the 1,000 houses donated by China, will meet the needs for initial resettlement.</P>
      <P>Chen urged the affected city and county governments to select locations fit for
resettlement quickly to allow assembly work to get started, adding that the
victims would be able to move in two weeks after assembly begins.</P>
      <P>Tzu Chi spokesman Ho Jih-sheng said the foundation supports the government's
decision to resettle the flood victims, but noted that the government had yet to
come up with any proposals as to how this should be achieved.</P>
      <P>"Tzu Chi will wait for more details from the government before assessing how to
cooperate," Ho added.</P>
      <P>He said that members of the foundation -- the largest charity group in Taiwan --
have gone to every flood-affected area to carry out relief work, and that its
plan is to resettle the victims, taking into account the views of the victims as
to whether the resettlement areas will be temporary or more permanent shelters.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is working to resolve water shortages in
the Kaohsiung area in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot and is expected to have
overcome the situation in two days, Economic Minister Yiin Chii-ming said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Yiin said that although water supplies to Kaohsiung have resumed, some residents
might still experience shortages because demand is higher than usual.</P>
      <P>He said the MOEA was trying to purify the turbid water flowing into to the
Nanhua reservoir in Tainan -- one of Kaohsiung's main water suppliers -- in an
effort to increase the water supply.</P>
      <P>According to a report published that day by the Economic Daily News, the water
shortages have affected hundreds of factories in the Gangshan, Yanchao, Lujhu,
Renwu and Dashe areas of Kaohsiung County, as well as the Nanzih district of
Kaohsiung City, with some factories having been forced to suspend operations.</P>

up by the local chapter of the international Christian charity World Vision to
shelter children affected by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Chow, who visited the center in the eastern county of Taitung, sang songs with
the children and joined a drawing activity in which they used art to share their
dreams, according to a World Vision Taiwan press release.</P>
      <P>Its great that you all have a dream. I hope you will pursue your dream with much
joy, Chow was quoted as saying in the press release.</P>
      <P>With dreams in your heart, even when you are faced with difficulties or
frustrations, you will not give up,she added.</P>
      <P>Some of the children had to flee from the typhoon's destruction and had lost
their home. Even those who may have been less affected may suffer from the
trauma of enduring these stressful situations, the center's officials said.</P>
      <P>World  Vision  Taiwan  said that providing  children  with psychological and
social support is one of its top priorities in the wake of Typhoon Morakot, as
children are often the most vulnerable among disaster survivors.</P>
      <P>Two centers have been set up in Taitung county, two in Pingtung county, and
three in Kaohsiung county -- to shelter 280 children.</P>
      <P>At these centers, these children engage in fun games and other creative

    <HEADLINE>Expert urges single agency for nation's land, water management</HEADLINE>

      <P>A single government agency should be made responsible for land restoration and
river management, a scholar said Tuesday in the wake of the devastation in
southern Taiwan caused by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Yao Nai-jia, director of the Center for Bridge Engineering Research of National
Central University, noted that over 90 bridges were damaged in the flooding and
mudslides triggered by the typhoon that battered Taiwan Aug. 6-10.</P>
      <P>"The large number of damaged bridges shows that the government has done a poor
job in land restoration and river management, " Yao said.</P>
      <P>He noted that at present, the planning, use and restoration of land,  as well as
river management, are managed by different government agencies such as the
Council of Agriculture and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and suggested that
"one agency should take full responsibility."</P>
      <P>He explained that Taiwan has a unique climate and terrain, and is divided
roughly into two parts by the Central Mountain Range, which means that
torrential rain in mountainous regions quickly flows down to the sea.</P>
      <P>"The nation also has more than 27,000 bridges, a density that is also rather
rare," he added.</P>
      <P>These bridges are most vulnerable during flooding, he said, pointing out that
central and southern Taiwan recorded the equivalent of a whole year's-worth of
precipitation in just two days during the typhoon.</P>
      <P>The damage sustained by the bridges, he went on, was most likely caused by
torrential rain over a very short period of time that triggered rockslides and
mudslides.</P>
      <P>He also said that the large amount of driftwood seen in flood-devastated areas
is evidence of the abusive development of mountain areas.</P>
      <P>Yao, who assisted in a survey of bridges after the earthquake of Sept. 21, 1999,
said many bridges were only tilted or knocked askew during the big temblor,
while the destructive power of the landslides caused by the typhoon was
immediate.</P>
      <P>If serious flooding washes away a bridge pier, the bridge will collapse
immediately, Yao noted.</P>
      <P>Another scholar agreed with Yao and said that "it is not fair" to compare the
relief work after Typhoon Morakot with that which followed the 921 earthquake.</P>
      <P>Wang Ya-nan, a professor of National Taiwan University, said that while many
houses collapsed after the earthquake and there were numerous aftershocks, roads
remained open.</P>
      <P>After the typhoon left Taiwan Aug. 9,  however, downpours continued that further
disrupted road and bridge traffic, he said.</P>
      <P>"With the changing weather patterns nowadays, extreme weather might become a
norm, " Wang predicted.</P>
      <P>"We also have to reflect upon the land overdevelopment that has caused this
backlash of nature," she said.</P>
      <P>"To solve the problem at its root, the government and the private sector must
work together to conserve energy and cut carbon dioxide emissions," she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Township declines Chinese prefab houses due to toxin misgivings</HEADLINE>

      <P>A township in southern Taiwan that was hit hard by Typhoon Morakot refused
Tuesday to accept the first in a batch of 1,000 prefabricated houses that were
donated by China, due to misgivings about levels of formaldehyde in the units.</P>
      <P>The first 100 of the donation of 1,000 prefab houses from China arrived in
Kaohsiung Harbor Tuesday and were immediately shipped to Jiadong township in
Pingtung County.</P>
      <P>However, the residents expressed concern after reports noted that the prefab
houses might contain formaldehyde.</P>
      <P>Jiadong township chief Lai Hsien-ho said he called the county government to
convey the people's misgivings, upon which the county government decided to
provide the township with 150 prefab houses donated by Rotary International.</P>
      <P>The county government then called the Construction and Planning Agency (CPA)
under the Ministry of the Interior and told the agency that there was no need to
ship the Chinese houses to Jiadong. However, by that time, the prefabs were
"already on the way, " Lai said.</P>
      <P>CPA official Chen Hung-yi said Taitung County was the first to apply for the
prefab houses, but as roads to Taitung were still not fully open after the
serious flooding triggered by Morakot, Jiadong became the first stricken
township to receive the temporary housing units from China.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the Jiadong authorities should have made their objections known
earlier. He pointed out that the houses had already arrived in the township, but
added that if Jiadong is certain that it does not want them, they will be
transferred elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Addressing the misgivings about the possibility of formaldehyde in the houses,
Chen had said earlier that a lot of plastic products contain formaldehyde and
that as long as the products are situated in well-ventilated places, any toxic
fumes will soon dissipate.</P>
      <P>Another CPA official said that same day that the agency had not received  any
product  certificate  with  the units  and that certification was not included
as part of the customs inspection.</P>
      <P>But the official said that during the assembly process, the Bureau of Standards,
Metrology and Inspection will dispatch staff to conduct tests on the materials.</P>
      <P>The official said that each prefab house is about 15 pings (equivalent to around
50 square meters) , which is bigger than the 12-ping units provided for each
homeless family after the magnitude 7.3 earthquake of Sept.  21,  1999 and also
bigger than the 20-square-meter shelters used to house the victims of the major
earthquake in China's Sichuan Province in 2008.</P>
      <P>The larger size is because the Taiwanese authorities requested that each unit
should include a kitchen and toilet, the official added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou apologized Tuesday for the government's shortcomings in
dealing with the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot and pledged to punish any liable
officials by early September.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks at a news conference held to address mounting public
resentment and criticisms that the government's response to the disaster was
slow and its rescue efforts inefficient.</P>
      <P>Ma said that as the national leader, he will take responsibility for any
deficiencies on the part of the government.</P>
      <P>"I hereby offer my heartfelt apology to the entire nation, especially to those
who lost their loved ones in the disaster," he said.</P>
      <P>He said as the rescue operations are ending, the government will soon begin to
investigate and identify the deficiencies in handling the disaster aftermath and
will examine the administrative and political responsibilities of the officials
involved.</P>
      <P>Any punishments for those deemed liable and any Cabinet reshuffle decisions will
be announced by early September, he said.</P>
      <P>Ma stressed that the government has decided to hold off on the matter for a
couple of weeks so as not to dampen the morale of rescuers.</P>
      <P>"We are not trying to cover up our mistakes, but are only making a little
postponement," he said.</P>
      <P>Ruling out the possibility of stepping down over the matter, Ma said he must
shoulder the upcoming post-disaster reconstruction effort and cannot leave
office, as this would be an evasion of duty.</P>
      <P>On the public's doubts over his decision not to declare a state of emergency in
the aftermath of the storm, Ma explained that the Disaster Prevention and
Protection Act enacted in 2000 already empowers the government to take the
necessary steps to deal with emergency situations.</P>
      <P>He said the mechanisms provided under the law should be allowed to function,
although there may be room for improvement to these provisions.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government set up a rescue command center in southern Taiwan
immediately after the disaster,  he said that communication problems probably
contributed to the inefficiency of the rescue operations.</P>
      <P>The president explained that he activated the national security mechanism Aug.
14 because the government needed to prepare for the huge outlay of financial and
human resources that would be required in the post-disaster reconstruction
period.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Facing criticisms from home and abroad that his administration's rescue and
relief efforts were slow and flawed, President Ma Ying-jeou vowed Tuesday to
improve his performance and lead the country into recovery from the disaster
caused last week by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks at a news conference at the Presidential Office amid falling
approval ratings driven by his government's response in the aftermath  of
massive flooding and landslides triggered by the storm, particularly in Tainan,
Chiayi, Kaohsiung and Pingtung and Taitung counties in the south.</P>
      <P>He said that a disaster prevention and rescue agency will be established to
replace the National Fire Agency, which is in charge of rescue operations in the
country, and that the government will spend US$300 million to purchase rescue
helicopters.</P>
      <P>According to the president, the money will come from the budget originally
earmarked for the purchase of 60 Black Hawk helicopters from the United States.</P>
      <P>"The government has now decided to buy 45 Black Hawks instead, and the US$300
million left over will be used to purchase rescue helicopters and equipment to
better meet Taiwan's needs," he said.</P>
      <P>Replying to a question on the possibility of a Cabinet reshuffle, Ma said that
his administration will seek to identify the mistakes made and that, based on an
agreement between him and Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, any decisions pertaining to
personnel will be made in two weeks.</P>
      <P>As part of the government's  plan to improve  its rescue capability, disaster
prevention will be included as one of the priority missions of the military, he
added.</P>
      <P>"In the future,  the disaster prevention  concept must be integrated into the
nation's overall military strategy, military approach, military personnel
deployment, as well as its budget allocation and equipment and machinery
installation, " the president said.</P>
      <P>In addition, disaster prevention units will be set up in all local governments,
he said.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the government will force an evacuation if a similar disaster
should threaten, Ma replied in the affirmative and stressed that standard
operation procedures must be established to deal with any similar situations.</P>
      <P>"We will face up to and delve into the evacuation issue, despite predictable
difficulties due to the fact that some villagers will never be willing to leave
their homes in the mountains." he said.</P>
      <P>"A homeland safety law is being crafted to serve that end. Villagers must be
transported to safety early, in the event of similar flooding or disasters," the
president said.</P>
      <P>Aboriginal townships and settlements in Chiayi,  Kaohsiung, Pintung and Taitung
were the worst hit by Typhoon Morakot, with many of them cut off as mountain
roads and bridges collapsed during the storm which battered the island Aug.
6-10.</P>
      <P>Over 100 people have been killed and some 600 are reported missing in the
typhoon, including close to 500 believed to have been buried under mudslides in
Siaolin village. Most of the dead were indigenous people from mountain
settlements.</P>
      <P>Ma said that in view of the high death toll among aborigines and in an effort to
honor his campaign promise to build a safe homeland for them, his government
will allocate NT$50 billion over the next four years to mudslide prevention.</P>
      <P>"The Council for Economic Planning and Development has already budgeted NT$12.6
billion for that purpose," he said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the government's plans for rehabilitation and reconstruction in
the aftermath of the storm, Ma said it will need some NT$110 billion to fund
such projects in the devastated areas of southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The government has appropriated NT$40 billion from its special budgets and the
remaining NT$70 billion will be obtained through public borrowing, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Although agricultural and farm losses from Morakot have exceeded NT$12.2
billion, Ma said "Taiwan's economy would be only slightly affected, but its Q3
economic growth rate would become negative."</P>
      <P>In light of the devastation wrought by the storm and the magnitude of the work
ahead, the president said, he has canceled a planned trip to the South Pacific
for a summit with leaders of Taiwan allies in that region in October.</P>
      <P>He also announced a cancellation of National Day celebrations that are usually
held annually on October 10.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou declined Tuesday to judge the performance of himself and
his government in the rescue and relief operations in the wake of Typhoon
Morakot, saying that the success of the disaster relief efforts should be
determined after the resettlement and reconstruction process is completed.</P>
      <P>"We have entered a new face of disaster relief, that is re-settlement and
recovery. We will try our best to do a better job. Certainly, we will do our job
right this time," Ma said at an international press conference held by the
Presidential Office, in which he apologized to the public for "the failure to
act faster and in a more orderly way."</P>
      <P>He pledged that the government will do whatever it can to correct its mistakes
and become efficient in the process of resettlement and reconstruction, which
the president said will determine the success of the entire post-typhoon
operation.</P>
      <P>Over the past week, Ma and his administration have come under fire for what is
perceived by the public and foreign media as slow and insufficient response in
the wake of the natural disaster, with several opinion polls, including a recent
one conducted by CNN, showing  strong  public  dissatisfaction  with the
government's performance.</P>
      <P>The questions of whether Ma exercised strong and competent leadership and how
his administration performed in the post-typhoon relief efforts, however, were
strongly questioned by the foreign media, as reporters from Time Magazine,
Japan's Kyodo News and other international media outlets all raised similar
questions in the press conference.</P>
      <P>"I think I have exercised strong leadership throughout the process by ordering
the armed forces to increase their participation in the disaster rescue
operation," Ma said, adding that the operation was "different from any other
natural disaster" because bad weather impeded the rescue efforts.</P>
      <P>"We are not blaming just the weather, but this is a fact, " he said.</P>
      <P>Ma said any review and punishment of the government's performance should be
carried out later, as it is more important for his government to focus on
resettlement and the reconstruction process.</P>
      <P>Pressed on whether he will make a Cabinet reshuffle and how he will take
responsibility as president, Ma did not respond directly, saying only that his
administration will review the performance of the government to identify the
mistakes and negligence by officials.</P>
      <P>The investigation and punishment process will take place no later than early
September, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No political influence in foreign aid: president</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou denied Tuesday that China played a role in his
administration's decision to accept international assistance in the wake of
Typhoon Morakot, saying that all international assistance is "purely
humanitarian."</P>
      <P>"We consider this assistance humanitarian and we don't politicize the
assistance. Whatever the assistance is, we will take that attitude," Ma said at
a news conference for foreign media outlets.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, his government welcomed "all international assistance from the
very beginning" and all humanitarian aid is treated the same.</P>
      <P>"We accepted donations from the U.S., Japan, Singapore and China. We also
accepted donations of materials from other countries. We don't have any
political attitude, they are purely humanitarian," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma and his administration have been lambasted over the past week by the media,
both domestic and international, as well as typhoon victims and members of the
public, for declining offers of foreign assistance in the wake of the natural
disaster.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was panned in particular for issuing
instructions Aug. 11 to all MOFA's foreign representative offices to decline
offers by their host governments of aid supplies or rescuers.</P>
      <P>Media reports said that the rejection of foreign aid was for fear that it would
upset China, which claims sovereignty over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The issue caused Deputy Foreign Minister Andrew Hsia to tender his resignation
for what he called "a technical error made out of negligence." His superior,
Foreign Minister Francisco Ou, was out of the country at the time.</P>
      <P>Ma said that he and Premier Liu Chao-shiuan decided that Hsia should be
responsible for the negligence.</P>
      <P>"The resignation is now on the premier's desk and I believe he will approve it,"
the president said.</P>
      <P>Ma added that an overall review of blame of his government and the punishment of
relevant officials will be carried out in early September, as it is more
important at present to focus on the resettlement  of the typhoon  victims  and
the start  of the reconstruction process.</P>
      <P>Noting that the scale of destruction brought by Typhoon Morakot is unprecedented
and describing it as a result of global warming, Ma said Taiwan needs to take
more effective measures in the face of similar situations.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the government is drafting a Homeland Planning Act that will
divide the country into different regions and identify those areas that are
unsuitable for human habitation.</P>
      <P>In addition to making arrangements and providing incentives for those living in
dangerous zones to leave, the government will also work on public education on
the importance of evacuation in the face of mudslides.</P>
      <P>"We believe that disasters cannot be prevented but can only be mitigated," Ma
said.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing on Tuesday inspects several spots
for setting up prefabricated homes for victims hit hard by Typhoon Morakot which
lashed Taiwan from Aug. 6-10.</P>
      <P>Leading a group of public works and construction officials, Yang visited six
spots selected to serve that purpose and listened to the opinions and demands of
people displaced by the typhoon.</P>
      <P>"We hope to make a decision soon and start erecting prefabricated houses on
appropriate sites as soon as possible," Yang said.</P>
      <P>Huang I-hsiung, director of the Economic Development Department, said officials
have selected four sites, including a nine-hectare plot of land belonging to
Taiwan Sugar Company near Shanlin Junior High School, and a 0.6-hectare plot of
land in Wulipu, close to Siaolin Village.</P>
      <P>The village, the worst-affected in the typhoon, is covered in 20 to 30 meters of
mud following a mudslide, with more than 400 people believed buried. Some 50
villagers managed to escape.</P>
      <P>Huang said, two other places, one in Dashu township and another in Cishan, were
being considered for location of new dormitories to be constructed for students
who have to study at schools in other neighborhoods after Typhoon Morakot
damaged their schools.</P>
      <P>Although the six spots are being viewed as suitable to erect prefabricated
houses to accommodate typhoon victims and affected students, county officials
said the victims' needs and concerns must first be addressed.</P>
      <P>Later Monday, the Executive Yuan announced that the government and private
sector will cooperate to help victims build new homes and return to normal lives
as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>According to Executive Yuan officials, the National Property Administration
under the Ministry of Finance, within one week, will offer suitable state-owned
land plots for the Ministry of the Interior or local governments to select and
use.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has asked charitable organizations to adopt disaster areas in
line with the rehoming project, the officials said, adding that welfare
organizations will be allowed to first erect prefabricated homes or houses for
victims on these land plots before conducting legal procedures required by the
government.</P>
      <P>Typhoon victims will be eligible to rent these houses from the property
administration, but the rentals will be decided by the Executive Yuan, an
administration official said.</P>
      <P>The Red Cross Society of the Republic of China, Fo Guang Shan Monastery, Dharma
Drum Mountain, Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation and World Vision
Taiwan have agreed to take part in the plan, Executive Yuan officials said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Around 300 celebrities and entertainers from Hong Kong, China and Taiwan have
raised HK$50 million (US$6.37 million) in Hong Kong for aid to the victims of
Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>They include Jackie Chan and Hong Kong media mogul Sir Run Run Shaw, as well as
popular Hong Kong actors and singers Andy Lau, Aaron Kwok and Jackey Cheung.</P>
      <P>They led a fund-raising  show organized by the Hong Kong Performing Artistes
Guild at the AsiaWorld-Expo Monday at which each audience member was asked to
donate at least HK$20 as an entrance fee to help relief work in the aftermath of
the typhoon that struck southern Taiwan last week.</P>
      <P>The entertainers, well-known in the Taiwan Strait region and other areas with
large Chinese societies, not only sang for the typhoon victims, but also donated
their own money.</P>
      <P>The funds raised in the four-hour show increased donations from Hong Kong to
over NT$560 million, including a contribution of NT$212 million by the Hong Kong
government, NT$100 million from Sir Li Ka-shing -- the richest person in Hong
Kong -- and NT$42.5 million from the Hong Kong Jockey Club.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot dumped nearly 3,000 mm of rain in just four days in parts of
southern Taiwan, washing away bridges and triggering landslides that buried
entire villages.</P>
      <P>As of 4 p.m. Tuesday, the storm had killed 128 people across Taiwan and had left
45 injured and 307 others unaccounted for, according to official statistics. The
death toll did not include the inhabitants of a mountain village entirely buried

      <P>Agricultural losses from Typhoon Morakot had surged to NT$13 billion (US$394.4
million) as of Tuesday, an increase of NT$750 million from a day earlier,
according to statistics released by the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA).</P>
      <P>The COA said that Morakot, which pummeled Taiwan Aug. 7-9, caused serious damage
to the agricultural sector in 11 counties, with Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties
in southern Taiwan and Hualien and Taitung counties in the east the hardest hit.</P>
      <P>The statistics show that damage to crops had amounted to NT$4.13 billion, with
27 percent of the crops on 72,345 hectares of farmland wiped out.</P>
      <P>Banana crops suffered the heaviest damage, with 5,947 hectares ravaged by strong
winds and flooding.</P>
      <P>Over 140,000 pigs, nearly 6 million chickens and around 1.4 million ducks
perished in floods caused by the storm, bringing the total livestock losses to
NT$1.42 billion, the COA said.</P>
      <P>Damage to the aquaculture sector had amounted to NT$4.13 billion, the heaviest
loss in 19 years, according to the statistics, with stock in some 8,845 hectares
of fishponds or coastal areas washed away, it said.</P>
      <P>Forestry losses had reached over NT$112 million, while damage to agricultural
infrastructure had amounted to NT$221.7 million, mostly facilities for the
cultivation of vegetables and papayas in the areas of Yunlin, Chiayi, Tainan,
Kaohsiung and Pingtung.</P>
      <P>Damage to the fishery sector had surpassed NT$261 million, with the worst damage
reported in Pingtung County.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The first 100 of a donation of 1,000 prefabricated houses from China for the
displaced victims of Typhoon Morakot arrived at Kaohsiung Harbor in southern
Taiwan Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The prefab houses cleared Kaohsiung customs rapidly and were sent directly to
Jiadong township in Pingtung County, one of the areas hardest hit by Typhoon
Morakot.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-based Yang Ming Marine Transport Corp. transported the houses free of
charge from Guangdong Providence in southeastern China.</P>
      <P>Yang Ming will also help transport the remaining 900 units that China has
pledged to donate, according to a spokesman from the company.</P>
      <P>Addressing  misgivings  about possible excessive  levels of formaldehyde in the
houses, Chen Hung-yi, a section chief of the Construction and Planning Agency
(CPA) under the Ministry of the Interior, said that "all plastic products
contain formaldehyde," and said that as long as the products are put in well-
ventilated places, the toxic fumes will dissipate.</P>
      <P>He added, however, that officials will conduct inspections to ensure that the
units meet government safety requirements for temporary shelters.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration will also monitor the water drainage
systems and hygiene situations of the locations for the prefab houses.</P>
      <P>China offered to assist in Taiwan's rehabilitation operation last week after
Typhoon Morakot wreaked havoc in parts of the country Aug. 7-9, particularly the
southern counties of Pingtung and Kaohsiung, prompting the government to request
the housing units.</P>
      <P>In a related development, the Executive Yuan is planning to cooperate with five
private groups to resettle typhoon-affected victims.</P>
      <P>Among them, the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China said Taiwan is
capable of assembling 2,000 prefab houses and expressed the hope that hard-hit
cities and counties will make requests for the housing.</P>
      <P>Red Cross Society Secretary-General Chen Shih-kuei said all five groups, which
also include the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, World Vision
Taiwan, Dharma Drum Mountain and the Fuokuangshan Foundation, support the
government's efforts to resettle the displaced victims.</P>
      <P>"But except for Taitung County, which has requested 153 prefab houses, no other
cities or counties have made any requests, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to the Red Cross, 2,000 prefab houses built in Taiwan, combined with
the 1,000 houses donated by China, will meet the needs for initial resettlement.</P>
      <P>Chen urged the affected city and county governments to select locations fit for
resettlement quickly to allow assembly work to get started, adding that the
victims would be able to move in two weeks after assembly begins.</P>
      <P>Tzu Chi spokesman Ho Jih-sheng said the foundation supports the government's
decision to resettle the flood victims, but noted that the government had yet to
come up with any proposals as to how this should be achieved.</P>
      <P>"Tzu Chi will wait for more details from the government before assessing how to
cooperate," Ho added.</P>
      <P>He said that members of the foundation -- the largest charity group in Taiwan --
have gone to every flood-affected area to carry out relief work, and that its
plan is to resettle the victims, taking into account the views of the victims as
to whether the resettlement areas will be temporary or more permanent shelters.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is working to resolve water shortages in
the Kaohsiung area in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot and is expected to have
overcome the situation in two days, Economic Minister Yiin Chii-ming said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Yiin said that although water supplies to Kaohsiung have resumed, some residents
might still experience shortages because demand is higher than usual.</P>
      <P>He said the MOEA was trying to purify the turbid water flowing into to the
Nanhua reservoir in Tainan -- one of Kaohsiung's main water suppliers -- in an
effort to increase the water supply.</P>
      <P>According to a report published that day by the Economic Daily News, the water
shortages have affected hundreds of factories in the Gangshan, Yanchao, Lujhu,
Renwu and Dashe areas of Kaohsiung County, as well as the Nanzih district of

up by the local chapter of the international Christian charity World Vision to
shelter children affected by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Chow, who visited the center in the eastern county of Taitung, sang songs with
the children and joined a drawing activity in which they used art to share their
dreams, according to a World Vision Taiwan press release.</P>
      <P>Its great that you all have a dream. I hope you will pursue your dream with much

      <P>With dreams in your heart, even when you are faced with difficulties or
frustrations, you will not give up,she added.</P>
      <P>Some of the children had to flee from the typhoon's destruction and had lost
their home. Even those who may have been less affected may suffer from the
trauma of enduring these stressful situations, the center's officials said.</P>
      <P>World  Vision  Taiwan  said that providing  children  with psychological and
social support is one of its top priorities in the wake of Typhoon Morakot, as
children are often the most vulnerable among disaster survivors.</P>
      <P>Two centers have been set up in Taitung county, two in Pingtung county, and
three in Kaohsiung county -- to shelter 280 children.</P>
      <P>At these centers, these children engage in fun games and other creative

    <HEADLINE>Expert urges single agency for nation's land, water management</HEADLINE>

      <P>A single government agency should be made responsible for land restoration and
river management, a scholar said Tuesday in the wake of the devastation in
southern Taiwan caused by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Yao Nai-jia, director of the Center for Bridge Engineering Research of National
Central University, noted that over 90 bridges were damaged in the flooding and
mudslides triggered by the typhoon that battered Taiwan Aug. 6-10.</P>
      <P>"The large number of damaged bridges shows that the government has done a poor
job in land restoration and river management, " Yao said.</P>
      <P>He noted that at present, the planning, use and restoration of land,  as well as
river management, are managed by different government agencies such as the
Council of Agriculture and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and suggested that
"one agency should take full responsibility."</P>
      <P>He explained that Taiwan has a unique climate and terrain, and is divided
roughly into two parts by the Central Mountain Range, which means that
torrential rain in mountainous regions quickly flows down to the sea.</P>
      <P>"The nation also has more than 27,000 bridges, a density that is also rather
rare," he added.</P>
      <P>These bridges are most vulnerable during flooding, he said, pointing out that
central and southern Taiwan recorded the equivalent of a whole year's-worth of
precipitation in just two days during the typhoon.</P>
      <P>The damage sustained by the bridges, he went on, was most likely caused by
torrential rain over a very short period of time that triggered rockslides and
mudslides.</P>
      <P>He also said that the large amount of driftwood seen in flood-devastated areas
is evidence of the abusive development of mountain areas.</P>
      <P>Yao, who assisted in a survey of bridges after the earthquake of Sept. 21, 1999,
said many bridges were only tilted or knocked askew during the big temblor,
while the destructive power of the landslides caused by the typhoon was
immediate.</P>
      <P>If serious flooding washes away a bridge pier, the bridge will collapse
immediately, Yao noted.</P>
      <P>Another scholar agreed with Yao and said that "it is not fair" to compare the
relief work after Typhoon Morakot with that which followed the 921 earthquake.</P>
      <P>Wang Ya-nan, a professor of National Taiwan University, said that while many
houses collapsed after the earthquake and there were numerous aftershocks, roads
remained open.</P>
      <P>After the typhoon left Taiwan Aug. 9,  however, downpours continued that further
disrupted road and bridge traffic, he said.</P>
      <P>"With the changing weather patterns nowadays, extreme weather might become a
norm, " Wang predicted.</P>
      <P>"We also have to reflect upon the land overdevelopment that has caused this
backlash of nature," she said.</P>
      <P>"To solve the problem at its root, the government and the private sector must
work together to conserve energy and cut carbon dioxide emissions," she added.</P>

      <P>A township in southern Taiwan that was hit hard by Typhoon Morakot refused
Tuesday to accept the first in a batch of 1,000 prefabricated houses that were
donated by China, due to misgivings about levels of formaldehyde in the units.</P>
      <P>The first 100 of the donation of 1,000 prefab houses from China arrived in
Kaohsiung Harbor Tuesday and were immediately shipped to Jiadong township in
Pingtung County.</P>
      <P>However, the residents expressed concern after reports noted that the prefab
houses might contain formaldehyde.</P>
      <P>Jiadong township chief Lai Hsien-ho said he called the county government to
convey the people's misgivings, upon which the county government decided to
provide the township with 150 prefab houses donated by Rotary International.</P>
      <P>The county government then called the Construction and Planning Agency (CPA)
under the Ministry of the Interior and told the agency that there was no need to
ship the Chinese houses to Jiadong. However, by that time, the prefabs were
"already on the way, " Lai said.</P>
      <P>CPA official Chen Hung-yi said Taitung County was the first to apply for the
prefab houses, but as roads to Taitung were still not fully open after the
serious flooding triggered by Morakot, Jiadong became the first stricken
township to receive the temporary housing units from China.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the Jiadong authorities should have made their objections known
earlier. He pointed out that the houses had already arrived in the township, but
added that if Jiadong is certain that it does not want them, they will be
transferred elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Addressing the misgivings about the possibility of formaldehyde in the houses,
Chen had said earlier that a lot of plastic products contain formaldehyde and
that as long as the products are situated in well-ventilated places, any toxic
fumes will soon dissipate.</P>
      <P>Another CPA official said that same day that the agency had not received  any
product  certificate  with  the units  and that certification was not included
as part of the customs inspection.</P>
      <P>But the official said that during the assembly process, the Bureau of Standards,
Metrology and Inspection will dispatch staff to conduct tests on the materials.</P>
      <P>The official said that each prefab house is about 15 pings (equivalent to around
50 square meters) , which is bigger than the 12-ping units provided for each
homeless family after the magnitude 7.3 earthquake of Sept.  21,  1999 and also
bigger than the 20-square-meter shelters used to house the victims of the major
earthquake in China's Sichuan Province in 2008.</P>
      <P>The larger size is because the Taiwanese authorities requested that each unit
should include a kitchen and toilet, the official added.</P>

      <P>A township in southern Taiwan that was hit hard by Typhoon Morakot refused
Tuesday to accept the first in a batch of 1,000 prefabricated houses that were
donated by China, due to misgivings about levels of formaldehyde in the units.</P>
      <P>The first 100 of the donation of 1,000 prefab houses from China arrived in
Kaohsiung Harbor Tuesday and were immediately shipped to Jiadong township in
Pingtung County.</P>
      <P>However, the residents expressed concern after reports noted that the prefab
houses might contain formaldehyde.</P>
      <P>Jiadong township chief Lai Hsien-ho said he called the county government to
convey the people's misgivings, upon which the county government decided to
provide the township with 150 prefab houses donated by Rotary International.</P>
      <P>The county government then called the Construction and Planning Agency (CPA)
under the Ministry of the Interior and told the agency that there was no need to
ship the Chinese houses to Jiadong. However, by that time, the prefabs were
"already on the way, " Lai said.</P>
      <P>CPA official Chen Hung-yi said Taitung County was the first to apply for the
prefab houses, but as roads to Taitung were still not fully open after the
serious flooding triggered by Morakot, Jiadong became the first stricken
township to receive the temporary housing units from China.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the Jiadong authorities should have made their objections known
earlier. He pointed out that the houses had already arrived in the township, but
added that if Jiadong is certain that it does not want them, they will be
transferred elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Addressing the misgivings about the possibility of formaldehyde in the houses,
Chen had said earlier that a lot of plastic products contain formaldehyde and
that as long as the products are situated in well-ventilated places, any toxic
fumes will soon dissipate.</P>
      <P>Another CPA official said that same day that the agency had not received  any
product  certificate  with  the units  and that certification was not included
as part of the customs inspection.</P>
      <P>But the official said that during the assembly process, the Bureau of Standards,
Metrology and Inspection will dispatch staff to conduct tests on the materials.</P>
      <P>The official said that each prefab house is about 15 pings (equivalent to around
50 square meters) , which is bigger than the 12-ping units provided for each
homeless family after the magnitude 7.3 earthquake of Sept.  21,  1999 and also
bigger than the 20-square-meter shelters used to house the victims of the major
earthquake in China's Sichuan Province in 2008.</P>
      <P>The larger size is because the Taiwanese authorities requested that each unit
should include a kitchen and toilet, the official added.</P>

      <P>A single government agency should be made responsible for land restoration and
river management, a scholar said Tuesday in the wake of the devastation in
southern Taiwan caused by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Yao Nai-jia, director of the Center for Bridge Engineering Research of National
Central University, noted that over 90 bridges were damaged in the flooding and
mudslides triggered by the typhoon that battered Taiwan Aug. 6-10.</P>
      <P>"The large number of damaged bridges shows that the government has done a poor
job in land restoration and river management, " Yao said.</P>
      <P>He noted that at present, the planning, use and restoration of land,  as well as
river management, are managed by different government agencies such as the
Council of Agriculture and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and suggested that
"one agency should take full responsibility."</P>
      <P>He explained that Taiwan has a unique climate and terrain, and is divided
roughly into two parts by the Central Mountain Range, which means that
torrential rain in mountainous regions quickly flows down to the sea.</P>
      <P>"The nation also has more than 27,000 bridges, a density that is also rather
rare," he added.</P>
      <P>These bridges are most vulnerable during flooding, he said, pointing out that
central and southern Taiwan recorded the equivalent of a whole year's-worth of
precipitation in just two days during the typhoon.</P>
      <P>The damage sustained by the bridges, he went on, was most likely caused by
torrential rain over a very short period of time that triggered rockslides and
mudslides.</P>
      <P>He also said that the large amount of driftwood seen in flood-devastated areas
is evidence of the abusive development of mountain areas.</P>
      <P>Yao, who assisted in a survey of bridges after the earthquake of Sept. 21, 1999,
said many bridges were only tilted or knocked askew during the big temblor,
while the destructive power of the landslides caused by the typhoon was
immediate.</P>
      <P>If serious flooding washes away a bridge pier, the bridge will collapse
immediately, Yao noted.</P>
      <P>Another scholar agreed with Yao and said that "it is not fair" to compare the
relief work after Typhoon Morakot with that which followed the 921 earthquake.</P>
      <P>Wang Ya-nan, a professor of National Taiwan University, said that while many
houses collapsed after the earthquake and there were numerous aftershocks, roads
remained open.</P>
      <P>After the typhoon left Taiwan Aug. 9,  however, downpours continued that further
disrupted road and bridge traffic, she said.</P>
      <P>"With the changing weather patterns nowadays, extreme weather might become a
norm, " Wang predicted.</P>
      <P>"We also have to reflect upon the land overdevelopment that has caused this
backlash of nature," she said.</P>
      <P>"To solve the problem at its root, the government and the private sector must
work together to conserve energy and cut carbon dioxide emissions," she added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials
Wednesday:</P>
      <P>LIBERTY TIMES:</P>
      <P>Consoling victims becomes litany of complaints</P>
      <P>Amid mounting criticism over failed flood relief operations, President  Ma
Ying-jeou's  news  conference  Tuesday  was  a disappointment.</P>
      <P>He stressed that he will not evade his responsibility, and that the road to
resettlement is long and he will let the people know that he can carry out the
task effectively.</P>
      <P>When he previously failed to deliver on his campaign promises, he said that he
will deliver it in 2016, and now he is employing the same gambit.</P>
      <P>The more tangible measure he proposed during the news conference is to set up a
disaster prevention and relief agency to replace the current National Fire
Agency under the Ministry of the Interior, but we think that it is only a change
of name and will not upgrade rescue and relief efficiency.</P>
      <P>We can now be sure that the Ma administration, which missed the golden 72 hours
period, has now proven itself powerless in relief operations.</P>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou's so-called consoling voice to ease the pain of those suffering has
become a consoling voice full of excuses about why relief efforts were hampered,
such as excessive amounts of rainfall, blocked roads and villagers who did not
evacuate.</P>
      <P>Can we turn over our nation to such a man? We have trouble sleeping or eating if
we also think that he is insisting on pushing for an economic cooperation
framework agreement with China.</P>
      <P>APPLE DAILY:</P>
      <P>Military in trouble if rescue mission like combat operation</P>
      <P>The military rescue operation in Typhoon Morakot has been hampered by the
procrastination of the president and the defense minister.</P>
      <P>Intelligence agencies in other countries often use the speed, the deployment and
efficiency a nation's military has displayed in a rescue operation to gauge its
combat capability.</P>
      <P>If our military were evaluated by the rescue mission this time, it would have
been wiped out in the very beginning and the root of it can be traced to an
inefficient commander-in-chief.</P>
      <P>We also think the conspiracy theory circulating on the Internet that the U.S.
sending heavy-lift helicopters to Taiwan to aid relief operations was a
competition between Washington and Beijing over Taiwan is a smearing of goodwill
assistance.</P>
      <P>UNITED DAILY NEWS:</P>
      <P>More than flood-affected areas need to be rebuilt</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's two news conferences Tuesday were mainly aimed at
improving the seriously tarnished image his administration has suffered over the
past 10 days due to a chaotic flood relief effort.</P>
      <P>Every one knows that the focus of Ma's administration will now be on post-
disaster reconstruction, but we think that Taiwan also needs reconstruction in
three other major fronts:</P>
      <P>First, public confidence in the administration should be rebuilt.</P>
      <P>When the government's relief operations are seen as far less efficient than
those of civilian groups and when officials are the targets of angry outbursts
from flood victims when they inspect the affected areas, we think a crisis of
confidence has formed.</P>
      <P>If such a crisis cannot be reversed, we believe an effective reconstruction
effort will be compromised.</P>
      <P>Secondly, we think that the Cabinet should be rebuilt judging from its
performance during the relief operation. All eyes are on Ma when he said that
the Cabinet will be adjusted by September.</P>
      <P>The third thing that needs reconstruction will be the nation's finances. The
government has initially estimated that NT$110 billion will be needed for post-
disaster reconstruction.</P>
      <P>But we know that the nation's deficit has become more serious with this year's
shortfall in tax revenues to the tune of several hundreds of billions of
dollars. The nation's debt has almost risen to its legally mandated ceiling.</P>
      <P>The Finance Ministry's tax-cutting measures over the past year, the free lunch
promises on a whim of the premier and the Ministry of Economic Affairs subsidy
for TMC in an unfavorable environment have all been "mudslides" created by
government agencies.</P>
      <P>We know that if we cannot rebuild on the above three fronts, then post-flood
reconstruction tasks will flounder.</P>
      <P>CHINA TIMES:</P>
      <P>We're not just expecting an apology!</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou offered an apology over the slow and chaotic rescue and
relief operations in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot. But have you accepted it
or felt his sincerity?</P>
      <P>Disaster relief efforts are seldom satisfactory. The government was also panned
soon after a magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck Taiwan on Sept. 21, 1999.</P>
      <P>When the people are in pain, a government should show its professionalism as
well as empathy. President Ma said he has done his best, but when his good
friend and policy adviser openly lash out at the Ma administration as cold
blooded, he has been dealt a serious blow.</P>
      <P>Ma was still "reasoning" during his news conference Tuesday when he explained
why he did not issue an emergency decree after the most serious flooding in 50
years battered southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>We think that a president who abides by the law and will not randomly expand his
power is to be appreciated in peacetime, but if a president still clings to the
law during a major disaster, he could easily fall prey to triviality and
overlook the big picture.</P>
      <P>The president and all political appointees cannot avoid their responsibility,
but we hope that they will not dwell on the administration's popularity but
rather confront the nation's future plight.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan has instructed the Cabinet committee promoting post-
Typhoon Morakot reconstruction to set up an office in southern Taiwan to
facilitate its work.</P>
      <P>Liu issued the directive in a meeting with Minister without Portfolio Tsai
Hsung-hsiung Tuesday, during which Tsai briefed the premier on the progress
achieved by the committee.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, Liu also asked the Central Emergency Operation Center to
gradually transfer some of its reconstruction-related projects to the new
committee and make sure that the process is handled seamlessly.</P>
      <P>On the government's effort to draft a special statute governing reconstruction
efforts, the Cabinet said in a statement Tuesday that the legislation will
address a number of key issues.</P>
      <P>They include: budgeting related to reconstruction, financing bailout plans for
businesses affected by the disaster, rebuilding or repairing public facilities,
relaxing or simplifying procedures for emergency projects related to disaster
prevention and rescue, and providing employment services for the jobless in
disaster areas.</P>
      <P>Hu Chung-ying, deputy minister of the Council of Economic Planning and
Development, said earlier in the day that the budget for the reconstruction plan
has been tentatively set at NT$100 billion.</P>
      <P>Lin Yi-shih, head of the ruling Kuomintang's Policy Committee, said that as soon
as the reconstruction bill is submitted to the Legislative Yuan, the party's
legislative caucus will discuss with the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
caucus whether to hold a special legislative session in late August to consider
the bill.</P>
      <P>Another option is for the legislature to convene early on Sept. 4 to deal with
the bill, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The legislature is currently in recess. While the new session starts in
September, legislators are not expected to meet until the middle of the month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NTU Hospital confirms H1N1 cluster infection, with 1 acute case</HEADLINE>

      <P>A cluster infection of swine flu, officially known as influenza A(H1N1) , has
been confirmed at National Taiwan University (NTU) Hospital in Taipei, involving
four nurses and one patient, an NTU spokesman said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The patient had been confirmed as a severe H1N1 case, and was receiving
emergency treatment in an intensive care unit after developing pneumonia, said
Huang Li-min, director of the hospital's pediatric infectious disease
department.</P>
      <P>"The patient is a 45-year-old woman with underlying chronic disease," Huang
said, adding that although the woman initially showed symptoms of respiratory
failure, her vital signs stabilized after she was intubated.</P>
      <P>She was the 26th A(H1N1) severe case confirmed in Taiwan, but the first recorded
inside a hospital, according to official tallies.</P>
      <P>The four infected  nurses  were all mild cases  and were recuperating at home,
Huang added.</P>
      <P>More than 20 of their colleagues working at the same nursing station, as well as
two other patients who shared a room with the severe case and their caregivers
and family members, have been given preventive medication, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Noting that all four nurses and the patient fell ill between Aug. 13 and Aug.
14, Huang said an initial investigation had ruled out the possibility of the
patient and nurses coming down with the virus from the same source.</P>
      <P>"It was most likely that the patient and the nurses contracted the virus from
different sources, probably other patients, caregivers or family members and
friends who had visited the patient, " Huang elaborated.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the cluster infection had been brought under control and had
not shown any signs of spreading further.</P>
      <P>In addition to disinfecting the patient's room, Huang said, the hospital had
activated its in-hospital infection control mechanism and tightened monitoring
of patients with fever and sore throat. Outpatients  and emergency room patients
with fevers had been separated from other patients to contain any spread of the
virus, he added.</P>
      <P>The Centers  for Disease  Control  under the Cabinet-level Department of Health
estimated that there were an additional 9,000 A(H1N1) flu cases through
community infection over the past week.</P>

      <P>The official death toll from Typhoon Morakot had climbed to 136 as of 1 p.m.
Wednesday, with 386 people listed as missing and 45 injured, according to the
Central Emergency Operation Center.</P>
      <P>The death toll is likely to continue to rise, as an undetermined number of
people in remote villages, especially Siaolin in Kaohsiung County, are thought
to have died in massive landslides, it said.</P>
      <P>In terms of water and electricity supplies, the center said over 11,600
households in the southern counties of Tainan, Kaohsiung and Pingtung were still
without running water as of 10 a.m. Wednesday and that 11,881 households were
without power.</P>
      <P>In addition, 2,129 telephone lines and 124 mobile stations were yet to be
repaired, it said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 49 pumping systems have been sent to Pingtung County's Jiadong
township for use in low-lying areas where floodwaters were about 25 to 70
centimeters high, the center said.</P>
      <P>In the agricultural sector, damage from Typhoon Morakot was estimated at
NT$13.06 billion as of Wednesday morning, with Pingtung, Kaohsiung and Tainan
counties suffering the most, in that order, the center reported.</P>
      <P>The aquaculture sector suffered NT$4.1 billion in losses, with Pingtung,
Kaohsiung and Tainan counties also being the most heavily battered areas,
according to the center.</P>
      <P>About 24,281 victims have been evacuated since the flood, and the government has
established 51 emergency shelters that are now accommodating 5,849 people.
Disaster Response Centers in Chiayi, Taitung, Nantou, Kaohsiung, Pingtung and
Tainan County remain on full alert, the central center said.</P>
      <P>Some 550 airlift missions were carried out in the period Aug. 8-Aug. 19,
transporting 308,031 kilos of relief commodities, carrying 1,622 rescue
personnel to disaster areas and evacuating 9,033 victims and 17 bodies,

      <P>Every  possible  way to fix the problem-plagued Taipei Mass Rapid Transit Muzha-
Neihu Line will be taken into account, the Taipei City Deputy Secretary-General
Tan Gwa-guang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tan made the remarks in response to reporters' questions about a local tabloid
weekly report saying Mayor Hau Lung-bin intends to abandon the unstable Neihu
Line in order to save the Muzha Line.</P>
      <P>Tan declined to comment directly on the allegation, but confirmed that work to
transform the Matra-built Muzha Line trains so that they can be used on the
Neihu Line system constructed by Bombardier Inc. have been suspended.</P>
      <P>He also announced that to allow Bombardier -- a Canadian company -- to fix the
broken system, the Muzha-Neihu Line will be closed from 10 p.m. Aug. 21 to 6
a.m. Aug. 24, adding that free shuttle bus services will operate along the line
during the suspension of services.</P>
      <P>According to Tan, the city government has outlined a variety plans to address
the problem for good, including shortening the service hours and shutting down
the entire line until it can run without any hitches.</P>
      <P>No matter which plan is adopted, passenger convenience will be the top priority,
according to Tan.</P>
      <P>The Neihu Line has been plagued with problems since it began commercial services
July 4 and has been shut down several times due to system failures since then.</P>
      <P>The latest closures occurred a day earlier, with three breakdowns on that day
alone setting a new record.</P>
      <P>The latest failures were the result of the crashing of a network communication
system at the Dahu Park Station on the Neihu Line, Tan said, adding that the
failed device had already been replaced.</P>
      <P>The Neihu Line is a medium capacity system and runs on an elevated corridor
except near Taipei Songshan Airport. It spans 14.8 km and connects with the 13
-year-old Muzha Line, providing transport services to Taipei's suburban areas of
Neihu, Nangang and Muzha.</P>

      <P>Dogs and various hi-tech devices were employed Wednesday to help military
personnel locate and excavate the bodies of residents who perished in landslides
caused by Typhoon Morakot in two villages in Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>The military had previously had soldiers lie on ground to sniff possible smell
as a way to locate the remains of the victims, a method which reportedly had
caused severe stress disorder in some of the soldiers.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense decided Tuesday to forbid the use of such a
method.</P>
      <P>Hu Jui-chou, director of political warfare of the Army's Eight Regiment, said
Wednesday that health examination and psychological counseling will be provided
to the soldiers as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Joining the search effort Wednesday were three rescue and relief dogs provided
by the National Police Agency, five combustible gas detectors provided by the
Veterans Affairs Commission, three ground penetrating radars provided by Ching
Yun University and three methane detectors provided by the state-owned oil
refiner CPC Corp, Hu said.</P>
      <P>The animals and devices were delivered by helicopters to Siaolin village, where
hundreds of residents were believed buried alive by landslides, and Xinkai
village, where 32 people reportedly also died from the disaster, he said.</P>
      <P>A civic team equipped with gas detectors and a global positioning system (GPS)
also went to Xinkai village to help with the search.</P>
      <P>Among the members of the team was an executive from Taiwan Survey Corp., who
identified by his surname as Chang.</P>
      <P>Chang explained that decaying bodies release various gases that can be detected
by devices.</P>
      <P>If suspicious gases are discovered, the team will use the GPS and paint spray to
mark the locations where the gases are released to facilitate the military's
excavation work, he said.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou visited the typhoon wreckage of Siaolin village in
southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung County Wednesday, 12 days after the mountain
settlement was obliterated by landslides triggered by Typhoon Morakot that
pummeled Taiwan Aug.7-9.</P>
      <P>Ma burned incense at the site of the village to pay tribute to the hundreds of
its residents believed to have been buried alive when torrential rains spawned
by the typhoon loosened the foundations of two nearby mountain slopes and sent
their topsoil tumbling down onto the approximately 200 dwellings.</P>
      <P>The president later met with survivors and consoled those who lost their loved
ones in the disaster, as well as promising the allocation of NT$1 billion
(US$30.30 million) in special budget to the Kaohsiung county government to help
finance various restoration projects.</P>
      <P>Many of the survivors besieged the president upon his arrival at an emergency
placement center at the Lungfeng Temple in neighboring Jiasian township, some of
whom unleashed a flood of complaints about his administration's procrastination
in post-disaster rescue and relief operations.</P>
      <P>Several told the president that they still have family members believed to be
stranded in the mountains awaiting rescue.</P>
      <P>"Please, President Ma, do a bit more for our missing family members," exclaimed
one woman.</P>
      <P>In  response,  Ma immediately  directed  military  officers accompanying him on
the trip to help with search and rescue efforts.</P>
      <P>At a follow-up colloquium with Siaolin survivors, Ma bowed in apology for his
administration's flaws in the post-diaster relief.</P>
      <P>"I indeed came a bit late, " Ma admitted as he promised to do a better job in
the future and to shoulder full responsibility for the blame.</P>
      <P>He pledged to complete the rehabilitation of Siaolin village, peopled mainly by
members of the unofficially recognized Pingpu aboriginal tribe, during his term
as president and to help the survivors pick up the traces of their shattered
lives.</P>
      <P>After a suitable location is selected, construction of temporary prefabricated
houses will be completed within one month for the resettlement of all the
displaced survivors, Ma announced at the seminar.</P>
      <P>Until the prefabs are erected, Ma went on, displaced villagers can rent houses
in neighboring Jiasian township, with the government offering NT$6,000
(US$181.82) to NT$10,000 in rental subsidies per month for each household for up
to two years, as well as subsidies for living expenses.</P>
      <P>Addressing allegations that the devastating landslides were caused by dynamiting
to build a water intake opening at the Tsengwen Reservoir to draw water from the
Laonong River, along which Siaolin village nestles, Ma said he will ask the
Control Yuan,  the government's supreme supervisory arm, to investigate the
case.</P>
      <P>He also noted that the Kaohsiung Prosecutor's Office is already probing the
case.</P>
      <P>"We will get to the bottom of the matter to determine the cause and if the
speculation is substantiated,  the government will definitely shoulder full
responsibility and offer due compensation in accordance with the existing law,"
Ma assured the petitioners.</P>
      <P>On the issue of certifying the missing people as officially deceased, Ma said
the Ministry of Justice will send prosecutors to Jiasian township to speed up
the issuance of death certificates.</P>
      <P>Turning to a proposal that a Siaolin village reconstruction fund be established,
Ma said that as the project is part of the government's work agenda, it will be
financed from the government's regular budget.</P>
      <P>The proposal of turning the wreckage of Siaolin village into a memorial park, Ma
said,  will be integrated into the overall reconstruction project.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A township chief in southern Taiwan said Wednesday that if a batch of
prefabricated houses donated by China in the wake of Typhoon Morakot prove to be
safe, the townspeople are willing to move into them.</P>
      <P>Lai Hsien-ho, the township head of Jiadong in Pingtung County, which was hit
hard by the typhoon Aug. 7-9, did a swift U-turn just one day after saying the
townspeople had misgivings about the prefab houses from China in the wake of
reports that the units contain high levels of formaldehyde, a known
carcinogenic.</P>
      <P>The houses arrived in Kaohsiung  Harbor Tuesday  and were transported directly
to Jiadong to help those displaced by Morakot.</P>
      <P>Lai said later that day that the townspeople were worried that the formaldehyde
levels in the prefabs could be harmful and therefore refused to move into them.</P>
      <P>Lai said Wednesday that the Pingtung county government has been put in charge of
the temporary homes and that county officials had told him that the units, which
were temporarily placed along roadsides, will be tested to make sure they are
safe for habitation.</P>
      <P>"I asked the people of my town, and they also said that if tests prove that the
houses are safe, they are willing to move in, " he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Maa Shaw-chang, deputy secretary-general of the semi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation, said Wednesday that his Chinese counterpart, Ma Xiaoguang
of China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), had
notified him a day earlier that the first 100 of the houses contain 0.02ppm
formaldehyde and therefore do not pose a health hazard.</P>
      <P>Maa said that although in China the safety limit for prefab houses is 0.08 ppm
formaldehyde per square meter, the houses shipped to Taiwan contain the far
lower level of 0.02ppm, according to ARATS.</P>
      <P>Asked when the remaining 900 units will arrive, Maa said that this will be
decided based on the needs of the typhoon-affected cities and counties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei on its way to becoming 'garden city'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/19/09  20:06:18</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Walking the streets of Taipei City, many pedestrians may have noticed a
refreshing change: a touch of green is being added to homes and public
facilities.</P>
      <P>Walls, roofs and balconies are being turned into kaleidoscopic galleries for
living plants in the run-up to the 2010 Taipei International Gardening and
Horticulture Exposition -- the first accredited world-class exhibition ever held
by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The greenery that will soon radiate from the 91.8-hectare exhibition area --
comprised of four public parks near the Keelung River -- is gradually extending
to schools, commercial areas, markets, office buildings, and communities around
the city.</P>
      <P>Forming the backbone of this ambitious beautification initiative are 50
neighborhood greening projects that were completed in 2008, the first year of
the plan.</P>
      <P>With the public's interest in the campaign increasing, the city government has
received 300 more requests for green renovation projects since the start of this
year, according to the city's Department of Economic Development.</P>
      <P>"The news spread fast: spots that used to be the ugliest in each neighborhood
have become the most beautiful. Now applications are flooding in from almost
every borough, " said Chen Hsiung-wen, commissioner of the department.</P>
      <P>Once an application  is approved,  specialized  landscaping engineers contracted
by the city are assigned to carry out the project at the selected site. Also,
garden accessories and ornamental plants are offered to households for display
on their balconies.</P>
      <P>The city government foots the bill for these services on one condition: that the
participating neighborhoods form a volunteer team to care for the plants.</P>
      <P>Although part of the motivation of the greening campaign is to promote the
horticulture exposition, its more far-reaching mission is to increase citizen
involvement in environmental landscaping and eventually transform Taipei into a
permanent "garden city, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>He explained that through the campaign, the city government is trying to instill
an appreciation for plants among residents, further encouraging them to grow and
cherish flowers.</P>
      <P>"The exhibition should not be like a fireworks display that leaves nothing
behind after its conclusion, " Chen said. "It would be the expo's greatest
legacy if appreciating and growing flowers was to become a common culture or
habit."</P>
      <P>Among the most successful projects completed so far is the Jiantan community
center, which was converted from an abandoned, dilapidated property.</P>
      <P>The dull building received an impressive facelift last year when flowers and
grass were grown on its rooftop and potted plants were mosaicked  on two
10-meter tall sidewalls  to turn them into magnificant vertical gardens.</P>
      <P>According to Jiantan borough chief Pi Wu-liang, the renovated building has now
become a model for other neighborhoods, and many residents within the borough
are also seeking his assistance to have their homes undergo a similar
renovation.</P>
      <P>He said the popularity of the greening projects is partly due to the use of
landscape technology that does not damage the structure of buildings. The
vegetation's cooling effect, which helps reduce energy consumption, is another
factor.</P>
      <P>"The green walls bring the building's indoor temperature down by at least 3
degrees Celcius," Pi said.</P>
      <P>"In the past, the indoor temperature did not come down even with the air-
conditioner on. But almost no air-conditioning is required now, and it gets cool
very quickly after the air conditioning is switched on," he explained.</P>
      <P>In instilling an appreciation for plants and their benefit to the environment,
the city government believes the campaign will provide a boost to the
horticulture expo.</P>
      <P>Chen said the greening projects will create a connection between the exhibition
and the city's residents, grabbing their attention and encouraging their
participation.</P>
      <P>To get the maximum impact, the city hopes that at least one project similar to
the Jiantan community center is completed in each of the city's 449 boroughs by
the time the expo opens on Nov. 6, 2010.</P>
      <P>Chen estimated that the event, which is scheduled to run six months until April
25, 2011, will generate NT$12 billion (US$365.85 million) in overall economic
benefits, including at least NT$1.8 billion in revenue for local floricultural
vendors.</P>
      <P>With Taipei already the largest domestic market for locally grown flowers, the
greening movement is expected to further increase sales of related products in
the city and in turn boost the country's floricutlure sector, he said.</P>
      <P>"Our greatest hope is to see the exhibition bring a change to the city's
culture, its residents' lifestyles and even the city's landscape," Chen said.</P>

landslides triggered by Typhoon Morakot when it swept through Taiwan last week.</P>
      <P>Eight of the schools were either leveled or partially buried under mud and
debris from landslides, he said.</P>
      <P>As it has been determined that most of the damaged schools will not be able to
reopen in time for the new school year in September, Cheng said, arrangements
have been made for the students to attend other schools.</P>
      <P>Teachers from the damaged schools have been given a directive to locate all the
students and thus ensure that the children can start classes soon, he added.</P>
      <P>The central government will pay tuition and other expenses for students in the
disaster-hit areas, and will also subsidize those who lost their parents or were
rendered homeless by the storm, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>According to MOE figures, more than 1,300 schools in central and southern Taiwan
were demolished or damaged by Morakot,  which presented a challenge to education
authorities in the effort to resettle the students.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in discussions being held by government officials, experts and
scholars on the reconstruction of damaged schools and other educational
facilities, it has been suggested that smaller schools with six or fewer classes
be closed down or merged.</P>
      <P>Maximum resources should be put into rebuilding  destroyed campuses and
renovating old schools so that they can better withstand natural disasters such
as storms and earthquakes, some commentators have suggested.</P>
      <P>According to MOE statistics, 49 percent of elementary schools in Chiayi County
-- one of the worst-affected areas -- are small or so-called mini schools. In
Tainan County such schools account for 40 percent of the total number, in
Pintung County 30.72 percent, and in Kaohsiung County 29.61 percent, the figures
show.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier orders acceleration of relief subsidies distribution</HEADLINE>

(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan on Wednesday ordered government agencies to accelerate
the distribution of relief subsidies to people suffering losses of family
members and properties in floodings and landslides triggered by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu gave the order when he convened the first meeting of the
Reconstruction Advancement Committee. He stressed the urgency of delivering the
relief subsidies and arranging resettlement for those hit by the disaster.</P>
      <P>The central government has already allocated a total of NT$2.7 billion to the
local governments of Pingtung, Kaohsiung, Tainan and Chiayi and Taitung
Counties. The premier expected that at least 80 percent of the subsidies will be
delivered within a week.</P>
      <P>For those waiting for government relief subsidies to pay rent, the money should
be delivered within three days, said the premier.</P>
      <P>In a survey among villagers stricken homeless, 70 percent said they preferred to
rent a place to live and pay for it with subsidies, while 30 percent said they
would like to live in government-provided prefabricated houses or to wait for
the government to arrange other housing options for them, according to the
premier.</P>
      <P>He added that the government has found eight locations suitable for building
prefabricated houses, and the government will work with the Buddhist Compassion
Relief Tzu Chi Foundation in building 70 to 80 housing units first in two
locations in Taitung County.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the Ministry of Economic Affairs show that a total of
136,401 households in southern and southeastern Taiwan were flooded and each is
entitled to NT$20,000 in relief payments from the government.</P>

      <P>A Chinese procurement mission arrived in Taipei Wednesday with plans to purchase
more than US$1.2 billion worth of machinery, petrochemical and textile goods.</P>
      <P>The group, the fourth of its kind from China so far this year, came at a time
when Taiwan is trying to dig itself out of the rubble left by Typhoon Morakot,
which lashed Taiwan with strong winds and torrential rains Aug.7-9.</P>
      <P>The mission, organized by the Association of Economy and Trade Across the Taiwan
Straits (AETATS), is composed of more than 100 executives representing 55 major
Chinese enterprises, including Chongqing Hybest Air Tools and Kingfa Sci &amp;
Tech Co.</P>
      <P>The delegation is headed by AETATS Vice President Tang Wei who concurrently
headed the Taiwan,  Hong Kong and Macau affairs Department under China's
Ministry of Commerce.</P>
      <P>The AETATS, an affiliate of China's Ministry of Commerce, is tasked with
promoting commercial exchanges and economic cooperation with Taiwan. It has
organized two previous procurement missions to Taiwan this year.</P>
      <P>Lin Li-kai, a section chief at the Taiwan External Trade and Development Council
(TAITRA), said the delegation will purchase a variety of products that Taiwanese
manufacturers are competing keenly to supply.</P>
      <P>The products will include machinery, electronics and chemical engineering
equipment, garments and footwear. The buyers will also seek to purchase auto
parts and components in line with China's "automobiles to the countryside"
project that is part of its economic stimulus package.</P>
      <P>As some companies in southern and central Taiwan are still recovering from
serious flooding triggered by the storm, Lin said, they may not be able to send
executives to Taipei to participate in the one-to-one sessions with prospective
Chinese buyers.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Lin said, TAITRA has posted special application forms on
its Web site to allow such companies to introduce their products and present
their corporate profiles.</P>
      <P>"The TAITRA will help disseminate relevant information in an effort to help
those companies forge links with the companies represented on the Chinese
procurement mission," Lin added.</P>

      <P>An ad hoc committee tasked with planning rehabilitation work in the aftermath of
Typhoon Morakot came up with four  reconstruction  packages  Wednesday,
focusing  on  land conservation,  infrastructure  construction,  resettlement
and industrial revival.</P>
      <P>The four packages were finalized at the first working meeting of the ad hoc
committee, which was chaired by Premier Liu Chao-shiuan.</P>
      <P>Liu said at a news conference held after the meeting that the focus of the post-
disaster rehabilitation work will now gradually shift from rescue and
resettlement to reconstruction.</P>
      <P>"The national land conservation package, drafted by the Council for Economic
Planning and Development, will serve as the main guidelines for all
reconstruction projects, " Liu said.</P>
      <P>Protection of the natural environment is very important to the prevention of
natural disasters, given Taiwan's unique climate and topography, he added.</P>
      <P>The infrastructure construction package spells out guidelines for repair  and
restoration  of broken highways  and bridges  and reinforcement of flood-control
systems and management mechanisms, work that will be carried out by the Ministry
of Transportation and Communications and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Liu
said.</P>
      <P>The resettlement package will focus on helping displaced typhoon survivors
rebuild  their communities  and establish  permanent settlements, Liu said,
adding that the Ministry of the Interior will be responsible for that task.</P>
      <P>The industrial revival package will promote the development of industries and
services suited to the hardest-hit disaster zones, including  tourism,  creative
cultural industries  and high-end agriculture.</P>
      <P>It  was   also   decided   at  the   meeting   that Minister-without-Portfolio
Tsai Hsun-hsiung  will serve as the committee's chief executive and Veterans
Affairs Commission Minister Kao Hua-chu will head the committee's branch in
southern Taiwan, which was the hardest hit area when Morakot lashed Taiwan with
strong winds and heavy rains Aug.7-9, Liu added.</P>

      <P>Shenzhen Airlines of China donated NT$10 million (US$302,000) to Taiwan Monday,
saying that it hopes the money will be used to help restore the Alishan scenic
area, one of the most popular tourist attractions among Chinese visitors to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shenzhen Airlines President Li Kun presented the donation during a cocktail
party held to celebrate the company's establishment of a branch in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tourism Bureau Director-General Janice Lai accepted the money and thanked the
donor on behalf of the Taiwan government.</P>
      <P>Lai said Taiwan is as beautiful as ever, despite the devastation wrought by
Typhoon Morakot, which triggered massive flooding and landslides last week in
southern Taiwan and caused devastation in many mountain villages that were
popular among local sightseers.</P>
      <P>However, most of the areas that foreign tourists find attractive were untouched
by the storm, she said, noting that the Alishan forest recreation area, at an
altitude of 2,200 meters to 2,500 meters in the greater Alishan National Scenic
Area, was one such site.</P>
      <P>Although the 1,400-hectare forest recreation site was spared by the typhoon,
there was heavy damage to the roads, the popular alpine railway that serves the
area, and some of the sightseeing spots along route.</P>
      <P>According to the Directorate General of Highways, the heavily damaged Alishan
Highway -- the main road to the forest recreation area -- will not be able to
accommodate traffic again until late September.</P>
      <P>Parts of the highway have caved in and the roadbed has been eroded in many
spots. Also, sections of the Alishan Railway have been washed away by floods,
some tunnels on the line have caved in, and some road beds have disappeared
completely.</P>
      <P>Yen Mao-sheng, the official in charge of railway construction at the Chiayi
Forest District Office, has estimated that it would take at least a year to
repair the railway.</P>
      <P>Alishan is one of the must-see sites for visitors from China, and has attracted
several thousand Chinese tourists a day since March.</P>
      <P>Two other Chinese carriers -- China Southern Airlines and Air China -- have also
made donations to help with Taiwan's relief work in the aftermath of the
typhoon.</P>

      <P>The ruling Kuomintang will postpone its 18th national party congress from Sept.
12 to Oct. 17, which means President Ma Ying-jeou will not take over as party
chairman until October, KMT spokesman Lee Chien-jung said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, Ma himself took the initiative to have the KMT national
congress postponed to October so that he can focus his efforts on the
rehabilitation work in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>"President Ma phoned outgoing KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung Tuesday to ask for Wu's
consent on the matter," Lee said.</P>
      <P>The telephone conversation took place shortly after Ma hosted Chinese- and
English-language news conferences the same day to brief the local and
international news media on his administration's post-typhoon response projects
amid mounting criticism over flaws in the rescue and relief work.</P>
      <P>Acting on Ma's request, Wu brought up the proposal for discussion Wednesday at
the weekly meeting of the party's decision-making Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>It was unanimously agreed at the meeting that the party's 18th national congress
would be postponed until Oct.17, at which time Ma will take over from Wu as
chairman, in accordance with the KMT charter.</P>
      <P>In line with that decision, the party's election of Central Committee members
will also be postponed from Aug.22 to Sept. 27 and the election of its Central
Standing Committee members deferred from Sept. 6 to Oct. 11, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Ma won the party's chairmanship in an unchallenged election July 26.</P>
      <P>He was first elected KMT chairman July 17, 2005, but he resigned from the post
Feb.13, 2007 after he was indicted on charges of misusing public funds during
his tenure as Taipei mayor from 1998-2006. He was cleared of the charges before
assuming the presidency in May 2008.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou visited the typhoon wreckage of Siaolin village in
southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung County Wednesday, 12 days after the mountain
settlement was obliterated by landslides triggered by Typhoon Morakot that
pummeled Taiwan Aug.7-9.</P>
      <P>Ma burned incense at the site of the village to pay tribute to the hundreds of
its residents believed to have been buried alive when torrential rains spawned
by the typhoon loosened the foundations of two nearby mountain slopes and sent
their topsoil tumbling down onto the approximately 200 dwellings.</P>
      <P>The president later met with survivors and consoled those who lost their loved
ones in the disaster, as well as promising the allocation of NT$1 billion
(US$30.30 million) in special budget to the Kaohsiung county government to help
finance various restoration projects.</P>
      <P>Many of the survivors besieged the president upon his arrival at an emergency
placement center at the Lungfeng Temple in neighboring Jiasian township, some of
whom unleashed a flood of complaints about his administration's procrastination
in post-disaster rescue and relief operations.</P>
      <P>Several told the president that they still have family members believed to be
stranded in the mountains awaiting rescue.</P>
      <P>"Please, President Ma, do a bit more for our missing family members," exclaimed
one woman.</P>
      <P>In  response,  Ma immediately  directed  military  officers accompanying him on
the trip to help with search and rescue efforts.</P>
      <P>At a follow-up colloquium with Siaolin survivors, Ma bowed in apology for his
administration's flaws in the post-diaster relief.</P>
      <P>"I indeed came a bit late, " Ma admitted as he promised to do a better job in
the future and to shoulder full responsibility for the blame.</P>
      <P>He pledged to complete the rehabilitation of Siaolin village, peopled mainly by
members of the unofficially recognized Pingpu aboriginal tribe, during his term
as president and to help the survivors pick up the traces of their shattered
lives.</P>
      <P>After a suitable location is selected, construction of temporary prefabricated
houses will be completed within one month for the resettlement of all the
displaced survivors, Ma announced at the seminar.</P>
      <P>Until the prefabs are erected, Ma went on, displaced villagers can rent houses
in neighboring Jiasian township, with the government offering NT$6,000
(US$181.82) to NT$10,000 in rental subsidies per month for each household for up
to two years, as well as subsidies for living expenses.</P>
      <P>Addressing allegations that the devastating landslides were caused by dynamiting
to build a water intake opening at the Tsengwen Reservoir to draw water from the
Laonong River, along which Siaolin village nestles, Ma said he will ask the
Control Yuan,  the government's supreme supervisory arm, to investigate the
case.</P>
      <P>He also noted that the Kaohsiung Prosecutor's Office is already probing the
case.</P>
      <P>"We will get to the bottom of the matter to determine the cause and if the
speculation is substantiated,  the government will definitely shoulder full
responsibility and offer due compensation in accordance with the existing law,"
Ma assured the petitioners.</P>
      <P>On the issue of certifying the missing people as officially deceased, Ma said
the Ministry of Justice will send prosecutors to Jiasian township to speed up
the issuance of death certificates.</P>
      <P>Turning to a proposal that a Siaolin village reconstruction fund be established,
Ma said that as the project is part of the government's work agenda, it will be
financed from the government's regular budget.</P>
      <P>The proposal of turning the wreckage of Siaolin village into a memorial park, Ma
said,  will be integrated into the overall reconstruction project.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A township chief in southern Taiwan said Wednesday that if a batch of
prefabricated houses donated by China in the wake of Typhoon Morakot prove to be
safe, the townspeople are willing to move into them.</P>
      <P>Lai Hsien-ho, the township head of Jiadong in Pingtung County, which was hit
hard by the typhoon Aug. 7-9, did a swift U-turn just one day after saying the
townspeople had misgivings about the prefab houses from China in the wake of
reports that the units contain high levels of formaldehyde, a known
carcinogenic.</P>
      <P>The houses arrived in Kaohsiung  Harbor Tuesday  and were transported directly
to Jiadong to help those displaced by Morakot.</P>
      <P>Lai said later that day that the townspeople were worried that the formaldehyde
levels in the prefabs could be harmful and therefore refused to move into them.</P>
      <P>Lai said Wednesday that the Pingtung county government has been put in charge of
the temporary homes and that county officials had told him that the units, which
were temporarily placed along roadsides, will be tested to make sure they are
safe for habitation.</P>
      <P>"I asked the people of my town, and they also said that if tests prove that the
houses are safe, they are willing to move in, " he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Maa Shaw-chang, deputy secretary-general of the semi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation, said Wednesday that his Chinese counterpart, Ma Xiaoguang
of China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), had
notified him a day earlier that the first 100 of the houses contain 0.02ppm
formaldehyde and therefore do not pose a health hazard.</P>
      <P>Maa said that although in China the safety limit for prefab houses is 0.08 ppm
formaldehyde per square meter, the houses shipped to Taiwan contain the far
lower level of 0.02ppm, according to ARATS.</P>
      <P>Asked when the remaining 900 units will arrive, Maa said that this will be
decided based on the needs of the typhoon-affected cities and counties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei on its way to becoming 'garden city'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/19/09  20:06:18</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Walking the streets of Taipei City, many pedestrians may have noticed a
refreshing change: a touch of green is being added to homes and public
facilities.</P>
      <P>Walls, roofs and balconies are being turned into kaleidoscopic galleries for
living plants in the run-up to the 2010 Taipei International Gardening and
Horticulture Exposition -- the first accredited world-class exhibition ever held
by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The greenery that will soon radiate from the 91.8-hectare exhibition area --
comprised of four public parks near the Keelung River -- is gradually extending
to schools, commercial areas, markets, office buildings, and communities around
the city.</P>
      <P>Forming the backbone of this ambitious beautification initiative are 50
neighborhood greening projects that were completed in 2008, the first year of
the plan.</P>
      <P>With the public's interest in the campaign increasing, the city government has
received 300 more requests for green renovation projects since the start of this
year, according to the city's Department of Economic Development.</P>
      <P>"The news spread fast: spots that used to be the ugliest in each neighborhood
have become the most beautiful. Now applications are flooding in from almost
every borough, " said Chen Hsiung-wen, commissioner of the department.</P>
      <P>Once an application  is approved,  specialized  landscaping engineers contracted
by the city are assigned to carry out the project at the selected site. Also,
garden accessories and ornamental plants are offered to households for display
on their balconies.</P>
      <P>The city government foots the bill for these services on one condition: that the
participating neighborhoods form a volunteer team to care for the plants.</P>
      <P>Although part of the motivation of the greening campaign is to promote the
horticulture exposition, its more far-reaching mission is to increase citizen
involvement in environmental landscaping and eventually transform Taipei into a
permanent "garden city, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>He explained that through the campaign, the city government is trying to instill
an appreciation for plants among residents, further encouraging them to grow and
cherish flowers.</P>
      <P>"The exhibition should not be like a fireworks display that leaves nothing
behind after its conclusion, " Chen said. "It would be the expo's greatest
legacy if appreciating and growing flowers was to become a common culture or
habit."</P>
      <P>Among the most successful projects completed so far is the Jiantan community
center, which was converted from an abandoned, dilapidated property.</P>
      <P>The dull building received an impressive facelift last year when flowers and
grass were grown on its rooftop and potted plants were mosaicked  on two
10-meter tall sidewalls  to turn them into magnificant vertical gardens.</P>
      <P>According to Jiantan borough chief Pi Wu-liang, the renovated building has now
become a model for other neighborhoods, and many residents within the borough
are also seeking his assistance to have their homes undergo a similar
renovation.</P>
      <P>He said the popularity of the greening projects is partly due to the use of
landscape technology that does not damage the structure of buildings. The
vegetation's cooling effect, which helps reduce energy consumption, is another
factor.</P>
      <P>"The green walls bring the building's indoor temperature down by at least 3
degrees Celcius," Pi said.</P>
      <P>"In the past, the indoor temperature did not come down even with the air-
conditioner on. But almost no air-conditioning is required now, and it gets cool
very quickly after the air conditioning is switched on," he explained.</P>
      <P>In instilling an appreciation for plants and their benefit to the environment,
the city government believes the campaign will provide a boost to the
horticulture expo.</P>
      <P>Chen said the greening projects will create a connection between the exhibition
and the city's residents, grabbing their attention and encouraging their
participation.</P>
      <P>To get the maximum impact, the city hopes that at least one project similar to
the Jiantan community center is completed in each of the city's 449 boroughs by
the time the expo opens on Nov. 6, 2010.</P>
      <P>Chen estimated that the event, which is scheduled to run six months until April
25, 2011, will generate NT$12 billion (US$365.85 million) in overall economic
benefits, including at least NT$1.8 billion in revenue for local floricultural
vendors.</P>
      <P>With Taipei already the largest domestic market for locally grown flowers, the
greening movement is expected to further increase sales of related products in
the city and in turn boost the country's floricutlure sector, he said.</P>
      <P>"Our greatest hope is to see the exhibition bring a change to the city's
culture, its residents' lifestyles and even the city's landscape," Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government to subsidize students affected by typhoon disaster</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) will spare no effort to help students in the
typhoon disaster areas return to school, and will also cover all their
educational expenses, Minister Cheng Jei-cheng said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Addressing the issue during a visit to Taoyuan County, northern Taiwan, Cheng
said 31 schools in southern Taiwan were severely damaged by flooding and
landslides triggered by Typhoon Morakot when it swept through Taiwan last week.</P>
      <P>Eight of the schools were either leveled or partially buried under mud and
debris from landslides, he said.</P>
      <P>As it has been determined that most of the damaged schools will not be able to
reopen in time for the new school year in September, Cheng said, arrangements
have been made for the students to attend other schools.</P>
      <P>Teachers from the damaged schools have been given a directive to locate all the
students and thus ensure that the children can start classes soon, he added.</P>
      <P>The central government will pay tuition and other expenses for students in the
disaster-hit areas, and will also subsidize those who lost their parents or were
rendered homeless by the storm, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>According to MOE figures, more than 1,300 schools in central and southern Taiwan
were demolished or damaged by Morakot,  which presented a challenge to education
authorities in the effort to resettle the students.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in discussions being held by government officials, experts and
scholars on the reconstruction of damaged schools and other educational
facilities, it has been suggested that smaller schools with six or fewer classes
be closed down or merged.</P>
      <P>Maximum resources should be put into rebuilding  destroyed campuses and
renovating old schools so that they can better withstand natural disasters such
as storms and earthquakes, some commentators have suggested.</P>
      <P>According to MOE statistics, 49 percent of elementary schools in Chiayi County
-- one of the worst-affected areas -- are small or so-called mini schools. In
Tainan County such schools account for 40 percent of the total number, in
Pintung County 30.72 percent, and in Kaohsiung County 29.61 percent, the figures
show.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan on Wednesday ordered government agencies to accelerate
the distribution of relief subsidies to people suffering losses of family
members and properties in floodings and landslides triggered by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu gave the order when he convened the first meeting of the
Reconstruction Advancement Committee. He stressed the urgency of delivering the
relief subsidies and arranging resettlement for those hit by the disaster.</P>
      <P>The central government has already allocated a total of NT$2.7 billion to the
local governments of Pingtung, Kaohsiung, Tainan and Chiayi and Taitung
Counties. The premier expected that at least 80 percent of the subsidies will be
delivered within a week.</P>
      <P>For those waiting for government relief subsidies to pay rent, the money should
be delivered within three days, said the premier.</P>
      <P>In a survey among villagers stricken homeless, 70 percent said they preferred to
rent a place to live and pay for it with subsidies, while 30 percent said they
would like to live in government-provided prefabricated houses or to wait for
the government to arrange other housing options for them, according to the
premier.</P>
      <P>He added that the government has found eight locations suitable for building
prefabricated houses, and the government will work with the Buddhist Compassion
Relief Tzu Chi Foundation in building 70 to 80 housing units first in two
locations in Taitung County.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the Ministry of Economic Affairs show that a total of
136,401 households in southern and southeastern Taiwan were flooded and each is
entitled to NT$20,000 in relief payments from the government.</P>

      <P>A Chinese procurement mission arrived in Taipei Wednesday with plans to purchase
more than US$1.2 billion worth of machinery, petrochemical and textile goods.</P>
      <P>The group, the fourth of its kind from China so far this year, came at a time
when Taiwan is trying to dig itself out of the rubble left by Typhoon Morakot,
which lashed Taiwan with strong winds and torrential rains Aug.7-9.</P>
      <P>The mission, organized by the Association of Economy and Trade Across the Taiwan
Straits (AETATS), is composed of more than 100 executives representing 55 major
Chinese enterprises, including Chongqing Hybest Air Tools and Kingfa Sci &amp;
Tech Co.</P>
      <P>The delegation is headed by AETATS Vice President Tang Wei who concurrently
headed the Taiwan,  Hong Kong and Macau affairs Department under China's
Ministry of Commerce.</P>
      <P>The AETATS, an affiliate of China's Ministry of Commerce, is tasked with
promoting commercial exchanges and economic cooperation with Taiwan. It has
organized two previous procurement missions to Taiwan this year.</P>
      <P>Lin Li-kai, a section chief at the Taiwan External Trade and Development Council
(TAITRA), said the delegation will purchase a variety of products that Taiwanese
manufacturers are competing keenly to supply.</P>
      <P>The products will include machinery, electronics and chemical engineering
equipment, garments and footwear. The buyers will also seek to purchase auto
parts and components in line with China's "automobiles to the countryside"
project that is part of its economic stimulus package.</P>
      <P>As some companies in southern and central Taiwan are still recovering from
serious flooding triggered by the storm, Lin said, they may not be able to send
executives to Taipei to participate in the one-to-one sessions with prospective
Chinese buyers.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Lin said, TAITRA has posted special application forms on
its Web site to allow such companies to introduce their products and present
their corporate profiles.</P>
      <P>"The TAITRA will help disseminate relevant information in an effort to help
those companies forge links with the companies represented on the Chinese
procurement mission," Lin added.</P>

      <P>An ad hoc committee tasked with planning rehabilitation work in the aftermath of
Typhoon Morakot came up with four  reconstruction  packages  Wednesday,
focusing  on  land conservation,  infrastructure  construction,  resettlement
and industrial revival.</P>
      <P>The four packages were finalized at the first working meeting of the ad hoc
committee, which was chaired by Premier Liu Chao-shiuan.</P>
      <P>Liu said at a news conference held after the meeting that the focus of the post-
disaster rehabilitation work will now gradually shift from rescue and
resettlement to reconstruction.</P>
      <P>"The national land conservation package, drafted by the Council for Economic

reconstruction projects, " Liu said.</P>
      <P>Protection of the natural environment is very important to the prevention of
natural disasters, given Taiwan's unique climate and topography, he added.</P>
      <P>The infrastructure construction package spells out guidelines for repair  and
restoration  of broken highways  and bridges  and reinforcement of flood-control
systems and management mechanisms, work that will be carried out by the Ministry
of Transportation and Communications and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Liu
said.</P>
      <P>The resettlement package will focus on helping displaced typhoon survivors
rebuild  their communities  and establish  permanent settlements, Liu said,
adding that the Ministry of the Interior will be responsible for that task.</P>
      <P>The industrial revival package will promote the development of industries and
services suited to the hardest-hit disaster zones, including  tourism,  creative
cultural industries  and high-end agriculture.</P>
      <P>It  was   also   decided   at  the   meeting   that Minister-without-Portfolio

      <P>Shenzhen Airlines of China donated NT$10 million (US$302,000) to Taiwan Monday,
saying that it hopes the money will be used to help restore the Alishan scenic
area, one of the most popular tourist attractions among Chinese visitors to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shenzhen Airlines President Li Kun presented the donation during a cocktail
party held to celebrate the company's establishment of a branch in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tourism Bureau Director-General Janice Lai accepted the money and thanked the
donor on behalf of the Taiwan government.</P>
      <P>Lai said Taiwan is as beautiful as ever, despite the devastation wrought by
Typhoon Morakot, which triggered massive flooding and landslides last week in
southern Taiwan and caused devastation in many mountain villages that were
popular among local sightseers.</P>
      <P>However, most of the areas that foreign tourists find attractive were untouched
by the storm, she said, noting that the Alishan forest recreation area, at an
altitude of 2,200 meters to 2,500 meters in the greater Alishan National Scenic
Area, was one such site.</P>
      <P>Although the 1,400-hectare forest recreation site was spared by the typhoon,
there was heavy damage to the roads, the popular alpine railway that serves the
area, and some of the sightseeing spots along route.</P>
      <P>According to the Directorate General of Highways, the heavily damaged Alishan
Highway -- the main road to the forest recreation area -- will not be able to
accommodate traffic again until late September.</P>
      <P>Parts of the highway have caved in and the roadbed has been eroded in many
spots. Also, sections of the Alishan Railway have been washed away by floods,
some tunnels on the line have caved in, and some road beds have disappeared
completely.</P>
      <P>Yen Mao-sheng, the official in charge of railway construction at the Chiayi
Forest District Office, has estimated that it would take at least a year to
repair the railway.</P>
      <P>Alishan is one of the must-see sites for visitors from China, and has attracted
several thousand Chinese tourists a day since March.</P>
      <P>Two other Chinese carriers -- China Southern Airlines and Air China -- have also

    <HEADLINE>Three science parks' revenues fall more than 38% in 1st half of year</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The total revenues of companies in Taiwan's three science parks fell by more
than 38 percent in the first half of 2009 as a result of the global recession,
the National Science Council (NSC) reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>Total turnover at the Hsinchu Science Park in northern Taiwan, the Central
Taiwan Science Park and the Southern Taiwan Science Park amounted to NT$631.4
billion (US$19.13 billion) in the first six months of this year, representing a
year-on-year decline of 38.2 percent, said NSC Vice Chairman Chen Li-chun at a
news conference Wednesday.</P>
      <P>A chart of the three science parks' total revenues between January 2008 and June
2009 shows that the revenues bottomed out in January 2009 and began a gradual
rise, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The chart showed that the parks' revenues amounted to NT$377.2 billion in the
second quarter of this year, representing an increase of 48.3 percent from the
first quarter, he noted.</P>
      <P>"Judging from that trend, the revenues of the three science parks would continue
to rise in July and August," he forecast.</P>
      <P>IC companies were the mainstays of the three parks, contributing NT$316.3
billion, or 50.1 percent, to the total revenues in the first half of the year.
This was a decline of 34.9 percent compared to the same period last year,
according to NSC statistics.</P>
      <P>Optoelectronic companies were the second largest contributors, generating
NT$254.7 billion, or 40.3 percent of the three parks' revenues during the six-
month period. The figure was a year-on-year drop of 43.7 percent.</P>
      <P>The third largest group, computer and peripheral companies, contributed NT$27.7
billion in revenues to the total, a drop of 34.3 percent from the same period in
2008, the tallies showed.</P>
      <P>Between January and June this year, Chen said, 20 new investment projects worth
NT$6.6 billion were approved for the three parks, while 20 companies increased
their investment capital by a total of NT$8.1 billion.</P>
      <P>In July alone, 12 newly approved companies became operational in the three
parks, while 10 companies increased their investment capital, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>As of the end of June, 689 companies had been approved to operate in the three
parks -- the backbone of Taiwan's industrial development -- with 446 to be
located in the Hsinchu Science Park, 151 in the Southern Taiwan Science Park,
and 92 in the Central Taiwan Science Park, according to NSC officials.</P>
      <P>As of June 30, the three parks had a workforce of 194,096 people, down 5,353
from the figure posted at the end of 2008, mainly as a result of the global
economic crunch, NSC officials said.</P>
      <P>As of Aug. 1, the number of workers on unpaid leave at the three parks had
dropped to 22,013, representing a sharp increase over the figure of 128,304
reported in January.</P>
      <P>By Aug. 16, the number of workers on furlough had declined further to 14,697,
according to the latest NSC tallies.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's health authorities have confirmed five more clusters of influenza
A(H1N1) infection, bringing to 48 the total number on record.</P>
      <P>Among the five latest clusters reported Wednesday by the Centers for Disease

after-school care center.</P>
      <P>In the cluster at National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) , flu-like symptoms
were reported among 11 healthcare workers, four of whom were diagnosed with the

      <P>The other cluster was discovered at a teaching hospital in southern Taiwan,
where 18 healthcare workers came down with flu-like symptoms, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Five of the 10 people who were tested for the A(H1N1) virus came up positive, he

defect.</P>
      <P>The CDC is investigating whether there is a connection between the patient at
NTUH and the cluster of infections there.</P>

      <P>Two prefabricated houses in a batch donated by China in the wake of Typhoon
Morakot were erected in an open area in Pingtung County Thursday for the purpose
of testing the materials for hazardous content.</P>
      <P>A group of specialists from the Cabinet-level Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) went to Pingtung to check the indoor air quality of the two
prefab houses that were erected in Pingtung County's Jiadong township, the EPA
said.</P>
      <P>Based on concerns that the first 100 prefabricated houses donated by China might
contain high levels of formaldehyde,  a known carcinogenic, EPA officials said
that the materials will be tested and the results publicized on Aug. 22.</P>
      <P>Ten containers of prefab housing materials arrived in Kaohsiung Harbor Tuesday
and were transported directly to Jiadong as aid to people affected Typhoon
Morakot, which triggered the worst flooding in Taiwan in half a century.</P>
      <P>The death toll from the storm rose to 141 as of noon Thursday. Another 440
remained unaccounted for and 45 were reported injured. Jiadong was one of the
areas in southern Taiwan hardest hit by the storm, which lashed Taiwan Aug.7-9.</P>
      <P>"All 100 prefab houses will be erected if the first two prove safe for
habitation," said township chief Lai Hsien-ho.</P>
      <P>The comment was an about-face by Lai, who said two days ago that the townspeople
were concerned about the safety of the units, in light of reports that the
materials contained high levels of formaldehyde. He added that the townspeople
had therefore said they would not occupy the houses.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lai said, his office has asked Rotary International Taiwan to donate
another 150 prefab houses.</P>
      <P>Even if the 100 units from China are all erected, Jiandong will still be 50
houses short, he said, noting that some 300 families in the township were
rendered homeless by the storm.</P>
      <P>He added that his office has been negotiating with Taiwan Sugar Corp. for about
7-8 hectares of land on which to erect the prefab houses for the flood victims.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy will grow 3 percent or higher next year, following a gradual
recovery in the global economy, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting
and Statistics (DGBAS) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The growth of the domestic economy is likely to turn from negative to positive
next year, thanks to the lower comparison basis of 2009 and a possible rebound
in major global economies, the DGBAS said.</P>
      <P>For this year, however, DGBAS officials forecasted that the growth rate would
not be significant if there were any.</P>
      <P>The officials said Typhoon Morakot, which pummeled Taiwan Aug. 7-9 with the
worst flooding in Taiwan in 50 years, will drag down the domestic economy in the
third quarter because of the massive destruction it wreaked.</P>
      <P>However, they said, the outlook for Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) in the
fourth quarter is not necessarily "pessimistic," given that huge governmental
funds and resources expected to be channeled into post-disaster reconstruction
efforts might rev up economic growth.</P>
      <P>"There are chances that the GDP might register positive growth in Q4 as a result
of the reconstruction work, which will generate new demand, investment and
employment, and as a result of the recovery of the global economies," they
forecasted.</P>
      <P>"However, the growth range would not be significant," they noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  government  officials  have  said  post-typhoon reconstruction could
cost NT$100 billion (US$3 billion) and take as long as three years.</P>

schools with a total of 409 students in the county's mountainous townships will
not be able to reopen in time for the start of the new school year on Sept. 1,
mainly because most of them are covered in mud in the wake of the storm.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Education has encouraged undergraduates to join the clean up
efforts at the affected schools.</P>
      <P>NCYU officials said more than 30 students from the university have registered to
help clean up Taiho Elementary School in Meishan township and Chungho Elementary
School in Jhuci township.</P>
      <P>After mountain roads damaged by the typhoon have been repaired, the volunteer
students will be divided into two teams and sent to the schools to undertake

      <P>A total of 237 Taiwanese students, several of whom tested positive for the A
(H1N1) influenza virus in South Korea, returned to Taiwan Thursday on two
charter flights arranged by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).</P>
      <P>The 238-member group, which is composed of tour guides as well as students and
teachers from National Taiwan Normal University, Kuang Hwa Junior High School in
Hsinchu City, and Er Chong Junior High School in Hsinchu County were in South
Korea to attend the 14th Jeju International Wind Ensemble Festival.</P>
      <P>The group was quarantined in a resort on Jeju island after some members of the
group developed high fevers on Aug. 17. Fifteen members of the group were later
confirmed to have the H1N1 flu, also known as swine flu.</P>
      <P>Apart from one tour guide who flew to Italy, the group returned to Taiwan
Thursday morning on two TransAsia Airways charter flights.</P>
      <P>The 15 confirmed H1N1 cases will receive necessary treatment while the rest will
be quarantined and monitored.</P>
      <P>James Chang, deputy spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, denied at a regular

      <P>Chang  said  that officials  from the Foreign  Ministrys representative office
in Seoul and Busan immediately went to Jeju on Aug. 18 and 19, respectively,
upon learning that 15 of the students had H1N1 flu.</P>
      <P>Chang said the officials reported the situation to the Centers for Disease
Control in Taiwan, and asked it to send doctors.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the ministry also contacted TransAsia Airways to arrange

Thursday:</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou should step down, Liu Chao-shiuan should resign over their bungled
rescue operation.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's approval rate has plunged to 16 percent, while Premier
Liu Chao-shiuan's has dived to 13 percent in the wake of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>We are not surprised, because Ma has a record of incompetence in most of the
political posts he has held.</P>
      <P>As there are still two more years to go before Ma's term expires, we call on him
to resign and spare the people the ordeal of his botched leadership.</P>
      <P>As to Premier Liu, he should step down immediately if he still has a conscience.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Let us remember the noble spirit of these people</P>
      <P>The funerals of two of the three helicopter crew members who died in the line of
duty were held yesterday.</P>
      <P>The daughter of the deceased pilot Chang Shun-fa told journalists proudly that
her father gave his life for his work.</P>
      <P>In another case, a volunteer firefighter Chang Jui-hsiang drowned while
searching for survivors in a car that had fallen into a river in a bridge
collapse during the onslaught of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Chang, a survivor of the Sept. 21, 1999 earthquake, was still paying back loans
that he had taken to rebuild his house after it was damaged in the earthquake.
During the typhoon, he took leave from his job at a factory to join the rescue
efforts.</P>
      <P>The flooding brought about by Morakot revealed many facets of human character.
Let us not forget the heroes we mentioned above, as their noble and courageous
acts uplift the world.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Ma's administration needs constructive purge</P>
      <P>The shortcomings of President Ma's administration have been fully exposed by
Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Ma's aloofness toward the public could hardly be offset by Premier Liu Chao-
shiuan because the two are similar in terms of educational background and
character.</P>
      <P>Natural disasters are not unusual in the world. Former New York Mayor Rudy
Giuliani earned a reputation as good leader because of his competence in the
aftermath of the terror attack on the city Sept. 11, 2001.</P>
      <P>President Ma, on the other hand, has become a lightning rod for criticism in the
wake of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>For this reason, a Cabinet reshuffle is an inevitable, though detrimental,
decision for Ma, but we hope it will be conducive to better approval ratings for
the president.</P>
      <P>Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>Incompetent officials, get off your posts quickly please</P>
      <P>12 days after Typhoon Morakot cut a swathe through the island, only Deputy
Foreign Ministry Andrew Hsia resigned. No others follow suit.</P>
      <P>President  Ma has vowed  to keep  the  stability  of his administration by
refraining from replacing Cabinet members too often, but his pledge offered a
shelter for the many incompetent officials in his administration.</P>
      <P>With the popularity of Premier Liu Chao-shiuan's administration dipping to the

      <P>A group Chinese buyers who arrived in Taipei Wednesday donated 3 million yuan
(US$438,981) for disaster relief in Taiwan, and plans to purchase US$900 million
worth of Taiwanese goods, the head of the delegation said at a news conference
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The group, the third of its kind to be organized by Beijing's Association of
Economy and Trade Across the Taiwan Straits (AETATS) this year, arrived at a
time when Taiwan is trying to dig itself out of the rubble left by Typhoon
Morakot.</P>
      <P>The mission is composed of more than 120 executives representing 55 major
Chinese enterprises, including Lenovo Group Ltd, Chongqing Hybest Air Tools and
Kingfa Sci &amp; Tech Co.</P>
      <P>The delegation is being led by AETATS Vice President Tang Wei who is also head
of the Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Department under China's Ministry of
Commerce.</P>
      <P>Tang Wei stressed that the donation was a compassionate rather than a political
gesture. It was also offered in return for Taiwan's kindness and generosity
during China's Sichuan Earthquake last year, he said.</P>
      <P>His comment was a reference to the fact that two days after a 7.8 magnitude
temblor struck Sichuan Province in May last year killing more than 14,000
people, Taiwan's Red Cross Society mustered NT$70 million (US$2.27 million) in
donations for disaster relief. The Taiwan government also donated a total of
NT$2 billion (US$65.57 million) to the effort.</P>
      <P>At the news conference Thursday, the Chinese delegation also presented Taiwan
with a Chinese calligraphy piece bearing the words "Faith Is More Precious Than
Gold," a biblical quote that is often used by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao.</P>
      <P>The group handed over the cash donation to the Taiwan External Trade Development
Council, which will pass it on to the relevant agencies soon.</P>
      <P>The delegation has begun one-on-one sessions with Taiwanese buyers, and plans to
purchase US$900 million worth of machinery, petrochemical and textile goods.</P>
      <P>The first Chinese procurement mission organized by the AETATS visited Taiwan in
June and placed more than US$2.2 billion worth of orders for computers,
television sets and other home appliances. The goods have already been shipped
to China.</P>
      <P>The second AETATS group was in Taiwan July 12-17 to buy US$700 million worth of
specialty foods, giftware, daily necessities and handicrafts.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Lin Huo-wan, a national advisor to President Ma Ying-jeou, offered to resign
Thursday after his blatant criticism of the Cabinet's slow response to Typhoon
Morakot caused widespread criticism of the administration.</P>
      <P>Lin, a professor of philosophy at National Taiwan University, said Thursday that
he has submitted a letter of resignation to the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Lin disclosed Monday on a cable TV political talk show that Premier Liu Chao-
shiuan went to have his hair dyed on Aug. 11 and Executive Yuan Secretary-
General Hsueh Hsiang-chuan had dinner at the five-star Howard Hotel on Aug. 9
when the Cabinet should have spared no effort in rescuing people and providing
disaster relief after the typhoon caused severe flooding and massive landslides.</P>
      <P>Lin's remarks led to Hsueh tendering his resignation this week. Premier Liu has
yet to offer to resign or to accept Hsueh's resignation.</P>
      <P>Despite admitting that he was rapped for tarnishing the Ma administration's
image by making the remarks,  Lin denied his resignation was offered under
pressure from the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that he is a national advisor to the president, not an advisor to the
ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>"If a government's behavior is not in the interest of the country's people, why
should not the people make criticism? " asked Lin, when speaking to reporters
Thursday.</P>
      <P>In response, Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi indicated Thursday that
the Presidential Office has accepted Lin's resignation.</P>
      <P>"We respect Lin Huo-wan's decision, and thank him for his assistance and
suggestions during his term," said Wang.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Broken bridges, broken calls, broken lives</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/20/09  17:56:53</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The distress call rang out at 0: 42 a.m. Aug. 9, a desperate cry for help from
31-year-old Tsai Ya-hsueh to her sister after her car plunged off the Shuangyuan
Bridge over the Gaoping River and became caught at the abutment of the bridge.</P>
      <P>"The bridge is out! I have fallen under... Come to save me! Hurry! "</P>
      <P>But Tsai's mobile phone signal soon died in the rampaging waters fed by Typhoon
Morakot, and she become one of the storm's early casualties.</P>
      <P>Similar tragedies played out on roads around central and southern Taiwan,
focusing the spotlight on the country's traditionally vulnerable bridges that
have given out during natural disasters.</P>
      <P>What was different this time was the scale and severity of the destruction,
especially in the southern counties of Pingtung, Kaohsiung and Chiayi and in
central Taiwan's Nantou County, and the questions it raised about how bridges in
Taiwan will be built and managed in the future.</P>
      <P>As of noon Aug. 19, a total of 90 bridges around Taiwan had collapsed, with
another nine requiring repairs to their abutments, according to Yao Nai-jia,
head of the National Central University's Center for Bridge Engineering
Research, who has been monitoring the situation alongside government officials.</P>
      <P>That number, he said, still does not include bridges on the Southern Cross
Island Highway (No. 20) that may have collapsed in areas that remain
inaccessible.</P>
      <P>"Never before has a single typhoon caused bridge damage on such a massive
scale," said Lin Chia-hsin, a Directorate General of Highways (DGH) official in
charge of highway and bridge maintenance.</P>
      <P>Particularly worrisome to officials is that only three of the 14 major bridges
that collapsed on nationally administered roadways -- Tajin Bridge, Liouguei
Bridge and Ciwei Bridge, all located in Kaohsiung County -- were listed as
"dangerous" during a countrywide inspection last year.</P>
      <P>Bridges such as the New Ciwei Bridge and the No. 1 Bridge that were pronounced
"structurally sound with no serious problems" in the 2008 assessment also fell
victim to Morakot's raging floodwaters.</P>
      <P>Highway officials and bridge engineering experts generally agree that the
staggering amount of rainfall dumped by Morakot over a very short period --
2,500 mm of precipitation, or a year's-worth of rain, in three days from Aug.
7-9 -- was the main culprit behind the high frequency of bridge destruction.</P>
      <P>But given more extreme weather patterns caused by global warming and climate
change, massive storms like Morakot could become more common in the future.</P>
      <P>Scholars said that with this in mind, the government should update bridge
management procedures, including revising criteria for closing bridges in stormy
weather.</P>
      <P>Water levels have traditionally been the sole criteria for bridge closure amid
flooding. This time around, many bridges were not closed off before they
collapsed.</P>
      <P>Take, for instance, the 2,083-meter Shuangyuan Bridge, which was actually two
separate bridges, one for each direction of traffic.</P>
      <P>The water level in the Gaoping River was still 4.5 meters lower than the
riverbank when the northbound bridge's No. 1-15 piers and the southbound
bridge's No. 1-16 piers were washed away by raging currents.</P>
      <P>Under current guidelines, bridges do not need to be closed off until the water
level rises to within 1.5 meters of the riverbank's upper level.</P>
      <P>"The  rules  should  be overhauled  and should  take into consideration the
velocity of river flows, the geological condition of each bridge and the extent
of abutment erosion, " said Tsai Chun-yi, a structural engineer and an assistant
professor at National Central University.</P>
      <P>Another key to improving bridge safety lies in design and construction, Tsai
said. Most of Taiwan's 27,183 bridges are girder bridges, built of precast
concrete and steel, which feature short spans and often require many piers --
the pillars supporting the individual spans.</P>
      <P>"New thinking should be employed in designing Taiwan's river bridges, " Tsai
said.</P>
      <P>Two recent high-profile  bridge collapses --  that of the 22-year-old Gaoping
Bridge in Kaohsiung in 2000 and the 18-year-old Houfeng Bridge in Taichung in
2008 -- were both caused by bridge piers giving out after being battered by
flash floods.</P>
      <P>Noting that erosion, earthquakes and typhoons are three key elements that should
be factored into the design of Taiwan's river bridges, Tsai said reducing the
number of piers or eliminating them completely would be the most effective way
to enhance the safety and durability of local bridges, a view echoed by his
colleague.</P>
      <P>"Riverbed bridge piers tend to disrupt water flow, increasing the hazard of
piers being eroded or washed away. Therefore, the fewer the number of piers in a
riverbed, the safer the bridge, " NCU's Yao said.</P>
      <P>The Shuangyuan Bridge, for example, has more than 60 piers in the river, with no
span longer than 31 meters.</P>
      <P>"With so many piers sitting in the riverbed, the erosion of a single pier could
lead to the collapse of other piers and the whole bridge, " Yao lamented,
saddened by the thought that the two painstakingly built bridges stood for less
than 30 years.</P>
      <P>In light of Taiwan's unique climate and topography, Yao said bridges longer than
100 meters should use cable-stayed or extradosed bridges, which use cables
suspended from single towers rather than a series of piers to support long
bridge spans.</P>
      <P>Most of Taiwan's river bridges stretch between 200 meters and over 1,000 meters
are most suitable to these styles.</P>
      <P>Whether the cable-stayed or extradosed model is chosen depends on the breadth of
the rivers over which a bridge will be built.</P>
      <P>According to Yao, the span of a cable-stayed bridge can stretch 400 to 500
meters, while that of an extradosed bridge can extend 200 to 300 meters.</P>
      <P>However, high costs might deter the use of these bridge types. Construction of a
cable-stayed bridge is three to four times more expensive than the cost of
building a girder one, while an extradosed bridge costs around twice as much as
a girder type.</P>
      <P>Noting that the higher costs are mainly a result of higher technological
thresholds, Yao said Taiwan is technologically capable of building such
suspension-style bridges.</P>
      <P>The 2,617-meter highway bridge on the Yancao-Jiuru section of Taiwan's  Second
Freeway that crosses the Gaoping River is a cable-stayed model that has become a
landmark and is the longest such bridge in Asia.</P>
      <P>With the technology available, the only problem is funding, but Yao said he does
not think all Taiwan's bridges need to be changed to cable-stayed or extradose
models.</P>
      <P>"I think such models need to be introduced just for long river bridges that
require longer spans to overcome abutment-scouring problems," Yao said.</P>
      <P>As to the cost, while cable-stayed and extradosed bridges are more expensive
than girder ones, they are easier to maintain, said Yao.</P>
      <P>While girder bridges may cost less to construct, they tend to need more
maintenance and to incur higher repair fees. In the event of collapse, huge
compensation has to be paid to those who are affected, while reconstruction of
such bridges costs even more, Yao went on.</P>
      <P>Apart from bridge design, equally important is environmental protection.</P>
      <P>Yao, who led a team on an investigation last week into why a large number of
bridges in Chiayi County failed, said the main reason behind the collapse of so
many bridges before water levels reached officially set alarm levels lay in the
fact that the huge amounts of silt,  soil,  rocks and driftwood  washed into the
rivers by typhoon-triggered flash floods and landslides enormously increased the
impact of the river flows.</P>
      <P>"Silt, soil and driftwood from the mountains are testimony to illegal logging
and excessive land development and residential construction on mountain slopes,"
Yao said.</P>
      <P>"If rampant overuse of slopeland and riverside agriculture cannot be halted,
bridges will be doomed to continue collapsing, no matter how advanced the
technology used to build them."</P>
      <P>In the face of Taiwan's unique natural environment, Yao went on, some areas
should not be inhabited any longer to solve the problem at the root. "Land
planning and river management should be addressed to resolve bridge safety
problems once and for all," he stressed.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan has one of the world's highest bridge densities, it is sadly
lacking in manpower for bridge maintenance and management. Before the deadly
earthquake of Sept. 21, 1999, only the DGH had a bridge supervisory system in
charge of 4,564 provincial highway bridges.</P>
      <P>After the 921 earthquake, Yao noted, the MOTC commissioned the NCT's bridge
research center to conduct a nationwide survey, which found Taiwan has
20,000-plus bridges but only a limited number of staff to oversee them. For
instance, Chiayi County has 993 bridges, but only one full-time engineering
official and several contract workers to manage them.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, bridge experts suggested that the government should conduct a
nationwide bridge examination and single out dangerous bridges.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-huang,  president of the national federation  of construction industry
associations, said many bridges, particularly those in rural townships or
villages, are situated on narrow rivers and are in a state of dilapidation.</P>
      <P>"Environmental and climatic changes might have undermined their structures. Even
though they remain standing after the typhoon, they might nonetheless require
maintenance," Chen said.</P>

      <P>Donations and disaster relief supplies continue to flow in into Taiwan from the
international community to help with the relief efforts in the aftermath of
Typhoon Morakot, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to a MOFA press release, a donation from Japan, comprised of 200
waterproof ground sheets, 400 water buckets, 50 water tanks, 50 water purifiers,
30 generators and 900 sleeping pads, was scheduled to arrive in Taiwan later
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Japan's top representative to Taiwan Masaki Saito, on behalf of his government,
will hand over the supplies to Vice Foreign Minister David Lin, the MOFA said,
adding that the supplies will be sent to the Kaohsiung County government for
distribution.</P>
      <P>In addition, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) sent a second
disaster relief expert to Taiwan Aug. 19 to evaluate the country's needs in its

    <HEADLINE>Cabinet approves special bill for post-typhoon reconstruction</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is scheduled to complete reconstruction in the aftermath of
Typhoon Morakot within three years at an estimated cost of NT$100 billion
(US$3.03 billion) , Vice Minister of the Interior (MOI) Lin Chung-sen said
Thursday after the Executive Yuan approved a bill on reconstruction.</P>
      <P>If passed by the Legislature, the special MOI-drafted bill will authorize the
executive branch to raise a special budget of NT$100 billion in three years to
finance various post-typhoon rehabilitation and reconstruction projects.</P>
      <P>"According to the special bill, the government will carry out reconstruction
projects in line with three top principles -- leniency, promptness and minimal
red-tape," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Taking cues from the special statute governing reconstruction in the wake of the
devastating Sept. 21, 1999 earthquake, the draft bill on post-Typhoon Morakot
reconstruction outlines mechanisms regarding rehabilitation of public
infrastructure and resettlement of displaced typhoon victims, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin added that the bill will soon be referred to the Legislative Yuan for
approval to facilitate rehabilitation of areas affected by Morakot which lashed
southern Taiwan with strong winds and torrential rains from Aug. 7-9, causing
severe flooding and landslides that killed an estimated 500 people.</P>
      <P>One key element of the bill is to outlaw habitation in mountain hillsides and
other areas that put residents at risk in typhoons or other natural disasters.</P>
      <P>"With safety as the top concern, potentially dangerous regions will no longer be
listed as inhabitable," Lin said.</P>
      <P>One such area,  Siaolin Village in Kaohsiung County,  was hardest-hit in the
typhoon. Nearly 400 people are believed buried alive when sides of nearby
mountains came crashing down on the village after heavy rain loosened the soil.
The village is located at the foothills of Alishan in a narrow valley.</P>
      <P>Community relocation may be inevitable for some dangerous zones, Lin said,
adding that the special reconstruction bill has outlined a mechanism for
compensation and land acquisition for people who have to be relocated.</P>
      <P>If land plots picked to accommodate resettlement projects are owned by
government agencies or state-run enterprises, the use of such land will be free
of charge, Lin said.</P>
      <P>"So long as those land plots are professionally determined to be safe for
habitation,  regulations  involving  rezoning or land development will be
relaxed, " Lin said, adding that the government will cooperate  closely  with
the private  sector to finalize resettlement and reconstruction as early as
possible.</P>
      <P>While preferential incentives will be offered,  application procedures will also
be simplified as much as possible to speed up reconstruction, Lin said.</P>
      <P>As Morakot-triggered flooding and landslides which severely damaged or buried
many roads and bridges, Lin said the central government will also work hand-in-
hand with local governments to rebuild or repair roads and bridges in no more
than three years.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the Executive Yuan has already paid NT$6.6 billion in
reconstruction funds to various county governments whose districts were hit
hardest by the disaster.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said he will call a meeting of
caucus whips of ruling and oppsoition parties Friday to discuss whether an
extraordinary session will be convened soon to screen the special bill for
reconstruction projects or the next legislative session be opened ahead of the
schedule to deal with this urgent bill.</P>
      <P>"Anyway, the Legislature will scrutinize the bill and pass it as soon as
possible to accelerate reconstruction and resettlement of displaced typhoon
victims," Wang said.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang contols an absolute majority in the Legislature. Both KMT
and the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party have voiced support for the
bill.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan announced Thursday that the government's post-typhoon
response has now entered the resettlement and reconstruction phase, as rescues
have more or less been completed.</P>
      <P>Liu emphasized that the handover of tasks by government units of various levels
must be a "seamless" process so that reconstruction in flood-affected areas can
be launched smoothly.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liu said that although the Council for Economic Planning and
Development already has a national homeland plan, it must come up with a new
strategic plan on land conservation in flood-affected areas soon. The plan will
serve as the main guidelines for all post-typhoon reconstruction projects.</P>
      <P>"The new guidelines will enable post-typhoon reconstruction projects, including
land conservation, infrastructure reconstruction, resettlement and industrial
revival to be carried out efficiently," Liu said.</P>
      <P>The premier gave the instructions after hearing briefings by Minister Without

      <P>A visiting Chinese commerce official said Thursday he is confident that
negotiations on an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) between
Taiwan and China will be concluded by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Tang Wei, director general of the Department of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao
Affairs under China's Ministry of Commerce, told a news conference in Taipei
that currently both sides are still at the stage of studying the feasibility of
such an agreement on its own and will continue to strengthen communications with
each other in order to develop a mutually beneficial and win-win cooperative
mode.</P>
      <P>Although it depends on the results of talks, Tang said that he "has great
confidence" that the negotiations will be concluded by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Tang is on a visit in Taiwan as the head of a 100-member procurement delegation
organized by China's Association of Economy and Trade Across the Taiwan Straits
(AETATS). He is the AETATS' vice president.</P>
      <P>Responding to concerns that the agreement will have a negative impact on
Taiwan's various industries, such as the towel industry, Tang noted that the
signing of the ECFA is to benefit both China and Taiwan and assure that China
will take these concerns into account and will not allow the agreement to
negatively impact Taiwan's domestic industries.</P>
      <P>Touching on what kinds of industries will be included in the early-harvest list
of the planned cross-Taiwan Strait ECFA, Tang said that those agreed upon by
both sides, and those that can be implemented easily and quickly, will first be
included on the list. These could be the financial and banking,  petrochemicals
and machinery industries proposed by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The AETATS, an affiliate of China's Ministry of Commerce, is tasked with
promoting commercial exchanges and economic cooperation with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The procurement group, the fourth of its kind to come from China so far this
year, plans to purchase more than US$1.2 billion worth of machinery,
petrochemicals and textile goods.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou and his administration have said that negotiations on the
ECFA agreement will begin in October and that they hope to sign such an
agreement with China by next year.</P>
      <P>While critics have expressed concerns that there could be a flood of Chinese
products into Taiwan and local industries will be hurt, Ma and other proponents
have argued that the agreement - similar to a free-trade agreement - is
necessary for Taiwan to remain competitive, as China is signing similar pacts
with other countries.</P>

      <P>The central government will float NT$466 billion (US$14.12 billion) in state
bonds next year to help cover its spending, according to the 2010 draft budget
bill approved by the Executive Yuan Thursday at a weekly Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>The new budget bill projects the government's annual revenue and expenditure  at
NT$1.552  trillion  and  NT$1.7398  trillion, respectively, leaving the national
coffers with a deficit of NT$187.8 billion.</P>
      <P>As the government has to repay NT$66 billion in previous debts in 2010 and will
need to spend an additional NT$212.2 billion on infrastructure construction,
flood control and reservoir renovation, it will have to borrow the combined
total of NT$466 billion in the coming year to make ends meet, a Cabinet official
said.</P>
      <P>The targeted 2010 government revenue marks a decrease of NT$121.2 billion from
this year's level, while its projected expenditure represents a drop of NT$69.9
billion year on year, the official went on.</P>
      <P>According to next year's budget bill, education, scientific research and
cultural development will take the lion's share of government budget, at a
combined 20.3 percent, followed by social welfare spending at 18.7 percent,
defense expenditure at 16.6 percent and economic development spending at 12.1
percent.</P>
      <P>The official pointed out that defense spending will account for roughly 3
percent of the country's gross domestic product, fulfilling a government promise
to raise the defense budget to beef up the country's military muscle.</P>
      <P>The key government work agenda listed in the budget bill includes research and

improvements to the disaster prevention system, infrastructure construction,

      <P>The Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation will build "green" houses in
cooperation  with the Kaohsiung county government for aboriginal people whose
mountain homes were destroyed by Typhoon Morakot, officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin Pi-yu, deputy chief executive of the Tzu Chi Foundation, Taiwan's largest
charity, signed a letter of intent with Kaohsiung Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsiung
earlier in the day on cooperation in building a completely new village -- to be
called Da Ai (Big Love) village -- in the southern county in which displaced
typhoon victims can be resettled.</P>
      <P>According to the preliminary agreement, the county government will provide a
plot of land upon which the Buddhist charity will build up to 1,000 permanent
houses to accommodate the displaced aboriginal people from several townships in
mountainous areas of the county.</P>
      <P>The Tzu Chi foundation, founded by Master Cheng Yen, will raise the funds needed
to build the houses, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Yang for his part said the county government had already selected a 22.8-hectare
plot in Shanlin township to accommodate the planned Da Ai village.</P>
      <P>The site, located near Shanlin Junior High School, is owned by state-run Taiwan
Sugar Corp.</P>
      <P>Yang said he will seek the central government's assistance in acquiring the land
as soon as possible to speed up the resettlement project.</P>
      <P>He further said the houses will be offered to the displaced typhoon victims free
of charge, with the proviso that they cannot be sold for a specified period of
time.</P>
      <P>Tzu Chi has built many Da Ai villages in disaster zones in Taiwan and other
countries around the world, and Lin said the housing units to be built in
Kaohsiung County will be environmentally friendly "green" houses.</P>
      <P>Several mountain townships in Kaohsiung  County,  including Jiasian, Siaolin,
Liuguei and Taoyuan, were hit hard by torrential rain and landslides triggered
by Typhoon Morakot that pummeled Taiwan Aug. 7-9, leaving hundreds of people
dead or missing and rendering many others homeless.</P>
      <P>Out of respect for aboriginal religious beliefs and customs, Lin went on, the
roads in the planned Da Ai village will be unpaved, in keeping with the desires
of the people who will live there.</P>
      <P>The village will also feature a youth activity center and a handicraft display
gallery to provide indigenous tribal people with a better living environment and
a means of selling their traditional craftwork, Lin added.</P>
      <P>As many of the aborigines are resistant to being resettled out of the mountains
down onto the plains, Yang said the central government should help them relocate
by offering incentives such as employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>Years of excessive development, Taiwan's mountain slopes are vulnerable to
landslides. Aboriginal communities have thus often fallen victim to typhoons
whcih tend to bring with them heavy rains to trigger landslides and mudslides.</P>
      <P>"Tzu Chi will reinforce communciations with aboriginal village chiefs to
convince them the importance of land restoration and persuade them to relocate
to safer places to establish new homes and return the mountains and forests to
Mother Nature," Lin said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DGBAS forecasts 4.04 percent negative economic growth</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  20  (CNA)
08/20/09  22:50:38

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) has revised
its projections for Taiwan's economic situation for this year to 4.04 percent
negative growth, slightly more optimistic than the 4.25 percent projected in
May.</P>
      <P>However, if a special budget for reconstruction projects in the wake of Typhoon
Morakot is factored in, the economy for the whole of this year is expected to
shrink even less, with 3.75 percent negative growth, DGBAS Minister Shih Su-mei
said at a press conference Thursday to announce the projections.</P>
      <P>Shih said a government plan to earmark NT$100 billion budget for post-typhoon
reconstruction, of which NT$50 billion will be allocated for the 2009 fiscal
year, is expected to increase the real gross domestic product (GDP) to NT$36.1
billion and lessen the contraction of the economy to 3.75 percent for the year.</P>
      <P>The agency also revised upward its economic outlook, predicting that the economy
will shrink 10.13 percent in Q1 and 7.54 percent in Q2, less than the previously
projected 10.24 percent in Q1 and 8.5 percent in Q2.</P>
      <P>According to DGBAS projections, Typhoon Morakot, which has battered the
agriculture, tourism and manufacturing sectors, is estimated to have caused GDP
losses of between NT$19 billion and NT$23 billion in Q3 and could lead to a
further Q3 negative growth of 0.6 percent to 0.7 percent.</P>
      <P>However, the negative impact of the typhoon on the Q4 GDP will be lessened after
reconstruction projects begin, as they are expected to contribute 0.1 percent to
0.2 percent to the Q4 economic growth, Shih added.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS also projected Taiwan a 3.92 percent economic growth for 2010 due to
the low comparison base affected by the global economic downturn this year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, as an export-orientated country, is expected to benefit as a global
recovery begins and to register positive year-on-year economic growth next year,
according to Shih.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the agency predicted that the Consumer Price Index will register a
0.87 percent year-on-year increase next year, compared with a projected 0.68
percent contraction this year.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS also forecast that the country's gross national product will rise to
NT$13.05 trillion next year from NT$12.56 trillion projected for this year.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's household income gap widened in 2008, with the average annual
disposable incomes of the richest families reaching 6.05 times those of the
poorest, according to the results of the latest survey released Thursday.</P>
      <P>The trend marked a reversal from 2007, when the income gap between the richest
and poorest 20 percent of local families narrowed slightly to 5.98-fold from
6.01-fold recorded in 2006, said an official of The Cabinet-level  Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>Moreover, the official said, if social welfare subsidies and tax benefits are
excluded, the income gap between the two groups hit an all-time high of
7.73-fold in 2008.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS has conducted an annual survey of family incomes and expenditures
around the country since 1964 to keep tabs on wealth distribution.</P>
      <P>The survey divides families into five brackets in terms of annual disposable
income, with the top 20 percent defined as the richest and the bottom 20 percent
as the poorest. The largest income gap between these two brackets was 6.39-fold,
recorded in 2001.</P>
      <P>But if social welfare subsidies and tax benefits were excluded, the wealth gap
in 2001 was 7.67 fold, lower than that recorded in 2008.</P>
      <P>The latest survey found that the average annual disposable income in the richest
group  of families  reached  NT$1.84  million (US$55,757.5) in 2008, compared to
NT$304,000 for those in the poorest bracket.</P>
      <P>With government welfare subsidies and tax breaks excluded, the annual disposable
family income of the richest group amounted to NT$1.9 million, compared to the
poorest group's NT$245,000.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS official attributed the widening wealth gap in part to structural
changes in the job market as a result of economic globalization.</P>
      <P>As to whether the global financial crisis had any impact on the local wealth
distribution, the official said it requires a further survey and study.</P>

      <P>The central government will float NT$466 billion (US$14.12 billion) in state
bonds next year to help cover its spending, according to the 2010 draft budget
bill approved by the Executive Yuan Thursday at a weekly Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>The new budget bill projects the government's annual revenue and expenditure  at
NT$1.552  trillion  and  NT$1.7398  trillion, respectively, leaving the national
coffers with a deficit of NT$187.8 billion.</P>
      <P>As the government has to repay NT$66 billion in previous debts in 2010 and will
need to spend an additional NT$212.2 billion on infrastructure construction,
flood control and reservoir renovation, it will have to borrow the combined
total of NT$466 billion in the coming year to make ends meet, a Cabinet official
said.</P>
      <P>The targeted 2010 government revenue marks a decrease of NT$121.2 billion from
this year's level, while its projected expenditure represents a drop of NT$69.9
billion year on year, the official went on.</P>
      <P>According to next year's budget bill, education, scientific research and
cultural development will take the lion's share of government budget, at a
combined 20.3 percent, followed by social welfare spending at 18.7 percent,
defense expenditure at 16.6 percent and economic development spending at 12.1
percent.</P>
      <P>The official pointed out that defense spending will account for roughly 3
percent of the country's gross domestic product, fulfilling a government promise
to raise the defense budget to beef up the country's military muscle.</P>
      <P>The key government work agenda listed in the budget bill includes research and
development personnel cultivation, improvements in the transport network,
improvements to the disaster prevention system, infrastructure construction,
upgrading of living environments and increased cultural development.</P>

      <P>The Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation will build "green" houses in
cooperation  with the Kaohsiung county government for aboriginal people whose
mountain homes were destroyed by Typhoon Morakot, officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin Pi-yu, deputy chief executive of the Tzu Chi Foundation, Taiwan's largest
charity, signed a letter of intent with Kaohsiung Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsiung
earlier in the day on cooperation in building a completely new village -- to be
called Da Ai (Big Love) village -- in the southern county in which displaced
typhoon victims can be resettled.</P>
      <P>According to the preliminary agreement, the county government will provide a
plot of land upon which the Buddhist charity will build up to 1,000 permanent
houses to accommodate the displaced aboriginal people from several townships in
mountainous areas of the county.</P>
      <P>The Tzu Chi foundation, founded by Master Cheng Yen, will raise the funds needed
to build the houses, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Yang for his part said the county government had already selected a 22.8-hectare
plot in Shanlin township to accommodate the planned Da Ai village.</P>
      <P>The site, located near Shanlin Junior High School, is owned by state-run Taiwan
Sugar Corp.</P>
      <P>Yang said he will seek the central government's assistance in acquiring the land
as soon as possible to speed up the resettlement project.</P>
      <P>He further said the houses will be offered to the displaced typhoon victims free
of charge, with the proviso that they cannot be sold for a specified period of
time.</P>
      <P>Tzu Chi has built many Da Ai villages in disaster zones in Taiwan and other
countries around the world, and Lin said the housing units to be built in
Kaohsiung County will be environmentally friendly "green" houses.</P>
      <P>Several mountain townships in Kaohsiung  County,  including Jiasian, Siaolin,
Liuguei and Taoyuan, were hit hard by torrential rain and landslides triggered
by Typhoon Morakot that pummeled Taiwan Aug. 7-9, leaving hundreds of people
dead or missing and rendering many others homeless.</P>
      <P>Out of respect for aboriginal religious beliefs and customs, Lin went on, the
roads in the planned Da Ai village will be unpaved, in keeping with the desires
of the people who will live there.</P>
      <P>The village will also feature a youth activity center and a handicraft display
gallery to provide indigenous tribal people with a better living environment and
a means of selling their traditional craftwork, Lin added.</P>
      <P>As many of the aborigines are resistant to being resettled out of the mountains
down onto the plains, Yang said the central government should help them relocate
by offering incentives such as employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>Years of excessive development, Taiwan's mountain slopes are vulnerable to
landslides. Aboriginal communities have thus often fallen victim to typhoons
whcih tend to bring with them heavy rains to trigger landslides and mudslides.</P>
      <P>"Tzu Chi will reinforce communciations with aboriginal village chiefs to
convince them the importance of land restoration and persuade them to relocate
to safer places to establish new homes and return the mountains and forests to
Mother Nature," Lin said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DGBAS forecasts 4.04 percent negative economic growth</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) has revised
its projections for Taiwan's economic situation for this year to 4.04 percent
negative growth, slightly more optimistic than the 4.25 percent projected in
May.</P>
      <P>However, if a special budget for reconstruction projects in the wake of Typhoon
Morakot is factored in, the economy for the whole of this year is expected to
shrink even less, with 3.75 percent negative growth, DGBAS Minister Shih Su-mei
said at a press conference Thursday to announce the projections.</P>
      <P>Shih said a government plan to earmark NT$100 billion budget for post-typhoon
reconstruction, of which NT$50 billion will be allocated for the 2009 fiscal
year, is expected to increase the real gross domestic product (GDP) to NT$36.1
billion and lessen the contraction of the economy to 3.75 percent for the year.</P>
      <P>The agency also revised upward its economic outlook, predicting that the economy
will shrink 10.13 percent in Q1 and 7.54 percent in Q2, less than the previously
projected 10.24 percent in Q1 and 8.5 percent in Q2.</P>
      <P>According to DGBAS projections, Typhoon Morakot, which has battered the
agriculture, tourism and manufacturing sectors, is estimated to have caused GDP
losses of between NT$19 billion and NT$23 billion in Q3 and could lead to a
further Q3 negative growth of 0.6 percent to 0.7 percent.</P>
      <P>However, the negative impact of the typhoon on the Q4 GDP will be lessened after
reconstruction projects begin, as they are expected to contribute 0.1 percent to
0.2 percent to the Q4 economic growth, Shih added.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS also projected Taiwan a 3.92 percent economic growth for 2010 due to
the low comparison base affected by the global economic downturn this year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, as an export-orientated country, is expected to benefit as a global
recovery begins and to register positive year-on-year economic growth next year,
according to Shih.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the agency predicted that the Consumer Price Index will register a
0.87 percent year-on-year increase next year, compared with a projected 0.68
percent contraction this year.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS also forecast that the country's gross national product will rise to
NT$13.05 trillion next year from NT$12.56 trillion projected for this year.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's household income gap widened in 2008, with the average annual
disposable incomes of the richest families reaching 6.05 times those of the
poorest, according to the results of the latest survey released Thursday.</P>
      <P>The trend marked a reversal from 2007, when the income gap between the richest
and poorest 20 percent of local families narrowed slightly to 5.98-fold from
6.01-fold recorded in 2006, said an official of The Cabinet-level  Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>Moreover, the official said, if social welfare subsidies and tax benefits are
excluded, the income gap between the two groups hit an all-time high of
7.73-fold in 2008.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS has conducted an annual survey of family incomes and expenditures
around the country since 1964 to keep tabs on wealth distribution.</P>
      <P>The survey divides families into five brackets in terms of annual disposable
income, with the top 20 percent defined as the richest and the bottom 20 percent
as the poorest. The largest income gap between these two brackets was 6.39-fold,
recorded in 2001.</P>
      <P>But if social welfare subsidies and tax benefits were excluded, the wealth gap
in 2001 was 7.67 fold, lower than that recorded in 2008.</P>
      <P>The latest survey found that the average annual disposable income in the richest
group  of families  reached  NT$1.84  million (US$55,757.5) in 2008, compared to
NT$304,000 for those in the poorest bracket.</P>
      <P>With government welfare subsidies and tax breaks excluded, the annual disposable
family income of the richest group amounted to NT$1.9 million, compared to the
poorest group's NT$245,000.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS official attributed the widening wealth gap in part to structural
changes in the job market as a result of economic globalization.</P>
      <P>As to whether the global financial crisis had any impact on the local wealth
distribution, the official said it requires a further survey and study.</P>

      <P>The New Zealand government donated NZ$100,000 (US$67,635) to Taiwan's Red Cross
Friday to help with the relief efforts in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Felicity Bloor, acting director of the Taipei-based New Zealand Commerce and
Industry Office, handed over the donation on behalf of her government to the Red
Cross Society of the Republic of China, which she said is a trustworthy charity
group that she believed will make best use of the money.</P>
      <P>"We hope that by giving it to the Red Cross, people that need to rebuild their
houses and rebuild their lives will be able to benefit. Whoever these people
are, we hope that they will be able to receive hope from my government to help
rebuild their lives that have been shattered by this typhoon," Bloor said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Asians constitute 9.8 percent of the New Zealand population, Bloor
said her country is closely connected with Asian countries and communities in
the region.</P>
      <P>"We feel that we are a natural partner within the Asian region, so if something
happens in your part of the world, we feel it. It concerns us," she said.</P>
      <P>Steven Chen, secretary-general of the ROC chapter of the Red Cross Society,
pledged to make the best use of the donation by caring for the emergency needs
of the typhoon victims.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot dumped nearly 3,000 mm of rain in just four days on parts of
Taiwan, mainly in the south, swelling rivers that washed away bridges and
triggered landslides that buried entire villages.</P>
      <P>As of 10 p.m. Thursday, the storm had killed at least 141 people across Taiwan,
with 45 people injured and 440 others unaccounted for.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's health authorities reported the country's third influenza A(H1N1)
fatality Friday, a student from the eastern county of Taitung.</P>
      <P>The 24-year-old man, who had not traveled overseas, came down with flu symptoms

County's Public Health Bureau.</P>
      <P>He sought treatment at the Taitung Christian Hospital, where he tested negative

    <TEXT>
      <P>Over 136,000 households in seven counties and one city in southern and eastern
Taiwan are entitled to flood compensation because their homes were inundated by
flooding or destroyed  by  mudslides  triggered  by  Typhoon  Morakot,  a
government-sponsored foundation said Friday.</P>
      <P>Fan Liang-shiow, chairman of the non-profit Relieve Disaster Foundation, said
NT$2.73 billion (US$82.91 million) was remitted the day before to local
government offices in Pingtung, Kaohsiung, Tainan, Chiayi, Changhua, Nantou and
Taitung counties, as well as Chiayi City, allowing each household to receive
NT$20,000, said Fan, who is also chairman of the Cabinet-level Public
Construction Commission.</P>
      <P>It is expected that more than 80 percent of the eligible households will receive
the NT$20,000 in cash within one week, Fan added.</P>
      <P>The Relieve Disaster Foundation allocated NT$430 million and NT$660 million,
respectively, to local governments of the hardest-hit counties several days ago
as condolence money for households that have lost loved ones in the wake of
Typhoon Morakot and as subsidies to help finance the rebuilding of their homes,
he continued.</P>
      <P>According to the foundation, families with members who have died or who have
been reported missing because of the typhoon have already been earmarked for
condolence money of NT$1 million (US$30,488) per casualty. Families whose
members have suffered severe injury as a result of the typhoon are also to
receive NT$250,000 per victim, the foundation said, adding that the money has
already been remitted to the various local governments.</P>
      <P>Fan said the foundation -- established in 2001 by the Ministry of the Interior
to handle government relief funds and private donations in the wake of Typhoon
Toraji, which killed 100 people and left 100 others unaccounted for -- presently
has a balance of NT$2 billion after paying out the Morakot-related remittances.</P>
      <P>The foundation is also offering flood victims a choice of either NT$10,000 per
person in relocation funds for up to five people per household or NT$3,000 per
person to rent a property for up to six months, up to three people per
household.</P>
      <P>As of Thursday, the official death toll of Typhoon Morakot was at 141, with 45
injured and 440 people remaining unaccounted for.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tainan politicians call for abolition of water channeling project</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Politicians in Tainan County launched a petition Friday calling for the
abandonment of a local water channelling project that has been blamed for the
terrible landslides that destroyed Siaolin village in Kaohsiung County during
Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Members of the Tainan County Council will encourage their constituents to sign
the petition before submitting it to the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>According to Wu Chien-pao, speaker of the council, residents in Tainan County
have always opposed the project, believing that the required dynamiting damages
the already fragile geological conditions and undermines the ecology of the
area.</P>
      <P>Wu warned that if the project continues, the Siaolin tragedy will likely be
repeated.</P>
      <P>The NT$21.2 billion project, which involves channeling water from Kaohsiung's
Laonong River to Tainan's  Zengwen Reservoir  and delivering the treated water
back to Kaohsiung, is intended to resolve water shortages in the Kaohsiung area.</P>
      <P>The Water Resources Agency, which carries out the project, has already been
fined NT$1.5 million for failing to obtain approval for part of the work.</P>
      <P>It is expected to be completed in 2012.</P>
      <P>Wu said that while the reservoir has seldom reached its full capacity in the
past, the situation has changed in recent years as global climate change is
increasing the frequency of extreme rainfall in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, he argued, channeling water from the Laonong River
will further increase the burden on the reservoir, and in the event of flood
releases, areas located downstream from the reservoir may experience severe
flooding.</P>

      <P>Houston Rockets center Yao Ming called for Chinese people around the world via a
televised message Thursday to contribute to post-Typhoon Morakot relief efforts
to help victims of the deadliest storm in Taiwan in 50 years.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a star-studded fundraiser telethon that took place in Beijing
Thursday to raise funds for Taiwanese storm victims, Yao expressed his deepest
sympathy to families who lost their loved ones or their homes.</P>
      <P>Yao, currently recovering from a foot injury at his U.S. home, said the damage
wreaked by Morakot was beyond imagination and prediction, but said that "we
people finally conquer each devastating disaster with empathy and compassion for
each other."</P>
      <P>At least 310 million Chinese yuan (US$45 million) were raised for the typhoon
victims in the four-hour telethon co-sponsored by Shanghai Dragon TV and leading
television stations in five provinces.</P>
      <P>Over 100 movie and athletic stars, as well as notable figures from China's
political, cultural, business and entertainment sectors, served as operators to
receive phone calls from donors.</P>
      <P>China's Red Cross Society and Beijing's intermediary body with Taiwan, the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, also pitched in with the
fundraiser, the largest of its kind for disaster victims on the other side of
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The fundraiser linked six locations in Shanghai,  Nanjing, Hangzhou, Changsha,
Shenzhen and Chengdu during the direct broadcast, which also broadcast the
donations committed by donors in the six cities.</P>
      <P>"The actual amount of donations is still being calculated, " said a Shanghai
Dragon TV spokesman.</P>
      <P>Among the groups that performed during the fundraiser was a Taiwanese aboriginal
group led by Legislator Kao Chin Su-mei. The group, wearing traditional tribal
garb, danced and sang songs, including "We are One Family."</P>
      <P>Speaking at the function, a visibly moved Kao Chin said that "we don't feel
lonely any longer with your care."</P>

      <P>The Chinese manufacturer of 1,000 prefabricated houses sent to Taiwan to house
victims of Typhoon Morakot reiterated Thursday that the units do not contain
dangerous levels of formaldehyde, a known carcinogenic.</P>
      <P>According to Beijing-based China News Agency, Di Da-hai, administrative manager
of Yahgee Modular House Co., Ltd. -- the company that produced the houses --
said that all the company's products undergo strict quality control and none of
the materials used for the prefabs contain excessive levels of formaldehyde.</P>
      <P>"We had the houses inspected by Taiwanese quality inspection authorities," Di
said.</P>
      <P>"They knew the houses were safe at first glance, because usually wooden
materials are the ones that have problems with formaldehyde, but we barely use
any wood in our product."</P>
      <P>Di also guaranteed  that all aspects of the manufacturing processes conformed to
standard operating procedures, rebutting speculation that workers had to rush to
prepare the 1,000 houses, thus lowering the production quality.</P>
      <P>However, some of the typhoon victims were initially doubtful as to the safety of
the prefabs, with residents of one township initially refusing to accept them,
although they later changed their minds.</P>
      <P>Environmental Protection Administration officials assured the residents that a
complete assessment of levels for all toxins, including formaldehyde, would be
made before anyone had to move into the units, with an initial report due the
following day.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou traveled by helicopter to two more mountainous townships
in Kaohsiung County Friday to visit residents displaced by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>The tour of Namasia and Taoyuan townships followed a similar one to Jiasian
township on Wednesday and another to Liouguei township on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Roads leading to the townships remained impassable up to Friday.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Ma is visiting the disaster areas
to extend his condolences to the victims and to gain a better understanding of
their needs.</P>
      <P>This face-to-face contact has allowed the victims to see the president's sincere
intention to help them, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The government's sluggish response to the disaster and its inefficient rescue
efforts have led to widespread public resentment and the most serious leadership
crisis the Ma administration has faced since it took office in May 2008.</P>
      <P>In an apology to the public Tuesday for his administration's shortcomings, Ma
promised to punish the responsible officials and give consideration to
reshuffling the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Both Minister of National Defense Chen Chao-min and Executive Yuan Secretary-
General Hsieh Hsiang-chuan verbally offered to resign Wednesday.</P>
      <P>On reports that former Deputy Taipei Mayor Ou Chin-teh has been tipped as
Hsieh's successor, Wang said all media reports regarding the upcoming Cabinet
reshuffle are based on speculation.</P>
      <P>President Ma has said that he and Premier Liu Chao-shiuan will not discuss the

      <P>Wang stressed that post-disaster rescue and reconstruction remain the
government's top priority at present and that all personnel decisions will be

    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Friday:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Re-drafting 2010 government budget bill</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has come up with a special budget bill of NT$100 billion for
relief and reconstruction in the aftermath of the flooding caused by Typhoon
Morakot.</P>
      <P>We can understand why the Executive Yuan will have recourse to a special  budget
bill to deal with the disaster,  because the government's general budget bill
has already been formulated and is ready for presentation in September to the
legislature for debate.</P>
      <P>However, the easy way out is not necessarily the best way, because the
government's general budget bill was worked out before the flooding and the
government's agenda is sure to be revised in light of this new situation.</P>
      <P>Therefore, we urge the Executive Yuan to overhaul its budget plan completely
rather than simply tack a special bill onto it.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Ma should heed people's voice against him</P>
      <P>Ma's popularity cannot be boosted by replacing the premier or reshuffling the
Cabinet, which are being made scapegoats to protect him.</P>
      <P>From the crisis triggered by Typhoon Morakot, Ma should take three lessons:</P>
      <P>1. He should respect the Legislative Yuan and lawmakers, rather</P>
      <P>than dictate to it; and lawmakers, especially those from the</P>
      <P>ruling Kuomintang,  should supervise  the Executive Yuan</P>
      <P>closely.</P>
      <P>2. He should learn to exchange views with the opposition and</P>
      <P>push policy only with the opposition's consent;</P>
      <P>3. He should give the people the final voice in laying out</P>
      <P>national policy, especially his pro-China policy.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Is Hseh Hsiang-chuan at fault, or the person who picked him as a</P>
      <P>Cabinet member?</P>
      <P>Hseh Hsiang-chuan, secretary-general of the Cabinet, caused an uproar when he
defended his dinning with his family at a restaurant while the island was being
pounded by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>He, as well as several other Cabinet members who have committed similar faux
pas, have become a millstone around the neck of Ma's administration.</P>
      <P>Is that their fault, or the fault of Ma who choose them for the posts ?</P>
      <P>Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>Debunking the myth of Ph.Ds value in Cabinet</P>
      <P>President Ma's Cabinet is known for its many doctorate degree holders.</P>
      <P>But the Cabinet is also known for its sluggish response to emergencies,
ineptness in executing policy, inability to strategize on how to achieve goals,
and ineffective communication with the people.</P>
      <P>Cabinet members who do not have the necessary savoir faire and shrewdness cannot
be expected to push the Cabinet's policies, far less cement the president's
leadership.</P>
      <P>This is because most of the Cabinet members are well-educated technocrats -- as
are the president and the premier -- and they are out of touch with the people.</P>
      <P>None of them have ever gone through the baptism of fire of an election.</P>
      <P>We therefore suggest that the president replace his present Cabinet with a cast
of veteran politicians, successful business executives and elected chiefs of
local government.</P>

      <P>The distance between Taiwan and Israel is being lessened by movies and
performances, with Raphael Gamzou, the representative of the Israel Economic and
Cultural Office in Taipei (ISECO) , meeting recently with locally renowned movie
director and producer Lee Khan to discuss filmmaking ideas.</P>
      <P>According to the ISECO, Gamzou and Lee talked about potential Taiwanese-Israeli
co-productions in their meeting, in which art-lover Gamzou invited Lee to meet
with Gila Almagor, an actress from Israel's Habimah National Theatre who is
dubbed the "first lady" of Israeli cinema.</P>
      <P>Almagor is scheduled to visit Taiwan in October to present an autobiographical
one-woman stage play and to share with local audiences several of her films at
the Performing Arts Festival organized by the Taipei National University of the
Arts.</P>
      <P>Gamzou and Lee were brought together not only because of their shared passion
for cinema but also for good wine, as the top Israeli representative to Taiwan
learnt that Lee had two bottles of Israeli wine he bought in Tel Aviv's Ben
Gurion Airport confiscated at Bangkok Airport due to the restrictions on
carrying liquids aboard aircraft.</P>
      <P>Lee, who is the brother of world renowned director Ang Lee, went to Israel in
May to attend the 2009 "Docaviv"  international documentary film festival, as it
featured a special tribute to Taiwan's documentary filmmaking.</P>
      <P>Invited by the film festival to show his production Starts -- a documentary
about young people pursuing their dreams of becoming singers -- Lee was among
six Taiwanese filmmakers and directors who screened their work at the festival.</P>
      <P>After returning from Israel, Lee wrote a letter to ISECO and recounted among
other things his disappointment regarding the wine incident. Gamzou therefore
decided to offer Lee two bottles of prestigious Israeli wine at their meeting.</P>

      <P>Growing numbers of residents in areas of southern Taiwan where floodwaters from
Typhoon Morakot have yet to fully recede are experiencing skin disease because
of their exposure to contaminated water.</P>
      <P>Many villages still remain blanketed by muddy water two weeks after the typhoon
battered Taiwan, and some residents have lingered in it for more than 10 hours a
day to clean up their homes.</P>
      <P>Experts say the water is full of germs from garbage and animal corpses and can
cause serious infections such as cellulitis if it comes into contact with the
wounds.</P>
      <P>Among the cases is a 70-year-old senior citizen in the coastal town of Linbian
township in Pingtung County, who has not been able to sleep because his arms
have itched constantly after being in the muddy water too long.</P>
      <P>Also, a woman's feet started to blister after wearing rain boots for ten days in
a row.  Both patients contracted dermatitis, contracted after wading too long in
dirty water.</P>
      <P>They are just two of numerous villagers who have consulted doctors in the area
for inflammatory rashes and itches,  and physicians have warned that anybody
with such symptoms should immediately get treatment so that the infections do
not fester.</P>
      <P>Also, young and elderly people who have more sensitive skin have been warned
about contracting the fungal skin infection tinea, which leads to itchiness and
pealing of the skin.</P>
      <P>Doctors have also cautioned that residents in flooded areas should be careful
about the water they drink.</P>
      <P>There are fears that some may draw on groundwater or springwater for drinking
water if their supply of potable water has been cut off because those sources
are contaminated and might cause stomach diseases.</P>
      <P>People who have also recently had their tap water restored should also be
careful because changes in water pipe pressure could "back draw" dirty water
into the household pipes.</P>
      <P>Excessive fluoride residue is another concern, experts say, because if it is
ingested, it may induce asthma or other respiratory ailments.</P>
      <P>Flood victims are highly encouraged to boil their tap water before using it.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that his administration's "no unification, no
independence, no use of force" approach has allowed Taiwan to simultaneously
maintain relations with both China and the United States.</P>
      <P>"This raises the possibility for the three sides to come to a win-win or win-
win-win solution," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Also, Ma said his administration's effort to improve cross-Taiwan Strait
relations over the past year has made security ties between Taiwan and the
United States less complicated.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while receiving Howard Berman, chairman of the
U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that he called Berman during transit stops in the United States last
year and this year and was impressed with the attention paid by Berman to the
implementation of the Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>Congressman Berman, along with his colleagues Eni F.H. Faleomavaega, Jack
Kingston, Ruben Hinojosa and Diane Watson, arrived in Taipei on Thursday for a
three-day visit. ENDITEM/ls</P>

      <P>The international community continues to express its condolences and offer
assistance for victims in the wake of Typhoon Morakot, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Mike Coleman, commander of the Salvation Army Taiwan Region, expressed the
Christian group's willingness  to participate in long-term reconstruction
efforts in storm-stricken areas in southern Taiwan, including Kaohsiung and
Pingtung counties, according to a MOFA press release.</P>
      <P>The London headquarters of the Salvation Army will also send three disaster
relief experts to assess what assistance it can provide, the press release
added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan continues to receive condolences for typhoon victims from
diplomatic allies and friendly countries around the world, including deep
sympathies expressed by Gambian President Yahya A.J.J. Jammeh, Idaho Governor
C.L."Butch" Otter, New York Governor David Paterson, and New York City Mayor
Michael R. Bloomberg.</P>
      <P>As of Aug. 20, at least 81 countries from around the world, the European Union,
and 21 international organizations had donated a total of NT$160 million in
relief aid to Taiwan, according to the latest figures released by the MOFA.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot lashed Taiwan two weeks ago, dumping massive amounts of rain on
the southern parts of the country. As of 1 p.m. Friday, the storm had killed at
least 153 people across Taiwan, with 45 people injured and 464 others
unaccounted for.</P>
      <P>Agricultural losses had surged to more than NT$13.4 billion (US$407 million).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Obesity found associated with three genetic loci in ethnic Chinese</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>After six years of research and genome comparisons, a Taiwanese research team
has found recently that three genetic loci, or positions on a chromosome, are
associated with severe obesity in ethnic Chinese.</P>
      <P>Severe obesity is associated  with novel single nucleotide polymorphisms of the
ESR1 and PPAR loci in Han Chinese.</P>
      <P>According to Pan Wen-harn, a researcher with the Institute of Biomedical
Sciences, Academia Sinica, severe obesity is associated with novel single
nucleotide  polymorphisms,  or DNA sequence variation, of the ESR1 and PPAR loci
in ethnic Chinese.</P>
      <P>Pan said many loci associated with obesity have been reported, with at least 18
genes having been replicated in five studies on obesity-related indicators and
that 14 additional genes having been associated with obesity in Asians.</P>
      <P>Pan and his associates examined these variants identified in medical periodicals
in an attempt to find out how many are associated with severe obesity in Han
Chinese and how they are combined to exert their effects.</P>
      <P>In collaboration with Lee Wei-jei, vice president of Min-Sheng General Hospital
in Taoyuan County, Pan and his group selected 304 severely obese patients with
body mass index (BMI) exceeding 39 from the hospital and 304 control subjects
with BMI smaller than 24 selected from Academia Sinica's Han Chinese Gene Data
Bank to participate in a two-stage association study.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, 220 additional severely obese patients (BMI 35) and 338 controls
(BMI 24) were recruited to replicate the results, Pan said.  All of the controls
were age-,  sex-,  education- and residence-matched.</P>
      <P>Finally, a pooled analysis was carried out based on all 514 cases and 606
controls with complete information, he added.</P>
      <P>In the first stage, in tests on 94 cases and 94 controls, the researchers  found
18 potentially  associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, Pan said.</P>
      <P>The significance  of three novel common  single nucleotide polymorphisms, one on
ESR1 and two on PPAR, were confirmed in the second stage and replicated further,
he said.</P>
      <P>A combination of the three genes was stronger than that of any individual gene
and resulted in a five-times greater risk of severe obesity than in those
without the genetic variations.</P>
      <P>"This information may contribute to the assessment of risk of severe obesity,"
he noted.</P>
      <P>A summary of the study was carried in the August 2009 issue of the American
Journal of Clinical Nutrition.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Independent lawmaker Kao Chin Su-mei from the indigenous Atayal tribe said
Friday that her acceptance of a disaster relief donation from China was not
illegal and that anyone who wants to could monitor her distribution of the
funds.</P>
      <P>Kao, who is leading a group of 80 representatives of Taiwan aboriginal tribes on
a visit to Beijing, accepted a donation of 20 million yuan (NT$96 million or
US$2.9 million) from China's Taiwan Affairs Office Wednesday to aid victims of
Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) has expressed reservations over
the donation, saying that because of the way it was made, it will be difficult
for the government to monitor its disbursement.</P>
      <P>"That is not the way to make a contribution for relief aid, " MAC Deputy
Chairman Liu Te-shun said Thursday, noting that the donation had not been routed
through the Ministry of the Interior or the Red Cross Society of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In response, Kao on Friday promised that the fund will be used transparently and
that proper records will be kept. The records will be made available the donor,
to Taiwan's semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation and to anyone else,
including the MAC, who wishes to see them, she said.</P>
      <P>"The MAC is also welcome to help disburse the funds, if it has the time," she
added.</P>
      <P>She argued that there is no law to prevent her from accepting the donation on
behalf of aboriginal typhoon victims.</P>
      <P>In adherence to the donor's wishes, the money will be used to help rehabilitate
families in minor aboriginal tribes in Taiwan who lost their homes in the
massive flooding and landslides triggered by the storm, she said.</P>
      <P>In addition to the funds from the Taiwan Affairs Office, donations of 1.5
million yuan each were received from China's state-run Sinosteel Corp. and a
Guangdong-based business enterprise for the purpose of helping aboriginal
students in the disaster areas return to school, the lawmaker said.</P>
      <P>She promised to hold a presentation ceremony Saturday in Sandimen township,
Pingtung County to inform the residents about the donation and solicit the
opinions of typhoon victims there on how the money should be used.</P>
      <P>Many of the mountain villages that suffered the worst flooding and landslides in
the typhoon were home to Taiwan's aboriginal people.</P>
      <P>The storm, which pummeled the island Aug. 7-9, has left hundreds of people dead
or missing and many others homeless.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's state-owned petroleum company, CPC Corp., announced Friday that it will
use a three-tiered pricing system for gasoline across the country to ease the
burden on areas hit hard by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Starting at midnight Friday, gasoline and diesel prices in certain remote
mountainous townships hardest-hit by Morakot-triggered flooding and landslides
will be lowered, while prices in eight affected city and counties will remain
unchanged, and prices in unaffected localities will be raised.</P>
      <P>It will mark the first time that CPC Corp. has ever adopted a multi-tiered
pricing system.</P>
      <P>"The strategy is part of the government's efforts to help reduce the financial
burden of typhoon victims, " said Vice Minister of Economic Affairs John Chen-
chung Deng at a news conference.</P>
      <P>Under the new system, gasoline prices at 31 CPC-run or franchised gas stations
in townships and villages that bore the brunt of the typhoon destruction will be
lowered by NT$2.1 (US$0.0636) per liter and prices for diesel will be cut by
NT$1.</P>
      <P>"The preferential prices will remain valid for two months, " CPC Vice President
Lin Mao-wen said. "After that, we will make a new decision depending on the
progress in reconstruction."</P>
      <P>Gasoline and diesel prices will remain unchanged in areas affected by the storm
-- Tainan City and Kaohsiung, Tainan, Chiayi, Yunlin, and Pingtung counties in
southern Taiwan, Nantou County in central Taiwan and Taitung County in eastern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In all other zones barely affected by the typhoon -- mainly northern Taiwan,
eastern Taiwan's Yilan and Hualien counties, and Chiayi and Kaohsiung cities in
southern Taiwan, gasoline and diesel prices will be raised by NT$0.4 and NT$0.5,
respectively.</P>
      <P>In those areas, the price per liter of 92, 95, and 98 octane gasoline will be
NT$28.7, NT$29.4 and NT$30.9 respectively.</P>
      <P>Given steady increases in crude oil prices in the international market, Lin
said, the company should have raised its gasoline and diesel prices by NT$0.8
and NT$0.9 per liter.</P>
      <P>But because of the significant surge in prices of vegetables, fruit, chicken
eggs, and pork driven by the widespread destruction of the typhoon, the company
decided to limit its price hike, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The company actually should have adjusted prices higher two weeks ago to reflect
rising crude oil costs according to a weekly pricing mechanism adopted last
year, the executive said, but held off on making any adjustments for two weeks
in the aftermath of the storm.</P>
      <P>As a freeze in fuel price adjustments mainly benefits those unaffected by the
typhoon rather than typhoon victims, Lin said, CPC decided to adjust its
gasoline and diesel prices to let market mechanisms function normally.</P>

      <P>The Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) pledged Friday to increase its aid for post-
typhoon recovery, saying that it will donate an additional NT$1 billion (US$30.4
million) to help rebuild schools in areas that were flooded in the storm.</P>
      <P>FPG Chairman Wang Wen-yuan said that after its donation of NT$300 million last
week, the FPG and its employees decided Friday to contribute another NT$1
billion for rehabilitation in southern Taiwan in the wake of the deadliest storm
in Taiwan in half a century.</P>
      <P>Wang said the FPG has its own construction and engineering teams that can
quickly rebuild schools and infrastructure systems.</P>
      <P>In 1999, after a 7.3 magnitude earthquake in Taiwan killed some 2,400 people and
left 100,000 others homeless, the conglomerate donated at least NT$900 million

    <HEADLINE>Alishan Highway expected to reopen in one month</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Alishan Highway, which was seriously damaged during Typhoon Morakot, is
expected to reopen in one month, the Directorate General of Highways (DGH) said
Friday.</P>
      <P>DGH officials noted that rainfall on the famous, scenic mountain that is popular
with domestic and international tourists reached nearly 3,000 mm when the
typhoon pummeled Taiwan from Aug. 7-9.</P>
      <P>As a result of the heavy rainfall, which weakened the soil, the 89-km highway
suffered serious erosion of its foundation and six sections of the highway were
broken or washed away by flood waters or mudslides.</P>
      <P>An official from DGH's Fifth Maintenance Office said that workers have now
repaired broken sections of the road up to the 59 km marker of the highway, and
estimated that the highway can reopen by Sept. 20.</P>
      <P>"But in the initial stage, only small cars will be allowed to travel on the
road. Tourist buses or trucks will have to wait for some time later," he said.</P>
      <P>That is because repairs up to that point will only enable the highway to have
one lane in certain parts, so it will not be able to accommodate large vehicles.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the hardest-hit 10 villages in Alishan township and Taiho village in
nearby Meishan township are still inaccessible to the outside world, two weeks
after Typhoon Morakot struck Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Most of the communities in Alishan have relied on the Alishan Highway to travel
to and from the mountain. Now that the mountain's major transportation route is
disrupted, they have become isolated islands and have had to rely on food and
supplies airlifted by military helicopters.</P>
      <P>The DGH, which is under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, has
estimated that restoration of the highway will cost as much as NT$1.75 billion.</P>
      <P>In related news, 500 packages of relief goods from South Korea were carried by
vehicles and workers to affected areas in Alishan.</P>
      <P>Each package contains daily necessities and food, which will be enough for a
four-member family to live on for four days.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Alishan National Scenic Area under the Tourism Bureau said that
with Alishan now out of reach, they are planning to set up a signboard of
Alishan at Wufeng Memorial Park, about 26 km into the highway, and another
scenic spot nearby -- Tijiou Bridge -- for tourists to take pictures.</P>
      <P>Starting Aug. 24, the Tourism Bureau will also offer dance performances by the
Tsou indigenous people at Wufeng Memorial Park so that the tourism-dependent
area can continue to attract tourists.</P>
      <P>Before the typhoon, there used to be four such performances by Tsou people at
the Alishan Railway Station, which had delighted of tourists, especially those
from mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Q3 electronic component output growth forecast at 20% Q-on-Q</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The output of Taiwan's electronic components sector is expected to reach NT$174
billion (US$5.3 billion) in the third quarter this year, 20 percent higher than
in Q2, the Industry and Technology Intelligence Services (ITIS) forecast Friday.</P>
      <P>The  technology  intelligence  provider,  operated  by  the quasi-official
Industrial Technology Research Institute, attributed the increase to surging
demand for Chinese "bandit" phones and for CULV (consumer ultra low voltage)
notebooks sold by major vendors such as Acer, Asustek, Lenovo Taiwan and Dell.</P>
      <P>Bandit  mobile phones,  gray market handsets  that closely approximate branded
phones but are sold in China for a fraction of the price, depend heavily on
components made in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Despite continuing quarter-on-quarter growth, the ITIS said the sector's
estimated output for 2009 of NT$601.1 billion would still be 16 percent less
than last year because of the global economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Local manufacturers will also suffer declines in net earnings this year, because
the economic slump has driven consumers toward cheaper low- and middle-end
electronic products, the organization said.</P>
      <P>The sector's output in Q2 grew 30 percent from Q1 to NT$145.5 billion, thanks to
increasing demand from China, but the figure was still 17 percent lower than in
the second quarter of 2008.</P>
      <P>Semiconductors posted the highest Q-on-Q growth of any component in the sector,
their output of NT$14 billion in Q2 43 percent higher than in the previous
quarter.</P>
      <P>The ITIS attributed the growth to the increasing popularity of light emitting
diodes (LED) in the production of backlighting for LCD panels.</P>
      <P>The ITIS predicted that LEDs will be used for the backlighting of at least 50
percent of notebooks produced this year for the first time ever, and said they
are also being aggressively marketed for use in LCD flat panel TVs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ITIS also reported that the Q3 output of printed circuit boards
is expected to grow by 36 percent from the second quarter to NT$75.7 billion,
while energy component output should rise 14 percent to NT$19.3 billion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan still needs U.S. to supply weapons: envoy</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan needs the United States to continue supplying it defensive weapons to
beef up its strength as it engages and negotiates with China, the country's top
representative to the United States said here Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a luncheon organized by the National Strategy Forum (NSF), a
Chicago-based non-partisan think tank, Jason Yuan said U.S. President Barack
Obama will follow the Taiwan policy adopted by his predecessor, George W. Bush,
of providing Taiwan with necessary assistance.</P>
      <P>According to the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), the United States is obligated  to
continue providing Taiwan with adequate military arsenals to safeguard its
national security.</P>
      <P>With President Ma Ying-jeou actively improving relations with China since taking
office last year, Yuan said the Taiwan Strait is no longer a potential
flashpoint, a development that is in the U.S. interest.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Taiwan still needs to reinforce its military muscle to strengthen
its position in negotiations with China, Yuan told an audience of nearly 50
elite members of political, economic and academic communities in the Chicago
area.</P>
      <P>Yuan said he is convinced that the United States will honor its commitment to
furnish Taiwan with needed military hardware and services in accordance with the
TRA, a U.S. law.</P>
      <P>With cross-strait ties warming up, Yuan said Taiwan has managed to attend this
year's World Health Assembly -- the decision-making arm of the World Health
Organization -- as an observer and sign the World Trade Organization-affiliated
Government Procurement Agreement to facilitate expansion of commercial exchanges
with other countries.</P>
      <P>Responding to questions raised by participants on the latest cross-strait
situation, Yuan said cross-strait negotiations are now focusing on topics
related to people's livelihood.</P>
      <P>As political systems on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait remain far different,
Yuan said, bilateral negotiations on political topics will be shelved for the
time being.</P>
      <P>Postponing solutions to those issues to the future is the view shared by a
majority of Taiwan people, Yuan said.</P>
      <P>He assured the audience that in its engagements with China, Taiwan will pursue a
Taipei-Washington-Beijing "win-win-win" scenario on the basis of common
interests.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the United States is Taiwan's most important ally, Yuan said both
countries share the same beliefs in a democratic and liberal political system.</P>
      <P>Yuan said his office has often invited friends from many U.S. social circles to
visit Taiwan to enhance their understanding of and support for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the devastation Taiwan suffered from Typhoon Morakot, Yuan said Taiwan
appreciated the assistance offered by the United States and some 70 other
countries. Such aid indicated Taiwan is not alone in the international
community, he added.</P>
      <P>The luncheon meeting was chaired by NSF President Richard Friedman. Among the
audience were Chicago Vice Mayor Bernard Stone and political science professors
from the University of Chicago, Loyola University and DePaul University.</P>

      <P>Service on the Taipei Muzha-Neihu Mass Transit (MRT) Line will be suspended from
10 p.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Monday for repairs on its electrical system, the
director of the city's Department of Transportation said Friday.</P>
      <P>The city government will provide free shuttle buses along the two sections of
the line, Lou Hsiao-hsien said, adding that the bus service will begin at 9 p.m.
Friday, and will run Saturday and Sunday from 5: 40 a.m. to midnight.</P>
      <P>The shuttle buses will operate between Taipei Nangang Exhibition Center Station
and Linguang Station along one section, and between Songshan Airport and Taipei
Zoo along the other section of the MRT line.</P>
      <P>With the approach of the 21st Summer Deaflympics in Taipei Sept. 5-15 and given
that there are no guarantees that the problematic line will not have to be
closed again, the city's Department of Transportation has preparations in place
to deal with any glitches on the line, Lou said.</P>
      <P>More shuttle buses will be put into service close to the Nanjing E. Road and
Zhongxiao stations, both of which are in the area of the Deaflympics main venue,
Lou said.</P>
      <P>Mayor Hau Lung-bin said on Thursday that there was no question of eventually
closing the Neihu section of the MRT Line, refuting rumors that the city
government intended to abandon the Bambarier Inc.-built Neihu Line to save the
Muzha section of the line.</P>
      <P>Hau said the Canadian company has vowed to fix the unstable system at all costs
and will conduct a final test of its repair work one week before the Deaflympics
open on Sept. 5.</P>
      <P>Hau reiterated that Bambarier has a responsibility to fulfill the terms of its
contract.</P>
      <P>The Neihu Line is a medium capacity system that runs on viaducts, except for the
section near Taipei Songshan Airport. It covers 14.8 km and connects with the 13
-year-old Matra-constructed Muzha Line, providing transport services to Taipei's
suburban areas of Neihu, Nangang and Muzha.</P>
      <P>The Neihu Line, however, has been plagued with problems since it began
commercial services July 4 and has since been shut down several times due to
system failures.</P>
      <P>The latest closure was on Thursday after there were a record three breakdowns
that day alone on the line.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou promised Friday that the government's reconstruction and
settlement measures targeting the Typhoon Morakot-affected people will be more
complete in the future.</P>
      <P>Ma made the promise during a visit to Namasia township in Kaohsiung County,
which has yet to be connected to the outside world after the main road leading
to the area was damaged by flooding and landslides triggered by the typhoon two
weeks ago.</P>
      <P>After arrived in the township by helicopter accompanied by other officials, Ma
told local residents, "we are late " and bowed in apology for nearly 10 seconds,
an acknowledgement of criticism that the government did not act quickly enough
in dealing with the disaster as it unfolded.</P>
      <P>Answering the local people's demands for help, Ma promised to fix the broken
roads and electricity systems and vowed that before that time, the military
would ensure that the village had enough food and drinking water.</P>
      <P>Ma was accompanied by Council of Indigenous Peoples Minister Chang Jen-hsiang
and Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing.</P>
      <P>Namasia was among the townships in southern Taiwan most affected by the
flooding, which was the worst in 50 years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>First batch of prefab houses in south to be ready in three weeks</HEADLINE>

      <P>The first lot of prefabricated houses to be built in Kaohsiung County for
victims of Typhoon Morakot will be completed in about three weeks, the Red Cross
Society of the Republic of China said Friday.</P>
      <P>The nonprofit organization has pledged to donate 400 prefab houses to the
county, and the first 100 will be erected in two locations -- next to a junior
high school and close to a temple.</P>
      <P>"Land clearing begins Friday and the houses are expected to be completed in
three weeks," a spokesman for the organization said.</P>
      <P>The first batch of prefab houses will have an area of about 15 pings (49.5
square meters), complete with a bathroom and a kitchen.</P>
      <P>The prefab houses built beside Shanlin Junior High School will mainly
accommodate disaster victims from Siaolin Village in Jiashien Township, while
those located near Tiantai Temple will house people from Taoyuan Township.</P>
      <P>Siaolin was buried by landslides early Aug. 9 after torrential rains from
Typhoon Morakot had pummeled Taiwan's southern mountains for over two days.
Shanlin lies well downriver from Siaolin and was less badly bruised by the
storm.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung County has also asked the head of Liouguei to find a site where 100
prefab houses can be put up to shelter flood victims from the township's Sinkai
and Sinfa villages.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Red Cross Society, the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi
Foundation and World Vision Taiwan will also donate prefab houses.</P>
      <P>The Tzu Chi Foundation will build 300 permanent housing units for displaced
flood victims. Those located near Shanlin Junior High School will accommodate
residents from Taoyuan and Namasia townships, while units in Wulipu, one of the
three major communities in Siaolin, will house survivors from the section of the
village that was destroyed.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung County officials said that the number of short-term and long-term
prefab houses to be built will depend on the needs of the flood victims.</P>
      <P>The officials are surveying flood victims in 20 temporary shelters to discern
their desire to move into the prefab houses.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Pingtung County Magistrate Tsao Chi-hung said Friday that the Tzu Chi
Foundation, the Red Cross Society and World Vision Taiwan will build mid-way
housing units to help displaced victims in aboriginal communities.</P>
      <P>The Tzu Chi Foundation will sponsor 586 units in the villages of Ali,  Chilu,
Haocha, Chiamu, Tawu and Kuchuan in the remote mountainous Wutai Township.</P>
      <P>Among them are some 177 households that originally lived in Haocha, including
127 that agreed to be relocated to a military barrack two years ago due to
landslides,</P>
      <P>World Vision Taiwan says it will sponsor the resettlement of 317 households in
three villages -- Taser, Talai and Derwen -- in two mountainous Pingtung County
townships.</P>
      <P>"A team of architects and villagers will work hand-in-hand to build the housing
units," Tsao said, adding that Taser village has a number of famous artists, and
the housing units will be given the flavor of the Paiwan indigenous peoples.</P>
      <P>The Red Cross Society will sponsor 660 households from two villages further
south in Laiyi township -- Laiyi and Yilin -- and Taiwu village in Taiwu
township. All victims have been temporarily sheltered in a military barrack.</P>
      <P>"The village people will be sheltered for the time being, and they can decide if
they want to stay on for a longer time, " Tsao said.</P>
      <P>The villagers will leave the mountainous region for the time being, but their
lands in the mountain still belong to them, and they can still return for
hunting to preserve the tradition of the indigenous people, Tsao said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, China will send technicians to Taiwan to help with the construction
of the prefab houses they have donated after local workers could not put
together the parts because of a lack of structural and assembly instructions,
and a confusion over technical terms in the information that China id provide.</P>
      <P>China also announced that it will send 200 more prefab houses to Taiwan Aug. 22,
which it said will meet international environmental standards, according to TV
reports.</P>
      <P>The first batch has proved controversial as some have charged the materials
contain excessive levels of formaldehyde, a known carcinogenic. The
Environmental Protection Administration is conducting tests on the quality of
air in the houses both when they are and are not ventilated.</P>
      <P>They expect the results to be available Aug. 23.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Legislature to meet next week to screen reconstruction bill</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng announced Friday that the Legislature
will convene a three-day extraordinary session starting Aug. 25 to deal with a
special bill on reconstruction in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Wang made the announcement  after chairing  a meeting  of legislative caucus
whips of the ruling and opposition parties to discuss whether to hold an
extraordinary session or advance the opening of the next formal legislative
session to screen the special reconstruction bill as early as possible.</P>
      <P>"The caucus whips reached a consensus quickly on convening an extraordinary
session next Tuesday through Thursday, " Wang said, adding that they are also
determined to complete the third reading of the bill before the end of the
session.</P>
      <P>The bill will authorize the Executive Yuan to raise NT$100 billion (US$3.03
billion) over three years to finance various post-disaster reconstruction
projects.</P>
      <P>"We all agree that the bill should be passed as soon as possible to speed up
rehabilitation work," Wang added.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator George Hsieh, who is also
a party whip, said more money may be needed for reconstruction as Morakot-
triggered flooding and landslides have left more than 600 people dead or
missing, and caused an estimated NT$13.4 billion in agricultural losses and
severe damage to a large number of roads and bridges in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If needed, Hsieh said, the Legislature will support an increase in the budget
for reconstruction projects.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-drafted bill is expected to clear the legislative floor smoothly as
the KMT controls an absolute majority in the Legislature.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Tsai Huang-liang
said the government should exempt those whose homes were buried by landslides or
washed away by flash floods from repaying outstanding loans on those homes or
interest payments on new homes to be built in the aftermath of the disaster.</P>
      <P>Such practices were implemented after a devastating magnitude-7.3 earthquake hit
Taiwan Sept. 21, 1999 and killed some 2,500 people while leaving tens of
thousands homeless, Tsai said.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that every post-flood reconstruction project
has a timetable, and he asked the public to help monitor their progress.</P>
      <P>"The timetable of every project will be put on record and its progress monitored
at least once a month. The results will be published for the scrutiny of the
public," said Ma, who expects the first progress report to be issued on Sept. 8.</P>
      <P>The pledge came after listening to a briefing by Premier Liu Chao-shiuan on
post-flood reconstruction in Cishan, Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The president noted there would be four stages -- rescue, shelter, resettlement
and reconstruction -- in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot, which pummeled Taiwan
with torrential rains Aug. 7-9, triggering the worst flooding in southern Taiwan
in half a century,</P>
      <P>"Currently, the rescue part has been largely completed, although we are still
conducting the rescue mission in a few places. Some isolated communities still
need outside support, but most areas have started resettlement and
reconstruction," Ma said.</P>
      <P>"More than 6,000 people are still in temporary shelters, and we hope that they
can return to normal life soon," he said.</P>
      <P>"The flooding was a tragic experience, " the president said, noting that over
100 people perished while more than 400 are missing and the agricultural and
property losses are too big to calculate.</P>
      <P>Before the meeting, Ma also led officials from the Cabinet and heads of the
seven counties in southern and southeastern Taiwan hard hit by the flood to
observe a minute of silence for those who perished in the flood and mudslides.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the head of the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD)
said that a major blueprint for post-flood construction will be completed in two
weeks and submitted to the Executive Yuan early next month.</P>
      <P>CEPD Chairman Chen Tain-jy said that the principle for initial reconstruction
includes "mitigation, " referring to reductions in populations  and production
activities,  although the level of reduction still needs careful assessment.</P>
      <P>After the major projects, then related government agencies will propose sub-
projects related to homelands, living and schooling, industrial production and
infrastructure.</P>

      <P>Those whose homes were hit by flooding during Typhoon Morakot will have their
water and electricity bills waived or reduced for specified periods of time
depending on the extent of damage their houses suffered.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs John Chen-chung Deng annoucned at a news
conference that state-owned Taiwan Power Co. and Taiwan Water Corp. will offer
exemptions or deductions to help ease the burden on typhoon victims.</P>
      <P>According to the plan, those whose houses were submerged in floodwaters higher
than 50 centimeters will be exempted from paying for up to 10 cubic meters of
water for at least the next two months.</P>
      <P>People who rebuild their houses at the original locations or reside in
government-provided prefabricated houses will be exempted from water payments
for two years if their water consumption falls below 20 cubic meters per month.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, those whose homes were waterlogged by floodwaters higher than 50
centimeters will not pay for electricity up to 110 kilowatt hours for at least
two months.</P>
      <P>They will not have to pay for electricity used under 330 kwh during the summer

live in prefabicated houses.</P>
      <P>Those whose houses were toppled and rendered uninhabitable will be exempted from
paying water or electricity fees for the most recent payment period.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot dumped more than 2500 mm of precipitation or a year's worth of
rains in southern Taiwan Aug. 7-9, swelling rivers that washed away bridges and
spurring landslides that buried entire villages.</P>
      <P>The storm, one of the worst natural disasters to batter Taiwan in half a
century, had left more than 600 people dead or missing as of Friday as the
military continued to dig up bodies buried deep under rocks and mud.</P>
      <P>The Central Emergency Operation Center has confirmed 153 deaths since the
typhoon hit as well as listed 464 people missing who were feared buried in
landslides that wiped out parts of villages nestle on mountains in southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the center, the exact number of people feared buried in landslides
that obliterated Kaohsiung County's Siaolin Village and Sinkai tribal community
in Liuguei township  are still being investigated by the county's disaster
response center.</P>
      <P>As of 1 p.m. Friday, agricultural and fishing losses were estimated at NT$13.45
billion, with Pingtung, Tainan, Kaohsiung and Chiayi counties reported worst
losses in that order.</P>
      <P>The government had opened 47 emergency placement centers to shelter 5,678
evacuated typhoon victims as of Friday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Several low-lying  villages in Pingtung  County were still submerged in 20

      <P>Taiwan's economy has gradually come out of recession and will return to the pre-
recession level of early last year by the fourth quarter at the earliest,
according to a Cabinet official in charge of economic planning.</P>
      <P>Minister Chen Tian-jy of the Council for Economic Planning and Development said
that the economy bottomed out earlier than expected and the risk of a down-up-
down pattern W-shaped recovery is slim.</P>
      <P>A forecast released Thursday by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting
and Statistics predicts Taiwan's economy to achieve an annual growth of 3.92
percent next year, with quarterly growth rates of 8.1 percent, 4.51 percent,
2.03 percent and 1.43 percent.</P>
      <P>Chen  said the nation's  economy  posting  for consecutive quarter-on-quarter
negative growth rates beginning in 2008 Q2 but began posting positive QoQ growth
rates in the second quarter of this year.</P>
      <P>In year-on-year terms, however, the economy contracted by 7.54 percent in the
second quarter after declining 10.13 percent in the first quarter.</P>
      <P>While many countries in the world have already begun to recover, Chen expects
that Taiwan will not return to positive YoY growth until the fourth quarter of
this year at the earliest.</P>
      <P>The statistics bureau reported earlier that Taiwan's economy is expected to
contract 4.40 percent, although the economy is expected to gain strength through
the rest of the year despite the major economic disruption caused by Typhoon
Morakot.</P>

      <P>Before the meeting, Ma also led officials from the Cabinet and heads of the
seven counties in southern and southeastern Taiwan hard hit by the flood to
observe a minute of silence for those who perished in the flood and mudslides.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the head of the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD)
said that a major blueprint for post-flood construction will be completed in two
weeks and submitted to the Executive Yuan early next month.</P>
      <P>CEPD Chairman Chen Tain-jy said that the principle for initial reconstruction
includes "mitigation, " referring to reductions in populations  and production
activities,  although the level of reduction still needs careful assessment.</P>
      <P>After the major projects, then related government agencies will propose sub-
projects related to homelands, living and schooling, industrial production and

      <P>Taiwan's economy has gradually come out of recession and will return to the pre-
recession level of early last year by the fourth quarter at the earliest,
according to a Cabinet official in charge of economic planning.</P>
      <P>Minister Chen Tian-jy of the Council for Economic Planning and Development said
that the economy bottomed out earlier than expected and the risk of a down-up-
down pattern W-shaped recovery is slim.</P>
      <P>A forecast released Thursday by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting
and Statistics predicts Taiwan's economy to achieve an annual growth of 3.92
percent next year, with quarterly growth rates of 8.1 percent, 4.51 percent,
2.03 percent and 1.43 percent.</P>
      <P>Chen  said the nation's  economy  posting  for consecutive quarter-on-quarter
negative growth rates beginning in 2008 Q2 but began posting positive QoQ growth
rates in the second quarter of this year.</P>
      <P>In year-on-year terms, however, the economy contracted by 7.54 percent in the
second quarter after declining 10.13 percent in the first quarter.</P>
      <P>While many countries in the world have already begun to recover, Chen expects
that Taiwan will not return to positive YoY growth until the fourth quarter of
this year at the earliest.</P>
      <P>The statistics bureau reported earlier that Taiwan's economy is expected to
contract 4.40 percent, although the economy is expected to gain strength through
the rest of the year despite the major economic disruption caused by Typhoon
Morakot.</P>

      <P>A group of approximately 100 veterans of the "823 Battle" returned to Kinmen
Saturday to take part in activities marking the 51st anniversary of artillery
shelling of the island group by China.</P>
      <P>The veterans toured various battle sites in Kinmen soon after their arrival and
are expected to attend a ceremony to be held Sunday in memory of their deceased
comrades.</P>
      <P>Lu Fang-yen, leader of an association for "823 Battle" veterans, said the
veterans came to Kinmen not to celebrate Taiwan's victory in the battle, but to
tell their lost comrades that they have not been forgotten.</P>
      <P>The battle left 439 Taiwanese soldiers dead or missing, with 1,870 others
injured.</P>
      <P>Lu reminded the public that the battle's victory was crucial to the prosperity
and progress of Taiwan and urged the government to provide proper benefits for
aging veterans.</P>
      <P>The conflict, known internationally as the Battle of the Taiwan Strait, began on
Aug. 23, 1958 with China launching heavy bombardment on Kinmen. More than 30,000
shells were fired by China in the first 85 minutes alone.</P>
      <P>The Chinese military did not suspend the bombardment until Oct. 6, when the
intensive action had continued for 44 days.</P>
      <P>On Oct. 20, however, China resumed the shelling. This second action ran through
Oct. 25 when Beijing announced it would shift to the strategy of bombing Kinmen
on odd-numbered days and resting on even-numbered days.</P>
      <P>When the battle finally came to an end on Jan. 7, 1959, the Chinese troops had
fired approximately 480,000 shells, but still failed to pound Kinmen into
submission.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou again apologized Saturday over the disaster caused by
Typhoon Morakot as he mourned people who perished in two of the hardest-hit
locations in Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>"The government is sorry to you. It failed to fulfill its responsibility of
protecting you, " Ma said while attending a Buddhist prayer service held in
Jiasian township to mourn residents who were killed by massive flooding and
landslides that hit Siaolin Village on Aug. 9.</P>
      <P>Around 400 people are believed buried alive when the entire village was
destroyed in minutes. The authorities are still verifying the exact number of
fatalities.</P>
      <P>Ma renewed his promise to help the surviving villagers rebuild their homes
during his term. The government will also help the affected families find
temporary residence and provide them with all necessary schooling and employment
assistance, he said.</P>
      <P>A memorial park or monument may be set up in the village for the deceased
depending on the desires of the bereaved families, he said.</P>
      <P>At the scene of the service, however, some angry villagers were protesting
against a water channelling project carried out by the government near Siaolin,
which they believed were the main cause of the landslides. They demanded that
Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, who also attended the ceremony, be replaced to assume
responsibility for the disaster.</P>
      <P>In response to the demand, Ma said although the project was not decided by his
administration, he will investigate the matter to find out if any human errors
were involved.</P>
      <P>Ma later went to Liouguei Township to take part in another Buddhist prayer
service held for those who were killed by mudslides in the indigenous community
of Xinkai.</P>
      <P>The president promised the surviving residents that related reconstruction work
will be completed within his term. He assumed office in May 2008 and will serve
a four-year term.</P>
      <P>Ma later headed to a shelter in Pingtung County's Sandimen Township to visit

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although the popularity of President Ma Ying-jeou and his administration have
dipped to their nadir in the wake of Typhoon Morakot, the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) is unsure how it can win support from people who are
dissatisfied with the performance of Ma while it weights whether to push for a
no-confidence vote, according to DPP members.</P>
      <P>Cheng Li-chiun, executive-director of the Taiwan Thinktank which is friendly to
the DPP, has called on the DPP lawmakers to oust Premier Liu Chao-shiuan by
initiating a vote of no-confidence in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>In light of the fact that Liu's approval rating has plunged to 20 percent
because of his administration's bungled rescue operation, Cheng claimed there is
a good chance that the premier will be forced to step down.</P>
      <P>According to the Constitution, a no-confidence vote could be held at the request
of one third of the lawmakers and approved by a majority of lawmakers.</P>
      <P>However, a premier who is voted out of his post may ask the president to
dismantle the legislature and call for a snap election before he leaves his post
within ten days after a no-confidence vote.</P>
      <P>Although the DPP controls only one third of the legislative seats, Cheng argued
that some lawmakers of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), also upset with Ma's
administration, may vote across party lines.</P>
      <P>However, Cheng's suggestion was greeted with a cold shoulder from the DPP, with
Tuan Yi-kang, a member of the party's Central Standing Committee, saying that
the DPP would not necessarily win the backing of KMT lawmakers who are
displeased with the KMT administration.</P>
      <P>"The Democratic Progressive Party's popularity among the people do not rise
because of the Kuomintang's losses," he said.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, an attempt to drive out the Cabinet as the country was busy with
post-disaster reconstruction could be considered a partisan political maneuver
and backfire against the DPP, Tuan said.</P>
      <P>"We have to do something to convert the Kuomintang's losses into our political
gains rather than sit on our hands waiting for the Kuomintang to drive its
supporters to us," Tuan said.</P>
      <P>Former DPP lawmaker Lin Cho-shui agreed with his views, saying it would be
better to initiate a motion for a no-confidence vote against the Cabinet when
the reconstruction work was well underway.</P>
      <P>"The no-confidence vote should be proposed as an examination of the premier's
job performance rather than a political struggle leveled against the
Kuomintang." he said.</P>
      <P>In addition to being dissatisfied with the central government officials,
Taiwan's public is also disappointed with local officials' handling of the
typhoon disaster. The worst-hit areas are controlled by officials who are
members of the DPP and in many of these areas residents were not evacuated,
leading to the high death toll.</P>

southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung City on Monday to investigate whether there were
negligence and mistakes in the administration's handling of the Typhoon Morakot
disaster that took several hundred lives, officials said Saturday.</P>

disease control, fund-raising, supply of relief supplements, and maintenance of
stable consumer prices, according to the Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>Huang and Yeh were assigned to conduct their inspection in Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>Yeh on Saturday invited people to submit petitions to him during his visit to
the Kaohsiung City Hall on Monday.</P>
      <P>Yeh promised to bring both their wishes and complaints back to the Control Yuan
for review.</P>
      <P>Huang revealed he and another colleague Chen Yung-hsiang have been assigned to
investigate the tragedy of Siaolin Village in the Jiasian township of Kaohsiung
County.</P>
      <P>The mountain village was buried in mud and debris washed down by a powerful
landslide caused by Morakot's heavy rainfall on Aug. 9, with nearly 400 of the
residents believed to have perished.</P>
      <P>Huang said he will try to determine how badly the aboriginal Pinpu tribal
village and its culture was damaged, and whether or not the surviving residents
have been properly resettled.</P>
      <P>Chen is tasked with finding out what doomed the village, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Villagers on Saturday complained to President Ma Ying-jeou, who was visiting the
village, that construction of a water irrigation channel weakened the soil in
the mountains and contributed to the mudslide. Ma said he will look into this
claim.</P>
      <P>The village was not evacuated despite its dangerous location in a narrow valley
amidst mountains.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The fisheries industry in southern Taiwan suffered unprecedented losses in
floods triggered by Typhoon Morakot this month and its grouper culture ponds,
which turned out nearly 60 percent of the world's production in terms of value,
have almost been completely wiped out, an industry source said Saturday.</P>
      <P>A post-Morakot investigation conducted by the Council of Agriculture (COA)
indicates that of the 1,500 hectares of grouper culture ponds in Taiwan, more
than 90 percent have been damaged.</P>
      <P>The COA reported that as of 3 p.m. Friday, Morakot's damage to the fishery
industry amounted to NT$4.14 billion. In Chiatung and Linbian alone, the losses
to the fish culture industry might reach NT$3 billion, according to the county
magistrate.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Chin-huei, president of the Aquaculture Development Association of the
R.O.C., lamented that it might take the grouper culture industry more than a
year to recover.</P>
      <P>Groupers were among the high value fish products which earned the nation
handsome foreign exchange every year. In 2008, the NT$3.88 billion (US$120
million) in Taiwan's grouper production value represented 58 percent of the
world's overall production value for the popular fish.</P>
      <P>As the coastal townships Chiatung and Linbian in Pingtung County are suffering
the heaviest toll in terms of fishery losses, Pingtung County Magistrate Tsao
Chi-Hung is looking into ways to help fish farmers there solve their financial
difficulties.</P>
      <P>"For those people affected by the typhoon who owe bank loans, we can adopt a
special measure to cancel their debt," Tsao told reporters.</P>

      <P>Major charity organizations in the country have begun efforts in cooperation
with the government to build permanent housing units for more than 6,000 people
in southern Taiwan who have been made homeless by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>According to the latest official statistics, there are 6,016 people still living
at 51 shelters after their homes were washed away or destroyed by flooding and
mudslides from Morakot.</P>
      <P>The typhoon was the worst typhoon in Taiwan in 50 years in terms of death toll,
which lashed the country with record rainfall from Aug. 7-9.</P>
      <P>Almost every leading charity group on the island have launched aid and rescue
efforts in the affected areas, including the Dharma Drum Mountain (DDM) Social
Welfare and Charity Foundation, the Red Cross Society, the Buddhist Compassion
Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, the Fo Guang Shan Monastery, and World Vision.</P>
      <P>On Saturday -- two weeks after severe flooding began on Aug. 8 -- the Dharma
Drum Mountain Foundation said that it has begun working with the Red Cross
Society to build permanent housing units in Wulipu area, of Jiasian Township,
Kaohsiung County, for 200 homeless households from nearby Siaolin Village.</P>
      <P>The village, which is also located in the township, was entirely leveled by
landslides during the typhoon on Aug. 9. Around 400 villagers are believed to
have been buried in the mudslides.</P>
      <P>Wulipu, located only 2 km away from Siaolin, is a good spot for the disaster
survivors to rebuild their lives because they could still return to their old
fruit gardens or farmland to make a living, the foundation said.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou promised Saturday during a religious mourning ceremony
for Siaolin's deceased that he will complete post-typhoon reconstruction work at
the village during his term in office, but he also said if the land in the
village is found not fit for human habitation, the government will suggest
relocation of the village.</P>
      <P>The president said this week his administration was conducting an assessment of
land in Taiwan to see which areas are too dangerous to live in, so as to prevent
deaths in future typhoons and other natural disasters.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan meanwhile announced a few days ago that it will provide
state-owned land for the charity organizations to construct permanent houses for
typhoon victims.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two dams in southern Taiwan were being closely monitored after the Central
Weather Bureau (CWB) released on Saturday a special report forecasting
mountainous areas on the island may expect heavy rain during the day due to the
influence of active cloud systems.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) said it will warn local
governments to evacuate residents living downstream from the dams once it
detects that downpour in the area has reached 40 mm in an hour.</P>
      <P>The dams are landslide dams,  which were created by past landslides. The earth
in the dams are not firm and heavy rainfall could caused the dams to collapse
and cause severe flooding.</P>
      <P>The barrier lakes are located in Baoshengshe  of Jingfong Township, Taitung
County and Majia Township in Kaohsiung County. The two counties were among the
areas worst affected by the Aug. 8 flooding triggered by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>As of 3 p.m. Saturday, a total of 18 landslide dams were recorded on the island.
They are scattered in the central and southern counties of Nantou, Chiayi,
Tainan, Kaohsiung, Pingtung and Taitung, according to the COA.</P>
      <P>Nine of the dammed lakes have collapsed while the other nine have been assessed
to pose no immediate threat to the safety of people living in the lower reaches,
the COA said.</P>
      <P>But it noted that it was closely watching the Baoshengshe and Majia landslide
dams even though there was no immediate risk of the dams collapsing.</P>
      <P>The CWB's weather report said the mountain areas in Pingtung were observed to
have had substantial rainfall Saturday afternoon. As of 5 p.m., the volume of
downpour in Laiyi of the county's Wanluan Township has accumulated to 50 mm, it
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'Underground ninja turtle' keeps Taiwan's effluence flowing</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/23/09  17:03:34</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA staff writer</P>
      <P>For 32 years, Shen An-pao has been creeping through the stinking underworld  of
Taiwan's  sewers,  taking care of the island's underground "sweat glands" for
over three decades, a job he has carried out with glamorous dignity and dogged
perseverance.</P>
      <P>Despite his advancing years -- Shen is nearly 70 -- he still spends a great deal
of his time crawling through fetid, dark sewers with his company to open up,
repair and maintain underground sewerage systems wherever his services are
needed.</P>
      <P>While city dwellers enjoy their cozy indoor life -- flushing their toilets,
taking showers and washing their dishes in comfort -- most of them probably
never give a thought that possibly under their very building, Shen and his crew
could be sweating underground fixing their sewer system under high temperatures
in darkness and stinking air.</P>
      <P>Shen has been living his "ninja turtle" life from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily for
the past 32 years without complaint, despite the fear and fatigue that his job
entails.</P>
      <P>Shen came to Taipei City from southern Taiwan with his wife at the age of 26
with a mere NT$800 in his pocket. After trying a variety of trades, including
driving a taxi, a tour bus and working on construction sites, he became a sewer
worker -- a trade he worked in as an employee for around a decade before
deciding to open his own company.</P>
      <P>Despite the physical demands and the potential dangers inherent in the job, Shen
still takes great pride in his career, saying that the underground piping
systems he has been taking care of transport domestic and industrial waste water
for treatment before being flushed into the sea.</P>
      <P>"We underground workers not only provide residents with a clean, sanitary
environment,  but also  contribute  to the country's environmental protection
efforts, " Shen said proudly in an interview with CNA soon after emerging from a
manhole wearing a safety helmet and with sweat covering his brow.</P>
      <P>One of the major challenges of his work is to build new underground pipelines
connected to sewer pipes from buildings and larger underground trunk mains that
transport the sewage to treatment facilities.</P>
      <P>In the past, he said, he and his co-workers built the sewers manually, without
the assistance of machinery.</P>
      <P>"The gravity and high pressure underground made us breathless and caused
tinnitus. Some of us even suffered from the bends or caisson disease
eventually," he recalled.</P>
      <P>Geological variables also affect the speed of building new connecting pipes, he
went on. In ground made up of ordinary gravel, he and his company can drill and
lay down new connecting pipes at a rate of 20-25 meters a day. However, upon
encountering bedrock, like that found in Xindian and other southern suburbs of
Taipei, that rate can fall to just 5 meters per day.</P>
      <P>Noting that the penetration rate of modern sewerage systems is one of the
indices of whether a country is advanced or not, Shen said that most
industrially  advanced nations in the world have a penetration rate over 80
percent.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, however, only the capital city of Taipei has a penetration rate of
over 80 percent, while many cities and counties in the rest of the country have
a penetration rate of less than 30 percent, he lamented.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan still has a long way to go," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Shen, who only has an elementary school education, said he has been running a
business that provides jobs for members of his extended family, including
younger brothers-in-law and his own children, as well as a number of unrelated
workers who have stuck by him for years.</P>
      <P>"Beating the global economic crunch, employees in my company have never been put
on unpaid leave," Shen added proudly.</P>

the servicemen up and wish them a speedy recovery.</P>
      <P>Two of the six -- an artilleryman and a marine, have been receiving treatment

floodwater.</P>

      <P>The government will open disused military barracks that remain in a relatively
good state of repair and are equipped with cooking facilities for the
resettlement of displaced survivors in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot, Premier
Liu Chao-shiuan said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks while accompanying President Ma Ying-jeou on a visit to six
soldiers injured during post-disaster rescue and relief operations who were
receiving treatment at the Kaohsiung Military General Hospital in southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Responding to media inquiries about the progress of post-typhoon rehabilitation,
Liu said the government is stepping up its efforts to resettle thousands of
displaced survivors who are still being accommodated at various emergency
placement centers.</P>
      <P>In addition to offering them condolence money and subsidies for day-to-day
living, Liu said the government has accelerated its efforts to help them find
new homes.</P>
      <P>As part of the drive, Liu went on, the Executive Yuan will ask the military to
open suitable disused army barracks for resettlement of those who have been
displaced by Morakot-triggered flooding and landslides.</P>
      <P>Several villages and townships in remote mountain areas of southern Kaohsiung,
Pingtung and Chiayi counties, as well as in central Taiwan's Nantou County and
the eastern county of Taitung, have borne the brunt of the devastation.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of residents in villages in those areas are believed to have been
buried alive when mudslides came crashing down on their homes after heavy rain
loosened the soil.</P>
      <P>The previous evening, Liu said he met with local government heads,  including
the chiefs of the hardest-hit  villages and townships, to discuss measures for
breaking bottlenecks in the rehabilitation work.</P>
      <P>"We all agreed that survivor resettlement should get underway at full  speed
and that multiple  measures  should  be employed simultaneously to meet the
diverse demands of the different victims," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Those whose homes were damaged can apply for housing subsidies from the
government after their homes have been examined, Liu said, adding that each
household will be entitled to an initial subsidy of NT$30,000.</P>
      <P>He also promised that examination of houses located in places accesible by
vehicle will be completed within three days.</P>
      <P>For survivors from villages that were obliterated entirely by landslides and
mudslides, such as Siaolin, located in the foothills of Alishan in a narrow
valley in Kaohsiung County, they can apply for compensation directly without the
need for prior examination, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Liu continued, local governments in disaster zones will set up joint
service stations in cooperation with private real estate or property brokerages
to provide displaced victims with updated information  about resettlement  and
counseling  on leasing or purchasing houses.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot, one of the worst natural disasters to batter Taiwan in half a
century, had left more than 600 people dead or missing as of Friday, as the
military continued to dig up bodies buried deep under rocks and mud.</P>
      <P>As of 1 p.m. that day, the Central Emergency Operation Center had confirmed 153
deaths since the typhoon hit, as well as listing 464 people missing and feared
buried under landslides.</P>

      <P>The Taipei city government sponsored a Vietnamese cultural festival Sunday to
honor the thousands of migrant workers and new immigrants from the Southeast
Asian country.</P>
      <P>The festival, offering a variety of entertainment, attracted more than 1,000
migrant workers to the Daan Forest Park in downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening ceremony, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin greeted the
participants with a "How are you" in Vietnamese, winning thunderous applause.</P>
      <P>He then expressed his condolences and sympathies for the victims of recent
typhoons in southern Taiwan and in northern Vietnam.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot dumped heavy rainfall in southern Taiwan Aug. 7-9 that triggered
serious flooding and landslides in remote mountain regions, leaving more than
600 people dead or missing and rendering thousands of others homeless.</P>
      <P>At almost the same period, northern Vietnam was also battered by a typhoon that
led to heavy human casualties and property losses.</P>
      <P>"Let's come together on this occasion to express our condolences and concern for
all the surviving victims and pray for their well-being," Hau said.</P>
      <P>The festival was part of a series of cultural activities being held by the
Taipei city government this year to promote cultural exchanges with Southeast
Asian countries, many of which are major sources of Taiwan's migrant workers and
new immigrants.</P>
      <P>"The festival is also designed to celebrate Vietnam's Sept. 2 National Day," Hua
said.</P>
      <P>According to Hau, Taiwan's capital city now has more than 1,300 Vietnamese
spouses of local citizens, as well as more than 5,000 workers and caregivers
from the Southeast Asian country.</P>
      <P>"We appreciate the contributions and dedication the Vietnamese workers and new
immigrants have made to our city and country, " Hau said, adding that all those
who have encountered problems in work and daily life are welcome to contact the
city's Bureau of Labor Affairs, where city officials will offer them counseling
services or other forms of assistance in resolving their issues.</P>
      <P>Three famous Vietnamese pop singers were invited to perform at the festival,
while various Vietnamese delicacies were also available for the participants,
along with a lucky draw which offered cash and other prizes.</P>
      <P>Nguyen Ba Cu, director of the Vietnamese Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei,
and many Taipei city officials attended the festival and offered their best
wishes for the migrant workers.</P>

      <P>As nearly 10,000 new cases of influenza A(H1N1) have been reported per week in
Taiwan over the past few weeks, the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) is
planning to allow for the expanded use of the antiviral drug Tamiflu, a DOH
official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>From Aug. 15, anyone testing positive for the virus using a preliminary testing
kit has been able to receive a course of Tamiflu treatment covered by National
Health Insurance, according to Kuo Hsu-sung, director-general of the Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) under the DOH.</P>
      <P>The testing kits are being paid for by the CDC, but there is a shortage of the
kits, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Those who test negative for A(H1N1) virus but who have been diagnosed with flu
and have experienced exacerbations or pneumonia can obtain a prescription for
Tamiflu but have to pay for the drug themselves, Kuo said, adding that these
cases will also soon be covered by insurance in the near future.</P>
      <P>Tamiflu should not be given to all patients with flu-like symptoms without the
initial screening test because that could cause drug misuse and abuse, while
about 30 percent of Tamiflu users experience harmful side effects that are worse
than the symptoms caused by the virus, Kuo noted.</P>
      <P>At present, hospitals and medical centers equipped with both Tamiflu and quick-
test kits are mostly larger facilities, requiring patients with flu-like
symptoms attending smaller hospitals or clinics to be referred to bigger
institutions to receive testing and treatment.</P>
      <P>The  preliminary  test  kits,  which  cost  NT$250-NT$300 (US$7.6-US$9.1) each,
are in short supply due to insufficient production and high production costs,
Kuo noted, adding that the DOH will coordinate biomedical companies to speed up
production of the test kits to meet an anticipated increase in demand during the
peak of the seasonal flu period in September.</P>

      <P>Some 800 participants, including veterans, local officials and military
servicemen, took part in a public memorial ceremony Sunday at the Martyr's
Shrine in Taiwushan on the outlying island of Kinmen to pay tribute to those who
died in the "823 Battle" of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>The ceremony, part of a series of activities marking the 51st anniversary of the
battle that involved mainly artillery shelling of the island group by China, was
presided over by Maj. Gen. Lu Hsiao-jung, commander of the Kinmen Defense
Command, and Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng.</P>
      <P>The dead were paid tribute with three ceremonial bows followed by the placing of
a wreath at the foot of a memorial dedicated to those who fell in the battle.</P>
      <P>A group of approximately 100 veterans of the battle headed by Lu Fang-yen,
leader of an association of battle veterans, also attended the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Lu Hsiao-jung  said the fruits of democracy,  freedom and prosperity that Taiwan
people enjoy should be attributed to those who gave their lives in defense of
the country.</P>
      <P>He added that despite improved relations between Taiwan and China, the people
should still uphold the spirit of adventure and sacrifice  possessed  by the
veterans,  enhance  their  combat preparedness and ensure national security.</P>
      <P>Lu Fang-yen for his part said Taiwan's victory in the battle laid a solid
foundation for accelerating the country's democratic and economic development
and that the veterans should be given credit for their contributions.</P>
      <P>He further said the government should attach more importance to the rights and
interests of the aging veterans and should provide them with proper benefits.</P>
      <P>The conflict began Aug. 23, 1958 when China launched a heavy bombardment on the
Kinmen archipelago, which has a total surface area of just 150 square

      <P>There have been no excess levels of the carcinogenic formaldehyde recorded in
prefabricated houses donated by China to house victims of Typhoon Morakot who
have been evacuated or who have lost their homes, the Cabinet-level
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Wang Pi,  director-general  of the National  Institute  of Environmental
Analysis under the EPA, said that indoor air samples collected from two Chinese
prefab houses that were erected in Pingtung County's Jiadong township Aug. 20
were tested and were found to contain no formaldehyde, dashing rumors that the
materials used to construct the dwellings contained high levels of the toxic
substance.</P>
      <P>Wang also confirmed that total volatile organic compounds (TVOC) concentrations
in indoor air samples collected from the two Chinese prefabs were under
allowable levels of less than 3ppm.</P>
      <P>Wang said the TVOC concentrations averaged 11.3 ppm in the air collected from
the two prefabs within the first hour of erection, although the concentrations
dropped to below 3 ppm in one day. "The TVOCs we found in our tests actually
pose no harm to humans," he added.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Yen-ju, director-general of the EPA Bureau of Air Quality Protection and
Noise Control, suggested nevertheless that anyone moving into the units should
keep doors and windows open for one day before moving in.</P>
      <P>Wang, Hsieh and other EPA specialists were called in by the Consumers Foundation
Aug. 20 to check the safety of the first batch of 100 prefabs that arrived in
Taiwan in the wake of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>The units arrived Aug. 18 and were transported directly to Jiadong township to
house people there affected by Typhoon Morakot, which triggered the worst
flooding in Taiwan in half a century.</P>
      <P>The death toll from the storm had risen to 160 as of Saturday, with another 490
remaining unaccounted for and 45 people reported injured.</P>
      <P>Jiadong was one of the areas in southern Taiwan hardest hit by the storm that

      <P>Assembly of 100 units of a second batch of prefabricated houses for temporary
resettlement of survivors of Typhoon Morakot got underway Sunday in Shanlin
township in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>The prefab houses were donated  by China's  quasi-official Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and were delivered to Kaohsiung
Harbor the previous day.</P>
      <P>Three Chinese technicians, who also arrived in Kaohsiung the previous day to
offer technical counseling and manpower training, visited the construction site
near Shanlin Junior High School to oversee the assembly of the units.</P>
      <P>They said their company has exported prefab houses to the Middle East and
Africa, all of which have been of satisfactory quality.</P>
      <P>The Chinese technicians  were accompanied by executives of Taiwan's Red Cross
Society, which is joining with several other charities, including World Vision
Taiwan, Dharma Drum Mountain and the Fo Guang Shan Monastery, to provide the
prefabs for displaced typhoon victims.</P>
      <P>Seven other Chinese technicians were also scheduled to arrive in Kaohsiung the
following day to assist in assembly of the houses.</P>
      <P>China has donated 1,000 prefab houses to help with Taiwan's post-disaster
resettlement drive. A total of 300 had arrived in Taiwan in two shipments as of
Saturday, with a third batch of 300 due to be delivered Monday.</P>
      <P>Yeh Shih-wen, director of the Construction and Planning Agency under the
Ministry of the Interior, said at a ceremony marking the start of assembly that
the project is part of efforts to deliver on President Ma Ying-jeou's promise to
build prefab houses within one month for displaced victims in several of the
hardest-hit disaster zones.</P>
      <P>During an inspection tour of the three hardest-hit villages and townships in
Kaohsiung County -- Siaolin, Liouguei and Taoyuan -- Aug.  19,  Ma promised to
complete  within a month temporary resettlement of residents who were still
being accommodated in emergency placement centers.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the current site, which is owned by the state-run Taiwan Sugar Co.,
will be able to accommodate 200 to 400 of the prefabs. "The first 100 will be
ready in two weeks," he added.</P>
      <P>Each 15-ping prefab house has two bed rooms, one living area and a bathroom.</P>
      <P>"The houses can be used for more than 10 years," Yeh said, adding that the new
100-house community will have an activity center, a parking lot and other public
facilities, with major roads 8 meters wide.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, the plot can also be used to accommodate permanent houses for
the survivors.</P>
      <P>Hsu Pao-yen, an executive of the Siaolin Village Self-Help Association, said 247
houses in the remote mountain village were buried when mudslides came crashing
down after torrential rain spawned by Morakot loosened the topsoil in the hills
above the village.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of Siaolin villagers are believed to have been buried alive in the
tragic landslides, and Hsu said the survivors have expressed preference to have
their new permanent houses built at the nearby village of Wulipu.</P>

      <P>China Mobile Chairman Wang Jianzhou arrived in Taiwan Aug. 21 for a nine-day
visit during which he will meet with HTC Chairwoman Cher Wang to discuss mobile
phone procurement  and cooperation  in development and research of China's TD-
SCDMA standards, according to the executive.</P>
      <P>The planned strategic alliance between the two companies is expected to help HTC
Corp.'s Ophone to compete with Apple's iPhone in China's vast market, despite a
lackluster performance by the company in China this year, the HTC executive
said.</P>
      <P>To attain its goal of gaining 85 million households using 3G services in three
years, China Mobile has been investing heavily in TD-SCDMA network expansion,
according to the executive, who said that during Wang's stay, he will also visit
a number of local companies, including Mediatek and Chunghwa Telecom, to seek
cooperation with them.</P>
      <P>China Mobile and HTC will develop at least one new type of mobile phone this
year and at least five types next year. The two companies will develop new
smartphones based on China Mobile's Open Mobile System (OMS), the executive
added.</P>
      <P>The day before his arrival, Wang Jianzhou said in Hong Kong that China Mobile
will launch its Ophone running on the OMS platform in collaboration with HTC,
Lenovo and Dell.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier vows to improve disaster prevention, relief mechanism</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will overview the existing public infrastructure specifications
with regard to natural disaster prevention out of safety concerns in the
aftermath of Typhoon Morakot, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Liu made the statement after presiding over a meeting of an ad hoc post-typhoon
reconstruction committee held at an army base in Cishan township in southern
Taiwan's Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>Liu said the country's natural disaster prevention and response mechanism, as
well as the present standard operating procedure (SOP) for evacuating people
from potentially dangerous areas in the event of an imminent natural disaster,
should also be overhauled and reinforced.</P>
      <P>Liu's pledge came after scathing criticism over the government's flawed post-
disaster rescue and relief operation after Morakot wreaked havoc in southern
Taiwan, particularly in several remote mountainous regions.</P>
      <P>Liu said he has directed the Construction and Planning Agency under the Ministry
of the Interior and the National Science and Technology Center for Disaster
Reduction to come up with improvement and reinforcement measures.</P>
      <P>"The central government  will also discuss relevant reform measures with local
governments before putting them into force, " Liu said.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou also said last week that the existing Disaster Prevention
and Response Act should be updated to establish criteria that would allow or a
compulsory evacuation to prevent a repeat of the loss of human life and
suffering caused by Typhoon Morakot that pummeled Taiwan Aug.7-9.</P>
      <P>Morakot, which dumped a staggering amount of rainfall in some parts of Taiwan,
had its deadliest impact on some remote villages that nestle mountains in
Pingtung and Kaohsiung counties. One such village, Siaolin, was obliterated when
Morakot-triggered torrential rains sent the faces of the nearby mountains
tumbling down on the village's 240 or so houses. Hundreds of Siaolin residents
are believed to have been buried alive in the killer landslides.</P>
      <P>On post-disaster rehabilitation, Liu said the government will enlist local
enterprises that have promised to donate funds to take part in various
reconstruction projects.</P>
      <P>Noting that reconstruction involves not only building prefab houses or permanent
houses but also employment, schooling, cultural preservation and other issues,
Liu said the government plans to mobilize local enterprises to sponsor various
hardest-hit villages.</P>
      <P>"The funds donated by business groups should be better used by mobilizing donor
companies to sponsor various hardest-hit villages or townships, " Liu said,
adding that the proposal has received warmer-than-expected response from the
business community.</P>
      <P>A large number of local enterprises have chipped in to help finance post-
disaster relief and rehabilitation projects.</P>
      <P>"We should not waste even a penny of those funds and the central and local
governments as well as public-interest groups and private corporations should
work hand-in-hand to accelerate rehabilitation on various fronts," Liu said.</P>
      <P>In the process, Liu went on, surviving victims certainly will have a say so that
all reconstruction projects will better meet their future demand.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry had interviewed 3,927 survivors from 1,388
households as of Aug.18 to explore their opinions about resettlement.</P>
      <P>Among  them,  553  households  want  government-arranged resettlements; 264 want
to rent houses on their own; 74 want to buy new houses; and 497 remain
undecided.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'Underground ninja turtle' keeps Taiwan's effluence flowing</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/23/09  17:03:34</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA staff writer</P>
      <P>For 32 years, Shen An-pao has been creeping through the stinking underworld  of
Taiwan's  sewers,  taking care of the island's underground "sweat glands" for
over three decades, a job he has carried out with glamorous dignity and dogged
perseverance.</P>
      <P>Despite his advancing years -- Shen is nearly 70 -- he still spends a great deal
of his time crawling through fetid, dark sewers with his company to open up,
repair and maintain underground sewerage systems wherever his services are
needed.</P>
      <P>While city dwellers enjoy their cozy indoor life -- flushing their toilets,
taking showers and washing their dishes in comfort -- most of them probably
never give a thought that possibly under their very building, Shen and his crew
could be sweating underground fixing their sewer system under high temperatures
in darkness and stinking air.</P>
      <P>Shen has been living his "ninja turtle" life from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily for
the past 32 years without complaint, despite the fear and fatigue that his job
entails.</P>
      <P>Shen came to Taipei City from southern Taiwan with his wife at the age of 26
with a mere NT$800 in his pocket. After trying a variety of trades, including
driving a taxi, a tour bus and working on construction sites, he became a sewer
worker -- a trade he worked in as an employee for around a decade before
deciding to open his own company.</P>
      <P>Despite the physical demands and the potential dangers inherent in the job, Shen
still takes great pride in his career, saying that the underground piping
systems he has been taking care of transport domestic and industrial waste water
for treatment before being flushed into the sea.</P>
      <P>"We underground workers not only provide residents with a clean, sanitary
environment,  but also  contribute  to the country's environmental protection
efforts, " Shen said proudly in an interview with CNA soon after emerging from a
manhole wearing a safety helmet and with sweat covering his brow.</P>
      <P>One of the major challenges of his work is to build new underground pipelines
connected to sewer pipes from buildings and larger underground trunk mains that
transport the sewage to treatment facilities.</P>
      <P>In the past, he said, he and his co-workers built the sewers manually, without
the assistance of machinery.</P>
      <P>"The gravity and high pressure underground made us breathless and caused
tinnitus. Some of us even suffered from the bends or caisson disease
eventually," he recalled.</P>
      <P>Geological variables also affect the speed of building new connecting pipes, he
went on. In ground made up of ordinary gravel, he and his company can drill and
lay down new connecting pipes at a rate of 20-25 meters a day. However, upon
encountering bedrock, like that found in Xindian and other southern suburbs of
Taipei, that rate can fall to just 5 meters per day.</P>
      <P>Noting that the penetration rate of modern sewerage systems is one of the
indices of whether a country is advanced or not, Shen said that most
industrially  advanced nations in the world have a penetration rate over 80
percent.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, however, only the capital city of Taipei has a penetration rate of
over 80 percent, while many cities and counties in the rest of the country have
a penetration rate of less than 30 percent, he lamented.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan still has a long way to go," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Shen, who only has an elementary school education, said he has been running a
business that provides jobs for members of his extended family, including
younger brothers-in-law and his own children, as well as a number of unrelated
workers who have stuck by him for years.</P>
      <P>"Beating the global economic crunch, employees in my company have never been put
on unpaid leave," Shen added proudly.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou traveled to the southern  county  of Kaohsiung  Sunday
to visit six soldiers hospitalized for injuries during rescue and relief work in
the wake of the devastation wrought by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Ma, accompanied by Premier Liu Chao-shiuan and Defense Minister Chen Chao-min,
visited the six soldiers at the Kaohsiung Armed Forces General Hospital to cheer
the servicemen up and wish them a speedy recovery.</P>
      <P>Two of the six -- an artilleryman and a marine, have been receiving treatment
for cellulitis in wounds they incurred during the post-typhoon relief actions.</P>
      <P>Another marine has a spinal fracture, while a private has bronchitis and two
others are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, according to hospital
authorities.</P>
      <P>In related news, Ma visited the eastern county of Taitung later that day to
visit once again the family of policeman Chiang Wen-hsiang, who remains
unaccounted for since Aug. 8, when he went missing while guiding villagers near
the Taimali river to evacuation points amid stormy weather and rising
floodwater.</P>
      <P>Chiang slipped and was washed away by turbulent floodwaters that inundated the
entire area in the country's worst flooding in half a century.</P>
      <P>Ma met with Chiang's mother, who has since been searching for her son every day
at the mouth of the Taimali river, and offered her his deepest sympathies and
condolences.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Military barracks to be opened for typhoon victim resettlement</HEADLINE>

      <P>The government will open disused military barracks that remain in a relatively
good state of repair and are equipped with cooking facilities for the
resettlement of displaced survivors in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot, Premier
Liu Chao-shiuan said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks while accompanying President Ma Ying-jeou on a visit to six
soldiers injured during post-disaster rescue and relief operations who were
receiving treatment at the Kaohsiung Military General Hospital in southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Responding to media inquiries about the progress of post-typhoon rehabilitation,
Liu said the government is stepping up its efforts to resettle thousands of
displaced survivors who are still being accommodated at various emergency
placement centers.</P>
      <P>In addition to offering them condolence money and subsidies for day-to-day
living, Liu said the government has accelerated its efforts to help them find
new homes.</P>
      <P>As part of the drive, Liu went on, the Executive Yuan will ask the military to
open suitable disused army barracks for resettlement of those who have been
displaced by Morakot-triggered flooding and landslides.</P>
      <P>Several villages and townships in remote mountain areas of southern Kaohsiung,
Pingtung and Chiayi counties, as well as in central Taiwan's Nantou County and
the eastern county of Taitung, have borne the brunt of the devastation.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of residents in villages in those areas are believed to have been
buried alive when mudslides came crashing down on their homes after heavy rain
loosened the soil.</P>
      <P>The previous evening, Liu said he met with local government heads,  including
the chiefs of the hardest-hit  villages and townships, to discuss measures for
breaking bottlenecks in the rehabilitation work.</P>
      <P>"We all agreed that survivor resettlement should get underway at full  speed
and that multiple  measures  should  be employed simultaneously to meet the
diverse demands of the different victims," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Those whose homes were damaged can apply for housing subsidies from the
government after their homes have been examined, Liu said, adding that each
household will be entitled to an initial subsidy of NT$30,000.</P>
      <P>He also promised that examination of houses located in places accesible by
vehicle will be completed within three days.</P>
      <P>For survivors from villages that were obliterated entirely by landslides and
mudslides, such as Siaolin, located in the foothills of Alishan in a narrow
valley in Kaohsiung County, they can apply for compensation directly without the
need for prior examination, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Liu continued, local governments in disaster zones will set up joint
service stations in cooperation with private real estate or property brokerages
to provide displaced victims with updated information  about resettlement  and
counseling  on leasing or purchasing houses.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot, one of the worst natural disasters to batter Taiwan in half a
century, had left more than 600 people dead or missing as of Friday, as the
military continued to dig up bodies buried deep under rocks and mud.</P>
      <P>As of 1 p.m. that day, the Central Emergency Operation Center had confirmed 153
deaths since the typhoon hit, as well as listing 464 people missing and feared
buried under landslides.</P>

      <P>The Taipei city government sponsored a Vietnamese cultural festival Sunday to
honor the thousands of migrant workers and new immigrants from the Southeast
Asian country.</P>
      <P>The festival, offering a variety of entertainment, attracted more than 1,000
migrant workers to the Daan Forest Park in downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening ceremony, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin greeted the
participants with a "How are you" in Vietnamese, winning thunderous applause.</P>
      <P>He then expressed his condolences and sympathies for the victims of recent
typhoons in southern Taiwan and in northern Vietnam.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot dumped heavy rainfall in southern Taiwan Aug. 7-9 that triggered
serious flooding and landslides in remote mountain regions, leaving more than
600 people dead or missing and rendering thousands of others homeless.</P>
      <P>At almost the same period, northern Vietnam was also battered by a typhoon that
led to heavy human casualties and property losses.</P>
      <P>"Let's come together on this occasion to express our condolences and concern for
all the surviving victims and pray for their well-being," Hau said.</P>
      <P>The festival was part of a series of cultural activities being held by the
Taipei city government this year to promote cultural exchanges with Southeast
Asian countries, many of which are major sources of Taiwan's migrant workers and
new immigrants.</P>
      <P>"The festival is also designed to celebrate Vietnam's Sept. 2 National Day," Hua
said.</P>
      <P>According to Hau, Taiwan's capital city now has more than 1,300 Vietnamese
spouses of local citizens, as well as more than 5,000 workers and caregivers
from the Southeast Asian country.</P>
      <P>"We appreciate the contributions and dedication the Vietnamese workers and new
immigrants have made to our city and country, " Hau said, adding that all those
who have encountered problems in work and daily life are welcome to contact the
city's Bureau of Labor Affairs, where city officials will offer them counseling
services or other forms of assistance in resolving their issues.</P>
      <P>Three famous Vietnamese pop singers were invited to perform at the festival,
while various Vietnamese delicacies were also available for the participants,
along with a lucky draw which offered cash and other prizes.</P>
      <P>Nguyen Ba Cu, director of the Vietnamese Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei,
and many Taipei city officials attended the festival and offered their best
wishes for the migrant workers.</P>

Health Insurance, according to Kuo Hsu-sung, director-general of the Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) under the DOH.</P>
      <P>The testing kits are being paid for by the CDC, but there is a shortage of the
kits, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Those who test negative for A(H1N1) virus but who have been diagnosed with flu
and have experienced exacerbations or pneumonia can obtain a prescription for
Tamiflu but have to pay for the drug themselves, Kuo said, adding that these
cases will also soon be covered by insurance in the near future.</P>
      <P>Tamiflu should not be given to all patients with flu-like symptoms without the
initial screening test because that could cause drug misuse and abuse, while
about 30 percent of Tamiflu users experience harmful side effects that are worse
than the symptoms caused by the virus, Kuo noted.</P>
      <P>At present, hospitals and medical centers equipped with both Tamiflu and quick-
test kits are mostly larger facilities, requiring patients with flu-like
symptoms attending smaller hospitals or clinics to be referred to bigger
institutions to receive testing and treatment.</P>
      <P>The  preliminary  test  kits,  which  cost  NT$250-NT$300 (US$7.6-US$9.1) each,
are in short supply due to insufficient production and high production costs,
Kuo noted, adding that the DOH will coordinate biomedical companies to speed up
production of the test kits to meet an anticipated increase in demand during the
peak of the seasonal flu period in September.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 800 participants, including veterans, local officials and military
servicemen, took part in a public memorial ceremony Sunday at the Martyr's
Shrine in Taiwushan on the outlying island of Kinmen to pay tribute to those who
died in the "823 Battle" of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>The ceremony, part of a series of activities marking the 51st anniversary of the
battle that involved mainly artillery shelling of the island group by China, was
presided over by Maj. Gen. Lu Hsiao-jung, commander of the Kinmen Defense
Command, and Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng.</P>
      <P>The dead were paid tribute with three ceremonial bows followed by the placing of
a wreath at the foot of a memorial dedicated to those who fell in the battle.</P>
      <P>A group of approximately 100 veterans of the battle headed by Lu Fang-yen,
leader of an association of battle veterans, also attended the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Lu Hsiao-jung  said the fruits of democracy,  freedom and prosperity that Taiwan
people enjoy should be attributed to those who gave their lives in defense of
the country.</P>
      <P>He added that despite improved relations between Taiwan and China, the people
should still uphold the spirit of adventure and sacrifice  possessed  by the
veterans,  enhance  their  combat preparedness and ensure national security.</P>
      <P>Lu Fang-yen for his part said Taiwan's victory in the battle laid a solid
foundation for accelerating the country's democratic and economic development
and that the veterans should be given credit for their contributions.</P>
      <P>He further said the government should attach more importance to the rights and
interests of the aging veterans and should provide them with proper benefits.</P>
      <P>The conflict began Aug. 23, 1958 when China launched a heavy bombardment on the
Kinmen archipelago, which has a total surface area of just 150 square
kilometers.</P>
      <P>Over the course of the next 44 days of non-stop barrages, Chinese troops fired
approximately 470,000 shells, but failed to pound Kinmen into submission.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>There have been no excess levels of the carcinogenic formaldehyde recorded in
prefabricated houses donated by China to house victims of Typhoon Morakot who
have been evacuated or who have lost their homes, the Cabinet-level
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Wang Pi,  director-general  of the National  Institute  of Environmental
Analysis under the EPA, said that indoor air samples collected from two Chinese
prefab houses that were erected in Pingtung County's Jiadong township Aug. 20
were tested and were found to contain no formaldehyde, dashing rumors that the
materials used to construct the dwellings contained high levels of the toxic
substance.</P>
      <P>Wang also confirmed that total volatile organic compounds (TVOC) concentrations
in indoor air samples collected from the two Chinese prefabs were under
allowable levels of less than 3ppm.</P>
      <P>Wang said the TVOC concentrations averaged 11.3 ppm in the air collected from
the two prefabs within the first hour of erection, although the concentrations
dropped to below 3 ppm in one day. "The TVOCs we found in our tests actually
pose no harm to humans," he added.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Yen-ju, director-general of the EPA Bureau of Air Quality Protection and
Noise Control, suggested nevertheless that anyone moving into the units should
keep doors and windows open for one day before moving in.</P>
      <P>Wang, Hsieh and other EPA specialists were called in by the Consumers Foundation
Aug. 20 to check the safety of the first batch of 100 prefabs that arrived in
Taiwan in the wake of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>The units arrived Aug. 18 and were transported directly to Jiadong township to
house people there affected by Typhoon Morakot, which triggered the worst
flooding in Taiwan in half a century.</P>
      <P>The death toll from the storm had risen to 160 as of Saturday, with another 490
remaining unaccounted for and 45 people reported injured.</P>
      <P>Jiadong was one of the areas in southern Taiwan hardest hit by the storm that
lashed Taiwan Aug. 7-9.</P>

      <P>Assembly of 100 units of a second batch of prefabricated houses for temporary
resettlement of survivors of Typhoon Morakot got underway Sunday in Shanlin
township in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>The prefab houses were donated  by China's  quasi-official Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and were delivered to Kaohsiung
Harbor the previous day.</P>
      <P>Three Chinese technicians, who also arrived in Kaohsiung the previous day to
offer technical counseling and manpower training, visited the construction site
near Shanlin Junior High School to oversee the assembly of the units.</P>
      <P>They said their company has exported prefab houses to the Middle East and
Africa, all of which have been of satisfactory quality.</P>
      <P>The Chinese technicians  were accompanied by executives of Taiwan's Red Cross
Society, which is joining with several other charities, including World Vision
Taiwan, Dharma Drum Mountain and the Fo Guang Shan Monastery, to provide the
prefabs for displaced typhoon victims.</P>
      <P>Seven other Chinese technicians were also scheduled to arrive in Kaohsiung the
following day to assist in assembly of the houses.</P>
      <P>China has donated 1,000 prefab houses to help with Taiwan's post-disaster
resettlement drive. A total of 300 had arrived in Taiwan in two shipments as of
Saturday, with a third batch of 300 due to be delivered Monday.</P>
      <P>Yeh Shih-wen, director of the Construction and Planning Agency under the
Ministry of the Interior, said at a ceremony marking the start of assembly that
the project is part of efforts to deliver on President Ma Ying-jeou's promise to
build prefab houses within one month for displaced victims in several of the
hardest-hit disaster zones.</P>
      <P>During an inspection tour of the three hardest-hit villages and townships in
Kaohsiung County -- Siaolin, Liouguei and Taoyuan -- Aug.  19,  Ma promised to
complete  within a month temporary resettlement of residents who were still
being accommodated in emergency placement centers.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the current site, which is owned by the state-run Taiwan Sugar Co.,
will be able to accommodate 200 to 400 of the prefabs. "The first 100 will be
ready in two weeks," he added.</P>
      <P>Each 15-ping prefab house has two bed rooms, one living area and a bathroom.</P>
      <P>"The houses can be used for more than 10 years," Yeh said, adding that the new
100-house community will have an activity center, a parking lot and other public
facilities, with major roads 8 meters wide.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, the plot can also be used to accommodate permanent houses for
the survivors.</P>
      <P>Hsu Pao-yen, an executive of the Siaolin Village Self-Help Association, said 247
houses in the remote mountain village were buried when mudslides came crashing
down after torrential rain spawned by Morakot loosened the topsoil in the hills
above the village.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of Siaolin villagers are believed to have been buried alive in the
tragic landslides, and Hsu said the survivors have expressed preference to have
their new permanent houses built at the nearby village of Wulipu.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's HTC Corp. will sign an agreement Monday with China Mobile, the world's
largest mobile carrier, for joint development of 3G phones in China, an HTC
executive said Sunday.</P>
      <P>China Mobile Chairman Wang Jianzhou arrived in Taiwan Aug. 21 for a nine-day
visit during which he will meet with HTC Chairwoman Cher Wang to discuss mobile
phone procurement  and cooperation  in development and research of China's TD-
SCDMA standards, according to the executive.</P>
      <P>The planned strategic alliance between the two companies is expected to help HTC
Corp.'s Ophone to compete with Apple's iPhone in China's vast market, despite a
lackluster performance by the company in China this year, the HTC executive
said.</P>
      <P>To attain its goal of gaining 85 million households using 3G services in three
years, China Mobile has been investing heavily in TD-SCDMA network expansion,
according to the executive, who said that during Wang's stay, he will also visit
a number of local companies, including Mediatek and Chunghwa Telecom, to seek
cooperation with them.</P>
      <P>China Mobile and HTC will develop at least one new type of mobile phone this
year and at least five types next year. The two companies will develop new
smartphones based on China Mobile's Open Mobile System (OMS), the executive
added.</P>
      <P>The day before his arrival, Wang Jianzhou said in Hong Kong that China Mobile
will launch its Ophone running on the OMS platform in collaboration with HTC,
Lenovo and Dell.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier vows to improve disaster prevention, relief mechanism</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will overview the existing public infrastructure specifications
with regard to natural disaster prevention out of safety concerns in the
aftermath of Typhoon Morakot, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Liu made the statement after presiding over a meeting of an ad hoc post-typhoon
reconstruction committee held at an army base in Cishan township in southern
Taiwan's Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>Liu said the country's natural disaster prevention and response mechanism, as
well as the present standard operating procedure (SOP) for evacuating people
from potentially dangerous areas in the event of an imminent natural disaster,
should also be overhauled and reinforced.</P>
      <P>Liu's pledge came after scathing criticism over the government's flawed post-
disaster rescue and relief operation after Morakot wreaked havoc in southern
Taiwan, particularly in several remote mountainous regions.</P>
      <P>Liu said he has directed the Construction and Planning Agency under the Ministry
of the Interior and the National Science and Technology Center for Disaster
Reduction to come up with improvement and reinforcement measures.</P>
      <P>"The central government  will also discuss relevant reform measures with local
governments before putting them into force, " Liu said.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou also said last week that the existing Disaster Prevention
and Response Act should be updated to establish criteria that would allow or a
compulsory evacuation to prevent a repeat of the loss of human life and
suffering caused by Typhoon Morakot that pummeled Taiwan Aug.7-9.</P>
      <P>Morakot, which dumped a staggering amount of rainfall in some parts of Taiwan,
had its deadliest impact on some remote villages that nestle mountains in
Pingtung and Kaohsiung counties. One such village, Siaolin, was obliterated when
Morakot-triggered torrential rains sent the faces of the nearby mountains
tumbling down on the village's 240 or so houses. Hundreds of Siaolin residents
are believed to have been buried alive in the killer landslides.</P>
      <P>On post-disaster rehabilitation, Liu said the government will enlist local
enterprises that have promised to donate funds to take part in various
reconstruction projects.</P>
      <P>Noting that reconstruction involves not only building prefab houses or permanent
houses but also employment, schooling, cultural preservation and other issues,
Liu said the government plans to mobilize local enterprises to sponsor various
hardest-hit villages.</P>
      <P>"The funds donated by business groups should be better used by mobilizing donor
companies to sponsor various hardest-hit villages or townships, " Liu said,
adding that the proposal has received warmer-than-expected response from the
business community.</P>
      <P>A large number of local enterprises have chipped in to help finance post-
disaster relief and rehabilitation projects.</P>
      <P>"We should not waste even a penny of those funds and the central and local
governments as well as public-interest groups and private corporations should
work hand-in-hand to accelerate rehabilitation on various fronts," Liu said.</P>
      <P>In the process, Liu went on, surviving victims certainly will have a say so that
all reconstruction projects will better meet their future demand.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry had interviewed 3,927 survivors from 1,388
households as of Aug.18 to explore their opinions about resettlement.</P>
      <P>Among  them,  553  households  want  government-arranged resettlements; 264 want
to rent houses on their own; 74 want to buy new houses; and 497 remain
undecided.</P>

      <P>Taipei City Mayor Hau Lung-bin on Monday urged principals of 150 elementary
schools in the city to help accommodate school children displaced by Typhoon
Morakot.</P>
      <P>At a meeting with the principals, Hau exhorted them to make greater efforts to
help school children from southern Taiwan, as many students would be unable to
attend school in their own areas when the new semester begins because they lost
their homes or were evacuated from their residences.</P>
      <P>Hau also asked the principals to help rebuild schools that were destroyed or
damaged by landslides and flooding during Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the meeting, Wu Ching-shan, director of the Taipei City
Education Department, detailed a plan for Taipei City schools to help those in
the disaster areas.</P>
      <P>Wu said public elementary schools in Taipei City will offer a total of 3,000
openings to students from the affected areas.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said, the Education Department last week offered aid to five
elementary schools and one junior high school in Linbian township in the
southernmost county of Pingtung,  one of the hardest-hit areas.</P>

      <P>The many villagers in southern Taiwan who developed fevers in the wake of
Typhoon Morakot were preliminarily cleared of suspicion of A(H1N1) infection,
health authorities said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin Ting, director-general of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), said that
more than 30 residents in the flood-affected Wandan township in Pingtung County,
southern Taiwan, have developed fevers since Aug. 17, and 13 of them have been
hospitalized.</P>
      <P>However, in all cases, the symptoms were different from those of swine flu, Lin
said, adding that the CDC is carrying out tests to determine the cause of the
patients' illness.</P>
      <P>Those who developed fevers and sore muscles might have contracted other types of
viruses while they were cleaning up their flooded homes in the wake of Typhoon
Morakot, CDC officials suggested.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, officials from the Pingtung County Public Health Bureau said Monday
that all the Wandan residents who had reported having fevers were lucid and in
stable condition.</P>
      <P>The health authorities called for Pingtung residents to wear waterproof gear,
including rubber boots, when cleaning up areas flooded by the storm.</P>
      <P>The authorities warned that in flood affected areas there is risk of outbreaks
of diseases such dysentery, exogenous febrile disease, cholera, amoebic
dysentery, leptospirosis and dengue fever.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Regional balance of power not affected by economic crisis: scholars</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24  (CNA)
08/24/09  15:09:11
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several scholars said Monday at an international economic forum in Taipei that
the economic downturn has had limited impact on security in the Asia Pacific
region, and that China will likely emerge as a "quasi-superpower" because of its
economic resilience and military clout.</P>
      <P>Park Kie-duck, a senior fellow and former president of the South Korea's Seiong
Institute, said that although the recession has only been in effect for about
one year and its impact might not be fully reflected in area of security, "there
is no tangible sign of change in status quo in the security sector."</P>
      <P>He and other prominent  figures from academia,  government institutions and the
private sector at home and abroad are discussing key issues surrounding "Asia-
Pacific Security in the Context of the Global Economic Crisis," at the 2009
Asia-Pacific Security Forum (APSF) Aug. 24-25.</P>
      <P>Park forecast that if there is reasonable recovery from the recession, the
United States will maintain its economic hegemony for the foreseeable future and
military supremacy for an even longer time.</P>
      <P>However, the South-Korean scholar said, China will emerge as a military and
economic "quasi-superpower" in the near future.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Japan, with relatively declining economic and military power
vis-a-vis China, will strive to maintain its alliance with the U.S. and to
modernize its warfare capabilities, Park said.</P>
      <P>Japan will also be more frequently and strongly tempted into going nuclear, he
added.</P>
      <P>Carolina Hernandez, president of the Philippines' Institute for Strategic and
Development Studies, expressed a similar view as Parks, saying that military
spending by most countries in the Asia-Pacific region may not be overly affected
by the global economic crisis, and therefore the balance of power in the region
is unlikely to change soon.</P>
      <P>For countries that have ongoing military modernization programs, those that have
ongoing  overseas  commitments  including  for peacekeeping operations, and
those preparing for an uncertain and fluid strategic environment to some extent
shaped by the crisis, a dramatic decrease in military spending may not be in the
cards, Hernandez said.</P>
      <P>It is also likely  that defense  assistance  and military cooperation activities
in the Asia Pacific will continue, according to Hernandez.</P>
      <P>Regional joint exercise between and among the U.S. and its allies and friends,
for example, are long-standing commitments not likely to decline in the
foreseeable future, especially due to the continuing uncertainty of the region's
strategic environment, she added.</P>
      <P>"In the case of China, it is safe to say that the resilience of its economy as
shown by its continuing growth will enable it to pursue its military
modernization  program beyond the present crisis," she said.</P>
      <P>Brad Glosserman, executive director of the U.S. think tank Center for Strategic
and International Studies' (CSIS) Pacific Forum, said that in Asia, the primary
beneficiary of the global economic crisis is China.</P>
      <P>According to Glosserman, if China is seen to weather the crisis better than the
U.S. or emerges from the downturn more quickly, this will impact on the U.S.'
leadership.</P>
      <P>However, that does not foretell a shift in the balance of power within the
region because such a development may spur other countries to cling more tightly
to the U.S.  to ensure its continuing engagement, though this will alter
regional dynamics, he added.</P>
      <P>"Of course, if the U.S. emerges from this crisis faster and stronger that any of
its 'competitors,' then its credibility will be re-enhanced," Glosserman said.</P>
      <P>Now in its 13th year, the forum is being held by Taiwan's Institute for National
Policy Research in collaboration with the Pacific Forum from the United States,
the Institute for Strategic and Development Studies and the Asia Center of
France.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Lite-On Technology Corp. will cooperate with China's Yingtan city
government to develop thin film solar power generating systems for agricultural
use, Lite-on General Manager Chuang Mei-chen said Monday.</P>
      <P>Although the details of the agreement between Lite-On and the Chinese city in
Jianxi Province have not been finalized, the Taiwanese company has already
agreed to provide five solar power generating systems for agricultural use to
China's Shangrao City, also in Jianxi Province, with each system generating 20
kilowatts for a total estimated price of 5 million yuan (US$732,055).</P>
      <P>Chuang noted that investing in thin film solar power generating systems will not
only boost the development of green energy but will also speed up modern hi-tech
agricultural development, which will in turn increase output value and increase
farmers' incomes.</P>
      <P>Lite-On products include computers, semiconductor components, projector power
supplies and phone camera modules.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese government is supporting the growth of the solar energy industry
and has designated solar energy as a strategic industry for the country. It
forecasts that the total value of the sector will hit $12.5 billion in 2015,
compared to $652 million in 2006, accounting for 7 percent of the global solar-
power generation equipment sector.</P>

      <P>The flagship indigenous performance group of the Tsou tribespeople has been
forced to relocate from the Alishan National Scenic Area in the Alishan mountain
to a flat area in Chiayi County, southern Taiwan, in the aftermath of Typhoon
Morakot.</P>
      <P>The Tsou aboriginal group performed its traditional dances and songs for a group
of tourists from mainland China Monday, in its first public appearance since its
members were forced to relocate.</P>
      <P>The group moved from Alishan earlier this month after the highway that leads to
the mountain was damaged during the typhoon, which wreaked havoc in southern
Taiwan Aug. 7-9.</P>
      <P>The group's first performance since then was staged at Wufeng Park in Chiayi
County's Jhongpu township.</P>
      <P>Most of the group members escaped down the mountain on foot after the highway
was deluged by floodwaters and damaged in some sections by landslides. Some of
the members remained on the mountain to repair their ravaged homes, said Yang
Chia-yu, a dancer whose home in Laichi Village was also destroyed by the storm.</P>
      <P>"We're down and out, feeling listless and depressed as our homes and performance
venue have all gone," Yang said.</P>
      <P>"However, we are strong enough to hang in there and wait for the highway to
reopen to traffic," she stressed.</P>
      <P>The National Alishan Scenic Area -- one of the attractions in Taiwan that
Chinese tourists consider as a "must see" -- has been cut off from the rest of
the island since the typhoon slammed into Taiwan. Sections of the Alishan
Highway have been destroyed and the Alishan Forest Railway permanently damaged.</P>
      <P>According to the Chiayi County government, the highway might be rebuilt and
reopened to public traffic by later September, but there is no timetable for the
repair of the railway.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) is taking steps to provide counseling for the
many traumatized children in areas that were devastated by Typhoon Morakot
earlier this month, Administrative Deputy Minister Lin Tsong-ming Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Lin,  some 277 volunteer  counselors  and 100 professionals are
already in place in these areas and they will be offering therapy to the
numerous children in emergency shelters who lost their relatives and their homes
in the storm.</P>
      <P>Many of these children have been displaying  symptoms  of post-disaster
psychological trauma that include insomnia, nightmares, poor appetite, and
inability to focus, he said.</P>
      <P>In an effort to address this problem, Lin said, the MOE has devised a two-phase
plan, under which individual one-on-one counseling will be provided in the first
stage. In the second phase, universities will "adopt" elementary and junior high
schools to offer professional therapy to affected children, he added.</P>
      <P>The plan calls for an integrated effort by the MOE, local governments and the
participating universities and will involve students, parents and teachers in
the disaster areas, he said.</P>
      <P>The aim is to provide a professional, systematic, localized and deeply caring
service, he added.</P>
      <P>The first stage of the plan will commence before school opens for the new
semester and will focus on soothing the victims and easing their stress.</P>
      <P>Currently there are 13 psychological therapy centers at the emergency shelters.
The counselors will identify children in need of therapy and send them to these
centers.</P>
      <P>In the second phase, which will begin after school opens and run until next
February, professional counselors will be placed at schools to help the children
recover in the long term and adapt to new lives.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH to expand anti-viral drug inventory to ward off H1N1 outbreak</HEADLINE>

08/24/09  18:11:57
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan ordered an increase in Taiwan's anti-viral drug supply
on Monday in anticipation of a possible outbreak of influenza A(H1N1), more
commonly known as swine flu, after schools reopen in September.</P>
      <P>His instruction came amid reports of the fourth and fifth A(H1N1) fatalities in
Taiwan the same day.</P>
      <P>Addressing a meeting of public health officials, Liu said the Department of
Health (DOH) should collaborate with educational authorities to avert the spread
of the disease as local schools will open soon after the summer break.</P>
      <P>For one thing, the premier said, procurement and inventory of anti-viral drugs,
such as Tamiflu and Relenza, should be expanded to meet the demand in case of an
emergency.</P>
      <P>As of Monday, Taiwan had confirmed five swine flu fatalities. CDC tallies also
show that the number of severe cases has exceeded 40, with some patients still
receiving treatment at hospitals.</P>
      <P>The number of cluster H1N1 infections is also believed to have hit 100, and more
than 10,000 Taiwanese people are coming down with the virus each week, according
to CDC estimates.</P>
      <P>Given the trend, the government's epidemic-fighting capability could be put to a
test after local schools reopen next week, health experts said.</P>
      <P>In response to the situation, the Cabinet's epidemic control advisory task force
convened an emergency meeting Sunday.</P>
      <P>It was decided during the meeting that the inventory of Tamiflu and Relenza will
be raised to an amount sufficient for use by 30 percent of Taiwan's total
population - or at least 7 million people - up from the original 18 percent.</P>
      <P>After consulting with epidemic specialists, the CDC has also decided to ease
regulations for anti-viral drug prescriptions. Under the relaxed rules,
physicians will be authorized to prescribe Tamiflu or Relenza to certain
categories of flu-like patients without the need of passing speedy screenings
for the patients.</P>
      <P>Those patients will include people with underlying chronic diseases, pregnant
women, children under the age of 5, people who have come into contact with
confirmed H1N1 patients, and those who have developed pneumonia or severe flu
symptoms.</P>
      <P>The DOH has also unveiled guidelines for school closures. The criteria
stipulates that if two or more students in the same class are confirmed to have

    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Monday:</P>
      <P>Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>Foreign ministry officials can't be bothered to socialize.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister and his deputy were both absent Saturday from a disaster
relief fundraiser organized by diplomats stationed in Taipei, for disaster
relief.</P>
      <P>It was really impolite of the host country not to have an official at the
ministerial level at the fundraising event, which was attended by diplomats,
including six ambassadors, from 13 of Taiwan's allies.</P>
      <P>We would like to know what could have been important enough to prevent the
foreign minister from attending the fundraiser.</P>
      <P>As a Cabinet reshuffle appears to be imminent, we are calling for the foreign
minister to be replaced.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Beware of China's beguiling offense</P>
      <P>We have to warn the public that while the country is preoccupied with relief
operations in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot, Beijing has gone on a beguiling
offense against Taiwan with generous offers of aid.</P>
      <P>The flooding caused by Morakot was the worst in five decades, and President Ma
Ying-jeou's administration is the most incompetent in five decades -- two
factors that combined to produce an unprecedented disaster.</P>
      <P>Out of sympathy, Taiwanese donated more than NT$6 billion to China after the
2008 Sichuan Earthquake, but China donations to Taiwan in the wake of Typhoon
Morakot are for its own political gains.</P>
      <P>Beijing's donation of 20 million yuan to Taiwan lawmaker Kao-chin Su-mei to help
provide relief to aboriginals in Taiwan was obviously intended to woo Taiwan's
aboriginals, in China's aim to take over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If China achieves its goals with regard to Taiwan, it will be a policial
disaster of a magnitude greater than the devastation caused by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Reconstruction should not be carried out in haste</P>
      <P>Taiwan's mountainous areas were hardest-hit in the flooding caused by Typhoon
Morakot.</P>
      <P>As the government gears up to begin post-diaster reconstruction, the guideline
should be to coexist with nature rather than to fight for land that has rivers
or mountains.</P>
      <P>There are many problems in Taiwan's mountains that make them prone to mudslides.
We cannot agree with the government's promise to rebuild on the original sites
those villages that were leveled by mudslides. This will only set the stage for
more tragedy.</P>
      <P>Past experience shows that it also won't work to relocate people in the disaster
areas to safer places far away. Usually, when these people cannot adapt to their
new lives they sneak back to their homes in the mountains.</P>
      <P>We therefore suggest the authorities rebuild these mountain villages at
carefully chosen safe sites near the original locations and improve the flood-
warning systems to alert people in mountainous areas to impending disasters.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Ma's administration has been criticised for its approach toward the disaster
caused by Typhoon Morakot and its attempts to deal with the flooding.</P>
      <P>Ma should take lessons from the ancient Chinese Emperor Yu in both these
respects.</P>
      <P>Legend has it that Yu was so immersed in his work trying to quell floodwater
that he did not enter his home, even though he passed by it three times.</P>
      <P>Members of Ma's Cabinet have been lambasted for having haircuts or dining out
with their families during the onslaught of Typhoon Morakot, which, while
perhaps not inexcusable behavior, is considered a sign of negligence by a public
that has scant confidence in officialdom.</P>
      <P>As for ways to control flooding, Emperor Yu used dredging instead of
containment, which is still the principle followed by experts today.</P>
      <P>Yu's achievement in controlling flooding earned him the throne and thereby sent
a message to his descendants that people, like water, can oust an unpopular
ruler or sweep a popular leader to power.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Fourth, fifth H1N1 fatalities reported in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's health authorities reported the country's fourth and fifth influenza
A(H1N1) fatalities Monday, bringing the number of local residents who died of
swine flu-related illnesses from three to five in just three days.</P>
      <P>The fifth fatality, a 44-year-old woman from Pingtung County, southern Taiwan,
had not traveled overseas in recent months, but came down with flu symptoms on
Aug. 17 and developed a fever of 39 degrees Celsius on Aug. 20, according to the
Centers for Disease Control (CDC).</P>
      <P>The woman, who was not a victim of flooding triggered by Typhoon Morakot, sought
treatment on Aug. 20 at a Pingtung hospital and later tested positive for the
A(H1N1) virus the next day.</P>
      <P>Although doctors administered Tamiflu to her immediately on Aug. 21, she died of
multiple organ failure early Monday -- less than a week after showing flu
symptoms.</P>
      <P>Confounded by the woman's abrupt death, CDC officials said they will probe
whether it was a result of the occurrence of resistance to Tamiflu or mutation
by the A(H1N1) virus.</P>
      <P>The fourth fatality was a 6-year-old boy who lived in the central Taiwanese
county of Changhua and had not traveled overseas in recent months. The boy
developed flu symptoms in mid-July and was treated as a normal flu patient until
July 27 when he developed a high fever and his condition deteriorated.</P>
      <P>He was referred to a medical center on July 27 where he tested positive for
influenza A(H1N1) strain. After one month of treatment, the boy died on Aug. 21,
soon after he was taken home by his parents.</P>
      <P>Both the fourth and fifth cases were considered victims of community infections
of A(H1N1) strain.</P>
      <P>As of Monday, Taiwan has reported five A(H1N1) fatalities, with one each in
Taipei City, Taitung County, Pingtung County, Kaohsiung City and Changhua
County.</P>
      <P>Five other severe cases were under close medical monitoring at intensive care
units, according to the CDC.</P>
      <P>The Central Epidemics Command will soon convene an emergency meeting aimed at
heightening Taiwan's epidemic-defensive capabilities, CDC officials said.</P>
      <P>In related news, Cheng Jen-hung, an ombudsman of the Control Yuan, Taiwan's top
watchdog, said Monday that he will not rule out the possibility of initiating an
investigation into the fifth A(H1NI) fatality case to learn why the patient died
even after having been treated with Tamiflu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China incapable of launching financial warfare against U.S.: scholars</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 24 (CNA)
08/24/09  19:39:57
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two renowned scholars said Monday in Taipei that it is impossible for China to
launch "financial warfare" against the United States despite China's apparent
greater resilience in the face of the global financial crisis from which the
U.S. is still struggling to recover.</P>
      <P>"I believe U.S. status depends on what it does, no what China does. China cannot
undermine U.S. power," said Brad Glosserman, executive director of the Hawaii-
based U.S. think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies' (CSIS)
Pacific Forum.</P>
      <P>"In the context of financial warfare, no, it won't happen; the two economies are
too much intertwined," he added.</P>
      <P>Glosserman and Carolina Hernandez, president of the Philippines' Institute for
Strategic and Development Studies, expressed their views on the issue of whether
China has the ability to take over the U.S. as the leader in the global economic
arena, at the 13th Asia-Pacific Security Forum (APSF) being held in Taipei from
Aug. 24-25.</P>
      <P>Their responses came as one of the forum panelists Park Kie-duck, a senior
fellow and former president of South Korea's Seiong Institute, argued at the
forum that China's economic strength poses potential threats to the U.S. in two
ways -- China could launch a kind of financial warfare against the U.S. with the
massive amount of U.S. debt owed to China, including treasury bonds and other
securities, and could also utilize its continually expanding, diversified, and
sophisticated military capabilities against U.S. interests.</P>
      <P>However, Glosserman argued that he does not believe China will become the
world's leader any time soon because China is a nation that is in the process of
building its power and status, and is not prepared to take on any responsibility
in the international system beyond protecting its national interests.</P>
      <P>Hernandez expressed similar views as Glosserman, saying that at present, the
size of the U.S. economy is much bigger than China's, which would make it
difficult for China to initiate financial warfare.</P>
      <P>"Let's think about those figures before we go crazy thinking about other things
that someone is on the way out and somebody else is on the way in," she said.</P>
      <P>Entering its 13th year, the APSF forum is being held from Aug. 24-25 in Taipei
by Taiwan's Institute for National Policy Research in collaboration with the
Pacific Forum from the United States, the Institute for Strategic and
Development Studies and the Asia Center from France.</P>
      <P>It features  prominent  figures  from academia,  government institutions and the
private sector who gather from home and abroad to discuss key issues surrounding
the topic: "Asia-Pacific Security in the Context of the Global Economic Crisis."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Unemployment rate hits all-time high</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug.24 (CNA)
08/24/09  20:07:17
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate has risen above 6 percent for the first time since
the government began compiling jobless statistics in 1978, reaching 6.07 percent
in July as new college graduates entered the labor market.</P>
      <P>The number of jobless also hit a record high of 663,000, up 16,000 from the
level recorded in June, according to figures released by the Cabinet-level
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The number of people affected  by unemployment  (including dependents of
unemployed individuals) was estimated at 1.399 million in July, up 10,000 from
the June level, also a historical high.</P>
      <P>July's jobless rate marked an increase of 0.13 percentage points from the
previous month and a 2.01 percent rise year-on-year.</P>
      <P>The seasonally adjusted jobless rate for July also broke the 6 percent threshold
at 6.01 percent, according to DGBAS statistics.</P>
      <P>Heavily dependent on exports, Taiwan's economy has been battered by the global
economic crisis as traditional export markets in the West have dramatically cut
purchases.</P>
      <P>That has led to continuing layoffs in the export sector as local factories
closed or cut production. The total of jobless increased 117,000 between
November 2008 and February 2009 and then stabilized for the next three months
before rising by 30,000 in the past two months.</P>
      <P>Liu Tien-si, a DGBAS deputy department chief, said the swelling jobless ranks
could be attributed in part to the entry of new university graduates into the
job market in July.</P>
      <P>There were 115,000 new job seekers in July, 7,000 more than in the same month a
year earlier.</P>
      <P>In the particularly sensitive 45-64 age bracket, employment levels continued to
stabilize. Some 34.34 million people in the age group were employed, up 8,000
from the June level. The 143,000 people unemployed in the age group was the same
as in June, the first time in 11 months that the total had not increased.</P>
      <P>The number of jobless in the age bracket, however, was also 67,000 higher than
in July 2008, a jobless growth rate of 87.86 percent that was the highest for
any age group.</P>
      <P>Noting that few middle-age and elderly people would quit their jobs voluntarily,
Liu said the swelling of jobless numbers among middle-aged and older workers
could have the greatest negative impact on families and society.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the further weakening of the job market, Executive Yuan spokesman
Su Jun-pin said the government will continue taking active steps to stem a
further rise in unemployment.</P>
      <P>"Given an influx of new school graduates into the job market, we have foreseen a
possible rise in the unemployment rate in July and August and have taken many
measures to alleviate the situation, " Su said.</P>
      <P>He added that the unemployment rate is expected to drop gradually beginning in
September.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has intensified epidemic prevention efforts as it confirmed on Monday the
fourth and fifth fatalities from swine flu, officially known as influenza A
(H1N1).</P>
      <P>As part of the reinforced campaign, more flu patients will be treated with the
anti-viral drug Tamiflu, with the government rather than the National Health
Insurance system footing the bill, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said.</P>
      <P>In response to a steady rise in the number of swine flu infections in Taiwan,
Liu said the government has decided to ease guidelines for Tamiflu
prescriptions, which will be paid for with aspecial government budget.</P>
      <P>Under the relaxed rules, physicians will be authorized to prescribe Tamiflu or
Relenza to certain categories of flu patients without the need for them to
undergo rapid screening tests for the H1N1 flu strain, which are not totally
reliable.</P>
      <P>Those patients will include people with underlying chronic diseases, pregnant
women, children under the age of 5, people who have come into contact with
confirmed H1N1 patients, and those who have developed pneumonia or severe flu
symptoms.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the premier said the procurement and inventory of anti-viral flu
drugs, such as Tamiflu and Relenza, should be expanded to meet the demand in
case of an emergency.</P>
      <P>After consulting with health specialists, Liu said the inventory of Tamiflu and
Relenza will be raised to an amount sufficient to treat 30 percent of Taiwan's
total population -- or at least 7 million people -- up from the original 18
percent.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is still recovering from the destruction wrought by Typhoon Morakot,
Liu said priority should be given to epidemic control measures at emergency
shelters for people left homeless by the natural disaster.</P>
      <P>As of Monday, more than 6,000 survivors remain in shelters in the hardest-hit
zones in southern Taiwan's Pingtung, Kaohsiung and Chiayi counties.</P>
      <P>Morakot dumped a staggering amount of rainfall in southern Taiwan Aug. 7-9,
swelling rivers that washed away bridges and triggering landslides that buried
entire remote mountainous villages.</P>
      <P>As many military servicemen and volunteers have been mobilized to help clean up
the huge amounts of mud and debris left by the storm, Liu said those working in
the disaster zones should wear facial masks to protect themselves from coming
down with the H1N1 virus.</P>
      <P>As of Monday, Taiwan had confirmed five swine flu fatalities. CDC tallies also
show that the number of severe cases has exceeded 40, with some patients still
receiving treatment at hospitals.</P>
      <P>The number of cluster H1N1 infections is also believed to have hit 100, and more
than 10,000 Taiwanese people are coming down with the virus each week, according
to CDC estimates.</P>

      <P>Two cluster infections of swine flu, officially known as influenza A(H1N1) ,
were confirmed Monday among soldiers who are helping with post-typhoon relief
and cleanup work in southern Taiwan's Pingtung County.</P>
      <P>Lin Ting, deputy director-general of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under
the Department of Health (DOH), said two samples collected from officers and
enlisted men working at Tatan Elementary School in Donggang township tested
positive for the H1N1 flu strain and a third one tested positive for the H3N2
seasonal flu strain.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, two samples collected from the Wanjin army barrack in Wandan township
both tested positive for the A(H1N1) virus.</P>
      <P>"It marks the first time that swine flu cluster infections have been confirmed
among military servicemen  taking part in the post-disaster rescue and cleanup
work," Lin said.</P>
      <P>As to reports that one naval serviceman and one army soldier working in the
disaster zone had succumbed to swine flu, Lin said the DOH had not received such
information and described the reports as sheer speculation.</P>
      <P>According to CDC estimates, Taiwan should have 60 to 70 cluster H1N1 infections.</P>
      <P>On Monday, Taiwan also confirmed its fourth and fifth H1N1 fatalities.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's HTC Corp. signed a memorandum with Beijing-based China Mobile Ltd., the
world's largest mobile carrier, Monday to jointly develop smartphones using the
TD-SCDMA 3G mobile telecommunication standard used in China.</P>
      <P>China Mobile Chairman Wang Jianzhou said during the signing ceremony that the
Chinese company will invest 47 million yuan (around NT$226 million, or US$6.88
million) in the cooperation project, under which HTC will design and produce
seven new types of third-generation handsets for China Mobile.</P>
      <P>TD-SCDMA (time division synchronous  code division multiple access) is one of
three global mobile telecommunication networks recognized by the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU) and was developed by China to avoid dependence on
Western technology.</P>
      <P>Wang said the construction of TD-SCDMA infrastructure  has expanded quickly in
China, already covering 38 Chinese cities and expected to reach 200 cities
around the country by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The network, however, has too few 3G handset offerings to support expansion,
Wang said, and China Mobile plans to boost its product variety through
subsidization and development cooperation.</P>
      <P>Wang is in Taiwan to promote the unproven TD-SCDMA standard among local
suppliers, and many leading manufacturers,  eyeing China Mobile's nearly 500
million subscribers in China, have sought to meet with him during his nine-day
visit.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, smartphones have a bright future in China's mobile phone
market, but their popularity has been stymied by their price. He believes sales
would grow rapidly if the price could be lowered to around 1000 yuan per
handset.</P>
      <P>Under the HTC-China Mobile cooperation venture, the two parties will also
jointly develop mobile phones using Google's Android operating system, called
the open mobile system (OMS).</P>
      <P>China Mobile has adopted the system for its "Ophone" handsets, regarded as a
competitor to Apple's iPhone in China.</P>
      <P>The cooperation venture between the two companies will also pull together HTC's
technology and R&amp;D capability with China Mobile's telecommunications and
data services network to help grab a bigger share of the vast Chinese market.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's export orders fell less in July on a year-on-year basis than at any
time in the past nine months, another indication that the global economic slump
may be easing.</P>
      <P>July export orders totaled US$28.614 billion, down 8.77 percent compared to the
same month a year earlier, according to statistics released Monday by the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>Export orders from China, including Hong Kong, totaled US$8.179 billion in July,
representing year-on-year growth of 2.22 percent -- the first positive growth in
orders from China since last July, the statistics showed.</P>
      <P>China was also the biggest source of export orders during the month, followed by
the United States, which ordered US$6.22 billion worth of goods from Taiwan in
July. That was 12.51 percent lower than in July 2008.</P>
      <P>Europe was the Taiwan's third largest market, placing orders of US$4.764
billion in July.  Although the total represented  a year-on-year drop of 14.56
percent, it was also the smallest drop in nine months, the MOEA said.</P>
      <P>MOEA Statistics  Department  Director General Huang Chi-shi expressed  optimism
over export orders in the third quarter, anticipating   they   will  increase
month-on-month   and quarter-on-quarter.</P>
      <P>July export orders for basic metal products decreased US$620 million or 25.1
percent from the same month the previous year, as international raw material
prices were higher in 2008, while orders for electronic goods fell 7.97 percent
YoY in July by US$600 million, the statistics showed.</P>
      <P>Despite the global economic slowdown, July exports of precision instruments and
electrical machinery grew compared to a year earlier by 17.39 percent and 12.74
percent, respectively, the MOEA said, attributing the growth to increasing
demand from China.</P>
      <P>Export orders totaled US$168.577 billion in the first seven months of the year,
a decline of 21.15 percent from the same period in 2008, according to the

      <P>A Chinese procurement mission placed US$3.87 billion worth of orders with
Taiwanese companies Monday, part of China's attempt to help stimulate Taiwan's
battered economy.</P>
      <P>The biggest share of the orders were placed by China's biggest personal computer
maker Lenovo Group, which intends to buy US$3.255 billion worth of information
technology products from Taiwan, including notebooks and electronic items.</P>
      <P>A joint contract signing ceremony took place at the Taipei International
Convention Center, with Wang Chih-kang, chairman of the Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA) and Tang Wei, vice president of the Association of
Economy and Trade Across the Taiwan Straits (AETATS), in attendance.</P>
      <P>The group, which arrived in Taiwan Aug. 19, was the third AETATS-organized
procurement mission to Taiwan so far this year. It is composed of some 100
senior executives representating 47 Chinese business groups.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the three AETATS-organized missions have so far placed a
total of US$5.476 billion worth of orders with local suppliers.</P>
      <P>The AETATS, an affiliate of China's Ministry of Commerce, is tasked with
promoting commercial exchanges and economic cooperation with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The three groups are expected to place an additional US$3.144 billion worth of
orders with Taiwanese manufacturers in the coming year, bringing the total to
US$8.62 billion, which Wang said would exceed the original target without being
more specific.</P>
      <P>He denied that the total order value of the three buying missions had "shrunk,"
as has been speculated.</P>
      <P>In addition to Lenovo Group's purchase of information technology products, other
goods purchased by the third AETATS group also included machinery,  chemical
engineering  equipment,  garments, footwear and auto parts and components  in

      <P>Because  of  China's  opposition,  Taiwan's  president  has traditionally been
barred from attending the annual APEC summit in person and has to instead name a
proxy to attend on his behalf. Presenting the invitation to the president is
considered a mere formality.</P>
      <P>As Ma has spared no efforts to improve relations with Beijing since he assumed
office in May 2008, China did not oppose his proposal of former Vice President
Lien Chan to attend last year's APEC summit in Peru on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Lien was the most senior former Taiwanese official to ever attend the APEC
summit as the president's special envoy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has always strived to upgrade its international profile, but the official
acknowledged that it may not be easy for Ma to name an envoy with a stature
higher than Lien to attend this year's APEC leadership meeting.</P>
      <P>Political observers said this year's Taiwan representative at the APEC summit
will be seen a litmus test for cross-strait relations and represent a chance to
strengthen Taiwan-U.S. relations at a high level.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's APEC envoy will have the opportunity to meet with U.S. President Barack
Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao, they noted.</P>
      <P>An official close to Ma, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that it was
still too early to talk about who will serve as Ma's proxy at the APEC summit.</P>
      <P>"Many elements should be factored in, including delicate changes in cross-strait
ties, the operation of the new Cabinet to be formed in early September and
ruling Kuomintang operations after Ma becomes party chairman in October, " the
official said.</P>
      <P>He added that there was no rush, as the government did not announce the
appointment of Lien as Ma's proxy until late October last year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH to expand anti-viral drug inventory to ward off H1N1 outbreak</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 24 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan ordered an increase in Taiwan's anti-viral drug supply
on Monday in anticipation of a possible outbreak of influenza A(H1N1), more
commonly known as swine flu, after schools reopen in September.</P>
      <P>His instruction came amid reports of the fourth and fifth A(H1N1) fatalities in
Taiwan the same day.</P>
      <P>Addressing a meeting of public health officials, Liu said the Department of
Health (DOH) should collaborate with educational authorities to avert the spread
of the disease as local schools will open soon after the summer break.</P>
      <P>For one thing, the premier said, procurement and inventory of anti-viral drugs,
such as Tamiflu and Relenza, should be expanded to meet the demand in case of an
emergency.</P>
      <P>As of Monday, Taiwan had confirmed five swine flu fatalities. CDC tallies also
show that the number of severe cases has exceeded 40, with some patients still
receiving treatment at hospitals.</P>
      <P>The number of cluster H1N1 infections is also believed to have hit 100, and more
than 10,000 Taiwanese people are coming down with the virus each week, according
to CDC estimates.</P>
      <P>Given the trend, the government's epidemic-fighting capability could be put to a
test after local schools reopen next week, health experts said.</P>
      <P>In response to the situation, the Cabinet's epidemic control advisory task force
convened an emergency meeting Sunday.</P>
      <P>It was decided during the meeting that the inventory of Tamiflu and Relenza will
be raised to an amount sufficient for use by 30 percent of Taiwan's total
population - or at least 7 million people - up from the original 18 percent.</P>
      <P>After consulting with epidemic specialists, the CDC has also decided to ease
regulations for anti-viral drug prescriptions. Under the relaxed rules,
physicians will be authorized to prescribe Tamiflu or Relenza to certain
categories of flu-like patients without the need of passing speedy screenings
for the patients.</P>
      <P>Those patients will include people with underlying chronic diseases, pregnant
women, children under the age of 5, people who have come into contact with
confirmed H1N1 patients, and those who have developed pneumonia or severe flu
symptoms.</P>
      <P>The DOH has also unveiled guidelines for school closures. The criteria
stipulates that if two or more students in the same class are confirmed to have
contracted the flu, either the seasonal or swine flu, the whole class should
stay home for five days.</P>
      <P>At present, some city and county governments have ordered elementary and
secondary schools as well as kindergartens and day care centers in their
districts to monitor the temperatures of their students every day.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Monday:</P>
      <P>Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>Foreign ministry officials can't be bothered to socialize.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister and his deputy were both absent Saturday from a disaster
relief fundraiser organized by diplomats stationed in Taipei, for disaster
relief.</P>
      <P>It was really impolite of the host country not to have an official at the
ministerial level at the fundraising event, which was attended by diplomats,
including six ambassadors, from 13 of Taiwan's allies.</P>
      <P>We would like to know what could have been important enough to prevent the
foreign minister from attending the fundraiser.</P>
      <P>As a Cabinet reshuffle appears to be imminent, we are calling for the foreign
minister to be replaced.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Beware of China's beguiling offense</P>
      <P>We have to warn the public that while the country is preoccupied with relief
operations in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot, Beijing has gone on a beguiling
offense against Taiwan with generous offers of aid.</P>
      <P>The flooding caused by Morakot was the worst in five decades, and President Ma
Ying-jeou's administration is the most incompetent in five decades -- two
factors that combined to produce an unprecedented disaster.</P>
      <P>Out of sympathy, Taiwanese donated more than NT$6 billion to China after the
2008 Sichuan Earthquake, but China donations to Taiwan in the wake of Typhoon
Morakot are for its own political gains.</P>
      <P>Beijing's donation of 20 million yuan to Taiwan lawmaker Kao-chin Su-mei to help
provide relief to aboriginals in Taiwan was obviously intended to woo Taiwan's
aboriginals, in China's aim to take over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If China achieves its goals with regard to Taiwan, it will be a policial
disaster of a magnitude greater than the devastation caused by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Reconstruction should not be carried out in haste</P>
      <P>Taiwan's mountainous areas were hardest-hit in the flooding caused by Typhoon
Morakot.</P>
      <P>As the government gears up to begin post-diaster reconstruction, the guideline
should be to coexist with nature rather than to fight for land that has rivers
or mountains.</P>
      <P>There are many problems in Taiwan's mountains that make them prone to mudslides.
We cannot agree with the government's promise to rebuild on the original sites
those villages that were leveled by mudslides. This will only set the stage for
more tragedy.</P>
      <P>Past experience shows that it also won't work to relocate people in the disaster
areas to safer places far away. Usually, when these people cannot adapt to their
new lives they sneak back to their homes in the mountains.</P>
      <P>We therefore suggest the authorities rebuild these mountain villages at
carefully chosen safe sites near the original locations and improve the flood-
warning systems to alert people in mountainous areas to impending disasters.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Ma's administration has been criticised for its approach toward the disaster
caused by Typhoon Morakot and its attempts to deal with the flooding.</P>
      <P>Ma should take lessons from the ancient Chinese Emperor Yu in both these
respects.</P>
      <P>Legend has it that Yu was so immersed in his work trying to quell floodwater
that he did not enter his home, even though he passed by it three times.</P>
      <P>Members of Ma's Cabinet have been lambasted for having haircuts or dining out
with their families during the onslaught of Typhoon Morakot, which, while
perhaps not inexcusable behavior, is considered a sign of negligence by a public
that has scant confidence in officialdom.</P>
      <P>As for ways to control flooding, Emperor Yu used dredging instead of
containment, which is still the principle followed by experts today.</P>
      <P>Yu's achievement in controlling flooding earned him the throne and thereby sent
a message to his descendants that people, like water, can oust an unpopular
ruler or sweep a popular leader to power.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Fourth, fifth H1N1 fatalities reported in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's health authorities reported the country's fourth and fifth influenza
A(H1N1) fatalities Monday, bringing the number of local residents who died of
swine flu-related illnesses from three to five in just three days.</P>
      <P>The fifth fatality, a 44-year-old woman from Pingtung County, southern Taiwan,
had not traveled overseas in recent months, but came down with flu symptoms on
Aug. 17 and developed a fever of 39 degrees Celsius on Aug. 20, according to the
Centers for Disease Control (CDC).</P>
      <P>The woman, who was not a victim of flooding triggered by Typhoon Morakot, sought
treatment on Aug. 20 at a Pingtung hospital and later tested positive for the
A(H1N1) virus the next day.</P>
      <P>Although doctors administered Tamiflu to her immediately on Aug. 21, she died of
multiple organ failure early Monday -- less than a week after showing flu
symptoms.</P>
      <P>Confounded by the woman's abrupt death, CDC officials said they will probe
whether it was a result of the occurrence of resistance to Tamiflu or mutation
by the A(H1N1) virus.</P>
      <P>The fourth fatality was a 6-year-old boy who lived in the central Taiwanese
county of Changhua and had not traveled overseas in recent months. The boy
developed flu symptoms in mid-July and was treated as a normal flu patient until
July 27 when he developed a high fever and his condition deteriorated.</P>
      <P>He was referred to a medical center on July 27 where he tested positive for
influenza A(H1N1) strain. After one month of treatment, the boy died on Aug. 21,
soon after he was taken home by his parents.</P>
      <P>Both the fourth and fifth cases were considered victims of community infections
of A(H1N1) strain.</P>
      <P>As of Monday, Taiwan has reported five A(H1N1) fatalities, with one each in
Taipei City, Taitung County, Pingtung County, Kaohsiung City and Changhua
County.</P>
      <P>Five other severe cases were under close medical monitoring at intensive care
units, according to the CDC.</P>
      <P>The Central Epidemics Command will soon convene an emergency meeting aimed at
heightening Taiwan's epidemic-defensive capabilities, CDC officials said.</P>
      <P>In related news, Cheng Jen-hung, an ombudsman of the Control Yuan, Taiwan's top
watchdog, said Monday that he will not rule out the possibility of initiating an
investigation into the fifth A(H1NI) fatality case to learn why the patient died
even after having been treated with Tamiflu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China incapable of launching financial warfare against U.S.: scholars</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 24 (CNA)
08/24/09  19:39:57
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two renowned scholars said Monday in Taipei that it is impossible for China to
launch "financial warfare" against the United States despite China's apparent
greater resilience in the face of the global financial crisis from which the
U.S. is still struggling to recover.</P>
      <P>"I believe U.S. status depends on what it does, no what China does. China cannot
undermine U.S. power," said Brad Glosserman, executive director of the Hawaii-
based U.S. think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies' (CSIS)
Pacific Forum.</P>
      <P>"In the context of financial warfare, no, it won't happen; the two economies are
too much intertwined," he added.</P>
      <P>Glosserman and Carolina Hernandez, president of the Philippines' Institute for
Strategic and Development Studies, expressed their views on the issue of whether
China has the ability to take over the U.S. as the leader in the global economic
arena, at the 13th Asia-Pacific Security Forum (APSF) being held in Taipei from
Aug. 24-25.</P>
      <P>Their responses came as one of the forum panelists Park Kie-duck, a senior
fellow and former president of South Korea's Seiong Institute, argued at the
forum that China's economic strength poses potential threats to the U.S. in two
ways -- China could launch a kind of financial warfare against the U.S. with the
massive amount of U.S. debt owed to China, including treasury bonds and other
securities, and could also utilize its continually expanding, diversified, and
sophisticated military capabilities against U.S. interests.</P>
      <P>However, Glosserman argued that he does not believe China will become the
world's leader any time soon because China is a nation that is in the process of
building its power and status, and is not prepared to take on any responsibility
in the international system beyond protecting its national interests.</P>
      <P>Hernandez expressed similar views as Glosserman, saying that at present, the
size of the U.S. economy is much bigger than China's, which would make it
difficult for China to initiate financial warfare.</P>
      <P>"Let's think about those figures before we go crazy thinking about other things
that someone is on the way out and somebody else is on the way in," she said.</P>
      <P>Entering its 13th year, the APSF forum is being held from Aug. 24-25 in Taipei
by Taiwan's Institute for National Policy Research in collaboration with the
Pacific Forum from the United States, the Institute for Strategic and
Development Studies and the Asia Center from France.</P>
      <P>It features  prominent  figures  from academia,  government institutions and the
private sector who gather from home and abroad to discuss key issues surrounding
the topic: "Asia-Pacific Security in the Context of the Global Economic Crisis."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Unemployment rate hits all-time high</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug.24 (CNA)
08/24/09  20:07:17
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate has risen above 6 percent for the first time since
the government began compiling jobless statistics in 1978, reaching 6.07 percent
in July as new college graduates entered the labor market.</P>
      <P>The number of jobless also hit a record high of 663,000, up 16,000 from the
level recorded in June, according to figures released by the Cabinet-level
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The number of people affected  by unemployment  (including dependents of
unemployed individuals) was estimated at 1.399 million in July, up 10,000 from
the June level, also a historical high.</P>
      <P>July's jobless rate marked an increase of 0.13 percentage points from the
previous month and a 2.01 percent rise year-on-year.</P>
      <P>The seasonally adjusted jobless rate for July also broke the 6 percent threshold
at 6.01 percent, according to DGBAS statistics.</P>
      <P>Heavily dependent on exports, Taiwan's economy has been battered by the global
economic crisis as traditional export markets in the West have dramatically cut
purchases.</P>
      <P>That has led to continuing layoffs in the export sector as local factories
closed or cut production. The total of jobless increased 117,000 between
November 2008 and February 2009 and then stabilized for the next three months
before rising by 30,000 in the past two months.</P>
      <P>Liu Tien-si, a DGBAS deputy department chief, said the swelling jobless ranks
could be attributed in part to the entry of new university graduates into the
job market in July.</P>
      <P>There were 115,000 new job seekers in July, 7,000 more than in the same month a
year earlier.</P>
      <P>In the particularly sensitive 45-64 age bracket, employment levels continued to
stabilize. Some 34.34 million people in the age group were employed, up 8,000
from the June level. The 143,000 people unemployed in the age group was the same
as in June, the first time in 11 months that the total had not increased.</P>
      <P>The number of jobless in the age bracket, however, was also 67,000 higher than
in July 2008, a jobless growth rate of 87.86 percent that was the highest for
any age group.</P>
      <P>Noting that few middle-age and elderly people would quit their jobs voluntarily,
Liu said the swelling of jobless numbers among middle-aged and older workers
could have the greatest negative impact on families and society.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the further weakening of the job market, Executive Yuan spokesman
Su Jun-pin said the government will continue taking active steps to stem a
further rise in unemployment.</P>
      <P>"Given an influx of new school graduates into the job market, we have foreseen a
possible rise in the unemployment rate in July and August and have taken many
measures to alleviate the situation, " Su said.</P>
      <P>He added that the unemployment rate is expected to drop gradually beginning in
September.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has intensified epidemic prevention efforts as it confirmed on Monday the
fourth and fifth fatalities from swine flu, officially known as influenza A
(H1N1).</P>
      <P>As part of the reinforced campaign, more flu patients will be treated with the
anti-viral drug Tamiflu, with the government rather than the National Health
Insurance system footing the bill, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said.</P>
      <P>In response to a steady rise in the number of swine flu infections in Taiwan,
Liu said the government has decided to ease guidelines for Tamiflu
prescriptions, which will be paid for with aspecial government budget.</P>
      <P>Under the relaxed rules, physicians will be authorized to prescribe Tamiflu or
Relenza to certain categories of flu patients without the need for them to
undergo rapid screening tests for the H1N1 flu strain, which are not totally
reliable.</P>
      <P>Those patients will include people with underlying chronic diseases, pregnant
women, children under the age of 5, people who have come into contact with
confirmed H1N1 patients, and those who have developed pneumonia or severe flu
symptoms.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the premier said the procurement and inventory of anti-viral flu
drugs, such as Tamiflu and Relenza, should be expanded to meet the demand in
case of an emergency.</P>
      <P>After consulting with health specialists, Liu said the inventory of Tamiflu and
Relenza will be raised to an amount sufficient to treat 30 percent of Taiwan's
total population -- or at least 7 million people -- up from the original 18
percent.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is still recovering from the destruction wrought by Typhoon Morakot,
Liu said priority should be given to epidemic control measures at emergency
shelters for people left homeless by the natural disaster.</P>
      <P>As of Monday, more than 6,000 survivors remain in shelters in the hardest-hit
zones in southern Taiwan's Pingtung, Kaohsiung and Chiayi counties.</P>
      <P>Morakot dumped a staggering amount of rainfall in southern Taiwan Aug. 7-9,
swelling rivers that washed away bridges and triggering landslides that buried
entire remote mountainous villages.</P>
      <P>As many military servicemen and volunteers have been mobilized to help clean up
the huge amounts of mud and debris left by the storm, Liu said those working in
the disaster zones should wear facial masks to protect themselves from coming
down with the H1N1 virus.</P>
      <P>As of Monday, Taiwan had confirmed five swine flu fatalities. CDC tallies also
show that the number of severe cases has exceeded 40, with some patients still
receiving treatment at hospitals.</P>
      <P>The number of cluster H1N1 infections is also believed to have hit 100, and more
than 10,000 Taiwanese people are coming down with the virus each week, according

      <P>Lin Ting, deputy director-general of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under
the Department of Health (DOH), said two samples collected from officers and
enlisted men working at Tatan Elementary School in Donggang township tested
positive for the H1N1 flu strain and a third one tested positive for the H3N2
seasonal flu strain.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, two samples collected from the Wanjin army barrack in Wandan township
both tested positive for the A(H1N1) virus.</P>
      <P>"It marks the first time that swine flu cluster infections have been confirmed

      <P>Taiwan's HTC Corp. signed a memorandum with Beijing-based China Mobile Ltd., the
world's largest mobile carrier, Monday to jointly develop smartphones using the
TD-SCDMA 3G mobile telecommunication standard used in China.</P>
      <P>China Mobile Chairman Wang Jianzhou said during the signing ceremony that the
Chinese company will invest 47 million yuan (around NT$226 million, or US$6.88
million) in the cooperation project, under which HTC will design and produce
seven new types of third-generation handsets for China Mobile.</P>
      <P>TD-SCDMA (time division synchronous  code division multiple access) is one of
three global mobile telecommunication networks recognized by the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU) and was developed by China to avoid dependence on
Western technology.</P>
      <P>Wang said the construction of TD-SCDMA infrastructure  has expanded quickly in
China, already covering 38 Chinese cities and expected to reach 200 cities
around the country by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The network, however, has too few 3G handset offerings to support expansion,
Wang said, and China Mobile plans to boost its product variety through
subsidization and development cooperation.</P>
      <P>Wang is in Taiwan to promote the unproven TD-SCDMA standard among local
suppliers, and many leading manufacturers,  eyeing China Mobile's nearly 500
million subscribers in China, have sought to meet with him during his nine-day
visit.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, smartphones have a bright future in China's mobile phone
market, but their popularity has been stymied by their price. He believes sales
would grow rapidly if the price could be lowered to around 1000 yuan per
handset.</P>
      <P>Under the HTC-China Mobile cooperation venture, the two parties will also
jointly develop mobile phones using Google's Android operating system, called
the open mobile system (OMS).</P>
      <P>China Mobile has adopted the system for its "Ophone" handsets, regarded as a
competitor to Apple's iPhone in China.</P>
      <P>The cooperation venture between the two companies will also pull together HTC's
technology and R&amp;D capability with China Mobile's telecommunications and
data services network to help grab a bigger share of the vast Chinese market.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's export orders fell less in July on a year-on-year basis than at any
time in the past nine months, another indication that the global economic slump
may be easing.</P>
      <P>July export orders totaled US$28.614 billion, down 8.77 percent compared to the
same month a year earlier, according to statistics released Monday by the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>Export orders from China, including Hong Kong, totaled US$8.179 billion in July,
representing year-on-year growth of 2.22 percent -- the first positive growth in

      <P>A Chinese procurement mission placed US$3.87 billion worth of orders with
Taiwanese companies Monday, part of China's attempt to help stimulate Taiwan's
battered economy.</P>
      <P>The biggest share of the orders were placed by China's biggest personal computer
maker Lenovo Group, which intends to buy US$3.255 billion worth of information
technology products from Taiwan, including notebooks and electronic items.</P>
      <P>A joint contract signing ceremony took place at the Taipei International
Convention Center, with Wang Chih-kang, chairman of the Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA) and Tang Wei, vice president of the Association of
Economy and Trade Across the Taiwan Straits (AETATS), in attendance.</P>
      <P>The group, which arrived in Taiwan Aug. 19, was the third AETATS-organized
procurement mission to Taiwan so far this year. It is composed of some 100
senior executives representating 47 Chinese business groups.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the three AETATS-organized missions have so far placed a
total of US$5.476 billion worth of orders with local suppliers.</P>
      <P>The AETATS, an affiliate of China's Ministry of Commerce, is tasked with
promoting commercial exchanges and economic cooperation with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The three groups are expected to place an additional US$3.144 billion worth of
orders with Taiwanese manufacturers in the coming year, bringing the total to
US$8.62 billion, which Wang said would exceed the original target without being
more specific.</P>
      <P>He denied that the total order value of the three buying missions had "shrunk,"
as has been speculated.</P>
      <P>In addition to Lenovo Group's purchase of information technology products, other
goods purchased by the third AETATS group also included machinery,  chemical
engineering  equipment,  garments, footwear and auto parts and components  in
line with China's "automobiles to the countryside" project that is part of its

    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore has sent a special envoy to Taipei to deliver an invitation to
President Ma Ying-jeou to attend this year's informal leadership meeting of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, political sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>The Singaporean envoy visited Taipei two weeks ago and is expected to visit
Taiwan again to ascertain who will represent Taiwan at the APEC summit meeting
scheduled to take place Nov. 14-15 in the Southeast Asian city state.</P>
      <P>Because  of  China's  opposition,  Taiwan's  president  has traditionally been
barred from attending the annual APEC summit in person and has to instead name a
proxy to attend on his behalf. Presenting the invitation to the president is
considered a mere formality.</P>
      <P>As Ma has spared no efforts to improve relations with Beijing since he assumed
office in May 2008, China did not oppose his proposal of former Vice President
Lien Chan to attend last year's APEC summit in Peru on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Lien was the most senior former Taiwanese official to ever attend the APEC
summit as the president's special envoy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has always strived to upgrade its international profile, but the official
acknowledged that it may not be easy for Ma to name an envoy with a stature
higher than Lien to attend this year's APEC leadership meeting.</P>
      <P>Political observers said this year's Taiwan representative at the APEC summit
will be seen a litmus test for cross-strait relations and represent a chance to
strengthen Taiwan-U.S. relations at a high level.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's APEC envoy will have the opportunity to meet with U.S. President Barack
Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao, they noted.</P>
      <P>An official close to Ma, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that it was
still too early to talk about who will serve as Ma's proxy at the APEC summit.</P>
      <P>"Many elements should be factored in, including delicate changes in cross-strait
ties, the operation of the new Cabinet to be formed in early September and
ruling Kuomintang operations after Ma becomes party chairman in October, " the
official said.</P>
      <P>He added that there was no rush, as the government did not announce the
appointment of Lien as Ma's proxy until late October last year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's oldest person, 125-year-old Bunun tribesman Hu Yeh-mei, passed away
early Monday.</P>
      <P>Hu's ID showed her to be born Feb. 10, 1885, making her the Taiwan's oldest
person according to Ministry of the Interior records.</P>
      <P>Hu never had a major illness during her entire life, which could be because she
did physically demanding work in her youth, chopping wood and planting mullet in
the mountains.</P>
      <P>She also hiked in the mountains every day, enabling her to keep her body healthy
despite her advancing years. She gained fame five years ago when she had a cameo
role in a TV series.</P>
      <P>Her nephew, Hu Wu-jen, said she had the best temperament of all her siblings.
"Her moderate temper and remaining close to nature were the secrets of her
longevity," he said.</P>
      <P>She suffered broken bones to her limbs six years ago and became wheelchair
bound. but she otherwise remained healthy, her nephew said. She maintained a
good appetite, and would open her eyes wide whenever she heard that it was time
to eat.</P>
      <P>Last year, she was temporarily placed in a nursing home because younger
relatives were busy farming.</P>
      <P>The beginning in the end came in early Feb. when she felt sick and was sent to
the hospital, where she was diagnosed with stomach cancer.</P>
      <P>On Sunday night she suffered from multiple organ failure and was taken home to
die.</P>
      <P>Hu was never married, leaving her nephew to take care of the funeral.</P>
      <P>He said that in observation of the traditional Bunun funeral practice, he would
not publicly announce her death but rather only notify friends and relatives so
that they could accompany her at a final meal Sept. 1 before her burial, and
tell her that "she should come back to see relatives and friends."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's HTC Corp. signed a memorandum with Beijing-based China Mobile Ltd., the
world's largest mobile carrier, Monday to jointly develop smartphones using the
TD-SCDMA 3G mobile telecommunication standard used in China.</P>
      <P>China Mobile Chairman Wang Jianzhou said during the signing ceremony that the
Chinese company will invest 47 million yuan (around NT$226 million, or US$6.88
million) in the cooperation project, under which HTC will design and produce
seven new types of third-generation handsets for China Mobile.</P>
      <P>TD-SCDMA (time division synchronous  code division multiple access) is one of
three global mobile telecommunication networks recognized by the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU) and was developed by China to avoid dependence on
Western technology.</P>
      <P>Wang said the construction of TD-SCDMA infrastructure  has expanded quickly in
China, already covering 38 Chinese cities and expected to reach 200 cities
around the country by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The network, however, has too few 3G handset offerings to support expansion,
Wang said, and China Mobile plans to boost its product variety through
subsidization and development cooperation.</P>
      <P>Wang is in Taiwan to promote the unproven TD-SCDMA standard among local
suppliers, and many leading manufacturers,  eyeing China Mobile's nearly 500
million subscribers in China, have sought to meet with him during his nine-day
visit.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, smartphones have a bright future in China's mobile phone
market, but their popularity has been stymied by their price. He believes sales
would grow rapidly if the price could be lowered to around 1000 yuan per
handset.</P>
      <P>Under the HTC-China Mobile cooperation venture, the two parties will also
jointly develop mobile phones using Google's Android operating system, called
the open mobile system (OMS).</P>
      <P>China Mobile has adopted the system for its "Ophone" handsets, regarded as a
competitor to Apple's iPhone in China.</P>
      <P>The cooperation venture between the two companies will also pull together HTC's
technology and R&amp;D capability with China Mobile's telecommunications and
data services network to help grab a bigger share of the vast Chinese market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Average real income shrinks to 1996 level</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 25 (CNA)
08/25/09  13:26:10

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's average real income over the first six months of 2009 has fallen to a
level equal to that posted in 1996, as companies adjust their hiring patterns to
cope with the global economic slump.</P>
      <P>Real monthly earnings (including regular and irregular income) averaged
NT$42,909 (US$1,305.81) in the first six months of the year, 6.84 percent lower
than for the same period a year ago, according to figures released by the
Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) on Monday.</P>
      <P>The decline in real monthly earnings was the largest such fall since the
government began compiling employment-related statistics in 1978.</P>
      <P>The January-June average was about the same as the NT$42,744 recorded for the
first six months of 1996, the DGBAS tallies showed.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials said that although the number of people employed in Taiwan has
risen every month from April to July, average wages or salaries had continued to
decline.</P>
      <P>They attributed the decline to the global economic slump and the rise of
unconventional employment modes, such as temporary or part-time jobs with
hourly-based wages.</P>
      <P>Cheng Chih-yu, a professor in National Chengchi University's Graduate Institute
of Labor Research, said Taiwanese employers, battered by the global economic
crunch, have resorted to using temporary or "dispatched" workers to lower
personnel costs.</P>
      <P>Cheng asserted, however, that negative growth in the average wage rate will not
last forever.</P>
      <P>"The negative growth nightmare will be gone as soon as the domestic economy
bottoms out from its quagmire and unemployment drops," Cheng predicted.</P>
      <P>According the latest DGBAS tallies released Monday, Taiwan's unemployment rate
rose to a record high of 6.07 percent in July and could rise again in August as
more new entrants to the job market struggle to find work.</P>
      <P>The government said the country's jobless rate would reach its peak in July or
August before gradually easing in September, but Cheng argued that the
devastation wrought by Typhoon Morakot in southern Taiwan might exacerbate
unemployment.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials estimated that the floods and mudslides triggered by the typhoon
affected only 60,000 people, and would have little impact on the country's
jobless rate, but Cheng believed that the tourism, agriculture and aquaculture
sectors would take at least one year to recover from the storm and also suffer
job losses.</P>
      <P>Cabinet officials said Monday that the improving global economy and huge amounts
of funds and resources that will be channeled into disaster areas for
reconstruction projects would help offset some of the typhoon's negative impact.</P>
      <P>"If the post-disaster reconstruction projects are carried out efficiently, it
will help solve the jobless problem in disaster areas and boost demand in the
building and construction market as well, " an official said.</P>

      <P>Discounting media speculations that A(H1N1) influenza has broken out among
servicemen engaged in relief work in the wake of Typhoon Morakot, the Ministry
of National Defense said Tuesday that only four soldiers in the disaster areas
have come down with the virus.</P>
      <P>A total of 41 servicemen were confirmed to have contracted A(H1N1) flu since the
first case was reported in the military July 27, said Fan Pao-luo, chief of the
Medical Affairs Bureau.</P>
      <P>Of the total, 36 have recovered, he said, adding that four of the five who are
still in hospital had been engaged in post-disaster relief work in flood-
affected areas of Pingtung County, southern Taiwan over the past two weeks, Fan
said.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, it was reported that the four soldiers had minor symptoms of
influenza but were in stable condition.</P>
      <P>Fan said all 212 servicemen who had come into close contact with the four over
the past two weeks were being regularly monitored, which included having twice
daily temperature checks.</P>
      <P>"Servicemen on post-typhoon relief deployment will be quarantined immediately if
they are found to have a fever," Fan said. "This is to prevent transmission of
the disease to other troops and to people in the flood-affected communities," he
added.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Tuesday:</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>People's vengeance will come soon</P>
      <P>President  Ma is trying  to shift public  anger over his administration's
bungled disaster relief operation by blaming the Pingtung County government for
withholding compensation offered by the central government to flood victims in
that county.</P>
      <P>It once again showed that the administration, which boasted of being in
"complete control of the country and completely responsible for governing, " has
turned out to be completely dodging its responsibility.</P>
      <P>Ma's administration even threatened to allot flood-relief funds directly to
township offices instead of having them transferred through the county
governments in an attempt to sideline them.</P>
      <P>This is another barefaced attempt to kick up controversy between grassroot
constituents and county governments.</P>
      <P>But we have to warn that reconstruction work is more strenuous than relief
operations and should be done with the joint efforts of the ruling and
opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Ma's administration will be naive to think it could wriggle out of blame for its
incompetence by pointing fingers at others.</P>
      <P>Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>Foreign Ministry lies</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Francisco  Ou was absent from a Saturday fundraiser organized
by foreign diplomats posted in Taiwan to help with Taiwan's flood relief
operations.</P>
      <P>The ministry  said at that time that Ou was tied up by "undisclosed  business."
But after being criticized  as being "impolite" in missing such an important
event, Ou said he was suffering from asthma that day.</P>
      <P>We wonder why the ministry would lie to cover up the minister's absence.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>No administrative ability, no economic growth</P>
      <P>The world, including Asia, is gradually pulling out of the shadow of recession.</P>
      <P>Asia's emerging economies are leading the West in the economic recovery,  thanks
to their stimulus packages, relatively sound financial institutions and higher
rates of savings among their people.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy has been dampened by Typhoon Morakot, although the Directorate
General of Budget,  Accounting and Statistics has dismissed its impact, claiming
that the government's reconstruction plan may stimulate economic growth.</P>
      <P>However, we are not that optimistic in light of the executive branch's
incompetence as evidenced by its botched handling of the Typhoon Morakot
disaster.</P>
      <P>President Ma's administration has disappointed the nation with its sluggish
response to the disaster, and we hold little hope that it could carry out the
reconstruction successfully.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Applause for digital citizens</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Internet enthusiasts stepped up in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot to
fill the gap left by the government in providing public information about the
areas ravaged by floods and mudslides.</P>
      <P>When the central government was paralyzed after Morakot, these Internet
volunteers helped the many local government emergency operation centers to
disseminate vital information to the public about what was needed and where.</P>
      <P>Rescue and relief operations, just like military operations, depend very heavily
on detailed and accurate information. Internet enthusiasts filled the
information vacuum left by the government in the post-typhoon operations and
thereby helped to assuage public anxiety over a lack of information.</P>
      <P>When the relief operations end and the reconstruction begins, we hope these
digital citizen will keep a close eye on the government's work and pursue the
officials who are to be held responsible for the diaster.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Most schools damaged by typhoon will be ready for new school year</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Many schools in southern Taiwan were destroyed or damaged by Typhoon Morakot-
triggered landslides and flooding, but most of them will be ready when the new
school year begins next week, Education Minister Cheng Jei-cheng said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,312 schools in central and southern Taiwan were affected by the
storm and its aftermath, with damage to the properties and buildings estimated
at NT$2.59 billion (US$78.8 million).</P>
      <P>Of these, 1,145 were junior high schools and elementary schools, 126 were high
schools and 41 were universities and colleges.</P>
      <P>Cheng said he was confident that all universities and colleges would be ready
for the opening of school except for Chung Hwa University of Medical Technology
in Tainan, which sustained major damage during Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Eighteen junior high schools and elementary schools in Nantou and Kaohsiung that
were completely destroyed by the storm will also not be ready, forcing 1,335
students to attend classes in other areas.</P>
      <P>In determining where the children will be resettled, Cheng said the four main
criteria will be allowing students to live with their parents, arranging
alternative school locations as close to home as possible, respecting the will
of students and parents, and respecting aboriginal culture.</P>
      <P>Many of the affected schools are in mountainous areas mostly inhabitated by
indigenous peoples.</P>
      <P>Cheng acknowledged it would be impossible to satisfy everyone, however, and he
anticipated that students from several damaged schools will have to live in
dorms and attend school by bus.</P>
      <P>In the heavily battered Alishan area, students will still attend class in the
area's eight schools, but if roads connecting the mountain region to the outside
world remain inaccessible, the government will have the military get textbooks
and teachers there, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The education minister was confident that the 63 junior high and elementary
schools and eight universities still being cleaned would be ready for the start
of the fall semester, which begins Aug. 31 for most schools.</P>
      <P>Despite disruptions in transportation and damage to school buildings, Cheng said
textbooks would arrive in students' hands by Aug. 30. The Sayling Wen Cultural
&amp; Educational Foundation has donated NT$4 million to subsidize half of the
cost of reprinting the textbooks.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The unsanitary environment of many areas in southern Taiwan battered by Typhoon
Morakot earlier this month has contributed to increasing numbers of people
getting sick, including servicemen assigned to the area to help with cleanup
operations.</P>
      <P>Since Aug. 17, 105 people have visited the doctor in Pingtung County's Wannei
village, complaining of coughs, fevers, deep muscle soreness and abnormal liver
and kidney functioning. Thirty of them were sent to hospitals for follow-up
treatment.</P>
      <P>Tests conducted by Pingtung County's Department of Health, however, found that
none of the villagers had contracted swine flu, which has already infected some
individuals in disaster areas.</P>
      <P>Health authorities now suspect they have leptospirosis,  a bacterial infection,
but the results of more thorough tests conducted will not be available for
another two or three days.</P>
      <P>Lu Meng-lun, an official with the Centers for Disease Control, explained that
leptospira bacteria is known to infect people via animal urine.</P>
      <P>Since the homes of all of the patients were flooded in the typhoon and remain
muddy to this day, the villagers probably contracted the disease via dirty soil
or water, contaminated by animal carcasses that were washed away by the flood,
Lu said.</P>
      <P>Leptospirosis symptoms include fever, chills, or lower leg pain.</P>
      <P>The military and the Department of Health sent out disinfecting trucks and
chemical specialists on Tuesday to disinfect the village as well as nearby
Jiadong and Linbian townships, which also remained caked in mud.</P>
      <P>The soldiers tried to make sure all the streets and fish ponds in the low-lying
areas were properly disinfected.</P>
      <P>Aside from the still unknown disease in flooded areas, a cluster infection of
the H1N1 flu strain seemed to be spreading in the military.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Defense admitted at a press conference Tuesday that 41 soldiers
have contracted swine flu since the first infection in the military was
discovered July 27, of which four have taken part in disaster relief operations.</P>
      <P>So far 36 soldiers have recovered and returned to their duties while the others
remain hospitalized.</P>
      <P>A total of 212 people in the army are believed to have come into contact with
the four swine flu patients engaged in disaster relief efforts, but they are all
in good health.</P>

      <P>A workshop organized by the Taipei-based British Trade and Cultural Office
(BTCO) was kicked off on Tuesday to educate young people on the increasingly
urgent problem of climate change and encourage them to take action against the
trend.</P>
      <P>BTCO Director David Campbell said at the opening ceremony of the event that
climate change is much more than just an environmental issue and failure to
tackle it will damage global security and prosperity, as recent scientific data
has shown that its impact are being felt more quickly and more broadly than
previously thought.</P>
      <P>Its important  for us to realize that we can make a difference. In fact, those
who move early on this issue can in fact see economic benefits in developing new
technologies  and new strategies to deal with the missions,Campbell said.</P>
      <P>Applauding Taiwans recent moves to promote energy efficiency and the development
of renewable energy sources, the top British representative to Taiwan said that
he hoped Taiwan could establish a legal framework to allow long-term decisions
to be taken that will bring about further reduction of green house gas emissions
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>With Taiwans highly-skilled workforce, its expertise in the high-tech
industries, Taiwan is very well placed to benefit from taking the leading role
in combating climate change, he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that he has seen a huge amount of interest in Taiwan, both at the
political level, the business level and the civil societies in tackling climate
change, Campbell said that his country is keen to share its experience and
support activities for the cause.</P>
      <P>Exploring ways to expand the use of renewable energies could be a very good area
for Taiwan and the U.K. to cooperate in, according to Campbell. He added that
his country has many experts and universities dedicated to developing solar
technology and tidal power.</P>
      <P>Speaking of Typhoon Morakot, which devastated southern Taiwan more than two
weeks ago, Campbell said that the natural disaster cannot necessarily  be linked
to climate change,  but similar situations could become more and more common.</P>
      <P>What the scientists are saying is that unless effective action is taken, then we
can expect that there will be an increase in these weather-related episodes in
the coming years and thats why its so important to take action,he said.</P>
      <P>The workshop, entitledBuilding A Generation to Combat the Climate Crisis,is
being held at the Taipei Youth Hub on Tuesday and Wednesday in collaboration
with Taiwan Environmental Action Network (TEAN).</P>
      <P>Some 30 university students participating in the event will learn about the
opportunities and challenges of global climate governance and how to take part
in tackling the issue.</P>
      <P>Dustin Lin, a junior majoring in economics at National Tsing Hua University,
told CNA that he is an environmental activist, who established a network at his
school for like-minded students to share their experiences and ideas on climate
change.</P>
      <P>It is such a pity that people who have the passion to do something on the cause
have no idea how to start. My network in the university is aimed at serving as a
platform for them to discuss how to take practical local actions to combat the
climate crisis, Lin said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier gives directive for Tamiflu to be more widely prescribed</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan issued a directive Tuesday for the antiviral drug
Tamiflu to be more widely prescribed, as the country is stepping up its
influenza A(H1N1) prevention efforts.</P>
      <P>"All patients who test positive for the A(H1N1) virus will be treated with
Tamiflu, with the government, rather than the National Health Insurance system,
footing the bill," Liu said.</P>
      <P>In response to a steady rise in the number of swine flu infections and deaths in
Taiwan, Liu said the government has decided to ease the guidelines for Tamiflu
prescriptions, which will be covered under a special government budget.</P>
      <P>He said although there are acute shortages worldwide of antiviral drugs such as
Tamiflu and Relenza, the Department of Health will make every effort to procure
the drugs at home and abroad and stock enough Tamiflu and Relenza to treat 30
percent of Taiwan's total population -- or at least 7 million people.</P>
      <P>This will increase the stock from the current level, which is sufficient to
treat 18 percent of the population, he noted.</P>
      <P>He said that if Taiwan relents in its epidemic prevention efforts,  there  could
be an outbreak  of swine flu in the flood-affected areas in southern Taiwan and
also in the military, as servicemen are engaged in post-typhoon relief work in
disaster areas.</P>
      <P>The premier suggested that servicemen and volunteers working in the disaster
areas wear face masks at all times to guard against transmission of the A(H1N1)
virus.</P>
      <P>The disease has claimed five lives in Taiwan to date.</P>
      <P>As of Monday, 105 residents of a village in Wandan township in the southernmost
county of Pingtung had developed fevers, two weeks after Typhoon Morakot wreaked
havoc with the worst flooding in Taiwan in half a century.</P>
      <P>Thirty  of the 105 residents  were hospitalized  but were preliminarily cleared
of suspicion of A(H1N1) infection, county health authorities said.</P>
      <P>"It is more likely that they have leptospirosis, one of the diseases that
commonly surface in flood affected areas, " the local health officials said.</P>
      <P>In related news, the Chang Jung Senior High School in Tainan City, southern
Taiwan, announced Monday that three of its classes will be suspended until Aug.
31, as two students have tested positive for A(H1N1) flu and three others are
suspected of having contracted the disease.</P>
      <P>It was the fourth school in Tainan City to report a cluster infection of swine
flu.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators of the ruling and opposition parties have reached consensus Tuesday
to swiftly pass the special reconstruction bill in the legislature so as to help
victims of Typhoon Morakot rebuild their homes as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Legislators of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), the major opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and other smaller parties reached the agreement earlier
Tuesday in a meeting, a three-day extraordinary session called by Legislative
Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng to screen the bill.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, lawmakers gave their approval to the draft bill to allow it
to be quickly referred to a legislative meeting for a final approval before the
extraordinary session ends on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot, which brought severe flooding and mudslides to Taiwan from Aug.
7-10, killed 292 people, with another 385 missing, most of whom are residents
buried by a landslide in Siaolin Village, Kaohsiung County. A vast majority of
the victims are residents from Taiwan's indigenous tribes.</P>
      <P>Morakot also caused tens of billions of dollars in losses in the agricultural,
livestock and fish farming sectors, sending prices of vegetables, fruits, fish
and meat soaring in Taiwan's retail markets.</P>
      <P>Lin I-shih, head of the KMT's central policy committee, said legislators  from
the various parties  will immediately  start negotiations on the draft bill on
Wednesday, as they remain widely divided on the scale of the budget.</P>
      <P>The KMT version of the bill proposed a NT$100 billion (US$3.03 billion) budget
to finance the special reconstruction bill, while the DPP version called for
double that amount -- NT$200 billion or more -- without setting a limit.</P>
      <P>Earlier the same day, a group of about 90 typhoon victims and some 40 social
activists protested in front of the Legislative Yuan against the special
reconstruction bill, which they said was a "rash" piece of legislation concocted
in just three days.</P>
      <P>The protesters harshly criticized the KMT and DPP for looting and trying to
profit from other people's misfortune, with Tsai Chi-hsun, secretary-general  of
the Taiwan Association for Human Rights, accusing the government of drafting the
bill "behind closed doors" without listening to the victims' voices.</P>
      <P>Three female DPP lawmakers -- Tien Chiu-chin, Kuan Pi-ling and Huang Shu-ying --
accepted the protesters' petition and promised to hand it over to the party's
legislative caucus.</P>
      <P>Also protesting at the scene were members of the Land Bank of Taiwan's workers'
union. They demanded Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der resign from the post to
take the responsibility for the government's idea of selling the profitable
state-owned bank as a means of seeking funds for its post-typhoon rehabilitation
projects.</P>
      <P>Protesters demanded that Lee step down for trying to sell the bank for a value
that it can earn in less than four years.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Minister of the Interior (MOI) Lin Chung-sen said last week that
the government is projected to complete reconstruction in the aftermath of
Typhoon Morakot in three years at an estimated cost of NT$100 billion.</P>
      <P>If passed by the Legislature, the bill will authorize the executive branch to
raise a special budget of NT$100 billion in three years  to  finance  various
post-typhoon  rehabilitation  and reconstruction projects on public
infrastructure and resettlement of displaced typhoon victims, Lin said.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the Executive Yuan has already paid NT$6.6 billion in
reconstruction funds to various county governments whose districts were hit
hardest by the disaster.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EU experts give high marks to relief work in disaster areas</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Five disaster relief experts sent by the European Union to assess Taiwan's
requirements in the wake of Typhoon Morakot said Tuesday in Taipei that there
are no emergency needs in the storm-affected areas, as relief operations are
being properly carried out.</P>
      <P>"Everything that we saw on the ground seems to be firmly in the recovery phase.
We saw no immediate needs, nor were we asked for anything, " Gordon MacMillan,
deputy leader of the EU team, told the Central News Agency in an exclusive
interview.</P>
      <P>According to MacMillan, in its visit to the south of the country which was most
heavily devastated by the storm, the team noted that considerable efforts were
being made to meet the needs of all the survivors.</P>
      <P>The work in progress includes putting people in contact with their families,
looking after those who need to be relocated, and searching for missing people,
he said.</P>
      <P>"We have been impressed by those considerable efforts, " said MacMillan, who is
a professional fire and rescue officer and has participated in international
disaster relief operations for eight years.</P>
      <P>The team received no requests for civil protection assistance, he said.</P>
      <P>The five-member EU team, which arrived in Taiwan on Aug. 17, first visited the
Central Emergency Operation Center in Taipei to get an overview of the
casualties and destruction caused by Typhoon Morakot, one of the worst natural
disasters to hit Taiwan in half a century.</P>
      <P>The team members then went to southern Taiwan to see for themselves the severity
of the damage and evaluate what kind of help the EU can offer Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The team, which was assigned to help address emergencies in Taiwan, was
assembled at the initiative of the European Commission's Community Mechanism for
Civil Protection.</P>
      <P>Noting that the emergency phase is firmly over and the recovery phase has
commenced, MacMillan said that his mission has had good cooperation with local
authorities, people and other organizations.</P>
      <P>He described the existing operational structure in Taiwan as "outstanding, "
saying that the central and local emergency operation centers are cooperating
well in the disaster relief efforts.</P>
      <P>The team was impressed by the number of volunteers and officials on site, he
said.</P>
      <P>However, the team thinks that it will take some time for the country to rebuild
its critical infrastructures, such as roads and bridges, MacMillan said.</P>
      <P>Thomas Hernes, a Swedish medical officer on the EU team, said that clean water
should not be a problem in the disaster areas, as Taiwans water company has
taken quick action to restore supply in most areas.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the Swedish government, which currently holds the EU presidency, had
also donated 4,600 bottles of water purification drops as a temporary solution
to provide storm victims with clean water, Hernes said. A second batch of the
drops is scheduled to arrive in the country on Aug. 27, he added.</P>
      <P>Roger Valberg, head of the EU team, said that in addition to its daily situation
reports, the team will deliver a final report to the EU when it returns to
Brussels at the end of the week. On the basis of these reports and briefings,
the EU will decide what to do next, he said.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot lashed Taiwan Aug.7-9, dumping massive amounts of rain on the
southern parts of the country. The storm killed over 160 people,  and left 45
injured and nearly 500 unaccounted for. Agricultural losses are estimated at
more than NT$ 14.6 billion (US$444 million).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Muzha-Neihu MRT line shut down again</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25 (CNA)
08/25/09  18:47:53
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The problematic Muzha-Neihu MRT Line was shut down again Tuesday due to system
failure, after a few hours of service following a 56-hour suspension of
operations to allow the contractor -- Canadian Bombardier -- to carry out
repairs.</P>
      <P>A south-bound train ground to a complete halt at 9: 12 a.m. Tuesday as it
reached Dazhi Station and did not pull out again until 10 a.m.</P>
      <P>Preliminary investigations suggested that the train was stalled because of
problems with its brake and propulsion systems, said Taipei City Deputy
Secretary-General Tan Gwa-guang.</P>
      <P>More than 200 passengers were inconvenienced by the breakdown.</P>
      <P>Realizing that the problem could not be fixed right away, the control center
announced at 9: 27 a.m. that service on the entire Muzha-Neihu MRT Line will be
suspended, according to Tan.</P>
      <P>The technicians released the train's automatic driving system, activated its
manual system and drove it to the Songshan Airport depot for repairs, he said.
Service on the line resumed at 10 a.m.</P>
      <P>During the 33-minute suspension, more than 700 people asked for refunds, 429
tickets for free bus rides were distributed and 191 tickets for free MRT rides
were given out, according to Taipei Rapid Transit Corp. (TRTC), the system's
operator.</P>
      <P>The Neihu Line, built by Canadian Bombardier, has been plagued with problems
since it began commercial services July 4 and has been shut down more than 10
times due to system failures.</P>
      <P>The new Neihu Line was integrated with the Muzha Line that was built in the
1990s mainly by a French contractor, Matra. Critics have suggested that the
project to merge the two lines and integrate the control systems was too
ambitious.</P>
      <P>The Neihu Line is a medium capacity system that runs on viaducts, except for the
section near Taipei Songshan Airport. The 14.8-km line, which cost NT$63.7
billion and took nearly seven years to complete, provides transport services to
Taipei's suburban areas of Neihu, Nangang and Muzha.</P>

    <HEADLINE>19 supermarkets and shopping malls in Taiwan vow to save energy</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug 25 (CNA)
08/25/09  19:38:29
(By Julia Chien)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Representatives of 19 major shopping malls and supermarkets in Taiwan took a vow
on Tuesday to cut their store's electricity use by 5 percent in the next three
years and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>Among the 19 enterprises, 12 were shopping malls and seven were supermarkets.
Altogether they have 868 franchise stores under them.</P>
      <P>According to Yiin Chii-ming, Minister of Ministry of Economic Affairs, an
enormous amount of energy and money will be saved if the businesses keep their
promise.</P>
      <P>If the companies stick to their agreement, 40.72 million kwh of electricity will
be saved, which in turn will prevent 26,000 tons of CO2 from being released into
the air, Yiin said.</P>
      <P>That's 70 times the yearly carbon absorption for Daan Park, Taipei City's
largest park, which is 259,293-square meters in size. The energy savings can
also create NT$300 million worth of profit for energy-saving businesses, Yiin
added.</P>
      <P>Yiin was at a ceremony held by the Bureau of Energy at the International
Convention Center in National Taiwan University Hospital.</P>
      <P>The energy-saving campaign was launched in 2006. Back then, the energy
consumption growth rate of the service industry was 4.2 percent, higher than the
3.7 percent in industrial businesses.</P>
      <P>Over the past few years, the campaign persuaded different trades to sign an
agreement to reduce energy consumption. In the first year, convenience stores
signed up, the second year warehouse stores, and the third hospitals, hotels and
department stores. This year it was supermarkets and shopping malls.</P>
      <P>Previous participants have already reduced energy consumption by a total of 473
million kwh per year, preventing the release of 301,000 tons of CO2, which
equals to one year's worth of carbon absorption by Taiwan's Kenting National
Park, which is 18,084 hectares in size, Yiin said.</P>
      <P>Statistics showed that investments made on energy-saving equipment by
participants reached NT$1.8 billion, Yiin said, but the electricity bills they
saved in a year amounted to NT$1 billion, which means that within two years, the
participants get their money back, proving that energy-saving businesses can be
both meaningful and profitable.</P>
      <P>The results also show that convenience stores, the first type of business to
enter the campaign in 2006, have already reduced 22 percent of their total
energy consumption rate, saving 2.9 million kwh of energy and reducing 18,400
tons of CO2 per year, which equals to the yearly carbon absorption of the
28,400-hectare Yangmingshan National Park, an astonishing accomplishment, said
Yiin.</P>
      <P>The four most energy-efficient convenience stores are Uni-President, FamilyMart,
Hi-Life and OK Mart, according to the Bureau of Energy.</P>
      <P>The seven supermarkets that participated in the campaign were Pxmart, Wellcome,
Matsusei, Taiwan Fresh Supermarket, Tung Kuan, Ken &amp; Kuma and Civil
Community Market.</P>
      <P>The 12 shopping malls were The Mall, TaiMall, Metro Walk, the Breeze Center,
Living Mall, Taichung Central Mall, Tiger City, Taipei 101, SugarMall, Miramar,
Global Mall and Dream Mall.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Typhoon victims to take part in reconstruction panels</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, Aug. 25 (CNA)
08/25/09  20:09:16

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that representatives of victims of Typhoon
Morakot are welcome to take part in reconstruction committees organized by the
central government or local authorities, so as to help speed up the process of
resettlement and rebuilding.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks during a visit to a reception center temporarily
set up by Shunshien Temple in Kaohsiung County's Neimen Village for victims from
neighboring Namasia Village, which was devastated by the typhoon earlier this
month.</P>
      <P>Victims erected banners expressing their demands, such as "We want to
participate in reconstruction panels."</P>
      <P>Ma had flown to Namasia Village on a helicopter to gain a better understanding
of the damage caused by Morakot there. Two out of three towns in Namasia are
seriously damaged by mudslide stirred up by the typhoon and are no longer
suitable for people to live in.</P>
      <P>"Three townships have to be relocated and the complex task must be thoroughly
assessed by experts.  Residents' willingness and decision must be fully
respected," said the president.</P>
      <P>Ma urged the victims to swiftly make a decision on which government auxiliary
measures they would accept so as to help the government launch all necessary
measures as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>"The government has put short-term, medium-term and long-term subsidy and
housing plans in place to re-settle victims made homeless by Morakot, and it
hopes that the victims can quickly choose one option that best serves their
interest so as to allow the government to start ensuing projects swiftly," Ma
said.</P>
      <P>Ma stressed that the government will verify the deceased victims' identities in
a looser way and that their affected family members are not obliged to take on
any rehabilitation or rehoming projects put forward by the government.</P>
      <P>At the reception center, survivors and victims also held up signs saying: "Stop
the cross-region water channeling project to the Tsengwen Reservoir."</P>
      <P>Many typhoon victims blame the water project for destabilizing the mountains
near their villages and causing the deadly mudslides that killed many of their
villagers during Typhoon Morakot, the worst typhoon Taiwan has suffered in 50
years.</P>
      <P>Ma has promised to investigate their claim.</P>
      <P>Minister of National Defense Chen Chao-min, Council of Indigenous Peoples
Chairwoman Chang Jen-shiang and Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing were
also present. Along with Ma, They bowed to the victims and apologized for the
government's much criticized slow response in carrying out rescue and relief
operations in the wake of the typhoon.</P>
      <P>A bill seeking NT$100 billion for reconstruction is currently being screened by
lawmakers at the Legislative Yuan, and the Executive Yuan is set to launch many
rehabilitation projects once the bill clears the legislature, Ma added.</P>
      <P>According to Yang, 2,000 prefabricated houses are being built in Kaohsiung
County to house typhoon victims on a temporary basis, while the Buddhist
Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation has promised to construct 1,000 permanent
homes for the victims.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung, Taitung, Pingtung and Tainan counties are worst damaged by Typhoon
Morakot, which lashed Taiwan from Aug. 7-10. Most of the victims are indigenous
residents in mountain townships.</P>

      <P>Taipei city government officials said Tuesday that they have made every possible
preparation to guard against influenza A(H1N1) next month, when schools open for
the new semester and the city will host the international Deaflympics 2009.</P>
      <P>Amid reports that the new flu is spreading, city health officials said they have
explained  the situation  to staff of hotels, restaurants, games volunteers and
medical stations.</P>
      <P>They said the city authorities have also purchased forehead thermometers  and
will distribute them to hotels to take the temperatures of guests and maintain
daily notification with health officials.</P>
      <P>Alcohol and antiseptic wipes will also be available at hotels and restaurants,
according to the officials.</P>
      <P>Sign-language publicity ads will also be aired at public places such as hotels,
restaurants and MRT stations to spread the message of H1N1 prevention and
control.</P>
      <P>"Currently,  available  resources to fight the disease are abundant, " one
health official said, adding that if tests conducted by medical facilities
confirm anyone of having contracted A(H1N1) , they will be given Tamiflu, which
is covered by national health insurance.</P>
      <P>If athletes taking part in the Deaflympics are infected with the H1N1 virus,
they will also be given Tamiflu despite not being covered by national insurance,
the official added.</P>
      <P>All competition venues will have medical stations and will provide assessments
to athletes who show flu symptoms. The athletes will be sent to hospitals if
necessary and doctors accompanying each team will decide whether they will
suspend events as a result.</P>
      <P>On the issue of class suspensions after schools open, the officials said they
will follow the advice provided by the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC).</P>
      <P>The CECC advises that all schools, kindergartens, cram schools and day care
institutions with two or more students in one class who have been diagnosed with
A(H1N1) within three days will be closed for five days. Flu victims will only be
allowed to return to school 24 hours after the symptoms disappear.</P>
      <P>According to statistics provided by the CECC, Taiwan had recorded 70 cases of
serious swine flu as of Monday -- 10 in Taipei -- with five fatalities.</P>
      <P>The city government will make policy adjustments by keeping tabs on the swine
flu situation at home and abroad, following the central government's guidelines.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Fitch Ratings has lowered its forecast of losses by Taiwanese banks for the
year, from NT$100 billion to NT$30 billion, citing better-than-expected asset
quality maintenance during the global credit crisis.</P>
      <P>In a report released Tuesday, the company stated that the banks were able to
maintain good asset quality because of multi-year deleveraging by Taiwanese
households and corporations before the financial crisis hit in 2008.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the rating agency warned that the banking sector's large credit
exposure to the troubled dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chip makers remains
a significant threat to their asset quality over the short and medium term.</P>
      <P>Local DRAM chip makers have all been losing money for most of the past year
because of oversupply, while demand for chips have declined in the face of the
global economic crisis.</P>
      <P>Although local banks have done a good job in maintaining their asset quality in
the first half of this year, other factors, including Taiwan's persistent
economic slump, weak profit margins and high credit costs, could drive down
their profits, said Jonathan Lee, senior director of the financial institutions
group at Fitch Ratings Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's banking and financial reform plan may have been postponed because of
the sharp economic recession from the fourth quarter of last year and the recent
damage caused by Typhoon Morakot, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>Over the next two to three years, Taiwan would not likely see mergers of large
state-owned banks, Lee predicted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Close to 40,000 people in Taiwan have contracted influenza A(H1N1) since early
June, with a majority of them developing only mild symptoms, Department of
Health (DOH) Minister Yang Chi-liang, who serves as chief of the Central
Epidemic Command Center, said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Citing estimates by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the DOH, Yang
said about 38,000 people have been infected over the past three months around
the country, with some 12,000 getting the virus last week alone.</P>
      <P>Yang admitted that the epidemic, widely known as swine flu, is gradually
spreading as had been previously forecast, but he added that "it will be OK if
patients take medicine early enough."</P>
      <P>"Around 70 percent of the people infected with the influenza A(HINI) virus will
recover without taking anti-virals, " he noted.</P>
      <P>The DOH's top concern at present, Yang went on, is to stave off a massive
outbreak of A(H1N1), as it had initially succeeded in stemming the spread of the
disease.</P>
      <P>According to CDC Director-General Kuo Hsu-sung, there have been only 44
pneumonia cases induced by swine flu in Taiwan. Twenty-two of them have
recovered, five have died, five are still in intensive care units and five are
in normal wards.</P>
      <P>"Swine flu does not necessarily lead to death from pneumonia, " Kuo said,
pointing out that last year, Taiwan recorded 8,000 deaths caused by pneumonia,
while for last week alone, there were 183 such cases, only two of which were
induced by swine flu.</P>
      <P>"Compared to the same period of last year, the number of pneumonia deaths linked
to swine flu has not markedly increased, but the possibility of further deaths
cannot be ruled out for the whole of this year," he added.</P>
      <P>Kuo forecast that the first wave of swine flu will hit hard after schools begin
the new semester in early September. However, he went on, the impact will be
minimized as long as schools follow due procedure to stop classes for five days
if "two cases are confirmed in three days in the same class."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Adimmune Corp., Taiwan's only producer of swine flu vaccine, said it
had begun mass production of vaccine and that the first batch of 5 million doses
will be ready by the middle of September.</P>
      <P>A vaccination program is expected to kick off in mid-November, once the drug's
safety can be proven by the authorities, a company manager said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile that day, Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said President Ma
Ying-jeou had decided not to call a national security meeting for the time being
to address the swine flu issue, despite grave public concern that the situation
might spiral out of control.</P>
      <P>The president made the decision upon the advice of Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, who
had discussed the matter with epidemic experts, who assessed that the situation
did not merit such a meeting, according to Wang.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou thanked the United States Tuesday for its assistance to
Taiwan after Typhoon Morakot lashed the country Aug. 7-10.</P>
      <P>"The Republic of China government and people wholeheartedly appreciate the
United States for its provision of large helicopters which helped transport
heavy machinery to disaster areas, " Ma said during a meeting with visiting
Oklahoma Governor Brad Henry at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Ma also thanked Henry for the support that his state extended to Taiwan, such as
favoring Taiwan's participation in world bodies and the idea of Taiwan signing a
free trade agreement with the United States.</P>
      <P>It was Henry's first visit to Taiwan since he assumed office in 2003. Taiwan
Province and the state of Oklahoma will celebrate their 30th anniversary of

      <P>Typhoon Morakot had killed 292 people, with another 385 missing, mostly
residents buried by a landslide in Siaolin village, Kaohsiung County, according

      <P>The typhoon also caused tens of billions of dollars-worth of losses in the
agricultural, livestock and fish farming sectors, sending local prices of

      <P>Agricultural losses from Typhoon Morakot had surged to NT$15.81 billion
(US$540.55 million) as of Tuesday, according to statistics released that day by
the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>The COA said that Morakot, which pummeled Taiwan Aug. 7-9, caused serious damage
to the agricultural sector in 11 counties, with Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties
in southern Taiwan and Hualien and Taitung counties in the east the hardest hit.</P>
      <P>The statistics show that damage to crops had amounted to NT$4.47 billion, with
27 percent of the crops on 74,997 hectares of farmland wiped out.</P>
      <P>Bananas suffered the heaviest damage, with 6,307 hectares ravaged by strong

      <P>Over 148,273 pigs, nearly 6.11 million chickens and around 1.54 million ducks
perished in floods caused by the storm, bringing the total livestock losses to
NT$1.48 billion, the COA said.</P>
      <P>Damage to the aquaculture sector had amounted to NT$4.17 billion, the heaviest
loss in 19 years, according to the statistics, with stock in some 9,162 hectares
of fishponds or coastal areas washed away, it said.</P>
      <P>Over 2,512 hectares of forestry was destroyed, while damage to all agricultural

      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Tuesday that the city government will decide
whether to shut down the problematic Muzha-Neihu MRT line indefinitely after an
inspection and repair program over the weekend.</P>
      <P>The new line, which began commercial services July 4, has been a source of
embarrassment to the Taipei city government, with constant shutdowns due to
system failures.</P>
      <P>A 56-hour suspension of operations last weekend for inspection and repair
apparently failed to guarantee a smooth return to service, when a southbound

that problems with the brake and propulsion systems on one section caused the
breakdown.</P>
      <P>The Muzha-Neihu MRT line has been suspended twice over previous weekends for

      <P>The Taiwanese chapter of the Christian charity World Vision said Tuesday that it
will invest over NT$1.2 billion (US$36.5 million) in emergency relief and
rehabilitation programs in the wake of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Hank Du, executive director of World Vision Taiwan, made the announcement at a
news conference that same day in which he gave an update on the organization's
relief operations in the storm-stricken areas and announced long-term
rehabilitation plans to help the affected people return to normal life as soon
as possible.</P>
      <P>Noting that World Vision Taiwan plans to build 1,200 temporary homes for the
storm victims in Taitung, Pingtung, Kaohsiung and Chiayi counties, Du said the
temporary homes can be easily assembled by untrained personnel with simple hand
tools and that once the land is ready, these homes can be completed in two or
three weeks.</P>
      <P>The homes will be made of different local materials such as bamboo and slate, Du
went on, adding that the construction materials are light, environmentally
friendly and reusable.</P>
      <P>"We have worked with aboriginal people for a long time. We understand their
cultures and needs. World Vision's housing plan is particularly suitable for
them," Du went on.</P>
      <P>"The housing project will be implemented with a cash-for-work mechanism, so the
beneficiaries can participate in the construction of their own homes," he added.</P>
      <P>The organization will provide educational aid as well as living subsidies for
children affected by the typhoon and will continue to set up "Child Friendly
Spaces" for children.</P>
      <P>Since the disaster caused by Morakot, World Vision Taiwan has received NT$57.4
million from both individuals and corporations, as well as receiving support
from other countries such as the United States, Canada, Hong Kong and Singapore.</P>
      <P>Shelter Box, a British charity organization, has donated 324 tents to World

      <P>Hsieh Yen-Shen, Rotary International D3480 district governor, said the tents can

    <TEXT>
      <P>Five disaster relief experts sent by the European Union to assess Taiwan's
requirements in the wake of Typhoon Morakot said Tuesday in Taipei that there
are no emergency needs in the storm-affected areas, as relief operations are
being properly carried out.</P>
      <P>"Everything that we saw on the ground seems to be firmly in the recovery phase.
We saw no immediate needs, nor were we asked for anything, " Gordon MacMillan,
deputy leader of the EU team, told the Central News Agency in an exclusive
interview.</P>
      <P>According to MacMillan, in its visit to the south of the country which was most
heavily devastated by the storm, the team noted that considerable efforts were
being made to meet the needs of all the survivors.</P>
      <P>The work in progress includes putting people in contact with their families,
looking after those who need to be relocated, and searching for missing people,
he said.</P>
      <P>"We have been impressed by those considerable efforts, " said MacMillan, who is
a professional fire and rescue officer and has participated in international
disaster relief operations for eight years.</P>
      <P>The team received no requests for civil protection assistance, he said.</P>
      <P>The five-member EU team, which arrived in Taiwan on Aug. 17, first visited the
Central Emergency Operation Center in Taipei to get an overview of the
casualties and destruction caused by Typhoon Morakot, one of the worst natural
disasters to hit Taiwan in half a century.</P>
      <P>The team members then went to southern Taiwan to see for themselves the severity
of the damage and evaluate what kind of help the EU can offer Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The team, which was assigned to help address emergencies in Taiwan, was
assembled at the initiative of the European Commission's Community Mechanism for
Civil Protection.</P>
      <P>Noting that the emergency phase is firmly over and the recovery phase has
commenced, MacMillan said that his mission has had good cooperation with local
authorities, people and other organizations.</P>
      <P>He described the existing operational structure in Taiwan as "outstanding, "
saying that the central and local emergency operation centers are cooperating
well in the disaster relief efforts.</P>
      <P>The team was impressed by the number of volunteers and officials on site, he
said.</P>
      <P>However, the team thinks that it will take some time for the country to rebuild
its critical infrastructures, such as roads and bridges, MacMillan said.</P>
      <P>Thomas Hernes, a Swedish medical officer on the EU team, said that clean water
should not be a problem in the disaster areas, as Taiwans water company has
taken quick action to restore supply in most areas.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the Swedish government, which currently holds the EU presidency, had
also donated 4,600 bottles of water purification drops as a temporary solution
to provide storm victims with clean water, Hernes said. A second batch of the
drops is scheduled to arrive in the country on Aug. 27, he added.</P>
      <P>Roger Valberg, head of the EU team, said that in addition to its daily situation
reports, the team will deliver a final report to the EU when it returns to
Brussels at the end of the week. On the basis of these reports and briefings,
the EU will decide what to do next, he said.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot lashed Taiwan Aug.7-9, dumping massive amounts of rain on the
southern parts of the country. The storm killed over 160 people,  and left 45
injured and nearly 500 unaccounted for. Agricultural losses are estimated at
more than NT$ 14.6 billion (US$444 million).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The problematic Muzha-Neihu MRT Line was shut down again Tuesday due to system
failure, after a few hours of service following a 56-hour suspension of
operations to allow the contractor -- Canadian Bombardier -- to carry out
repairs.</P>
      <P>A south-bound train ground to a complete halt at 9: 12 a.m. Tuesday as it
reached Dazhi Station and did not pull out again until 10 a.m.</P>
      <P>Preliminary investigations suggested that the train was stalled because of
problems with its brake and propulsion systems, said Taipei City Deputy
Secretary-General Tan Gwa-guang.</P>
      <P>More than 200 passengers were inconvenienced by the breakdown.</P>
      <P>Realizing that the problem could not be fixed right away, the control center
announced at 9: 27 a.m. that service on the entire Muzha-Neihu MRT Line will be
suspended, according to Tan.</P>
      <P>The technicians released the train's automatic driving system, activated its
manual system and drove it to the Songshan Airport depot for repairs, he said.
Service on the line resumed at 10 a.m.</P>
      <P>During the 33-minute suspension, more than 700 people asked for refunds, 429
tickets for free bus rides were distributed and 191 tickets for free MRT rides
were given out, according to Taipei Rapid Transit Corp. (TRTC), the system's
operator.</P>
      <P>The Neihu Line, built by Canadian Bombardier, has been plagued with problems
since it began commercial services July 4 and has been shut down more than 10
times due to system failures.</P>
      <P>The new Neihu Line was integrated with the Muzha Line that was built in the
1990s mainly by a French contractor, Matra. Critics have suggested that the
project to merge the two lines and integrate the control systems was too
ambitious.</P>
      <P>The Neihu Line is a medium capacity system that runs on viaducts, except for the
section near Taipei Songshan Airport. The 14.8-km line, which cost NT$63.7
billion and took nearly seven years to complete, provides transport services to
Taipei's suburban areas of Neihu, Nangang and Muzha.</P>

    <HEADLINE>19 supermarkets and shopping malls in Taiwan vow to save energy</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug 25 (CNA)
08/25/09  19:38:29
(By Julia Chien)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Representatives of 19 major shopping malls and supermarkets in Taiwan took a vow
on Tuesday to cut their store's electricity use by 5 percent in the next three
years and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>Among the 19 enterprises, 12 were shopping malls and seven were supermarkets.
Altogether they have 868 franchise stores under them.</P>
      <P>According to Yiin Chii-ming, Minister of Ministry of Economic Affairs, an
enormous amount of energy and money will be saved if the businesses keep their
promise.</P>
      <P>If the companies stick to their agreement, 40.72 million kwh of electricity will
be saved, which in turn will prevent 26,000 tons of CO2 from being released into
the air, Yiin said.</P>
      <P>That's 70 times the yearly carbon absorption for Daan Park, Taipei City's
largest park, which is 259,293-square meters in size. The energy savings can
also create NT$300 million worth of profit for energy-saving businesses, Yiin
added.</P>
      <P>Yiin was at a ceremony held by the Bureau of Energy at the International
Convention Center in National Taiwan University Hospital.</P>
      <P>The energy-saving campaign was launched in 2006. Back then, the energy
consumption growth rate of the service industry was 4.2 percent, higher than the
3.7 percent in industrial businesses.</P>
      <P>Over the past few years, the campaign persuaded different trades to sign an
agreement to reduce energy consumption. In the first year, convenience stores
signed up, the second year warehouse stores, and the third hospitals, hotels and
department stores. This year it was supermarkets and shopping malls.</P>
      <P>Previous participants have already reduced energy consumption by a total of 473
million kwh per year, preventing the release of 301,000 tons of CO2, which
equals to one year's worth of carbon absorption by Taiwan's Kenting National
Park, which is 18,084 hectares in size, Yiin said.</P>
      <P>Statistics showed that investments made on energy-saving equipment by
participants reached NT$1.8 billion, Yiin said, but the electricity bills they
saved in a year amounted to NT$1 billion, which means that within two years, the
participants get their money back, proving that energy-saving businesses can be
both meaningful and profitable.</P>
      <P>The results also show that convenience stores, the first type of business to
enter the campaign in 2006, have already reduced 22 percent of their total
energy consumption rate, saving 2.9 million kwh of energy and reducing 18,400
tons of CO2 per year, which equals to the yearly carbon absorption of the
28,400-hectare Yangmingshan National Park, an astonishing accomplishment, said
Yiin.</P>
      <P>The four most energy-efficient convenience stores are Uni-President, FamilyMart,
Hi-Life and OK Mart, according to the Bureau of Energy.</P>
      <P>The seven supermarkets that participated in the campaign were Pxmart, Wellcome,
Matsusei, Taiwan Fresh Supermarket, Tung Kuan, Ken &amp; Kuma and Civil
Community Market.</P>
      <P>The 12 shopping malls were The Mall, TaiMall, Metro Walk, the Breeze Center,
Living Mall, Taichung Central Mall, Tiger City, Taipei 101, SugarMall, Miramar,
Global Mall and Dream Mall.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that representatives of victims of Typhoon
Morakot are welcome to take part in reconstruction committees organized by the
central government or local authorities, so as to help speed up the process of
resettlement and rebuilding.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks during a visit to a reception center temporarily
set up by Shunshien Temple in Kaohsiung County's Neimen Village for victims from
neighboring Namasia Village, which was devastated by the typhoon earlier this
month.</P>
      <P>Victims erected banners expressing their demands, such as "We want to
participate in reconstruction panels."</P>
      <P>Ma had flown to Namasia Village on a helicopter to gain a better understanding
of the damage caused by Morakot there. Two out of three towns in Namasia are
seriously damaged by mudslide stirred up by the typhoon and are no longer
suitable for people to live in.</P>
      <P>"Three townships have to be relocated and the complex task must be thoroughly
assessed by experts.  Residents' willingness and decision must be fully
respected," said the president.</P>
      <P>Ma urged the victims to swiftly make a decision on which government auxiliary
measures they would accept so as to help the government launch all necessary
measures as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>"The government has put short-term, medium-term and long-term subsidy and
housing plans in place to re-settle victims made homeless by Morakot, and it
hopes that the victims can quickly choose one option that best serves their
interest so as to allow the government to start ensuing projects swiftly," Ma
said.</P>
      <P>Ma stressed that the government will verify the deceased victims' identities in
a looser way and that their affected family members are not obliged to take on
any rehabilitation or rehoming projects put forward by the government.</P>
      <P>At the reception center, survivors and victims also held up signs saying: "Stop
the cross-region water channeling project to the Tsengwen Reservoir."</P>
      <P>Many typhoon victims blame the water project for destabilizing the mountains
near their villages and causing the deadly mudslides that killed many of their
villagers during Typhoon Morakot, the worst typhoon Taiwan has suffered in 50
years.</P>
      <P>Ma has promised to investigate their claim.</P>
      <P>Minister of National Defense Chen Chao-min, Council of Indigenous Peoples
Chairwoman Chang Jen-shiang and Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing were
also present. Along with Ma, They bowed to the victims and apologized for the
government's much criticized slow response in carrying out rescue and relief
operations in the wake of the typhoon.</P>
      <P>A bill seeking NT$100 billion for reconstruction is currently being screened by
lawmakers at the Legislative Yuan, and the Executive Yuan is set to launch many
rehabilitation projects once the bill clears the legislature, Ma added.</P>
      <P>According to Yang, 2,000 prefabricated houses are being built in Kaohsiung
County to house typhoon victims on a temporary basis, while the Buddhist
Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation has promised to construct 1,000 permanent
homes for the victims.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung, Taitung, Pingtung and Tainan counties are worst damaged by Typhoon
Morakot, which lashed Taiwan from Aug. 7-10. Most of the victims are indigenous
residents in mountain townships.</P>

      <P>Taipei city government officials said Tuesday that they have made every possible
preparation to guard against influenza A(H1N1) next month, when schools open for
the new semester and the city will host the international Deaflympics 2009.</P>
      <P>Amid reports that the new flu is spreading, city health officials said they have
explained  the situation  to staff of hotels, restaurants, games volunteers and
medical stations.</P>
      <P>They said the city authorities have also purchased forehead thermometers  and
will distribute them to hotels to take the temperatures of guests and maintain
daily notification with health officials.</P>
      <P>Alcohol and antiseptic wipes will also be available at hotels and restaurants,
according to the officials.</P>
      <P>Sign-language publicity ads will also be aired at public places such as hotels,
restaurants and MRT stations to spread the message of H1N1 prevention and
control.</P>
      <P>"Currently,  available  resources to fight the disease are abundant, " one
health official said, adding that if tests conducted by medical facilities
confirm anyone of having contracted A(H1N1) , they will be given Tamiflu, which
is covered by national health insurance.</P>
      <P>If athletes taking part in the Deaflympics are infected with the H1N1 virus,
they will also be given Tamiflu despite not being covered by national insurance,
the official added.</P>
      <P>All competition venues will have medical stations and will provide assessments
to athletes who show flu symptoms. The athletes will be sent to hospitals if
necessary and doctors accompanying each team will decide whether they will
suspend events as a result.</P>
      <P>On the issue of class suspensions after schools open, the officials said they
will follow the advice provided by the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC).</P>
      <P>The CECC advises that all schools, kindergartens, cram schools and day care
institutions with two or more students in one class who have been diagnosed with
A(H1N1) within three days will be closed for five days. Flu victims will only be
allowed to return to school 24 hours after the symptoms disappear.</P>
      <P>According to statistics provided by the CECC, Taiwan had recorded 70 cases of
serious swine flu as of Monday -- 10 in Taipei -- with five fatalities.</P>
      <P>The city government will make policy adjustments by keeping tabs on the swine

      <P>In a report released Tuesday, the company stated that the banks were able to
maintain good asset quality because of multi-year deleveraging by Taiwanese
households and corporations before the financial crisis hit in 2008.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the rating agency warned that the banking sector's large credit
exposure to the troubled dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chip makers remains
a significant threat to their asset quality over the short and medium term.</P>
      <P>Local DRAM chip makers have all been losing money for most of the past year
because of oversupply, while demand for chips have declined in the face of the
global economic crisis.</P>
      <P>Although local banks have done a good job in maintaining their asset quality in
the first half of this year, other factors, including Taiwan's persistent
economic slump, weak profit margins and high credit costs, could drive down
their profits, said Jonathan Lee, senior director of the financial institutions
group at Fitch Ratings Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's banking and financial reform plan may have been postponed because of
the sharp economic recession from the fourth quarter of last year and the recent
damage caused by Typhoon Morakot, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>Over the next two to three years, Taiwan would not likely see mergers of large
state-owned banks, Lee predicted.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan will work at a post-Typhoon Morakot reconstruction
office in southern Taiwan for one week from Wednesday to coordinate relief and
rehabilitation efforts, Government Information Office Minister Su Jun-pin said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Liu will help chiefs and deputy chiefs of government agencies in charge of post-
disaster reconstruction  work at the office to facilitate the distribution of
relief subsidies, resettlement and reconstruction work, according to Su.</P>
      <P>The initiative is aimed at providing a platform for Cabinet chiefs and officials
to exchange views with residents of areas in southern Taiwan affected by the
typhoon on reconstruction-related issues, he added.</P>
      <P>The government also hopes to strengthen communication and coordination with
displaced victims of the typhoon in terms of resettlement operations, he went
on.</P>
      <P>The premier will ask relevant  agencies to map out plans pertaining to future
typhoons and torrential rain in Morakot-affected areas during this year's
typhoon season.</P>
      <P>He will also preside over an Aug. 27 Cabinet meeting in Taipei as scheduled and
will attend other important meetings in Taipei, such as those in relation to
A(H1N1) influenza, according to Su.</P>
      <P>"In principle, Liu will stay in southern Taiwan but will return to Taipei for
important meetings," Su added.</P>
      <P>In a related development, Control Yuan President Wang Chien-hsuan said the
country's highest watchdog body will release a report in six months on its
investigation into who should be held responsible for the administration's
flawed response to the typhoon, which killed an estimated 500 people and left
hundreds more homeless.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Nearly 40,000 patients infected with swine flu: CDC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Close to 40,000 people in Taiwan have contracted influenza A(H1N1) since early
June, with a majority of them developing only mild symptoms, Department of
Health (DOH) Minister Yang Chi-liang, who serves as chief of the Central
Epidemic Command Center, said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Citing estimates by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the DOH, Yang
said about 38,000 people have been infected over the past three months around
the country, with some 12,000 getting the virus last week alone.</P>
      <P>Yang admitted that the epidemic, widely known as swine flu, is gradually
spreading as had been previously forecast, but he added that "it will be OK if
patients take medicine early enough."</P>
      <P>"Around 70 percent of the people infected with the influenza A(HINI) virus will
recover without taking anti-virals, " he noted.</P>
      <P>The DOH's top concern at present, Yang went on, is to stave off a massive
outbreak of A(H1N1), as it had initially succeeded in stemming the spread of the
disease.</P>
      <P>According to CDC Director-General Kuo Hsu-sung, there have been only 44
pneumonia cases induced by swine flu in Taiwan. Twenty-two of them have
recovered, five have died, five are still in intensive care units and five are
in normal wards.</P>
      <P>"Swine flu does not necessarily lead to death from pneumonia, " Kuo said,
pointing out that last year, Taiwan recorded 8,000 deaths caused by pneumonia,
while for last week alone, there were 183 such cases, only two of which were
induced by swine flu.</P>
      <P>"Compared to the same period of last year, the number of pneumonia deaths linked
to swine flu has not markedly increased, but the possibility of further deaths
cannot be ruled out for the whole of this year," he added.</P>
      <P>Kuo forecast that the first wave of swine flu will hit hard after schools begin
the new semester in early September. However, he went on, the impact will be
minimized as long as schools follow due procedure to stop classes for five days
if "two cases are confirmed in three days in the same class."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Adimmune Corp., Taiwan's only producer of swine flu vaccine, said it
had begun mass production of vaccine and that the first batch of 5 million doses
will be ready by the middle of September.</P>
      <P>A vaccination program is expected to kick off in mid-November, once the drug's
safety can be proven by the authorities, a company manager said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile that day, Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said President Ma
Ying-jeou had decided not to call a national security meeting for the time being
to address the swine flu issue, despite grave public concern that the situation
might spiral out of control.</P>
      <P>The president made the decision upon the advice of Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, who
had discussed the matter with epidemic experts, who assessed that the situation
did not merit such a meeting, according to Wang.</P>

heavy machinery to disaster areas, " Ma said during a meeting with visiting
Oklahoma Governor Brad Henry at the Presidential Office.</P>

      <P>Agricultural losses from Typhoon Morakot had surged to NT$15.81 billion
(US$540.55 million) as of Tuesday, according to statistics released that day by

      <P>The COA said that Morakot, which pummeled Taiwan Aug. 7-9, caused serious damage
to the agricultural sector in 11 counties, with Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties
in southern Taiwan and Hualien and Taitung counties in the east the hardest hit.</P>
      <P>The statistics show that damage to crops had amounted to NT$4.47 billion, with
27 percent of the crops on 74,997 hectares of farmland wiped out.</P>
      <P>Bananas suffered the heaviest damage, with 6,307 hectares ravaged by strong

custard apples and leafy vegetables. Bee losses amounted to NT$6.9 million.</P>
      <P>Over 148,273 pigs, nearly 6.11 million chickens and around 1.54 million ducks
perished in floods caused by the storm, bringing the total livestock losses to
NT$1.48 billion, the COA said.</P>
      <P>Damage to the aquaculture sector had amounted to NT$4.17 billion, the heaviest
loss in 19 years, according to the statistics, with stock in some 9,162 hectares
of fishponds or coastal areas washed away, it said.</P>
      <P>Over 2,512 hectares of forestry was destroyed, while damage to all agricultural

      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Tuesday that the city government will decide
whether to shut down the problematic Muzha-Neihu MRT line indefinitely after an
inspection and repair program over the weekend.</P>
      <P>The new line, which began commercial services July 4, has been a source of
embarrassment to the Taipei city government, with constant shutdowns due to
system failures.</P>
      <P>A 56-hour suspension of operations last weekend for inspection and repair
apparently failed to guarantee a smooth return to service, when a southbound
train ground to a complete halt during rush hour Tuesday morning.</P>
      <P>Replying to press inquiries regarding the latest half-hour shutdown, Hau said
that problems with the brake and propulsion systems on one section caused the
breakdown.</P>
      <P>The Muzha-Neihu MRT line has been suspended twice over previous weekends for
inspection and repair following numerous breakdowns. The contractor,  Canada's
Bombardier, will conduct another thorough inspection this coming weekend.</P>

      <P>The Taiwanese chapter of the Christian charity World Vision said Tuesday that it
will invest over NT$1.2 billion (US$36.5 million) in emergency relief and
rehabilitation programs in the wake of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Hank Du, executive director of World Vision Taiwan, made the announcement at a
news conference that same day in which he gave an update on the organization's
relief operations in the storm-stricken areas and announced long-term
rehabilitation plans to help the affected people return to normal life as soon
as possible.</P>
      <P>Noting that World Vision Taiwan plans to build 1,200 temporary homes for the
storm victims in Taitung, Pingtung, Kaohsiung and Chiayi counties, Du said the
temporary homes can be easily assembled by untrained personnel with simple hand
tools and that once the land is ready, these homes can be completed in two or
three weeks.</P>
      <P>The homes will be made of different local materials such as bamboo and slate, Du
went on, adding that the construction materials are light, environmentally
friendly and reusable.</P>
      <P>"We have worked with aboriginal people for a long time. We understand their
cultures and needs. World Vision's housing plan is particularly suitable for
them," Du went on.</P>
      <P>"The housing project will be implemented with a cash-for-work mechanism, so the
beneficiaries can participate in the construction of their own homes," he added.</P>
      <P>The organization will provide educational aid as well as living subsidies for
children affected by the typhoon and will continue to set up "Child Friendly
Spaces" for children.</P>
      <P>Since the disaster caused by Morakot, World Vision Taiwan has received NT$57.4
million from both individuals and corporations, as well as receiving support
from other countries such as the United States, Canada, Hong Kong and Singapore.</P>
      <P>Shelter Box, a British charity organization, has donated 324 tents to World
Vision through Rotary International to provide additional temporary housing for
affected families.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Yen-Shen, Rotary International D3480 district governor, said the tents can
provide shelter until more stable and permanent houses are constructed.</P>

      <P>"We have worked with aboriginal people for a long time. We understand their
cultures and needs. World Vision's housing plan is particularly suitable for
them," Du went on.</P>
      <P>"The housing project will be implemented with a cash-for-work mechanism, so the
beneficiaries can participate in the construction of their own homes," he added.</P>
      <P>The organization will provide educational aid as well as living subsidies for
children affected by the typhoon and will continue to set up "Child Friendly
Spaces" for children.</P>
      <P>Since the disaster caused by Morakot, World Vision Taiwan has received NT$57.4
million from both individuals and corporations, as well as receiving support
from other countries such as the United States, Canada, Hong Kong and Singapore.</P>
      <P>Shelter Box, a British charity organization, has donated 324 tents to World
Vision through Rotary International to provide additional temporary housing for
affected families.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Yen-Shen, Rotary International D3480 district governor, said the tents can
provide shelter until more stable and permanent houses are constructed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Nearly 40,000 patients infected with swine flu: CDC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Close to 40,000 people in Taiwan have contracted influenza A(H1N1) since early
June, with a majority of them developing only mild symptoms, Department of
Health (DOH) Minister Yang Chi-liang, who serves as chief of the Central
Epidemic Command Center, said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Citing estimates by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the DOH, Yang
said about 38,000 people have been infected over the past three months around
the country, with some 12,000 getting the virus last week alone.</P>
      <P>Yang admitted that the epidemic, widely known as swine flu, is gradually
spreading as had been previously forecast, but he added that "it will be OK if
patients take medicine early enough."</P>
      <P>"Around 70 percent of the people infected with the influenza A(HINI) virus will
recover without taking anti-virals, " he noted.</P>
      <P>The DOH's top concern at present, Yang went on, is to stave off a massive
outbreak of A(H1N1), as it had initially succeeded in stemming the spread of the
disease.</P>
      <P>According to CDC Director-General Kuo Hsu-sung, there have been only 44
pneumonia cases induced by swine flu in Taiwan. Twenty-two of them have
recovered, five have died, five are still in intensive care units and five are
in normal wards.</P>
      <P>"Swine flu does not necessarily lead to death from pneumonia, " Kuo said,
pointing out that last year, Taiwan recorded 8,000 deaths caused by pneumonia,
while for last week alone, there were 183 such cases, only two of which were
induced by swine flu.</P>
      <P>"Compared to the same period of last year, the number of pneumonia deaths linked
to swine flu has not markedly increased, but the possibility of further deaths
cannot be ruled out for the whole of this year," he added.</P>
      <P>Kuo forecast that the first wave of swine flu will hit hard after schools begin
the new semester in early September. However, he went on, the impact will be
minimized as long as schools follow due procedure to stop classes for five days
if "two cases are confirmed in three days in the same class."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Adimmune Corp., Taiwan's only producer of swine flu vaccine, said it
had begun mass production of vaccine and that the first batch of 5 million doses
will be ready by the middle of September.</P>
      <P>A vaccination program is expected to kick off in mid-November, once the drug's
safety can be proven by the authorities, a company manager said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile that day, Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said President Ma
Ying-jeou had decided not to call a national security meeting for the time being
to address the swine flu issue, despite grave public concern that the situation
might spiral out of control.</P>
      <P>The president made the decision upon the advice of Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, who
had discussed the matter with epidemic experts, who assessed that the situation
did not merit such a meeting, according to Wang.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan will work at a post-Typhoon Morakot reconstruction
office in southern Taiwan for one week from Wednesday to coordinate relief and
rehabilitation efforts, Government Information Office Minister Su Jun-pin said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Liu will help chiefs and deputy chiefs of government agencies in charge of post-
disaster reconstruction  work at the office to facilitate the distribution of
relief subsidies, resettlement and reconstruction work, according to Su.</P>
      <P>The initiative is aimed at providing a platform for Cabinet chiefs and officials
to exchange views with residents of areas in southern Taiwan affected by the
typhoon on reconstruction-related issues, he added.</P>
      <P>The government also hopes to strengthen communication and coordination with
displaced victims of the typhoon in terms of resettlement operations, he went
on.</P>
      <P>The premier will ask relevant  agencies to map out plans pertaining to future
typhoons and torrential rain in Morakot-affected areas during this year's
typhoon season.</P>
      <P>He will also preside over an Aug. 27 Cabinet meeting in Taipei as scheduled and
will attend other important meetings in Taipei, such as those in relation to
A(H1N1) influenza, according to Su.</P>
      <P>"In principle, Liu will stay in southern Taiwan but will return to Taipei for
important meetings," Su added.</P>
      <P>In a related development, Control Yuan President Wang Chien-hsuan said the
country's highest watchdog body will release a report in six months on its
investigation into who should be held responsible for the administration's
flawed response to the typhoon, which killed an estimated 500 people and left
hundreds more homeless.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Tuesday that the city government will decide
whether to shut down the problematic Muzha-Neihu MRT line indefinitely after an
inspection and repair program over the weekend.</P>
      <P>The new line, which began commercial services July 4, has been a source of
embarrassment to the Taipei city government, with constant shutdowns due to
system failures.</P>
      <P>A 56-hour suspension of operations last weekend for inspection and repair
apparently failed to guarantee a smooth return to service, when a southbound

      <P>Replying to press inquiries regarding the latest half-hour shutdown, Hau said
that problems with the brake and propulsion systems on one section caused the
breakdown.</P>
      <P>The Muzha-Neihu MRT line has been suspended twice over previous weekends for

      <P>Agricultural losses from Typhoon Morakot had surged to NT$15.81 billion
(US$540.55 million) as of Tuesday, according to statistics released that day by
the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>The COA said that Morakot, which pummeled Taiwan Aug. 7-9, caused serious damage
to the agricultural sector in 11 counties, with Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties
in southern Taiwan and Hualien and Taitung counties in the east the hardest hit.</P>
      <P>The statistics show that damage to crops had amounted to NT$4.47 billion, with
27 percent of the crops on 74,997 hectares of farmland wiped out.</P>
      <P>Bananas suffered the heaviest damage, with 6,307 hectares ravaged by strong
winds and flooding, followed by papayas, guavas, rice, bamboo shoots, orchids,
custard apples and leafy vegetables. Bee losses amounted to NT$6.9 million.</P>
      <P>Over 148,273 pigs, nearly 6.11 million chickens and around 1.54 million ducks
perished in floods caused by the storm, bringing the total livestock losses to
NT$1.48 billion, the COA said.</P>
      <P>Damage to the aquaculture sector had amounted to NT$4.17 billion, the heaviest
loss in 19 years, according to the statistics, with stock in some 9,162 hectares
of fishponds or coastal areas washed away, it said.</P>
      <P>Over 2,512 hectares of forestry was destroyed, while damage to all agricultural
and fishery facilities amounted to NT$5.44 billion.</P>
      <P>Damage to the fishery sector had surpassed NT$488 million, with the worst damage
reported in Tainan City and Pingtung County.</P>
      <P>The tallies also show that a total of 5,140 hectares of farmland had been either

      <P>Representatives of China's beauty industry received anti-aging treatments at two
Taipei hospitals Wednesday as part of their fact-finding tour of Taiwan's
cosmetic dermatology sector.</P>
      <P>Among the services offered to the visitors by the Taipei Veterans General
Hospital and the West Garden Hospital's Eonway Health Maintenance  Center  were
botox cosmetic  injections  and skin rejuvenation procedures.</P>
      <P>Huang Ming-shun, a marketing official at the center, said each of the customers
spent NT$5,000 (US$152) to NT$10,000 on the services.</P>
      <P>The delegation is comprised of 121 professionals from China's beauty sector who
arrived in Taiwan Tuesday for a six-day visit at the invitation of the Taiwan
External Trade Development Council (TAITRA).</P>
      <P>Lin Tsai-hsia, chairwoman of the Taiwan-invested Best Lady Beauty Body Co. in
Guangzhou, who helped organize the tour, said the group consists mainly of
owners and managers of beauty businesses from Chengdu, Fuzhou, Shenyang and
Shanxi.</P>
      <P>The cosmetic dermatology tour will allow them to learn from Taiwan's success and
prepare them for building a cosmetic dermatology industry in China, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The delegates, who had attended a conference in Hong Kong prior to their
arrival, are also expected to take part in the Taipei In Style 2009 fashion
exhibition set for Aug. 28-30 and visit various tourist spots in Taipei, Taoyuan
and Kaohsiung during their stay.</P>
      <P>TAITRA Vice Chairman Wu Wen-ya estimated that the delegation will generate more
than NT$10 million in tourism and cosmetic dermatology revenues for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that medium to high end physical examinations as well as cosmetic
dermatology services are two main highlights of Taiwan's medical tourism
industry, with China being the greatest potential market.</P>
      <P>With mesotherapy  becoming  increasingly  popular in China, non-surgical
cosmetic treatments that produce immediate benefits at reasonable prices are
especially attractive to business people and office workers there, Wu said.</P>
      <P>However, many female executives from China prefer receiving the treatments in
Taiwan because Taiwan's law requires the procedures to be performed by licensed
physicians, Wu said.</P>
      <P>In addition, many of Taiwan's medical institutions run health examination and
cosmetic dermatology centers that provide a welcoming environment and services
comparable to a five-star hotel, which make the guests feel at home, he said.</P>
      <P>In the future, Wu said, TAITRA will organize similar tours that will allow
Chinese visitors  to receive  health checkups  and mesotherapy treatments in
hospitals in southern Taiwan to help them better understand Taiwan's medical
technology.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials
Wednesday:</P>
      <P>APPLE DAILY::</P>
      <P>New flu crisis</P>
      <P>The medical sector has estimated that swine flu infections could peak between
November and next January, and that 30 percent of Taiwan's population, or 7
million people, could be infected.</P>
      <P>The figure is terrible.  After the opening of schools in September, the cross
infection is expected to be serious.</P>
      <P>The Ma administration should learn something from its bungled response to
Typhoon Morakot, which triggered the worst flooding and mudslides in Taiwan in
half a century.</P>
      <P>An erratic command mechanism has been one cause of expanded disasters. If the Ma
administration can make prior preparations and efficiently deal with the
possible outbreak, it can save some of the face it lost in its incompetent
handling of the rescue and relief mission during the typhoon.</P>
      <P>CHINA TIMES:</P>
      <P>Disaster prevention the military's 'core mission'</P>
      <P>The military's bungled response to the serious flooding triggered by Typhoon
Morakot has been severely criticized. To regain the public trust, it will have
to reinforce its non-warfare military operations capability -- a concept first
initiated by the United States in 1993.</P>
      <P>Since the Sept. 21, 1999 earthquake and the SARS outbreak in 2003, Taiwan has
listed disaster prevention and relief as one of the military's major missions.</P>
      <P>But despite that, the military did not follow world trends or understand the
people's urgent needs, treating disaster relief as a side job, which left it
unprepared for the most serious flooding in half a century.</P>
      <P>After President Ma Ying-jeou and the Defense Ministry were harshly criticized,
the president finally declared that disaster relief should be the military's
"core mission."</P>
      <P>The people want action, and if the performance of the military lets the public
down again, then it will not be long before another political transfer of power
occurs.</P>
      <P>UNITEd DAILY NEWS:</P>
      <P>Stay aloof, but not alone</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has said three things that impress the public. He said
that he would "retreat to the second line," drawing a clear line of distinction
between himself and the Executive Yuan. He also said that he "absolutely will
not assume the party chairmanship, drawing a clear line of distinction between
himself and the KMT.</P>
      <P>Then, lastly, he will not issue an emergency decree.</P>
      <P>Ma is consistent in thought -- he wants to restrain his power and let the law
and system prevail -- but Typhoon Morakot completely crushed his utopian vision.</P>
      <P>He now goes to the frontlines of flood-affected areas every day. He serves
concurrently not only as party chairman, but also as premier, and city and even
borough head.</P>
      <P>He has not issued an emergency decree, but he is now caught in an emergency
situation.</P>
      <P>Ma's ideas might represent a lofty vision in some respects, but they do not suit
today's Taiwan. By staying aloof and appointing law-abiding officials who are
incapable of coping with emergencies, he has painted himself into a corner.</P>
      <P>Although Ma stands aloof, we think his ideas, will,  and sentiments must be
instilled in his team so that it can operate efficiently.</P>
      <P>LIBERTY TIMES:</P>
      <P>Ma's promise to make Taiwan the centerpiece faces test</P>
      <P>The DGBAS recently announced that the jobless rate in July has hit 6.07 percent,
while average real earnings growth in the first half of the year fell 6.84
percent, returning to the 1996 level.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou made "6-3-3"-- an economic growth of six percent, a per
capita income of US$30,000 a year and a jobless rate of under 3 percent -- his
campaign promise, and he failed to deliver it in just one year.</P>
      <P>He also advocated direct transportation and the opening of Chinese tourists, but
the jobless rate rose to more than 6 percent from around 4 percent a year ago
even though both goals were achieved.</P>
      <P>But after the bounced campaign check, and the disaster of Typhoon Morakot, Ma's
approval rating has plunged to lower than 20 percent.</P>
      <P>To stem the sliding approval rating,  he has resorted to sacrificing more of
Taiwan's interests by pushing for the signing of an economic cooperation
framework agreement with China.</P>
      <P>The typhoon should serve as a warning, and if Ma insists on his own way and
continues to tilt toward China, the outlook of Taiwan will be even more
pessimistic, and his approval rating will fall to a new low.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Automatic rainfall reporting system to help with landslide alerts</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.26 (CNA)
08/26/09  15:38:01
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese research team has developed a wireless rainfall reporting system
that will help authorities issue more precise mudslide warnings and prevent a
recurrence of recent tragedies in which mountain villagers were buried alive by
unexpected landslides.</P>
      <P>In describing the system Wednesday,  researchers  said the automatic rain
measuring and reporting system can be deployed and maintained easily in remote
mountainous regions at a relatively low cost.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently still relies on volunteers to report rainfall levels recorded
at various precipitation gauge stations, which meteorologists then use to issue
landslide warnings.</P>
      <P>"The new system does not need humans to operate it. It can easily transmit
rainfall information back to the central control system or the Central Weather
Bureau, " King Chung-ta, a professor in National Tsinghua University's
Department of Computer Science said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>King, who played a key role in the development of the wireless rain gauge
reporting system, said the system can also be linked up with Google Map or
Microsoft's Sensor Map to display real-time rainfall data at specific locations.</P>
      <P>The key to the system lies in using multi-hop transmission technology to
overcome the possible inaccessibility of mobile phone services, King explained.</P>
      <P>"Aided by multi-hop routing, the system can deliver rainfall data to a base
station from where the data can be turned into short messages for delivery to
the central control center to help it more accurately forecast landslides," King
explained.</P>
      <P>Because the equipment and the installation cost of the new system are both
cheaper  than the cost of setting up a traditional precipitation collection
station, King argued that the new system should be deployed extensively in the
1,500 areas around Taiwan vulnerable to mudslides.</P>
      <P>"By so doing, we can collect more comprehensive rainfall data to help local
meteorologists make more precise weather forecasts and mudslide alerts," King
said.</P>
      <P>That would prevent having hundreds of people buried alive in mudslides in remote
mountainous villages as occurred earlier this month in Kaohsiung County after
Typhoon Morakot dumped a staggering amount of rainfall in the area.</P>
      <P>While the Central Weather Bureau accurately predicted the coming of the typhoon,
critics said the brueau fell short of doing a good job in offering timely
mudslide alerts in potentially vulnerable areas.</P>
      <P>The research team, composed of researchers from National Tsinghua University and
Feng Chia University, began developing the system three years ago with funding
from the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>King said the team has developed a prototype which has proven effective in
trials on the Feng Chia University campus and at other outdoor locations.</P>
      <P>"We hope the government can cooperate with the industrial sector to mass produce
this new equipment and deploy it extensively to enhance the accuracy of
landslide warnings," he said, adding that the cost for mass producing the device
is estimated at no more than NT$2,000 (US$60.6) apiece.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The eventual scale of a budget put forward by the Executive Yuan to carry out
reconstruction projects after Typhoon Morakot swept Taiwan will be decided by
the legislature, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Although the Executive Yuan has referred a special reconstruction bill worth
NT$100 billion (US$3.03 billion) to the Legislative Yuan to seek its approval
before it can start reconstruction tasks, Wang pointed out that the legislature
has the final say on the scale of the budget.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while answering questions from reporters on whether the
Legislative Yuan will pass a budget of more than NT$100 billion.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet's version of the bill proposes a NT$100 billion budget to finance
the special reconstruction  bill,  while an opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) version calls for double that amount -- NT$200 billion or more --
with no upper limit.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, five representatives from the Presidential Office, the
Executive Yuan and the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) have exchanged views on
reconstruction efforts and have reached consensus that the scale of the budget
could be increased depending on actual needs.</P>
      <P>Commenting  on whether the government  should finance  the reconstruction
projects through public borrowing or by selling NT$40 billion worth of stocks of
the state-owned Land Bank of Taiwan to manage the funds for the rehabilitation
work, Wang said many legislators are not in favor of the stock sales proposal.</P>
      <P>The bank can earn a profit of NT$2.4 billion every year for the national
coffers, but the Executive Yuan would only have to pay interest of NT$600
million to NT$700 million per year for any loans it takes out, he explained.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the Land Bank of Taiwan's workers' union have demanded that
Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der resign from his post to take responsibility for
the government's idea of selling the profitable state-owned bank as a means of
seeking funds for its post-typhoon rehabilitation projects.</P>
      <P>They demanded that Lee step down for trying to sell the bank for a sum it could
earn in less than four years.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Legislative Yuan had opened an extraordinary three-day session a
day earlier to screen the special reconstruction bill, and hopes to approve the
bill Thursday before the meeting ends so as to help victims of Typhoon Morakot
rebuild their homes as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Morakot brought severe flooding and mudslides to southern Taiwan Aug. 7-10, with
the death doll recorded at 292 people, while another 385 were still missing,
mostly residents buried by a landslide in Siaolin village in Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>Morakot also caused tens of billions of dollars worth of losses in the
agricultural, livestock and aquaculture sectors, sending prices of vegetables,
fruit, fish and meat soaring in Taiwan's retail markets.</P>

      <P>In an effort to accelerate the recovery of the tourism sector in eastern
Taiwan's typhoon-devastated Taitung, the East Coast National Scenic Area
Administration has decided to offer tourist subsidies on cycle tours in the
area, the Tourism Bureau said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The flood disaster after Typhoon Morakot did not cause too much damage in
Taitung's scenic areas, " said Yang Wen-ta, president of the Taitung Tourism
Association.</P>
      <P>Even though the six-floor Jinshuai Hotel toppled into a river and stores nearby
were washed away by a landslide in Jhihben township, other hot spring hotels in
the worst-hit areas of Taitung have already resumed normal operations, he noted.</P>
      <P>Despite this, Taitung's hotel industry has suffered from low occupancy since the
flooding, with few tourists coming to the city, he said.</P>
      <P>To promote tourism in the area, the bureau, in cooperation with two local travel
agencies, has been promoting cycle ecotourism packages, including bicycle
holidays on outlying Green Island, as well as offering subsidies of NT$500
(US$15) per tourist until Nov. 30.</P>
      <P>In addition, the East Coast National Scenic Area Administration is to host a
National Day cycling event in cooperation with one of Taiwan's leading bicycle
manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Participants in the event will tie yellow ribbons to their bikes, pedal down the
east coast of Taiwan and pray for the people of Taitung.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No new foot-and-mouth cases since vaccinations resumed</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>There have been no new cases of foot-and- mouth disease (FMD) in Taiwan since
the start of August after the animal health authorities resumed vaccinations of
pigs, a government agency reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>After the authorities restarted FMD vaccinations for pigs aged 12-14 weeks from
early this month in bid to stave off a fresh outbreak of the epidemic, Taiwan
has not reported any new cases, said the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
Inspection and Quarantine under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>Chiu Chui-chang, a bureau section chief, said pigs of that age are vulnerable to
FMD and need to be vaccinated against the disease. The amount of FMD vaccine
used in August was more than double the amount used the previous month, he
added.</P>
      <P>Before the resumption of vaccinations, only sporadic FMD cases were reported
from different regions to the bureau in the last year, but the bureau decided to
re-impose the practice in an effort to make Taiwan an FMD-free country
recognized by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) with a zero-
vaccination rate, bureau officials said.</P>
      <P>Until late last year, 90 percent of the pigs on 12,000 farms around the country
had stopped receiving FMD vaccinations, moving Taiwan toward the zero-injection
rate required by the OIE, they noted.</P>
      <P>FMD first broke out in Taiwan in 1997, brought into the country by hogs smuggled
from China, and the bureau was forced to mandate the vaccination of all pigs to
curtail the spread of the epidemic in Taiwan from that year onward, bureau
officials said.</P>
      <P>With the inoculation measure back in place, the officials said it will now take
Taiwan several more years to achieve its goal of becoming recognized as a
country free from FMD, they said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan used to raise as many as 12 million pigs per year, 7 million of which
were exported to Japan, according to COA officials. Taiwan now raises only about
6.4 million pigs a year, mainly for local consumption, they noted.</P>

      <P>Health authorities urged the public Wednesday not to panic over the influenza
A(H1N1) situation, in the wake of a forecast that put the projected fatalities
from the new flu strain in Taiwan at 7,000.</P>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang, who serves concurrently as
head of the Central Epidemics Command Center (CECC), pointed out that most
influenza A(H1N1) cases recorded in Taiwan so far have been mild infections and
that only a minority of patients have developed serious complications.</P>
      <P>"The public should be careful, but there is no need to panic," Yaung said.</P>
      <P>Noting that epidemiologists around the world have made various predictions on
the development of influenza A(H1N1) outbreaks, Yaung said the CECC believes
there are no right or wrong predictions and the center is not going to comment
on any of them.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou is closely watching the situation and will meet with
infectious disease experts Thursday to discuss related prevention and control
measures, the minister said.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, Academia Sinica scholar Chen Chien-jen, who is a former minister of
health, predicted that the outbreak is likely to affect one third of Taiwan's
population. With a hypothetical death rate of 0.1 percent, the outbreak could
result in 7,000 deaths, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Addressing the issue Wednesday, Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Director-
General Steve Kuo said the prediction was probably based on a previous forecast
by the World Health Organization that the new flu strain could infect one third
of the world's population.</P>
      <P>Although the new strain is currently responsible for one third of flu infections
in Taiwan, it "would be too imprecise" to infer that one third of the country's
population would become infected, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>The CDC's tracking of the disease has shown that in the past week, approximately
7,000 people per day had sought medical attention with flu-like symptoms. Of
that number, 2,100, or 29 percent, were found to be infected with influenza
A(H1N1).</P>
      <P>The CDC estimates that the total number of people in Taiwan infected with the
virus has reached 40,000.</P>
      <P>As of Wednesday, 47 severe infections had been recorded in the country, five of
which have resulted in death, Kuo said. Ten of these 47 patients are still in
hospital, while 32 have recovered and have been discharged, he added.</P>
      <P>These figures demonstrate that most influenza A(H1N1) infections are mild and
that most severe infections are curable, he said.</P>
      <P>According to virologist Michael Ming-chiao Lai of National Cheng Kung
University, the public should not be scared, because the severity of influenza
A(N1H)1 is similar to seasonal flu.</P>
      <P>The lack of immunity among the majority of people is what has increased the
virus's epidemic potential, Lai explained.</P>
      <P>Also Wednesday, the military reported three cases of influenza A(H1N1)
infections among naval servicemen, bringing to 44 the total number of recorded
cases involving military personnel since July 27.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party announced that it will
hold a meeting with a group of former Cabinet members Friday to advise the Ma
administration on measures that should be taken to prevent a major outbreak.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said his party is strongly opposed to President
Ma's decision not to hold a national security meeting to deal with the influenza
A(H1N1) situation, which he said indicates that Ma could be underestimating the
potential danger of the disease.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Flood victims living in shelters to move into military barracks</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing said Wednesday his administration
will begin relocating typhoon victims this week from shelters to four military
barracks in the southern Taiwanese county to provide them with a better living
environment and to prevent the spread of the A(H1N1) flu.</P>
      <P>Yang said he hopes the relocation can be completed by Aug. 31.</P>
      <P>According to the county government, around 3,000 people can be accommodated at
the military barracks, each of which houses for four, six or eight people.</P>
      <P>The barracks are believed to be able to allow the victims of the flooding and
mudslides, triggered by Typhoon Morakot earlier this month, to live more
comfortably, county officials said.</P>
      <P>They are also aimed at preventing the spread of A(H1N1) or swine flu, which has
infected a greater number of people in Taiwan in recent days.</P>
      <P>According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Taiwan has so far recorded
five deaths from the new flu virus and nearly 40,000 people infected, with the
rate of infection at 14,000 new cases a week.</P>
      <P>There are currently 30 shelters for flood victims in Kaohsiung County, one of
the areas hardest hit by the worst typhoon in Taiwan in 50 years.</P>
      <P>Wu Li-shueh, director of the county department of social affairs, said the first
batch of 1,000 people to be relocated to the military barracks will be those
currently sheltered  at the Fokuanshan Monastery and other local temples.</P>
      <P>They are people from Taoyuan and Namasia townships who were rendered homeless by
the floods and mudslides, Wu said.</P>
      <P>As of 6 p.m. Wednesday, the death toll caused by the typhoon devastation which
struck from Aug. 7-9 has reached 46l, while the number of missing people was at
192, with another 46 people injured, according to governmental statistics.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Local governments urged to take precautions against next storm</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou  urged local governments Wednesday to take precautions
against the next typhoon, which is forecast to hit Taiwan in the coming month.</P>
      <P>The president issued the instruction during an inspection of the Dahu disaster
zone in Chiayi County's Fanlu township, which is still recovering from the
devastation wrought by Typhoon Morakot that pummeled Taiwan Aug. 7-9.</P>
      <P>"As the Central Weather Bureau has forecast that another typhoon believed to be
stronger than Morakot is likely to strike Taiwan in the coming month, we should
brace ourselves, as the situation could worsen," Ma said in a meeting with Dahu
villagers.</P>
      <P>At the start of the meeting, Ma led central government officials in ritual
bowing to formally apologize to the villagers for his administration's flawed
disaster relief operations in the early stages.</P>
      <P>Fanlu township chief Lo Yin-chang briefed Ma on Morakot-triggered damage in the
township, which is located in the mountainous Alishan region.</P>
      <P>According to Lo, a total of 1,280 households comprising 3,352 people in the
township's four villages -- Dahu, Gungtien, Gungsing and Caoshan -- fell victim
to the storm, with their homes severely damaged or buried by mudslides.</P>
      <P>Thanks to timely evacuation, however, no fatalities were reported in the
disaster, Lo said proudly.</P>
      <P>Morakot dumped staggering amounts of rainfall on certain parts of southern
Taiwan, with Chiayi County topping the list, receiving nine months of
precipitation in just three days that led to devastating flooding.</P>
      <P>"The rainfall brought by Morakot was the largest amount ever brought by a single
typhoon in 50 years. This phenomenon once again proves that Taiwan's weather
patterns have changed because of global warming, " Ma said. "To tackle the
trend, local governments should craft a standard operating procedure (SOP) for
disaster prevention and relief as well as evacuation of residents in case of
emergency."</P>
      <P>Ma lauded county and township governments for doing a good job in pre-typhoon
precautions  and in persuading residents in areas vulnerable to flooding and
landslides to evacuate before the arrival of Morakot.</P>
      <P>"Such efforts helped minimize human casualties during the storm's onslaught," Ma
said.</P>
      <P>He promised that the central and local governments will cooperate in finding a
suitable plot of land on which the 33 Dahu families whose houses were toppled by
mudslides can build new homes.</P>
      <P>"The site will not be close to flood-prone areas or regions vulnerable to
landslides or other safety risks," Ma pledged.</P>
      <P>On post-disaster  relief  and reconstruction,  Ma said the government will
follow the principles of leniency, promptness and minimal red tape to allow
typhoon-affected people to get their lives back on track as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Ma also paid a visit to Taiho village in Chiayi County's
mountainous Meishan township, where four villagers remained unaccounted for, 38
houses were destroyed and 23 others were severely damaged.</P>
      <P>As the storm washed out all roads to the village, cutting it off completely,
military servicemen suffered delays in getting to the village to carry out
rescue and relief work, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"Once the weather improved, our soldiers immediately got to work on relief and
cleanup operations, " Ma said, expressing his gratitude for the devotion of all
service members.</P>
      <P>Some Meishan residents complained that the serious devastation in the village
mainly resulted from an accumulation of silt and rocks in the Alishan river that
led to a change of the river's flow and washed out the tribal settlement, and
they said they will seek national compensation as a result.</P>
      <P>In response, Ma said he will direct the county government to investigate the
cause and assist residents with compensation claims.</P>
      <P>Chiayi Magistrate Chen Ming-wen, who accompanied Ma on the inspection, also
promised that students at Meishan Elementary School will be able to return to
class Aug. 31 as scheduled, even though the school was seriously damaged in the
storm.</P>
      <P>"A tea-packing facility near Taiho village will provide space to be used for
makeshift classrooms and if necessary, teachers and textbooks will be delivered
to the school by helicopter," Chen added.</P>

      <P>People displaced by Typhoon Morakot and are living in shelters or prefabricated
houses will be the first in the country to be vaccinated against the new strain
of influenza A(H1N1), the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) announced
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The center, which is under the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) ,
decided the order of people to be targeted for vaccination earlier in the day
amid reports of a greater number of infections reported over the past few days.</P>
      <P>Following typhoon victims, frontline medical care personnel were listed as the
next most important group of people to be vaccinated, the CECC said.</P>
      <P>They are followed by pregnant women, children aged 1 to 6, and patients aged 7
or above who suffer from severe diseases or wounds.</P>
      <P>Next on the list are elementary school students, followed by junior high school
students; senior high school students; young people aged 19-24; patients over 25
years old suffering from high-risk diseases such as cardiovascular disease,
diabetes, and diseases on the liver and kidney; healthy adults aged 25-49;
healthy adults aged 50-64; and seniors aged 65 and older.</P>
      <P>According to the state-sponsored Adimmune Corp., Taiwan's only producer of
A(H1N1) flu vaccine, 5 million out of 10 million doses of A(H1N1) vaccine
purchased by the DOH will be delivered by the end of October.</P>
      <P>As a result, the inoculation can be launched in mid-November at the earliest,
after the clinical trials are completed, it said.</P>
      <P>However, the five million doses are only enough for everyone on the priority
list down to and including junior high school students. Those further down the
list will have to wait for the second batch of 5 million doses to become
available by the end of December, Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Director
General Steve Kuo said.</P>
      <P>As the vaccine produced by Adimmune cannot be proven safe for infants under 12
months, they are not included in the vaccination order, CECC deputy commander
Chang Shang-chun said, noting that the DOH will purchase other appropriate
vaccines for the infants.</P>
      <P>There are currently no tests, either on humans or animals, to see if the
Adimmune-produced anti-A(H1N1) vaccines are safe for infants, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Those not on the list also include people who had been infected but recovered
because they already have antibodies against the new flu, he added.</P>
      <P>According to CDC statistics, as of Wednesday, there have been 47 severe
infections on record in Taiwan, five of which have resulted in death.</P>
      <P>Among the severe infections, 16 patients were adults aged 25-49, while 12 were
children aged between 12 months and 6 years. The two groups accounted for 60
percent of the total severe infections.</P>

      <P>The government has decided to exempt borrowers from repaying mortgage balances
on houses completely destroyed or land plots washed away during Typhoon Morakot
earlier this month, officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Premier Liu Chao-shiuan has agreed to have state-owned banks cancel the balance
on those mortgages, " said Executive Yuan spokesman Minister Su Jun-pin.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the Bankers Association of the Republic of
China, the combined outstanding mortgages on the 297 houses completely
destroyed in Morakot-triggered  flooding and landslides slightly exceed NT$700
million (US$21.21 million).</P>
      <P>State-owned banks hold the mortgages for 262 of the houses, which total slightly
more than NT$600 million. Bank of Taiwan is the top creditor with 260 mortgaged
houses, and the remaining two mortgages are held by Land Bank of Taiwan and
Taiwan Cooperative Bank, respectively.</P>
      <P>The other 35 mortgages are held by private banks, with HSBC being the major
creditor, according to the Bankers Association tallies.</P>
      <P>Vice Finance Minister Tseng Ming-tsung said state-owned banks will fully support
the government policy and deal with the mortgage issue in a lenient manner.</P>
      <P>The ministry will also be pleased if state-owned banks decide to write off the
balance of mortgage payments on partially destroyed houses, Tseng said.</P>
      <P>The total outstanding mortgages on houses half-toppled in the storm amounted to
NT$600 million, according to Bankers Association statistics.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Executive  Yuan spokesman  Su said the Bankers Association will
assist in lobbying private banks to follow the rules for state-owned banks in
exempting repayment of outstanding mortgages on houses fully destroyed  or
washed away during the storm's onslaught.</P>
      <P>As most farmers and aquaculture operators tend to mortgage their farmland, fish
ponds and facilities to obtain loans from farmers' or fishermen's associations,
Su said, these associations will write off outstanding mortgages secured by
assets that were washed away by flash floods.</P>

      <P>Warming ties between Taiwan and mainland China could bring opportunities as well
as challenges to Taiwan's top-tier companies, but these corporations may not all
face the same benefits from improved access to China, according to a research
report of the Taiwan Ratings Corp.</P>
      <P>"There is no doubt that the gradual normalization of economic relations between
Taiwan and mainland China will offer new growth opportunities to many of
Taiwan's industries. However, any potential growth is unlikely to be realized
without an increase in credit risks," said the credit rating agency's chief
ratings officer Susan Chu.</P>
      <P>Closer links with China will partly reshape credit profiles of Taiwan's leading
corporations, according to Daniel Hsiao, director of the agency's department of
corporate and funds rating.</P>
      <P>He elaborated that while positive impacts are expected in the transportation,
real estate, petrochemical, semiconductor, packaging and testing as well as flat
panel sectors, the fortune for cement and food processing industries may be
mixed, and electronic components manufacturing and services may be negatively
affected.</P>
      <P>The credit rating agency's research covers Taiwan's top 100 corporations, of
which hi-tech industries account for 53 percent; petrochemical 10 percent; steel
5 percent; retail businesses 4 percent; telecommunications, marine
transportation and food processing each 3 percent; petroleum, cement, textiles
and aviation each 2 percent; automobile 1 percent.</P>
      <P>The research report meanwhile noted that while Taiwan's top corporations' credit
quality were "largely resilient to the current global recession", the existing
adverse factors of declining profitability and rising loan levels had a negative
impact on perceived risk.</P>

      <P>The Dalai Lama has received an invitation from a group of local government
officials to visit Taiwan, and he is ready to immediately embark on the trip,
the Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama confirmed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Thekchen Choeling, secretary general of the office, told CNA by phone that the
matter will be negotiated by the representative office of the Tibetan Government
in Exile and the authorities in Taipei.</P>
      <P>In principle, the Dalai Lama is "very willing" to visit southern Taiwan to show
his deep concern for the victims of Typhoon Morakot, the office said.</P>
      <P>The Tibetan spiritual leader has repeatedly said that he would be very willing
to visit Taiwan again as long as it would not create trouble for the government.</P>
      <P>W. C. Weng, Taiwan's representative to India, told CNA he was aware that the
Dalai Lama had been invited to visit Taiwan, but declined to comment further.</P>
      <P>The invitation was issued jointly by several local government heads from the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party in the wake of Typhoon Morakot. They are
heads of some of the municipalities in areas that were hardest hit by the storm.</P>
      <P>Earlier Wednesday, Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu urged the central government to
permit the Dalai Lama's visit, given that the Tibetan spiritual leader has
agreed to travel to Taiwan to pray for the typhoon victims.</P>
      <P>"The office of the Dalai Lama has responded favorably to the invitation, and the
central government should set aside its political considerations  and allow him
to visit Taiwan on humanitarian grounds," Chen said at a news conference at
Kaohsiung City Hall.</P>
      <P>"A visit by the Dalai Lama to Taiwan will definitely boost morale among the
typhoon victims and help them to find peace and rebuild their lives as soon as
possible," Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to the Kaohsiung City mayor, the Taipei-based Tibet Religious
Foundation of H. H. The Dalai Lama responded positively Aug. 25 to the city
government's inquiry on Aug. 23 about a possible visit to Taiwan by the Dalai
Lama.</P>
      <P>"We received a prompt positive reply from the foundation, saying that the Dalai
Lama would like to visit southern Taiwan from Aug. 31- Sept. 3. and meet with
typhoon victims housed in emergency shelters," she said.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama's office has sent officials to Delhi, where they will apply on
his behalf at Taiwan's representative office there for a Taiwan visa, she added.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama now lives in exile in Dharamsala in northern India.</P>
      <P>Hsu Li-ming, director-general of the Kaohsiung City Information Office, said the
major purpose of the proposed visit is for the Dalai Lama to console typhoon
victims and encourage them to find peace and start a new life as soon as
possible.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, Dharamsala is also under strong threat from mudslides and
landslides.</P>
      <P>"The Dalai Lama has deep compassion for those left homeless by Typhoon Morakot,
and because of this has promised to come to Taiwan, " he added.</P>

      <P>No drug-resistant strains of the A(H1N1) virus have been detected in Taiwan to
date, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed Wednesday, stressing that
the latest swine flu death was not caused by a mutated form of the virus.</P>
      <P>The forensic report on the fifth A(H1N1) death in the country showed that it was
not caused by a drug-resistant swine flu virus strain, CDC Director General
Steve Kuo said.</P>
      <P>The victim was a 44-year-old woman from central Taiwan who reportedly fell ill
Aug. 17 but did not seek medical treatment until Aug. 20, when she was given
antiviral drugs.</P>
      <P>However, the woman died on Aug. 24, which prompted a forensic probe into the
possibility of a drug resistant strain of the A(H1N1) virus.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the CDC also confirmed that there have been no cholera outbreaks in
areas in southern Taiwan that were flooded during Typhoon Morakot earlier this
month, according to Kuo.</P>
      <P>The CDC's statement came in the wake of reports of two suspected cases of
cholera in Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>However, in Wanden township, Pingtung County, eight of the 83 suspected cases of
leptospirosis have been confirmed as positive, and four of the eight patients
are in intensive care, he added.</P>

      <P>Four members of the ruling Kuomintang's decision-making Central Standing
Committee came up with a proposal Wednesday that the new Cabinet lineup should
be screened or approved by the committee.</P>
      <P>The four members, led by Lee Teh-wei, presented the proposal at the Central
Standing Committee's weekly meeting, KMT spokesman Lee Chieh-jung said after the
meeting.</P>
      <P>KMT Vice Chairman Wu Den-yih has asked the party's chairman, Wu Poh-hsiung, to
convey the suggestion to President Ma Ying-jeou, who is scheduled to take over
the KMT chairmanship in October, according to Lee Chien-jung.</P>
      <P>In response to mounting public dissatisfaction with the Cabinet's flawed rescue
and relief operations in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot, Ma has promised to
reshuffle the Cabinet early next month.</P>
      <P>Lee Teh-wei said that in light of the scale of the typhoon disaster, many
members of the public hope to see a major overhaul of the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Noting that the present Cabinet makeup was not discussed with or approved by the
ruling party, Lee said he looks forward to seeing the party's decision-making
body having a say in the formation of a new Cabinet.</P>
      <P>"We hope the president or the Executive Yuan will submit the list of nominees
for the new Cabinet to the Central Standing Committee for discussion or approval

this process, can the KMT become a bona fide ruling party."</P>
      <P>"This does not mean that the KMT will be leading the government," he argued,

    <HEADLINE>Public urged not to panic over H1N1</HEADLINE>

      <P>Health authorities urged the public Wednesday not to panic over the influenza
A(H1N1) situation, in the wake of a forecast that put the projected fatalities
from the new flu strain in Taiwan at 7,000.</P>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang, who serves concurrently as
head of the Central Epidemics Command Center (CECC), pointed out that most
influenza A(H1N1) cases recorded in Taiwan so far have been mild infections and
that only a minority of patients have developed serious complications.</P>
      <P>"The public should be careful, but there is no need to panic," Yaung said.</P>
      <P>Noting that epidemiologists around the world have made various predictions on
the development of influenza A(H1N1) outbreaks, Yaung said the CECC believes
there are no right or wrong predictions and the center is not going to comment
on any of them.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou is closely watching the situation and will meet with
infectious disease experts Thursday to discuss related prevention and control
measures, the minister said.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, Academia Sinica scholar Chen Chien-jen, who is a former minister of
health, predicted that the outbreak is likely to affect one third of Taiwan's
population. With a hypothetical death rate of 0.1 percent, the outbreak could
result in 7,000 deaths, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Addressing the issue Wednesday, Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Director-
General Steve Kuo said the prediction was probably based on a previous forecast
by the World Health Organization that the new flu strain could infect one third
of the world's population.</P>
      <P>Although the new strain is currently responsible for one third of flu infections
in Taiwan, it "would be too imprecise" to infer that one third of the country's
population would become infected, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>The CDC's tracking of the disease has shown that in the past week, approximately
7,000 people per day had sought medical attention with flu-like symptoms. Of
that number, 2,100, or 29 percent, were found to be infected with influenza
A(H1N1).</P>
      <P>The CDC estimates that the total number of people in Taiwan infected with the
virus has reached 40,000.</P>
      <P>As of Wednesday, 47 severe infections had been recorded in the country, five of
which have resulted in death, Kuo said. Ten of these 47 patients are still in
hospital, while 32 have recovered and have been discharged, he added.</P>
      <P>These figures demonstrate that most influenza A(H1N1) infections are mild and
that most severe infections are curable, he said.</P>
      <P>According to virologist Michael Ming-chiao Lai of National Cheng Kung
University, the public should not be scared, because the severity of influenza
A(N1H)1 is similar to seasonal flu.</P>
      <P>The lack of immunity among the majority of people is what has increased the
virus's epidemic potential, Lai explained.</P>
      <P>Also Wednesday, the military reported three cases of influenza A(H1N1)
infections among naval servicemen, bringing to 44 the total number of recorded
cases involving military personnel since July 27.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party announced that it will
hold a meeting with a group of former Cabinet members Friday to advise the Ma
administration on measures that should be taken to prevent a major outbreak.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said his party is strongly opposed to President
Ma's decision not to hold a national security meeting to deal with the influenza
A(H1N1) situation, which he said indicates that Ma could be underestimating the
potential danger of the disease.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Flood victims living in shelters to move into military barracks</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing said Wednesday his administration
will begin relocating typhoon victims this week from shelters to four military
barracks in the southern Taiwanese county to provide them with a better living
environment and to prevent the spread of the A(H1N1) flu.</P>
      <P>Yang said he hopes the relocation can be completed by Aug. 31.</P>
      <P>According to the county government, around 3,000 people can be accommodated at
the military barracks, each of which houses for four, six or eight people.</P>
      <P>The barracks are believed to be able to allow the victims of the flooding and
mudslides, triggered by Typhoon Morakot earlier this month, to live more
comfortably, county officials said.</P>
      <P>They are also aimed at preventing the spread of A(H1N1) or swine flu, which has
infected a greater number of people in Taiwan in recent days.</P>
      <P>According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Taiwan has so far recorded
five deaths from the new flu virus and nearly 40,000 people infected, with the
rate of infection at 14,000 new cases a week.</P>
      <P>There are currently 30 shelters for flood victims in Kaohsiung County, one of
the areas hardest hit by the worst typhoon in Taiwan in 50 years.</P>
      <P>Wu Li-shueh, director of the county department of social affairs, said the first
batch of 1,000 people to be relocated to the military barracks will be those
currently sheltered  at the Fokuanshan Monastery and other local temples.</P>
      <P>They are people from Taoyuan and Namasia townships who were rendered homeless by
the floods and mudslides, Wu said.</P>
      <P>As of 6 p.m. Wednesday, the death toll caused by the typhoon devastation which
struck from Aug. 7-9 has reached 46l, while the number of missing people was at
192, with another 46 people injured, according to governmental statistics.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Local governments urged to take precautions against next storm</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug. 26  (CNA)
08/26/09  19:16:12
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou  urged local governments Wednesday to take precautions
against the next typhoon, which is forecast to hit Taiwan in the coming month.</P>
      <P>The president issued the instruction during an inspection of the Dahu disaster
zone in Chiayi County's Fanlu township, which is still recovering from the
devastation wrought by Typhoon Morakot that pummeled Taiwan Aug. 7-9.</P>
      <P>"As the Central Weather Bureau has forecast that another typhoon believed to be
stronger than Morakot is likely to strike Taiwan in the coming month, we should
brace ourselves, as the situation could worsen," Ma said in a meeting with Dahu
villagers.</P>
      <P>At the start of the meeting, Ma led central government officials in ritual
bowing to formally apologize to the villagers for his administration's flawed
disaster relief operations in the early stages.</P>
      <P>Fanlu township chief Lo Yin-chang briefed Ma on Morakot-triggered damage in the
township, which is located in the mountainous Alishan region.</P>
      <P>According to Lo, a total of 1,280 households comprising 3,352 people in the
township's four villages -- Dahu, Gungtien, Gungsing and Caoshan -- fell victim
to the storm, with their homes severely damaged or buried by mudslides.</P>
      <P>Thanks to timely evacuation, however, no fatalities were reported in the
disaster, Lo said proudly.</P>
      <P>Morakot dumped staggering amounts of rainfall on certain parts of southern
Taiwan, with Chiayi County topping the list, receiving nine months of
precipitation in just three days that led to devastating flooding.</P>
      <P>"The rainfall brought by Morakot was the largest amount ever brought by a single
typhoon in 50 years. This phenomenon once again proves that Taiwan's weather
patterns have changed because of global warming, " Ma said. "To tackle the
trend, local governments should craft a standard operating procedure (SOP) for
disaster prevention and relief as well as evacuation of residents in case of
emergency."</P>
      <P>Ma lauded county and township governments for doing a good job in pre-typhoon
precautions  and in persuading residents in areas vulnerable to flooding and
landslides to evacuate before the arrival of Morakot.</P>
      <P>"Such efforts helped minimize human casualties during the storm's onslaught," Ma
said.</P>
      <P>He promised that the central and local governments will cooperate in finding a
suitable plot of land on which the 33 Dahu families whose houses were toppled by
mudslides can build new homes.</P>
      <P>"The site will not be close to flood-prone areas or regions vulnerable to
landslides or other safety risks," Ma pledged.</P>
      <P>On post-disaster  relief  and reconstruction,  Ma said the government will
follow the principles of leniency, promptness and minimal red tape to allow
typhoon-affected people to get their lives back on track as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Ma also paid a visit to Taiho village in Chiayi County's
mountainous Meishan township, where four villagers remained unaccounted for, 38
houses were destroyed and 23 others were severely damaged.</P>
      <P>As the storm washed out all roads to the village, cutting it off completely,
military servicemen suffered delays in getting to the village to carry out
rescue and relief work, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"Once the weather improved, our soldiers immediately got to work on relief and
cleanup operations, " Ma said, expressing his gratitude for the devotion of all
service members.</P>
      <P>Some Meishan residents complained that the serious devastation in the village
mainly resulted from an accumulation of silt and rocks in the Alishan river that
led to a change of the river's flow and washed out the tribal settlement, and
they said they will seek national compensation as a result.</P>
      <P>In response, Ma said he will direct the county government to investigate the
cause and assist residents with compensation claims.</P>
      <P>Chiayi Magistrate Chen Ming-wen, who accompanied Ma on the inspection, also
promised that students at Meishan Elementary School will be able to return to
class Aug. 31 as scheduled, even though the school was seriously damaged in the
storm.</P>
      <P>"A tea-packing facility near Taiho village will provide space to be used for
makeshift classrooms and if necessary, teachers and textbooks will be delivered
to the school by helicopter," Chen added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>People displaced by Typhoon Morakot and are living in shelters or prefabricated
houses will be the first in the country to be vaccinated against the new strain
of influenza A(H1N1), the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) announced
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The center, which is under the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) ,
decided the order of people to be targeted for vaccination earlier in the day
amid reports of a greater number of infections reported over the past few days.</P>
      <P>Following typhoon victims, frontline medical care personnel were listed as the
next most important group of people to be vaccinated, the CECC said.</P>
      <P>They are followed by pregnant women, children aged 1 to 6, and patients aged 7
or above who suffer from severe diseases or wounds.</P>
      <P>Next on the list are elementary school students, followed by junior high school
students; senior high school students; young people aged 19-24; patients over 25
years old suffering from high-risk diseases such as cardiovascular disease,
diabetes, and diseases on the liver and kidney; healthy adults aged 25-49;
healthy adults aged 50-64; and seniors aged 65 and older.</P>
      <P>According to the state-sponsored Adimmune Corp., Taiwan's only producer of
A(H1N1) flu vaccine, 5 million out of 10 million doses of A(H1N1) vaccine
purchased by the DOH will be delivered by the end of October.</P>
      <P>As a result, the inoculation can be launched in mid-November at the earliest,
after the clinical trials are completed, it said.</P>
      <P>However, the five million doses are only enough for everyone on the priority
list down to and including junior high school students. Those further down the
list will have to wait for the second batch of 5 million doses to become
available by the end of December, Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Director
General Steve Kuo said.</P>
      <P>As the vaccine produced by Adimmune cannot be proven safe for infants under 12
months, they are not included in the vaccination order, CECC deputy commander
Chang Shang-chun said, noting that the DOH will purchase other appropriate
vaccines for the infants.</P>
      <P>There are currently no tests, either on humans or animals, to see if the
Adimmune-produced anti-A(H1N1) vaccines are safe for infants, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Those not on the list also include people who had been infected but recovered
because they already have antibodies against the new flu, he added.</P>
      <P>According to CDC statistics, as of Wednesday, there have been 47 severe
infections on record in Taiwan, five of which have resulted in death.</P>
      <P>Among the severe infections, 16 patients were adults aged 25-49, while 12 were
children aged between 12 months and 6 years. The two groups accounted for 60
percent of the total severe infections.</P>

      <P>The government has decided to exempt borrowers from repaying mortgage balances
on houses completely destroyed or land plots washed away during Typhoon Morakot
earlier this month, officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Premier Liu Chao-shiuan has agreed to have state-owned banks cancel the balance
on those mortgages, " said Executive Yuan spokesman Minister Su Jun-pin.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the Bankers Association of the Republic of
China, the combined outstanding mortgages on the 297 houses completely
destroyed in Morakot-triggered  flooding and landslides slightly exceed NT$700
million (US$21.21 million).</P>
      <P>State-owned banks hold the mortgages for 262 of the houses, which total slightly
more than NT$600 million. Bank of Taiwan is the top creditor with 260 mortgaged
houses, and the remaining two mortgages are held by Land Bank of Taiwan and
Taiwan Cooperative Bank, respectively.</P>
      <P>The other 35 mortgages are held by private banks, with HSBC being the major
creditor, according to the Bankers Association tallies.</P>
      <P>Vice Finance Minister Tseng Ming-tsung said state-owned banks will fully support
the government policy and deal with the mortgage issue in a lenient manner.</P>
      <P>The ministry will also be pleased if state-owned banks decide to write off the
balance of mortgage payments on partially destroyed houses, Tseng said.</P>
      <P>The total outstanding mortgages on houses half-toppled in the storm amounted to
NT$600 million, according to Bankers Association statistics.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Executive  Yuan spokesman  Su said the Bankers Association will
assist in lobbying private banks to follow the rules for state-owned banks in
exempting repayment of outstanding mortgages on houses fully destroyed  or
washed away during the storm's onslaught.</P>
      <P>As most farmers and aquaculture operators tend to mortgage their farmland, fish
ponds and facilities to obtain loans from farmers' or fishermen's associations,
Su said, these associations will write off outstanding mortgages secured by
assets that were washed away by flash floods.</P>

      <P>Warming ties between Taiwan and mainland China could bring opportunities as well
as challenges to Taiwan's top-tier companies, but these corporations may not all
face the same benefits from improved access to China, according to a research
report of the Taiwan Ratings Corp.</P>
      <P>"There is no doubt that the gradual normalization of economic relations between
Taiwan and mainland China will offer new growth opportunities to many of
Taiwan's industries. However, any potential growth is unlikely to be realized
without an increase in credit risks," said the credit rating agency's chief
ratings officer Susan Chu.</P>
      <P>Closer links with China will partly reshape credit profiles of Taiwan's leading
corporations, according to Daniel Hsiao, director of the agency's department of
corporate and funds rating.</P>
      <P>He elaborated that while positive impacts are expected in the transportation,
real estate, petrochemical, semiconductor, packaging and testing as well as flat
panel sectors, the fortune for cement and food processing industries may be
mixed, and electronic components manufacturing and services may be negatively
affected.</P>
      <P>The credit rating agency's research covers Taiwan's top 100 corporations, of
which hi-tech industries account for 53 percent; petrochemical 10 percent; steel
5 percent; retail businesses 4 percent; telecommunications, marine
transportation and food processing each 3 percent; petroleum, cement, textiles
and aviation each 2 percent; automobile 1 percent.</P>
      <P>The research report meanwhile noted that while Taiwan's top corporations' credit
quality were "largely resilient to the current global recession", the existing
adverse factors of declining profitability and rising loan levels had a negative
impact on perceived risk.</P>

      <P>The Dalai Lama has received an invitation from a group of local government
officials to visit Taiwan, and he is ready to immediately embark on the trip,
the Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama confirmed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Thekchen Choeling, secretary general of the office, told CNA by phone that the
matter will be negotiated by the representative office of the Tibetan Government
in Exile and the authorities in Taipei.</P>
      <P>In principle, the Dalai Lama is "very willing" to visit southern Taiwan to show
his deep concern for the victims of Typhoon Morakot, the office said.</P>
      <P>The Tibetan spiritual leader has repeatedly said that he would be very willing
to visit Taiwan again as long as it would not create trouble for the government.</P>
      <P>W. C. Weng, Taiwan's representative to India, told CNA he was aware that the
Dalai Lama had been invited to visit Taiwan, but declined to comment further.</P>
      <P>The invitation was issued jointly by several local government heads from the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party in the wake of Typhoon Morakot. They are
heads of some of the municipalities in areas that were hardest hit by the storm.</P>
      <P>Earlier Wednesday, Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu urged the central government to
permit the Dalai Lama's visit, given that the Tibetan spiritual leader has
agreed to travel to Taiwan to pray for the typhoon victims.</P>
      <P>"The office of the Dalai Lama has responded favorably to the invitation, and the
central government should set aside its political considerations  and allow him
to visit Taiwan on humanitarian grounds," Chen said at a news conference at
Kaohsiung City Hall.</P>
      <P>"A visit by the Dalai Lama to Taiwan will definitely boost morale among the
typhoon victims and help them to find peace and rebuild their lives as soon as
possible," Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to the Kaohsiung City mayor, the Taipei-based Tibet Religious
Foundation of H. H. The Dalai Lama responded positively Aug. 25 to the city
government's inquiry on Aug. 23 about a possible visit to Taiwan by the Dalai
Lama.</P>
      <P>"We received a prompt positive reply from the foundation, saying that the Dalai
Lama would like to visit southern Taiwan from Aug. 31- Sept. 3. and meet with
typhoon victims housed in emergency shelters," she said.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama's office has sent officials to Delhi, where they will apply on
his behalf at Taiwan's representative office there for a Taiwan visa, she added.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama now lives in exile in Dharamsala in northern India.</P>
      <P>Hsu Li-ming, director-general of the Kaohsiung City Information Office, said the
major purpose of the proposed visit is for the Dalai Lama to console typhoon
victims and encourage them to find peace and start a new life as soon as
possible.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, Dharamsala is also under strong threat from mudslides and
landslides.</P>
      <P>"The Dalai Lama has deep compassion for those left homeless by Typhoon Morakot,
and because of this has promised to come to Taiwan, " he added.</P>

      <P>No drug-resistant strains of the A(H1N1) virus have been detected in Taiwan to
date, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed Wednesday, stressing that
the latest swine flu death was not caused by a mutated form of the virus.</P>
      <P>The forensic report on the fifth A(H1N1) death in the country showed that it was
not caused by a drug-resistant swine flu virus strain, CDC Director General
Steve Kuo said.</P>
      <P>The victim was a 44-year-old woman from central Taiwan who reportedly fell ill
Aug. 17 but did not seek medical treatment until Aug. 20, when she was given
antiviral drugs.</P>
      <P>However, the woman died on Aug. 24, which prompted a forensic probe into the
possibility of a drug resistant strain of the A(H1N1) virus.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the CDC also confirmed that there have been no cholera outbreaks in
areas in southern Taiwan that were flooded during Typhoon Morakot earlier this
month, according to Kuo.</P>
      <P>The CDC's statement came in the wake of reports of two suspected cases of
cholera in Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>However, in Wanden township, Pingtung County, eight of the 83 suspected cases of
leptospirosis have been confirmed as positive, and four of the eight patients
are in intensive care, he added.</P>

      <P>Four members of the ruling Kuomintang's decision-making Central Standing
Committee came up with a proposal Wednesday that the new Cabinet lineup should
be screened or approved by the committee.</P>
      <P>The four members, led by Lee Teh-wei, presented the proposal at the Central
Standing Committee's weekly meeting, KMT spokesman Lee Chieh-jung said after the
meeting.</P>
      <P>KMT Vice Chairman Wu Den-yih has asked the party's chairman, Wu Poh-hsiung, to
convey the suggestion to President Ma Ying-jeou, who is scheduled to take over
the KMT chairmanship in October, according to Lee Chien-jung.</P>
      <P>In response to mounting public dissatisfaction with the Cabinet's flawed rescue
and relief operations in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot, Ma has promised to
reshuffle the Cabinet early next month.</P>
      <P>Lee Teh-wei said that in light of the scale of the typhoon disaster, many
members of the public hope to see a major overhaul of the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Noting that the present Cabinet makeup was not discussed with or approved by the
ruling party, Lee said he looks forward to seeing the party's decision-making
body having a say in the formation of a new Cabinet.</P>
      <P>"We hope the president or the Executive Yuan will submit the list of nominees
for the new Cabinet to the Central Standing Committee for discussion or approval
though the party's internal decision-making mechanism," he said. "Only through
this process, can the KMT become a bona fide ruling party."</P>
      <P>"This does not mean that the KMT will be leading the government," he argued,
adding that the KMT just wants to assist the executive branch.</P>
      <P>The KMT now controls an absolute majority in the Legislative Yuan.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's intermediary Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) will soon provide its
Beijing counterpart with a detailed list of items needed for post-typhoon
rehabilitation, as requested, an SEF official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Kao Koong-lien said that, at the request
of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS)
, the SEF will provide the list as soon as it has been compiled by the relevant
public agencies.</P>
      <P>Kao's remarks came on the heels of the request by ARATS, which said Wednesday
the list would help it to determine how to disburse the 110 million yuan that
its business members have donated over the past two weeks for post-typhoon
reconstruction in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ARATS is reportedly ready to hand over the entire sum to Taiwan by next
week.</P>
      <P>So far, China's Red Cross Society had remitted 15 million yuan to Taiwan to help
with relief work in the wake of the massive destruction wreaked by Typhoon
Morakot in eastern and southern Taiwan Aug. 7-9.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kao said it is an "understandable and acceptable" notion that words
like "donated by China" can be inscribed on public construction projects that
were built or restored with funds from China.</P>
      <P>"Inscriptions of 'donated by Taiwan' were placed on many newly built public
structures in Sichuan Province after Taiwan made huge cash donations to the
recovery efforts in the wake of a killer earthquake there last year," Kao said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday that his administration has approved a
visit to Taiwan by Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama to console and pray
for the victims of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Ma made the announcement during an inspection tour of the disaster areas in
Nantou County.</P>
      <P>The invitation for the exiled Tibetan leader to visit Taiwan was issued by the
chiefs of seven Democratic Progressive Party-controlled localities in southern
Taiwan that were hit hard by the storm.</P>
      <P>The visit is tentatively scheduled for Aug. 31 to Sept. 4.</P>
      <P>According to Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi, the government's
decision to authorize the visit was based on religious and humanitarian
considerations.</P>
      <P>"We think this matter should not damage relations between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait," Wang said.</P>
      <P>On whether Ma will meet with the Dalai Lama during his stay in Taiwan, Wang said
this will remain a hypothetical question until the Tibetan spiritual leader
officially files an application for the visit.</P>
      <P>Wang said the Dalai Lama had written to Ma in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot
to convey his concern over the disaster, and Ma replied Aug. 24 to express his
appreciation.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama first visited Taiwan in 1997 and again in 2001.</P>
      <P>In 2002, however, the Dalai Lama turned down Taiwan's invitation for a third
visit, saying that it was an inconvenient time. The Tibetan government in exile
was holding talks with Beijing at the time.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama indicated his desire to visit Taiwan in June 2008, soon after the
inauguration of President Ma, but the proposal was turned down by Ma on the
grounds that it was an inappropriate time.</P>
      <P>It was widely believed that Ma did so to try to avoid blotching Taiwan's warming
ties with China.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the issue Thursday, Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
the Dalai Lama's upcoming visit will be religious in nature and that he believes
Beijing will view the matter from a humanitarian perspective, which will help
minimize any possible political fallout.</P>
      <P>Also, Wang said he believes the Dalai Lama will comply with Taiwan's request to
avoid any political activities while in Taiwan, so as not to cause any
misunderstanding between Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot, which battered the country Aug. 7-9, triggered the worst
flooding in 50 years, devastating much of southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As of Tuesday, confirmed fatalities from the disaster had reached 461, with 192
others reported missing and 46 injured, according to the Central Emergency
Operation Center.</P>
      <P>A national mourning ceremony will be held Sept. 7 in Kaohsiung for the dead.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'Mr. butterfly' chasing beauty as well as dream</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>By Lilian Wu
08/27/09  14:17:34
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P/>
      <P>CNA staff writer</P>
      <P>He has run into a mountain ditch, smashed into a cliff, come face-to-face with
the deadly bamboo viper and nearly frozen to death on a mountain top pursuing
his lifelong passion, but he has never been deterred by any of those adventures
-- or by opposition from his family.</P>
      <P>Tsai Bae-chun, an ecology photographer better known as "Mr. Butterfly, " has
been chasing butterflies around for more than 30 years, and he says his passion
for the beautiful creature has only grown stronger over time.</P>
      <P>He fell in love with butterflies as a child, catching them and mounting them in
a book as other children did to preserve their beauty.</P>
      <P>But that interest did not become a burning obsession until 1979, when Tsai, at
the age of 29, witnessed "in awe" the metamorphosis of the butterfly while
visiting a friend in Hualien.</P>
      <P>He saw a bunch of eggs hatch the first night, turn into caterpillars on the wall
a few days later and then become pupa before emerging as colorful butterflies,
an experience that left him obsessed with the fragile insect.</P>
      <P>For the next six months, he was captivated by the natural beauty of Hualien and
spent his time exploring creeks and mountains without even contacting his family
once.</P>
      <P>At the same time, he devoured every book he could lay his hands on to enhance
his knowledge of the species, which only fueled his passion further.</P>
      <P>He came across a Japanese reference book on Taiwan's butterflies, which to his
delight and dismay, presented the country's endemic species in their original
sizes and colors. In comparison, Taiwan's own books on butterflies seemed "so
slipshod."</P>
      <P>Taiwan at the time was focused solely on rapid economic growth, but after seeing
the difference in the books, Tsai felt the country's pursuit was too narrow.</P>
      <P>"What's the use of a better economy if there is such a big cultural gap between
Taiwan and its neighbor.  It was really humiliating," he recalls.</P>
      <P>He made up his mind then that he would one day publish his own pictorial almanac
of butterflies endemic to Taiwan to bring the beauty of the "butterfly kingdom"
to local residents.</P>
      <P>When he finally returned to his home in the industrial port city of Kaohsiung
six months later, he knew that he could no longer continue in the family
business, a company that wholesaled cooking oil.</P>
      <P>"My mind was set. I wanted to be a butterfly chaser," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Of Taiwan's 400 butterfly species, Tsai has recorded 345 of them, but tracking
down so many has not been easy and led him on plenty of adventures around the
island.</P>
      <P>He recalled that in his initial and more "crazy" days, whenever he heard about
the appearance of butterflies, he could easily cover more than 500 kilometers a
day on his motorcycle.</P>
      <P>Starting from Kaohsiung, he would ride the narrow mountainous Central Cross-
Island Highway to Hualien and head south along the east coast to Taitung and
Pingtung before returning to Kaohsiung, often covering 500 kilometers a day.</P>
      <P>Several times, he was so mesmerized by the butterflies, he forgot that he was on
a treacherous mountain road and ended up in mountain ditches. One day while in
hot pursuit of an elusive beauty, he smashed his motorcycle into the side of a
mountain.</P>
      <P>"That was actually fortunate, " he says, "because if it had been the other side
of the road, I would have fallen off a cliff."</P>
      <P>This blind pursuit of butterflies has carried over to his guiding philosophy --
"using the dumb way to get the best picture."</P>
      <P>Butterflies like to loiter by riversides, but Tsai believes photographing them
from above does not make a good picture, so he gets into position by wading into
rivers, braving rapid currents, slippery rocks, and, in the early spring when
some species appear, freezing cold water.</P>
      <P>When a butterfly is perched high on a tree, he often climbs up a higher tree to
shoot it from a better angle. If the subject is frightened away, Tsai simply
stays in the tree, waiting patiently for it to return.</P>
      <P>His methods might seem foolish to other photographers who simply use a big net
to catch the prey, release them in a fixed space and photograph them without any
worries.</P>
      <P>But Tsai insists on shooting them in their natural habitat, just as insists on
using micro lenses instead of long-distance lenses to get the best quality.</P>
      <P>Chasing butterflies is a solitary job, as the butterfly is a shy creature that
is frightened away by the shadow of human being. Alone in the wild, Tsai has had
numerous encounters with leeches and wasps and heard the roars of wild animals,
such as black bears.</P>
      <P>He remembers one traumatic experience in the bitter cold on a 2,000-meter high
mountain.</P>
      <P>"My head was spinning, and I had difficulty breathing. I didn't feel I could
live until the next day, " Tsai said. With no doctors or hospitals nearby, he
could only rely on herbs for relief.</P>
      <P>These many brushes with danger have been more than offset by the great joy
gained by successful pursuits, such as spotting the rare and elusive broad-
tailed swallowtail butterfly, considered by many the queen of butterflies, on
Taiping mountain in Yilan County after a search of nearly a decade.</P>
      <P>After near six years of chasing butterflies and learning butterfly basics --
what they eat, when and where they appear, their movements, and the trees they
like to cling to -- Tsai published a picture booklet in 1984 to introduce the
butterflies found in Kenting National Park.</P>
      <P>The project finally won his family over to his cause after years of opposition.</P>
      <P>He has since produced a similar booklet for Yushan National Park, written
columns, served as a TV program host, and gone on ecological photography
missions in many foreign countries.</P>
      <P>In May 2007, his collection of 28 butterfly photos were exhibited at the
Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, making him the first Asian
photographer to have his work displayed at the museum.</P>
      <P>Such honors are the result of more than just his "dumb way to get the best
picture." He has developed a number of special skills that have enabled him to
spot and get closer to his subjects.</P>
      <P>He has superb eyesight and his ability to identify light waves, for example,
help him spot butterflies that excel in camouflage, such as the orange oakleaf,
which appears as a withered leaf when it folds its wings. Tsai can spot it
because it emits a different light wave than that of a leaf.</P>
      <P>Tsai says he has also learned to "communicate" with butterflies by observing
their movements. When a butterfly sips nectar from flowers, its wings flap
moderately, but the flapping quickens when it is alarmed.</P>
      <P>If a butterfly is unwilling to leave a flower, the flapping will pick up to show
it is aware of the existence of an encroaching threat.</P>
      <P>He also has developed a "dance" that lets him get closer to his target. When he
is five meters away, he swings his arms in an exaggerated way to acclimate the
butterfly to his presence, and then moves to within two meters at a moderate
pace.</P>
      <P>To get even closer, he moves his legs forward first and then slowly follows with
his upper body, but even this stealthy approach often fails.</P>
      <P>For all of Tsai's recognition and expertise, chasing butterflies is not a money-
making endeavor. To support his basic expenses of NT$1 million (US$30,300) a
year, he has sold three houses in recent years and works as a street vendor from
mid-autumn to early spring when there are few butterflies to chase.</P>
      <P>Though not wealthy, Tsai uses some of his limited funds to give speeches around
the island and offer butterfly-related gifts to children to instill in them the
concept of conservation.</P>
      <P>Tsai, who claims he has been "immature, " and a "toddler" during his long
journey of chasing butterflies, says he will continue his blind pursuit to get
people more focused on the environment.</P>
      <P>"By getting people to appreciate the beauty of butterflies through my photos,
they will naturally want to protect and preserve the environment suitable for
them and eventually harbor a love for the land known as the 'kingdom of
butterflies'," he says.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will render whatever assistance is needed
to facilitate a visit to Taiwan by the Dalai Lama, a MOFA official in charge of
consular affairs said Thursday.</P>
      <P>However, Lo You-chung, director-general of the MOFA's Bureau of Consular
Affairs, said at a regular news conference that to date, his bureau has not
received any information or application from the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader
regarding his trip to Taiwan to pray for victims of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, the bureau is ready to assist with the process if the Dalai Lama
files an application to visit Taiwan, Lo added.</P>
      <P>"The bureau will process the entry application as soon as it is filed via a MOFA
overseas liaison office, " Lo said."The Dalai Lama could be issued an entry
permit or a visa, depending on how his status is listed on his entry
application."</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama could be issued an entry permit if he is classified as a non-
resident Republic of China citizen from overseas, Lo said. In that case, the
National Immigration Agency under the Ministry of the Interior will be
responsible for issuing the permit, he added.</P>
      <P>When the Tibetan spiritual leader first visited Taiwan in March 1997, he was
issued an entry permit by the National Immigration Agency, Lo said.</P>
      <P>However, he could also obtain a Taiwan visa from the Bureau of Consular Affairs
if he applies for entry as a stateless individual who does not hold a passport
and has only an identification certificate (IC) issued by the Indian government,
Lo added.</P>
      <P>On his second visit to Taiwan in March 2001, the Dalai Lama entered the country
as a stateless individual with an Indian IC, and on a Taiwan visa issued by the
Bureau of Consular Affairs.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ongoing influenza A(H1N1) outbreak in Taiwan is likely to run for at least
200 weeks, making the country's epidemic control effort a long-haul fight,
Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>While it is predicted that the new flu strain could infect 30 percent, or 7
million, of Taiwan's population, they are unlikely to get infected at the same
time, Yaung said.</P>
      <P>"If 30,000 people are infected per week, the outbreak will last for at least 200
weeks," he said in a news conference.</P>
      <P>Yaung expressed confidence that Taiwan can handle the situation properly, noting
that the new type of flu is not incurable, though slightly more severe than the
normal flu.</P>
      <P>The results of computer simulation generated by the Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) reveal that there have likely been 15,000 new cases in the past week.</P>
      <P>As of Wednesday, Taiwan had recorded 47 severe infections of influenza A(H1N1),
five of which had resulted in death, according to the CDC.</P>
      <P>Yaung said compared with other countries in the region, the situation in Taiwan
has remained moderate.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, Australia has seen 132 people die from the disease, and
the fatalities in Malaysia and Singapore have reached 63 and 12, respectively.</P>
      <P>On the controversy surrounding President Ma Ying-jeou's decision not to activate
the national security mechanism to deal with the influenza A(H1N1) situation,
Yaung said it was he who advised the president not to do so.</P>
      <P>The minister dismissed as fear mongering the claim by certain media outlets that
the government's measure to allow civil servants to take leave of absence to
take care of flu-infected family members will result in a shortage of staff to
deal with the epidemic.</P>
      <P>He said such false reporting is subject to a fine of up to NT$500,000 under the
Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Act and that the DOH will consider
taking action against these media.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan has enough face masks to fight H1N1, no need to hoard: gov't</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has a sufficient supply of face masks for the public to use amid mounting
worries of a swine flu, or influenza A(H1N1) flu, epidemic erupting in Taiwan,
the government said Thursday, urging people not to hoard the products.</P>
      <P>"With sufficient face masks in stock, there is no need for the public to hoard
them, " said the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>IDB officials quoted the latest survey as finding that the inventory for face
masks held by four major convenience store franchises nationwide can satisfy
demand for one to two months. The four franchise systems operate a total of
9,200 stores throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The IDB will also constantly remind these franchises not to leave their store
shelves empty so people can buy face masks whenever they need them, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, they added that the existing inventory of ordinary face masks held by
the central government totals 11 million pieces, enough for half of the nation's
population.</P>
      <P>In addition, they said, another 15 million face masks are in stock  for  the
use in medical  institutions  or by medical professionals.</P>
      <P>In related news, increased sales of face masks and other hygiene products, such
as hand cream, dry wash and sterilizing liquid, have been reported in
convenience and other retail stores over the past week, with sales going up
10-30 percent.</P>
      <P>According to Cosmed Taiwan Inc., a drug store franchise owned by the Uni
President Group, its sales of dry wash have soared by 40 percent since last
Saturday and sales of health-boosting vitamin C and vitamin complex have risen
by about 15 percent.</P>
      <P>"Overall sales of these products have increased by a larger amount in southern
Taiwan than those in the north after Typhoon Morakot wreaked mass destruction in
southern Taiwan with staggering floodings," said a Cosmed spokesperson.</P>
      <P>As of Thursday, Taiwan had confirmed five swine flu fatalities, with the number
of severe cases exceeding 40, according to the Centers for Disease Control
(CDC).</P>
      <P>The number of cluster H1N1 infections is also believed to have hit 100, and more
than 10,000 Taiwanese people are coming down with the virus each week, according
to CDC estimates.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's consumer confidence index (CCI) in August dropped by 3.18 points to 53
points, remaining below 100 points, which indicates that consumers' mood has
become "more pessimistic," according to results of a survey revealed Thursday.</P>
      <P>The index's six sub indices, which reflex consumers' expectations of six
economic conditions in the coming six months all dwindled in August compared to
July levels because of the impact of Typhoon Morakot, according to the press
release issued by the Research Center for Taiwan Economic Development (RCTED)
under National Central University, which carried out the survey on a monthly
basis.</P>
      <P>The six economic conditions are: 1. product price level; 2. family economic
conditions; 3. employment opportunities; 4. business climate; 5. whether it is a
good or bad time to buy stocks; and 6. whether it is a good or bad time to buy
durable goods.</P>
      <P>The six sub indices all scored a point below 100 points, indicating that the
overall economic mood of the consumers is "relatively  pessimistic."  Scores in
the range between 100-200 reflects a "more pessimistic" mood among consumers.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's CCI surged to a one-year high of 56.18 points in July -- the same level
as in July the previous year, the RCTED noted.</P>
      <P>The No. 1 sub indice concerning consumer product prices posted the largest
monthly decrease of 13.55 points to 29.95 points in August -- which is a record
low in this category and is the lowest point among the six sub indices, the
survey showed.</P>
      <P>The research center ascribed the fall to the adverse effects of Typhoon Morakot,
which lashed southern Taiwan early this month and which have sent the price of
vegetables, fruits and meat soaring in Taiwan's retail markets.</P>
      <P>The No. 5 sub indice regarding whether it is a good or bad time to buy stocks in
the coming six months saw the second-largest fall of 3.2 points to 78.8 points
for August.</P>
      <P>The No. 6 sub indice about whether it is a good time to buy durable goods also
dropped by 1.3 points to 81.2 points for this month, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>The No. 3 sub indice concerning the job market stood at a historical low of 32.4
points, down by 0.7 points from July -- indicating that Taiwan's people are
highly concerned about employment opportunities in the coming six months.</P>
      <P>The score for the prospects of family economic conditions and business  climate
declined  to 51.85 points and 43.8 points, representing a fall of 0.3 points and
0.05 points, respectively, the survey found.</P>
      <P>The research center conducted the telephone survey from Aug. 19- 22, questioning
2,308 citizens who are over 20 years old. It had a margin of error of 2
percentage points.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials
Thursday:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The battle against swine flu has both medical and political connotations</P>
      <P>Health experts estimate 7 million people will contract swine flu, with 5,000 to
10,000 of them expected to die from the disease.</P>
      <P>In the face of this forecast, the government's task is to first to curb the
disease and cure those infected, and second to allay public fears.</P>
      <P>The question of whether the president should convene a meeting of the National
Security Council should be considered from both an administrative and
psychological perspective.</P>
      <P>From a mass communication standpoint, the battle against swine flu will test the
administration's  ability to inspire public confidence and calm public fears.</P>
      <P>Experts have forecast that swine flu will be around for the next six months to
three years, therefore, the government should provide full information in the
fight against the disease, to avoid public panic.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Ma's administration is responding sluggishly to epidemic again.</P>
      <P>Since June, 38,000 people have fallen sick with swine flu, with five of them
dead, according to statistics compiled by the health authorities.</P>
      <P>Based on this trend, more than 10 million people will get the flu by November,
and 14,000 to 28,000 people will die from it.</P>
      <P>Facing this grim prospect, the public is on the brink of panic, and is hoping
the administration will come up with a response quickly.</P>
      <P>However, the Presidential Office said the previous day that the epidemic
situation is not serious enough to call the National Security Council into
meeting.</P>
      <P>When the country is hit by bird flu, then President Chen Shui-bian convened the
National Security Conference four times to map out a strategy to battle it.</P>
      <P>Why is it so difficult for President Ma Ying-jeou to convene the National
Security Conference?</P>
      <P>The reason is that Ma is afraid of taking the responsibility for batting the
epidemic and prefers to stand in the background as a leader behind the scene.</P>
      <P>As head of the state, it is the inevitable responsibility of President Ma to
convene a National Security Conference immediately.</P>
      <P>Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>Liu Chao-shiuan, step down!</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan proposed yesterday to give every government employee 20 days
of paid leave of absence to take care of family members infected with, rather
than five days as prescribed by the law.</P>
      <P>The decision is obviously an attempt to give government employees undue
benefits.</P>
      <P>Government employees are hired to serve the people, not the least when natural
disasters befall the country. If they can take leave of absence when swine flu
grips the country, and leave voluntary workers to handle the situation, why
should the tax payers finance their payments?</P>
      <P>So step down, Liu Chao-shiuan.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Advice on Cabinet reshuffle</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Francisco Ou has offered to resign to take responsibility for
rejecting foreign aid in the early stages of the disaster caused by Typhoon
Morakot.</P>
      <P>Since President Ma has promised to reshuffle the Cabinet at the beginning of
September, we would like to offer him some advice.</P>
      <P>According to our opinion poll on Aug. 20, the most unpopular Cabinet members are
Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, Defense Minister Chen Chao-min and Cabinet Secretary-

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan approves Dalai Lama visit</HEADLINE>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday that his administration has approved a
visit to Taiwan by Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama to console and pray
for the victims of Typhoon Morakot. Ma made the announcement during an
inspection tour of the disaster areas in Nantou County. The invitation for the
exiled Tibetan leader to visit Taiwan was issued by the chiefs of seven
Democratic Progressive Party-controlled localities in southern Taiwan that were
hit hard by the storm.</P>
      <P>The visit is tentatively scheduled for Aug. 31 to Sept. 4. According to
Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi, the government's decision to
authorize the visit was based on religious and humanitarian considerations.</P>
      <P>"We think this matter should not damage relations between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait," Wang said.</P>
      <P>On whether Ma will meet with the Dalai Lama during his stay in Taiwan, Wang said
this will remain a hypothetical question until the Tibetan spiritual leader
officially files an application for the visit.</P>
      <P>Wang said the Dalai Lama had written to Ma in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot
to convey his concern over the disaster, and Ma replied Aug. 24 to express his
appreciation.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama first visited Taiwan in 1997 and again in 2001.</P>
      <P>In 2002, however, the Dalai Lama turned down Taiwan's invitation for a third
visit, saying that it was an inconvenient time. The Tibetan government in exile
was holding talks with Beijing at the time.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama indicated his desire to visit Taiwan in June 2008, soon after the
inauguration of President Ma, but the proposal was turned down by Ma on the
grounds that it was an inappropriate time.</P>
      <P>It was widely believed that Ma did so to try to avoid blotching Taiwan's warming
ties with China.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the issue Thursday, Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
the Dalai Lama' s upcoming visit will be religious in nature and that he
believes Beijing will view the matter from a humanitarian perspective, which
will help minimize any possible political fallout. Also, Wang said he believes
the Dalai Lama will comply with Taiwan's request to avoid any political
activities while in Taiwan, so as not to cause any misunderstanding between
Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot, which battered the country Aug. 7-9, triggered the worst
flooding in 50 years, devastating much of southern Taiwan. As of Tuesday,
confirmed fatalities from the disaster had reached 461, with 192 others reported
missing and 46 injured, according to the Central Emergency Operation Center. A
national mourning ceremony will be held Sept. 7 in Kaohsiung for the dead.</P>

      <P>Private sector employers cannot reject workers' requests for leave of absence to
tend family members who are infected with the A(H1N1) virus or to take care of
children whose schools have been closed because of H1N1 infections, the Council
of Labor Affairs (CLA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The rule applies to all employers of five or more workers, CLA officials said.</P>
      <P>However, while each worker is entitled to up to seven days leave per year for
such purposes, they will not be paid for the periods of absence, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>In the case of civil servants, they can also take seven days off, but they will
be paid for a maximum of five of those days, according to the Central Personnel
Administration.</P>
      <P>Also Thursday, Su Ying-kuei, chief of Taipei City's Department of Labor, said
that if employers ask workers to stay at home on suspicion of influenza A(H1N1)
infection, the workers should be paid for the duration of their absence.</P>
      <P>In addition, if employees are quarantined by health authorities, their employers
cannot punish them on grounds of unauthorized absence, Su said.</P>
      <P>In the case of workers who contract H1N1 influenza in the line of duty, their
employers should grant them work-related sick leave with full pay, he said. If
such infections result in death, physical disability, injury or other illness,
employers are required to provide compensation, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's representative office in New Delhi is expected to issue a visa later
Thursday for the Dalai Lama to visit Taiwan next week, W. C. Weng, Taiwan's
envoy to India, said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The Taipei Economic and Cultural Center in New Delhi is likely to receive an
official notification from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Taipei later
Thursday, and will be able to promptly issue a visa to allow the Tibetan
spiritual leader to enter Taiwan for a stay from Aug. 31- Sept. 4," Weng told
the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>According to Weng, his office will issue a visa for foreign visitors to the
Dalai Lama so as to avert unnecessary complications. An entourage  of about 19
members will accompany the Dalai Lama to Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>Earlier Thursday during an inspection tour of the disaster areas in Nantou
County,  President Ma Ying-jeou announced  that his administration has approved
a visit to Taiwan by the Dalai Lama to comfort victims of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Ma in December declined to grant the Dalai Lama a visit, saying the timing was
not right. The president was just embarking on unprecedented efforts to reduce
tensions and strengthen economic ties with China at the time.</P>
      <P>The Tibetan spiritual leader has repeatedly said that he would be very willing
to visit Taiwan again as long as it would not create trouble for the government.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama first visited Taiwan in 1997. He then came to Taiwan in 2001,
holding a visa only available to Taiwanese citizens which was made possible with
consent from the Ministry of the Interior and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs
Commission.</P>
      <P>According to Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi, the government's
decision to authorize the visit was based on religious and humanitarian

not to cause any misunderstanding between Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Thekchen Choeling, secretary general of the Office of His Holiness the Dalai
Lama in Dharamsala, northern India, confirmed on the same day that the Tibetan
spiritual leader had received an invitation issued by Taiwan's opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to visit Taiwan later this month. But he
declined to comment further.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama has lived in exile in Dharamsala since fleeing to India following
a failed uprising against Chinese rule in 1959.</P>
      <P>Choeling said Wednesday that the Dalai Lama is "very willing" to visit southern
Taiwan to give morale support to the victims of Typhoon Morakot, which lashed
Taiwan Aug. 7-10.</P>
      <P>Seven mayors and magistrates of cities and counties in the typhoon-stricken
areas, who are also members of the DPP, extended the invitation to the Dalai
Lama, asking him to come to Taiwan and pray for the victim in the wake of the
storm.</P>
      <P>They are heads of some of the municipalities in areas that were hardest hit by
Morakot -- the worst to sweep southern Taiwan in 50 years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan renames 'severe' A(H1N1) case as 'hospitalized' case</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  27 (CNA)
08/27/09  19:22:14

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's health officials said Thursday they will reclassify "severe" cases of
swine flu, officially known as influenza A(H1N1), as "hospitalized" cases to
more accurately reflect the state of the patients.</P>
      <P>"In the past, we referred to a swine flu case with complications, such as
pneumonia, meningitis and myocarditis as 'severe, but most of such complications
were mild. Consequently, it was not precise to call it as a 'severe' case, "
said Department of Health (DOH) Deputy Minister Chang Shan-chwen.</P>
      <P>"Starting today, the category has been renamed 'hospitalized' case," Chang
added.</P>
      <P>Steve Kuo, director-general of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control, echoed
Chang's view, saying that even people who stay in intensive care units (ICUs)
are not necessarily in severe condition.</P>
      <P>"Some A(H1N1) patients were placed in ICUs mainly because hospital management
adopted a very cautious approach while in several other cases, patients opted to
stay in ICUs to save money in hiring caregivers," Kuo argued.</P>
      <P>In the future, he said, the DOH will identify truly severe swine flu patients in
terms of clinical data.</P>
      <P>Health analysts said the renaming may be part of the DOH's efforts to avoid
causing public panic as the number of swine flu infections has continued rising
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Five more "hospitalized" A(H1N1) cases were confirmed Thursday, bringing to 52
the total number recorded in the country, according to the latest statistics
released by the Central Epidemic Command Center.</P>
      <P>The five new cases involved a 45-year-old man and a 9-year-old boy in northern
Taiwan; a 6-year-old boy in central Taiwan; an 18-year-old male in southern
Taiwan's Kaohsiung-Pingtung area; and a 62-year-old woman in eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 52 "hospitalized" cases included five fatalities and 12 patients who are
still receiving treatment in hospitals, according to the center's data.</P>
      <P>Touching on the swine flu's mortality rate, Chang said previous data showed the
disease fatality rate at 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent.</P>
      <P>"But the figures may not be correct because many mild cases were not counted in
the denominator in the past, " he said. "In Taiwan, for instance, an estimated
11,000 to 12,000 people came down with the swine flu virus last week, but the
number of accumulated fatalities was only five so far. Based on this, the
mortality rate should not be high."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Will Taiwan's defense outpost become casino hub?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Aug.  27 (CNA)
08/27/09  20:19:01
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Residents on Taiwan's outlying island of Kinmen may soon go to the polls to
decide whether the defense outpost could turn into a casino hub.</P>
      <P>That prospect became more likely Thursday, with an activist filing a petition
with the Kinmen county government to hold a referendum on whether to legalize
gaming on the island and allow the establishment of tourist casinos.</P>
      <P>Kinmen,  composed  of 12 islets,  lies closer  to China's southeastern province
of Fujian than to Taiwan proper. It used to be Taiwan's froneline island against
China and in the late 50s and early 60s was the target of intense shelling by
Communist China.</P>
      <P>With cross-strait ties improving, the number of troops stationed there has
significantly decreased and tourism has become the backbone of its economic
activities.</P>
      <P>Chen Chang-chiang, head of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's)
Kinmen chapter, filed the petition in his capacity as convener of the organizing
committee of a Kinmen County tourism industry promotion association.</P>
      <P>To back his petition, Chen also produced 460 signatures endorsing the proposal.</P>
      <P>"According to the Referendum Act, the casino referendum petition needs formal
endorsement by at least 0.5 percent of eligible voters in the county's last
magistrate election, namely at least 354 signatures, " Chen said, adding that
the number of signatures collected by the association is well over that
threshold.</P>
      <P>A county government official received the petition along with signatures from
Chen and promised to pass them to the Kinmen County Election Commission for
processing.</P>
      <P>If the petition passes the screening, Chen's association will then launch the
second stage of signature campaign to qualify for putting the proposal to a
referendum.</P>
      <P>Stressing that he is petitioning for the referendum in his private capacity,
Chen said the move has nothing to do with his party's position. The DPP is known
to oppose legalizing casinos on outlying islands.</P>
      <P>Chen also argued that his petition does not necessarily imply his personal
support for the proposal.</P>
      <P>"My move just signifies my belief that the issue should be determined by the
majority of local residents instead by a few politicians' personal stance or
ideology, " Chen said, claiming that the county government and the county
council have been reluctant to address the issue.</P>
      <P>Gambling has long been banned in Taiwan, but the Legislative Yuan passed
legislation on Jan. 12 to legalize casino gambling on outlying islands.</P>
      <P>The offshore county of Penghu is scheduled to hold a referendum on whether to
allow casinos to be built there on Sept. 26.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although Kinmen lagged behind Penghu in launching the  drive,
his  association  managed  to  collect  the more-than-required-number of
endorsements in just three days.</P>
      <P>"The promptness indicates that local residents do not reject the proposal to
permit the establishment of tourist casinos, " Chen contended.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Lawrence Ho, the son of Macau gaming business tycoon Stanley
Ho, toured Kinmen on Aug. 7 to get a sense of the county's business environment
and expressed keen interest in tapping the market.</P>
      <P>"It is generally believed that Kinmen residents will approve the casino business
if a referendum is held, " Chen argued. "Given a fast thawing in relations
across the Taiwan Strait, it seems to me that Kinmen stands a better chance than
Penghu to operate tourist casino businesses."</P>

      <P>Tibet's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama will arrive in Taiwan for a six-day
visit Aug. 30 and will travel to two villages hit hard by Typhoon Morakot to
comfort the victims, the Kaohsiung city government confirmed Thursday.</P>
      <P>City officials have begun arranging the Dalai Lama's itinerary while he is in
Taiwan, and he is expected to head for some of the worst-hit disaster areas in
southern Taiwan, including Siaolin village in Kaohsiung County and Linbian
Township in neighboring Pingtung County, Sept. 1 and Sept. 2.</P>
      <P>The two villages, particularly Siaolin village, were devastated by Morakok,
which lashed southern Taiwan Aug. 7-10. Chiayi, Kaohsiung, Pingtung and Taitung
counties suffered the most damage from the storm.</P>
      <P>According to the Central Emergency Operation Center, the death toll from the
disaster had reached 461, with 192 others reported missing and 46 injured, as of
Tuesday. Many of the dead and missing are residents believed to have been buried
under mudslides in Siaolin village.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government is also hoping that the Dalai Lama will give a
speech at the Kaohsiung Arena and hold an international news conference in the
city during his three-day stay.</P>
      <P>In bid to give moral support to the typhoon victims, the Dalai Lama agreed to
travel to Taiwan and pray for them, responding to an invitation jointly issued
by seven city majors and county magistrates in southern Taiwan, all of whom are
members of Taiwan's opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Citing "humanitarian" and "religious" considerations, the central government in
Taipei approved the Dalai Lama's proposed visit to Taiwan earlier that same day.</P>

      <P>While Typhoon Morakot triggered flooding and landslides had demolished a small
percentage of Taiwan's scenic spots, the tourism industry is anticipating an
even worse scenario of a sharp decline of tourist arrivals from abroad and a
slumping market for domestic travel, a tourism official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Tourism Bureau Director-General Janice Lai said international tourist arrivals
from August to October could drop by 10 percent from the level of the same
period of last year, leading to industry losses of up to NT$2.7 billion (US$84.4
million).</P>
      <P>As many tour groups from China have canceled trips to Taiwan in the wake of the
worst flooding in 50 years in some southern areas of the country, only an
average of 700 Chinese tourists are expected each day in the coming weeks, a
drastic decline from the daily average of 2,000 at the end of July.</P>
      <P>Lai said the bureau has contacted travel businesses in China, suggesting that
they can still design impressive tour packages, since most of the tourist
attractions remain intact.</P>
      <P>Although the iconic mountain resort of Alishan was seriously damaged by floods
and mudslides, there are many other mountainous scenic spots in central Taiwan
worth seeing, she added.</P>
      <P>As the nation mourns the dead and works on rehabilitation and reconstruction,
people's interest in domestic travel has also declined.</P>
      <P>The bureau said that with the number of domestic tourists down by 15 percent in
August compared with the same month of the previous year, the tourism industry
will lose another NT$5.9 billion.</P>

      <P>To love and be loved. That is the common wish of more than 300 single young men

one of a series of romantic activities to mark Chinese Lover's Day, which fell
on Aug. 26 this year.</P>
      <P>Over 200 Chinese youths from the city of Xiamen in Fujian Province sailed to

Zhenlin, chief of the Hai Xia Dao Bao -- a Xiamen-based newspaper -- expressed
hope that the young lovers will soon find eternal love with their Mr. or Miss

      <P>On Kinmen Island's Shiapu beach, where the statue has been erected, the lovers
competed to snatch a piece of red thread from Yueh Lau as a gesture of being

sincerest hopes from surrounding trees in a gesture designed to fulfill their
sweetest dreams.</P>

perfect the process of quickly identifying, testing and treating students with
flu-like symptoms, as part of a campaign to prevent an outbreak of influenza A
(H1N1) after schools reopen on Friday.</P>
      <P>The drill, held at Wende Elementary School, simulated a situation in which the
school nurse confirmed that a student had a fever and had to be taken
immediately to Taipei County Public Health Center.</P>
      <P>After the student arrived at the health center, nose and throat swabs were
immediately taken and a doctor was able to determine within five minutes whether
or not the student was infected with the H1N1 virus.</P>
      <P>In an actual situation, if a student tests positive for the H1N1 virus, he or
she will be given medication and sent home to rest for five days, or
hospitalized if the symptoms are serious.</P>
      <P>In order to effectively monitor the spread of the virus, the Taipei City
Government's Department of Education will supply all public schools with ear
thermometers -- one for every three classes -- and students will be required to
have their temperatures taken every day.</P>
      <P>According to Lin Guo-ning, an official at the Centers for Disease Control, these
measures are being introduced to make good use of the precious time before a
massive A(H1N1) outbreak occurs, as has been predicted.</P>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control has also stipulated that if two students in a
class are diagnosed with H1N1 within three days, the whole class must be
suspended for five days in order to prevent cluster infections, Lin said.</P>
      <P>However, according to the head of the Kaohsiung County Government Health Bureau,
five days of suspension might not be enough to alleviate the risk. Other
countries tend to stipulate seven days in such situations, he noted.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that it would be difficult to isolate students who are
housed in emergency shelters in areas devastated by Typhoon Morakot, if they
contract the H1N1 virus.</P>
      <P>For example, the 120 students of Baolai Junior High School in Liugui Township --
one of the 18 schools completely destroyed by Typhoon Morakot earlier this month
-- are now housed at an Iguan Dao Temple where they all eat, sleep and take
classes, he said.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health has given priority to typhoon victims, medical workers,
pregnant women and children below high school level for H1N1 inoculation when
10,000,000 doses of the new vaccine become available in mid-November.</P>
      <P>However, experts have predicted that the vaccination campaign will come too late
to prevent an H1N1 epidemic.</P>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control has estimated that there are 15,000 new cases of
H1N1 influenza cases every week, and the number is predicted to increase when
the new school semester starts.</P>
      <P>The predictions put the number of H1N1 infections at a peak of 7,000,000, with a
conservative death count of 7,000.</P>
      <P>H1N1 symptoms include cough,  nasal congestion,  nausea or vomiting, diarrhea,
body aches, joint pains, fever, sore throat, headache, fatigue and loss of
energy.</P>
      <P>Antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu, if taken within 48 hours of the onset of H1N1
symptoms, can give some relief and reduce the period of illness by about a day.</P>
      <P>Tamiflu prescriptions for those who have been diagnosed with the H1N1 virus are
now covered by National Health Insurance.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Post-disaster reconstruction bill clears Legislature</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  27 (CNA)
08/27/09  22:40:44
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed an urgent special statute Thursday authorizing the
executive branch to raise a special budget of up to NT$120 billion (US$3.64
billion) for reconstruction in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>The statute also calls for the establishment of a reconstruction commission to
lead and guide relevant work, with the premier and vice premier serving as its
head and deputy head.</P>
      <P>It further stipulates that the number of those who represent affected residents
and aboriginal tribesmen should not be less than one-fifth of the commission's
complete roster.</P>
      <P>Morakot pummeled Taiwan Aug. 7-9, triggering the worst flooding in 50 years in
certain places in southern Taiwan and leading to landslides that buried remote
mountainous  villages and tribal settlements.</P>
      <P>The special statute authorizes governments at all levels to impose compulsory
relocation of villages or tribal settlements from areas vulnerable to floods and
landslides to safer areas.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang-controlled Legislature completed a third reading of the
bill at the conclusion of a three-day extraordinary screening session.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan originally planned to raise a special budget of NT$100
billion to finance various reconstruction projects, but the main opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) proposed that the fund be increased to NT$200
billion. The KMT also came up with a proposal that funding should be capped at
NT$120 billion.</P>
      <P>The KMT proposal prevailed. The method of fundraising was also changed to the
floating of state bonds or borrowing instead of selling government stakes in
state-run banks as had been proposed by the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>As the outstanding government debts are approaching the legal ceiling, the
statute exempts the government from restrictions set forth in the Public Debt
Law in this respect.</P>
      <P>Regarding mortgage balances on houses rendered uninhabitable or washed away
during the storm's onslaught, the statute stipulates that lending banks should
absorb all such losses.</P>
      <P>Financial institutions should also exempt borrowers from having to repay
outstanding mortgages on farmland and aquaculture ponds destroyed or washed away
during the storm, with the government offering them subsidies equivalent to a
maximum 80 percent of the total amount.</P>
      <P>On relocation of the hardest-hit villages and tribal settlements, the statute
prescribes that central and local governments should consult with residents to
reach a consensus on resettlement or relocation. No flood- and landslide-prone
areas should be available for habitation any longer.</P>
      <P>The statute also stipulates that land development and rezoning in selected sites
that have passed environmental impact assessments will not be subject to
restrictions imposed by existing urban planning laws or regulations.</P>
      <P>During the legislative screening process, some representatives from Namasia
township in Kaohsiung County -- one of the hardest-hit disaster zones --  voiced
strong opposition to the compulsory relocation regulation, but were bundled out
of the conference hall by policemen and security guards.</P>
      <P>The legislature also passed a resolution demanding that the Executive Yuan
submit a draft package within one month on national land protection and
restoration, as years of rampant overdevelopment of mountain slopelands and
river catchment areas have made many parts of Taiwan vulnerable to landslides
and mudslides.</P>
      <P>The resolution also demands that the central government set up service centers
in various typhoon-affected areas to offer mental health counseling as well as
employment and education services.</P>
      <P>In terms of driftwood cleanup, the resolution stipulates that a week after the
implementation of the special statute, typhoon victims should be allowed to pick
up driftwood  that the Council of Agriculture has not already marked.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Referendum Screening Committee under the Executive Yuan rejected an
opposition Democratic Progressive Party-initiated proposal to hold a referendum
on the signing of a Taiwan-China economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA).</P>
      <P>Only 19 of the 21-member committee were present, and a majority 13 members voted
to reject the proposal on the grounds that it is based on a hypothetical
situation that does not meet the criteria of the Referendum Law. Four voted in
favor and two abstained.</P>
      <P>The DPP had hoped to have the nation's voters answer the question: "Do you agree
that the government should hold a referendum to allow the people to decide on
the signing of a Taiwan-China ECFA?"</P>
      <P>Committee Chairman Chao Yung-mao commented that the referendum proposal was
ambiguous and based on something that has not actually happened.</P>
      <P>The proposed ECFA advocated by President Ma Ying-jeou is aimed at protecting
Taiwan from being marginalized  as countries in the Asia-Pacific region,
including China, Japan, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, are in the process of economic integration through the signing of free
trade agreements.</P>
      <P>So far, the ECFA proposal has not been put on the table for negotiation,
although the administration is expected to start cross-strait negotiations on
the issue by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>The government's outstanding debts will not exceed the legal ceiling even after
it borrows an additional NT$120 billion (US$3.64 billion) to finance
reconstruction projects in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot, an official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Deputy Finance Minister Tseng Ming-chung made the remarks after the Legislative
Yuan passed a special statute earlier in the day authorizing the executive
branch to raise a special budget of up to NT$120 billion for post-disaster
reconstruction.</P>
      <P>According to Tseng, the government's total outstanding debts are budgeted at
NT$4.1498 trillion up to the end of 2009, accounting for 32.87 percent of the
gross national product (GNP) for the previous three years.</P>
      <P>If the NT$120 billion budget for post-Morakot reconstruction is counted, the
government's accumulated outstanding debts will increase to NT$4.2698 trillion,
equivalent to 33.82 percent of the total GNP for the previous three years.</P>
      <P>"The ratio is still below the 40 percent ceiling set forth in the Public Debt
Law," Tseng noted.</P>
      <P>He also discounted a media report that the government's debts have exceeded
NT$10 trillion.  "The report is misleading  and erroneous," he said, adding that
the report used a calculation method far different from the ones usually adopted
in the international community.</P>
      <P>Compared with many other countries, he said, the government's debts remain
within a normal range.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan approves Dalai Lama visit</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday that his administration has approved a
visit to Taiwan by Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama to console and pray
for the victims of Typhoon Morakot. Ma made the announcement during an
inspection tour of the disaster areas in Nantou County. The invitation for the
exiled Tibetan leader to visit Taiwan was issued by the chiefs of seven
Democratic Progressive Party-controlled localities in southern Taiwan that were
hit hard by the storm.</P>
      <P>The visit is tentatively scheduled for Aug. 31 to Sept. 4. According to
Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi, the government's decision to
authorize the visit was based on religious and humanitarian considerations.</P>
      <P>"We think this matter should not damage relations between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait," Wang said.</P>
      <P>On whether Ma will meet with the Dalai Lama during his stay in Taiwan, Wang said
this will remain a hypothetical question until the Tibetan spiritual leader
officially files an application for the visit.</P>
      <P>Wang said the Dalai Lama had written to Ma in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot
to convey his concern over the disaster, and Ma replied Aug. 24 to express his
appreciation.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama first visited Taiwan in 1997 and again in 2001.</P>
      <P>In 2002, however, the Dalai Lama turned down Taiwan's invitation for a third
visit, saying that it was an inconvenient time. The Tibetan government in exile
was holding talks with Beijing at the time.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama indicated his desire to visit Taiwan in June 2008, soon after the
inauguration of President Ma, but the proposal was turned down by Ma on the
grounds that it was an inappropriate time.</P>
      <P>It was widely believed that Ma did so to try to avoid blotching Taiwan's warming
ties with China.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the issue Thursday, Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
the Dalai Lama' s upcoming visit will be religious in nature and that he
believes Beijing will view the matter from a humanitarian perspective, which
will help minimize any possible political fallout. Also, Wang said he believes
the Dalai Lama will comply with Taiwan's request to avoid any political
activities while in Taiwan, so as not to cause any misunderstanding between
Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot, which battered the country Aug. 7-9, triggered the worst
flooding in 50 years, devastating much of southern Taiwan. As of Tuesday,
confirmed fatalities from the disaster had reached 461, with 192 others reported
missing and 46 injured, according to the Central Emergency Operation Center. A
national mourning ceremony will be held Sept. 7 in Kaohsiung for the dead.</P>

      <P>Private sector employers cannot reject workers' requests for leave of absence to
tend family members who are infected with the A(H1N1) virus or to take care of
children whose schools have been closed because of H1N1 infections, the Council
of Labor Affairs (CLA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The rule applies to all employers of five or more workers, CLA officials said.</P>
      <P>However, while each worker is entitled to up to seven days leave per year for
such purposes, they will not be paid for the periods of absence, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>In the case of civil servants, they can also take seven days off, but they will
be paid for a maximum of five of those days, according to the Central Personnel
Administration.</P>
      <P>Also Thursday, Su Ying-kuei, chief of Taipei City's Department of Labor, said
that if employers ask workers to stay at home on suspicion of influenza A(H1N1)
infection, the workers should be paid for the duration of their absence.</P>
      <P>In addition, if employees are quarantined by health authorities, their employers
cannot punish them on grounds of unauthorized absence, Su said.</P>
      <P>In the case of workers who contract H1N1 influenza in the line of duty, their
employers should grant them work-related sick leave with full pay, he said. If
such infections result in death, physical disability, injury or other illness,
employers are required to provide compensation, he added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's representative office in New Delhi is expected to issue a visa later
Thursday for the Dalai Lama to visit Taiwan next week, W. C. Weng, Taiwan's
envoy to India, said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The Taipei Economic and Cultural Center in New Delhi is likely to receive an
official notification from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Taipei later
Thursday, and will be able to promptly issue a visa to allow the Tibetan
spiritual leader to enter Taiwan for a stay from Aug. 31- Sept. 4," Weng told
the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>According to Weng, his office will issue a visa for foreign visitors to the
Dalai Lama so as to avert unnecessary complications. An entourage  of about 19
members will accompany the Dalai Lama to Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>Earlier Thursday during an inspection tour of the disaster areas in Nantou
County,  President Ma Ying-jeou announced  that his administration has approved
a visit to Taiwan by the Dalai Lama to comfort victims of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Ma in December declined to grant the Dalai Lama a visit, saying the timing was
not right. The president was just embarking on unprecedented efforts to reduce
tensions and strengthen economic ties with China at the time.</P>
      <P>The Tibetan spiritual leader has repeatedly said that he would be very willing
to visit Taiwan again as long as it would not create trouble for the government.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama first visited Taiwan in 1997. He then came to Taiwan in 2001,
holding a visa only available to Taiwanese citizens which was made possible with
consent from the Ministry of the Interior and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs

      <P>Thekchen Choeling, secretary general of the Office of His Holiness the Dalai
Lama in Dharamsala, northern India, confirmed on the same day that the Tibetan
spiritual leader had received an invitation issued by Taiwan's opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to visit Taiwan later this month. But he
declined to comment further.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama has lived in exile in Dharamsala since fleeing to India following
a failed uprising against Chinese rule in 1959.</P>
      <P>Choeling said Wednesday that the Dalai Lama is "very willing" to visit southern
Taiwan to give morale support to the victims of Typhoon Morakot, which lashed
Taiwan Aug. 7-10.</P>
      <P>Seven mayors and magistrates of cities and counties in the typhoon-stricken
areas, who are also members of the DPP, extended the invitation to the Dalai
Lama, asking him to come to Taiwan and pray for the victim in the wake of the
storm.</P>
      <P>They are heads of some of the municipalities in areas that were hardest hit by
Morakot -- the worst to sweep southern Taiwan in 50 years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan renames 'severe' A(H1N1) case as 'hospitalized' case</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's health officials said Thursday they will reclassify "severe" cases of
swine flu, officially known as influenza A(H1N1), as "hospitalized" cases to
more accurately reflect the state of the patients.</P>
      <P>"In the past, we referred to a swine flu case with complications, such as
pneumonia, meningitis and myocarditis as 'severe, but most of such complications
were mild. Consequently, it was not precise to call it as a 'severe' case, "
said Department of Health (DOH) Deputy Minister Chang Shan-chwen.</P>
      <P>"Starting today, the category has been renamed 'hospitalized' case," Chang
added.</P>
      <P>Steve Kuo, director-general of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control, echoed
Chang's view, saying that even people who stay in intensive care units (ICUs)
are not necessarily in severe condition.</P>
      <P>"Some A(H1N1) patients were placed in ICUs mainly because hospital management
adopted a very cautious approach while in several other cases, patients opted to
stay in ICUs to save money in hiring caregivers," Kuo argued.</P>
      <P>In the future, he said, the DOH will identify truly severe swine flu patients in
terms of clinical data.</P>
      <P>Health analysts said the renaming may be part of the DOH's efforts to avoid
causing public panic as the number of swine flu infections has continued rising
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Five more "hospitalized" A(H1N1) cases were confirmed Thursday, bringing to 52
the total number recorded in the country, according to the latest statistics
released by the Central Epidemic Command Center.</P>
      <P>The five new cases involved a 45-year-old man and a 9-year-old boy in northern
Taiwan; a 6-year-old boy in central Taiwan; an 18-year-old male in southern
Taiwan's Kaohsiung-Pingtung area; and a 62-year-old woman in eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 52 "hospitalized" cases included five fatalities and 12 patients who are
still receiving treatment in hospitals, according to the center's data.</P>
      <P>Touching on the swine flu's mortality rate, Chang said previous data showed the
disease fatality rate at 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent.</P>
      <P>"But the figures may not be correct because many mild cases were not counted in
the denominator in the past, " he said. "In Taiwan, for instance, an estimated
11,000 to 12,000 people came down with the swine flu virus last week, but the
number of accumulated fatalities was only five so far. Based on this, the
mortality rate should not be high."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Will Taiwan's defense outpost become casino hub?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Aug.  27 (CNA)
08/27/09  20:19:01
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Residents on Taiwan's outlying island of Kinmen may soon go to the polls to
decide whether the defense outpost could turn into a casino hub.</P>
      <P>That prospect became more likely Thursday, with an activist filing a petition
with the Kinmen county government to hold a referendum on whether to legalize
gaming on the island and allow the establishment of tourist casinos.</P>
      <P>Kinmen,  composed  of 12 islets,  lies closer  to China's southeastern province
of Fujian than to Taiwan proper. It used to be Taiwan's froneline island against
China and in the late 50s and early 60s was the target of intense shelling by
Communist China.</P>
      <P>With cross-strait ties improving, the number of troops stationed there has
significantly decreased and tourism has become the backbone of its economic
activities.</P>
      <P>Chen Chang-chiang, head of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's)
Kinmen chapter, filed the petition in his capacity as convener of the organizing
committee of a Kinmen County tourism industry promotion association.</P>
      <P>To back his petition, Chen also produced 460 signatures endorsing the proposal.</P>
      <P>"According to the Referendum Act, the casino referendum petition needs formal
endorsement by at least 0.5 percent of eligible voters in the county's last
magistrate election, namely at least 354 signatures, " Chen said, adding that
the number of signatures collected by the association is well over that
threshold.</P>
      <P>A county government official received the petition along with signatures from
Chen and promised to pass them to the Kinmen County Election Commission for
processing.</P>
      <P>If the petition passes the screening, Chen's association will then launch the
second stage of signature campaign to qualify for putting the proposal to a
referendum.</P>
      <P>Stressing that he is petitioning for the referendum in his private capacity,
Chen said the move has nothing to do with his party's position. The DPP is known
to oppose legalizing casinos on outlying islands.</P>
      <P>Chen also argued that his petition does not necessarily imply his personal
support for the proposal.</P>
      <P>"My move just signifies my belief that the issue should be determined by the
majority of local residents instead by a few politicians' personal stance or
ideology, " Chen said, claiming that the county government and the county
council have been reluctant to address the issue.</P>
      <P>Gambling has long been banned in Taiwan, but the Legislative Yuan passed
legislation on Jan. 12 to legalize casino gambling on outlying islands.</P>
      <P>The offshore county of Penghu is scheduled to hold a referendum on whether to
allow casinos to be built there on Sept. 26.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although Kinmen lagged behind Penghu in launching the  drive,
his  association  managed  to  collect  the more-than-required-number of
endorsements in just three days.</P>
      <P>"The promptness indicates that local residents do not reject the proposal to
permit the establishment of tourist casinos, " Chen contended.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Lawrence Ho, the son of Macau gaming business tycoon Stanley
Ho, toured Kinmen on Aug. 7 to get a sense of the county's business environment
and expressed keen interest in tapping the market.</P>
      <P>"It is generally believed that Kinmen residents will approve the casino business
if a referendum is held, " Chen argued. "Given a fast thawing in relations
across the Taiwan Strait, it seems to me that Kinmen stands a better chance than
Penghu to operate tourist casino businesses."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Tibet's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama will arrive in Taiwan for a six-day
visit Aug. 30 and will travel to two villages hit hard by Typhoon Morakot to
comfort the victims, the Kaohsiung city government confirmed Thursday.</P>
      <P>City officials have begun arranging the Dalai Lama's itinerary while he is in
Taiwan, and he is expected to head for some of the worst-hit disaster areas in
southern Taiwan, including Siaolin village in Kaohsiung County and Linbian
Township in neighboring Pingtung County, Sept. 1 and Sept. 2.</P>
      <P>The two villages, particularly Siaolin village, were devastated by Morakok,
which lashed southern Taiwan Aug. 7-10. Chiayi, Kaohsiung, Pingtung and Taitung
counties suffered the most damage from the storm.</P>
      <P>According to the Central Emergency Operation Center, the death toll from the
disaster had reached 461, with 192 others reported missing and 46 injured, as of
Tuesday. Many of the dead and missing are residents believed to have been buried
under mudslides in Siaolin village.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government is also hoping that the Dalai Lama will give a
speech at the Kaohsiung Arena and hold an international news conference in the
city during his three-day stay.</P>
      <P>In bid to give moral support to the typhoon victims, the Dalai Lama agreed to
travel to Taiwan and pray for them, responding to an invitation jointly issued
by seven city majors and county magistrates in southern Taiwan, all of whom are
members of Taiwan's opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Citing "humanitarian" and "religious" considerations, the central government in
Taipei approved the Dalai Lama's proposed visit to Taiwan earlier that same day.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>While Typhoon Morakot triggered flooding and landslides had demolished a small
percentage of Taiwan's scenic spots, the tourism industry is anticipating an
even worse scenario of a sharp decline of tourist arrivals from abroad and a
slumping market for domestic travel, a tourism official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Tourism Bureau Director-General Janice Lai said international tourist arrivals
from August to October could drop by 10 percent from the level of the same
period of last year, leading to industry losses of up to NT$2.7 billion (US$84.4
million).</P>
      <P>As many tour groups from China have canceled trips to Taiwan in the wake of the
worst flooding in 50 years in some southern areas of the country, only an
average of 700 Chinese tourists are expected each day in the coming weeks, a
drastic decline from the daily average of 2,000 at the end of July.</P>
      <P>Lai said the bureau has contacted travel businesses in China, suggesting that
they can still design impressive tour packages, since most of the tourist
attractions remain intact.</P>
      <P>Although the iconic mountain resort of Alishan was seriously damaged by floods
and mudslides, there are many other mountainous scenic spots in central Taiwan
worth seeing, she added.</P>
      <P>As the nation mourns the dead and works on rehabilitation and reconstruction,
people's interest in domestic travel has also declined.</P>
      <P>The bureau said that with the number of domestic tourists down by 15 percent in
August compared with the same month of the previous year, the tourism industry
will lose another NT$5.9 billion.</P>

      <P>To love and be loved. That is the common wish of more than 300 single young men
and women from Taiwan and China who together marked the inauguration of the
statue of a traditional Chinese matchmaker Thursday on Taiwan's outlying county
of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>The young people jointly witnessed the inauguration of the statue of Yueh Lau --
an elderly and kind male matchmaker of Chinese folklore with a white beard -- in
one of a series of romantic activities to mark Chinese Lover's Day, which fell
on Aug. 26 this year.</P>
      <P>Over 200 Chinese youths from the city of Xiamen in Fujian Province sailed to
Kinmen a day earlier to take part in the activities sponsored by the authorities
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng and a variety of Chinese guests, including Ma
Zhenlin, chief of the Hai Xia Dao Bao -- a Xiamen-based newspaper -- expressed
hope that the young lovers will soon find eternal love with their Mr. or Miss
Right.</P>
      <P>On Kinmen Island's Shiapu beach, where the statue has been erected, the lovers
competed to snatch a piece of red thread from Yueh Lau as a gesture of being
blessed by the matchmaker. They also hung cards inscribed with their most
sincerest hopes from surrounding trees in a gesture designed to fulfill their
sweetest dreams.</P>
      <P>Lee and Ma also planted symbolic trees and flowers to represent their county and
city on the seashore as testimony to the pursuit of everlasting  love by the

    <HEADLINE>Government takes steps to prevent H1N1 epidemic</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 27 (CNA)
08/27/09  22:40:20

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei County Public Health Bureau held a drill Thursday in an effort to
perfect the process of quickly identifying, testing and treating students with
flu-like symptoms, as part of a campaign to prevent an outbreak of influenza A
(H1N1) after schools reopen on Friday.</P>
      <P>The drill, held at Wende Elementary School, simulated a situation in which the
school nurse confirmed that a student had a fever and had to be taken
immediately to Taipei County Public Health Center.</P>
      <P>After the student arrived at the health center, nose and throat swabs were
immediately taken and a doctor was able to determine within five minutes whether
or not the student was infected with the H1N1 virus.</P>
      <P>In an actual situation, if a student tests positive for the H1N1 virus, he or
she will be given medication and sent home to rest for five days, or
hospitalized if the symptoms are serious.</P>
      <P>In order to effectively monitor the spread of the virus, the Taipei City
Government's Department of Education will supply all public schools with ear
thermometers -- one for every three classes -- and students will be required to
have their temperatures taken every day.</P>
      <P>According to Lin Guo-ning, an official at the Centers for Disease Control, these
measures are being introduced to make good use of the precious time before a
massive A(H1N1) outbreak occurs, as has been predicted.</P>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control has also stipulated that if two students in a
class are diagnosed with H1N1 within three days, the whole class must be
suspended for five days in order to prevent cluster infections, Lin said.</P>
      <P>However, according to the head of the Kaohsiung County Government Health Bureau,
five days of suspension might not be enough to alleviate the risk. Other
countries tend to stipulate seven days in such situations, he noted.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that it would be difficult to isolate students who are
housed in emergency shelters in areas devastated by Typhoon Morakot, if they
contract the H1N1 virus.</P>
      <P>For example, the 120 students of Baolai Junior High School in Liugui Township --
one of the 18 schools completely destroyed by Typhoon Morakot earlier this month
-- are now housed at an Iguan Dao Temple where they all eat, sleep and take
classes, he said.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health has given priority to typhoon victims, medical workers,
pregnant women and children below high school level for H1N1 inoculation when
10,000,000 doses of the new vaccine become available in mid-November.</P>
      <P>However, experts have predicted that the vaccination campaign will come too late
to prevent an H1N1 epidemic.</P>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control has estimated that there are 15,000 new cases of
H1N1 influenza cases every week, and the number is predicted to increase when
the new school semester starts.</P>
      <P>The predictions put the number of H1N1 infections at a peak of 7,000,000, with a
conservative death count of 7,000.</P>
      <P>H1N1 symptoms include cough,  nasal congestion,  nausea or vomiting, diarrhea,
body aches, joint pains, fever, sore throat, headache, fatigue and loss of
energy.</P>
      <P>Antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu, if taken within 48 hours of the onset of H1N1
symptoms, can give some relief and reduce the period of illness by about a day.</P>
      <P>Tamiflu prescriptions for those who have been diagnosed with the H1N1 virus are
now covered by National Health Insurance.</P>

08/27/09  22:40:44

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed an urgent special statute Thursday authorizing the
executive branch to raise a special budget of up to NT$120 billion (US$3.64
billion) for reconstruction in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>The statute also calls for the establishment of a reconstruction commission to
lead and guide relevant work, with the premier and vice premier serving as its
head and deputy head.</P>
      <P>It further stipulates that the number of those who represent affected residents
and aboriginal tribesmen should not be less than one-fifth of the commission's
complete roster.</P>
      <P>Morakot pummeled Taiwan Aug. 7-9, triggering the worst flooding in 50 years in
certain places in southern Taiwan and leading to landslides that buried remote
mountainous  villages and tribal settlements.</P>
      <P>The special statute authorizes governments at all levels to impose compulsory
relocation of villages or tribal settlements from areas vulnerable to floods and
landslides to safer areas.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang-controlled Legislature completed a third reading of the
bill at the conclusion of a three-day extraordinary screening session.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan originally planned to raise a special budget of NT$100
billion to finance various reconstruction projects, but the main opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) proposed that the fund be increased to NT$200
billion. The KMT also came up with a proposal that funding should be capped at
NT$120 billion.</P>
      <P>The KMT proposal prevailed. The method of fundraising was also changed to the
floating of state bonds or borrowing instead of selling government stakes in
state-run banks as had been proposed by the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>As the outstanding government debts are approaching the legal ceiling, the
statute exempts the government from restrictions set forth in the Public Debt
Law in this respect.</P>
      <P>Regarding mortgage balances on houses rendered uninhabitable or washed away
during the storm's onslaught, the statute stipulates that lending banks should
absorb all such losses.</P>
      <P>Financial institutions should also exempt borrowers from having to repay
outstanding mortgages on farmland and aquaculture ponds destroyed or washed away
during the storm, with the government offering them subsidies equivalent to a
maximum 80 percent of the total amount.</P>
      <P>On relocation of the hardest-hit villages and tribal settlements, the statute
prescribes that central and local governments should consult with residents to
reach a consensus on resettlement or relocation. No flood- and landslide-prone
areas should be available for habitation any longer.</P>
      <P>The statute also stipulates that land development and rezoning in selected sites
that have passed environmental impact assessments will not be subject to
restrictions imposed by existing urban planning laws or regulations.</P>
      <P>During the legislative screening process, some representatives from Namasia
township in Kaohsiung County -- one of the hardest-hit disaster zones --  voiced
strong opposition to the compulsory relocation regulation, but were bundled out
of the conference hall by policemen and security guards.</P>
      <P>The legislature also passed a resolution demanding that the Executive Yuan
submit a draft package within one month on national land protection and
restoration, as years of rampant overdevelopment of mountain slopelands and
river catchment areas have made many parts of Taiwan vulnerable to landslides
and mudslides.</P>
      <P>The resolution also demands that the central government set up service centers
in various typhoon-affected areas to offer mental health counseling as well as
employment and education services.</P>
      <P>In terms of driftwood cleanup, the resolution stipulates that a week after the
implementation of the special statute, typhoon victims should be allowed to pick
up driftwood  that the Council of Agriculture has not already marked.</P>

      <P>The Referendum Screening Committee under the Executive Yuan rejected an
opposition Democratic Progressive Party-initiated proposal to hold a referendum
on the signing of a Taiwan-China economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA).</P>
      <P>Only 19 of the 21-member committee were present, and a majority 13 members voted
to reject the proposal on the grounds that it is based on a hypothetical
situation that does not meet the criteria of the Referendum Law. Four voted in
favor and two abstained.</P>
      <P>The DPP had hoped to have the nation's voters answer the question: "Do you agree
that the government should hold a referendum to allow the people to decide on
the signing of a Taiwan-China ECFA?"</P>
      <P>Committee Chairman Chao Yung-mao commented that the referendum proposal was
ambiguous and based on something that has not actually happened.</P>
      <P>The proposed ECFA advocated by President Ma Ying-jeou is aimed at protecting
Taiwan from being marginalized  as countries in the Asia-Pacific region,
including China, Japan, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, are in the process of economic integration through the signing of free
trade agreements.</P>
      <P>So far, the ECFA proposal has not been put on the table for negotiation,
although the administration is expected to start cross-strait negotiations on
the issue by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>The government's outstanding debts will not exceed the legal ceiling even after
it borrows an additional NT$120 billion (US$3.64 billion) to finance
reconstruction projects in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot, an official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Deputy Finance Minister Tseng Ming-chung made the remarks after the Legislative
Yuan passed a special statute earlier in the day authorizing the executive
branch to raise a special budget of up to NT$120 billion for post-disaster
reconstruction.</P>
      <P>According to Tseng, the government's total outstanding debts are budgeted at
NT$4.1498 trillion up to the end of 2009, accounting for 32.87 percent of the
gross national product (GNP) for the previous three years.</P>
      <P>If the NT$120 billion budget for post-Morakot reconstruction is counted, the
government's accumulated outstanding debts will increase to NT$4.2698 trillion,
equivalent to 33.82 percent of the total GNP for the previous three years.</P>
      <P>"The ratio is still below the 40 percent ceiling set forth in the Public Debt
Law," Tseng noted.</P>
      <P>He also discounted a media report that the government's debts have exceeded
NT$10 trillion.  "The report is misleading  and erroneous," he said, adding that
the report used a calculation method far different from the ones usually adopted
in the international community.</P>
      <P>Compared with many other countries, he said, the government's debts remain
within a normal range.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government takes steps to prevent H1N1 epidemic</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 27 (CNA)

      <P>The Taipei County Public Health Bureau held a drill Thursday in an effort to
perfect the process of quickly identifying, testing and treating students with
flu-like symptoms, as part of a campaign to prevent an outbreak of influenza A
(H1N1) after schools reopen on Friday.</P>
      <P>The drill, held at Wende Elementary School, simulated a situation in which the
school nurse confirmed that a student had a fever and had to be taken
immediately to Taipei County Public Health Center.</P>
      <P>After the student arrived at the health center, nose and throat swabs were
immediately taken and a doctor was able to determine within five minutes whether
or not the student was infected with the H1N1 virus.</P>
      <P>In an actual situation, if a student tests positive for the H1N1 virus, he or
she will be given medication and sent home to rest for five days, or
hospitalized if the symptoms are serious.</P>
      <P>In order to effectively monitor the spread of the virus, the Taipei City
Government's Department of Education will supply all public schools with ear
thermometers -- one for every three classes -- and students will be required to
have their temperatures taken every day.</P>
      <P>According to Lin Guo-ning, an official at the Centers for Disease Control, these
measures are being introduced to make good use of the precious time before a
massive A(H1N1) outbreak occurs, as has been predicted.</P>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control has also stipulated that if two students in a
class are diagnosed with H1N1 within three days, the whole class must be
suspended for five days in order to prevent cluster infections, Lin said.</P>
      <P>However, according to the head of the Kaohsiung County Government Health Bureau,
five days of suspension might not be enough to alleviate the risk. Other
countries tend to stipulate seven days in such situations, he noted.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that it would be difficult to isolate students who are
housed in emergency shelters in areas devastated by Typhoon Morakot, if they
contract the H1N1 virus.</P>
      <P>For example, the 120 students of Baolai Junior High School in Liugui Township --
one of the 18 schools completely destroyed by Typhoon Morakot earlier this month
-- are now housed at an Iguan Dao Temple where they all eat, sleep and take
classes, he said.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health has given priority to typhoon victims, medical workers,
pregnant women and children below high school level for H1N1 inoculation when
10,000,000 doses of the new vaccine become available in mid-November.</P>
      <P>However, experts have predicted that the vaccination campaign will come too late
to prevent an H1N1 epidemic.</P>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control has estimated that there are 15,000 new cases of
H1N1 influenza cases every week, and the number is predicted to increase when
the new school semester starts.</P>
      <P>The predictions put the number of H1N1 infections at a peak of 7,000,000, with a
conservative death count of 7,000.</P>
      <P>H1N1 symptoms include cough,  nasal congestion,  nausea or vomiting, diarrhea,
body aches, joint pains, fever, sore throat, headache, fatigue and loss of
energy.</P>
      <P>Antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu, if taken within 48 hours of the onset of H1N1
symptoms, can give some relief and reduce the period of illness by about a day.</P>
      <P>Tamiflu prescriptions for those who have been diagnosed with the H1N1 virus are
now covered by National Health Insurance.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Post-disaster reconstruction bill clears Legislature</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  27 (CNA)
08/28/09  09:55:31
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed an urgent special statute Thursday authorizing the
executive branch to raise a special budget of up to NT$120 billion (US$3.64
billion) for reconstruction in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>The statute also calls for the establishment of a reconstruction commission to
lead and guide relevant work, with the premier and vice premier serving as its
head and deputy head.</P>
      <P>It further stipulates that the number of those who represent affected residents
and aboriginal tribesmen should not be less than one-fifth of the commission's
complete roster.</P>
      <P>Morakot pummeled Taiwan Aug. 7-9, triggering the worst flooding in 50 years in
certain places in southern Taiwan and leading to landslides that buried remote
mountainous  villages and tribal settlements.</P>
      <P>The special statute authorizes governments at all levels to impose compulsory
relocation of villages or tribal settlements from areas vulnerable to floods and
landslides to safer areas.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang-controlled Legislature completed a third reading of the
bill at the conclusion of a three-day extraordinary screening session.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan originally planned to raise a special budget of NT$100
billion to finance various reconstruction projects, but the main opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) proposed that the fund be increased to NT$200
billion. The KMT also came up with a proposal that funding should be capped at
NT$120 billion.</P>
      <P>The KMT proposal prevailed. The method of fundraising was also changed to the
floating of state bonds or borrowing instead of selling government stakes in
state-run banks as had been proposed by the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>As the outstanding government debts are approaching the legal ceiling, the
statute exempts the government from restrictions set forth in the Public Debt
Law in this respect.</P>
      <P>Regarding mortgage balances on houses rendered uninhabitable or washed away
during the storm's onslaught, the statute stipulates that lending banks should
absorb all such losses.</P>
      <P>Financial institutions should also exempt borrowers from having to repay
outstanding mortgages on farmland and aquaculture ponds destroyed or washed away
during the storm, with the government offering them subsidies equivalent to a
maximum 80 percent of the total amount.</P>
      <P>On relocation of the hardest-hit villages and tribal settlements, the statute
prescribes that central and local governments should consult with residents to
reach a consensus on resettlement or relocation. No flood- and landslide-prone
areas should be available for habitation any longer.</P>
      <P>The statute also stipulates that land development and rezoning in selected sites
that have passed environmental impact assessments will not be subject to
restrictions imposed by existing urban planning laws or regulations.</P>
      <P>During the legislative screening process, some representatives from Namasia
township in Kaohsiung County -- one of the hardest-hit disaster zones --  voiced
strong opposition to the compulsory relocation regulation, but were bundled out
of the conference hall by policemen and security guards.</P>
      <P>The legislature also passed a resolution demanding that the Executive Yuan
submit a draft package within one month on national land protection and
restoration, as years of rampant overdevelopment of mountain slopelands and
river catchment areas have made many parts of Taiwan vulnerable to landslides
and mudslides.</P>
      <P>The resolution also demands that the central government set up service centers
in various typhoon-affected areas to offer mental health counseling as well as
employment and education services.</P>
      <P>In terms of driftwood cleanup, the resolution stipulates that a week after the
implementation of the special statute, typhoon victims should be allowed to pick
up driftwood  that the Council of Agriculture has not already marked.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cabinet screening committee rejects DPP initiated ECFA referendum</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Referendum Screening Committee under the Executive Yuan rejected an
opposition Democratic Progressive Party-initiated proposal to hold a referendum
on the signing of a Taiwan-China economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA).</P>
      <P>Only 19 of the 21-member committee were present, and a majority 13 members voted
to reject the proposal on the grounds that it is based on a hypothetical
situation that does not meet the criteria of the Referendum Law. Four voted in
favor and two abstained.</P>
      <P>The DPP had hoped to have the nation's voters answer the question: "Do you agree
that the government should hold a referendum to allow the people to decide on
the signing of a Taiwan-China ECFA?"</P>
      <P>Committee Chairman Chao Yung-mao commented that the referendum proposal was
ambiguous and based on something that has not actually happened.</P>
      <P>The proposed ECFA advocated by President Ma Ying-jeou is aimed at protecting
Taiwan from being marginalized  as countries in the Asia-Pacific region,
including China, Japan, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, are in the process of economic integration through the signing of free
trade agreements.</P>
      <P>So far, the ECFA proposal has not been put on the table for negotiation,
although the administration is expected to start cross-strait negotiations on
the issue by the end of this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chinese procurement mission places US$3.87 billion in orders</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Chinese procurement mission placed US$3.87 billion worth of orders with
Taiwanese companies Monday, part of China's attempt to help stimulate Taiwan's
battered economy.</P>
      <P>The biggest share of the orders were placed by China's biggest personal computer
maker Lenovo Group, which intends to buy US$3.255 billion worth of information
technology products from Taiwan, including notebooks and electronic items.</P>
      <P>A joint contract signing ceremony took place at the Taipei International
Convention Center, with Wang Chih-kang, chairman of the Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA) and Tang Wei, vice president of the Association of
Economy and Trade Across the Taiwan Straits (AETATS), in attendance.</P>
      <P>The group, which arrived in Taiwan Aug. 19, was the third AETATS-organized
procurement mission to Taiwan so far this year. It is composed of some 100
senior executives representating 47 Chinese business groups.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the three AETATS-organized missions have so far placed a
total of US$5.476 billion worth of orders with local suppliers.</P>
      <P>The AETATS, an affiliate of China's Ministry of Commerce, is tasked with
promoting commercial exchanges and economic cooperation with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The three groups are expected to place an additional US$3.144 billion worth of
orders with Taiwanese manufacturers in the coming year, bringing the total to
US$8.62 billion, which Wang said would exceed the original target without being
more specific.</P>
      <P>He denied that the total order value of the three buying missions had "shrunk,"
as has been speculated.</P>
      <P>In addition to Lenovo Group's purchase of information technology products, other
goods purchased by the third AETATS group also included machinery,  chemical
engineering  equipment,  garments, footwear and auto parts and components  in
line with China's "automobiles to the countryside" project that is part of its
economic stimulus package.</P>

unseen powers is felt -- sometimes above us, sometimes around us. Such is the
evidence of things invisible that it is impossible to doubt the spiritual nature
of man."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>Chiang Kai-shek's diaries to be published in Taiwan in 2010</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Shanghai, Aug. 28 (CNA)
08/28/09  15:05:31

    <TEXT>
      <P>The diaries of the late Republic of China President Chiang Kai-shek are expected
to be published, almost in their entirety, in Taiwan in 2010, a relative of the
Chiang family has revealed in a recent interview with a Chinese newspaper.</P>
      <P>Soong Tsao Li-hsuan, wife of a nephew of the late Madame Chiang Kai-shek, told
the Shanghai Morning Post Thursday that the diary collection comprises 55
volumes that cover a 55-year period from 1917 to 1972.</P>
      <P>The full content of the diaries will go to print, with the exception of a small
number of passages that the family has decided will remain private, Soong said.</P>
      <P>Soong, who has been helping to screen the diaries at Stanford University's
Hoover Institution, where the original copies are deposited, was in Shanghai to
attend a symposium held by Fudan University on the life of T.V. Soong, a brother
of Madame Chiang who served as finance minister and as foreign affairs minister
of the ROC.</P>
      <P>Soong said Chiang, who died in 1975, left his diaries to his son, the late ROC
President Chiang Ching-kuo, who in turn passed them to his third son Chiang
Hsiao-yung before his death in 1988.</P>
      <P>Chiang Hsiao-yung kept the diaries until his own death in 1996, after which his
widow, Elizabeth Chiang, took over the job of looking after them, she went on.</P>
      <P>In 2004, however, she decided to send the documents to the Hoover Institution
for preservation, Soong said.</P>
      <P>The diaries, which were written using a calligraphy pen, were in poor condition
when they arrived at the institution, with many pages stuck together, according
to Soong, who added that the institution spent around two years and
approximately US$3 million handling the papers.</P>
      <P>Copies of the originals, with some redacted passages, have been made available
at the Hoover Archives in various batches since 2006, attracting a large number
of scholars from different countries seeking to conduct research into their
contents.</P>
      <P>However, as readers are forbidden from making copies and can only take notes,
some of the scholars have made mistakes in reference to the diaries, causing
confusion of historical facts, Soong noted.</P>
      <P>In light of this situation, the Chiang family agreed to publish the diaries to
ensure a truthful presentation of history, she explained.</P>
      <P>According to Soong, some passages of the diaries were redacted mainly out of
privacy concerns and will also not appear in the published versions.</P>
      <P>The family, however, has authorized that the redacted passages can be published
in 2035, she said.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Friday:</P>
      <P>Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>Political parties on both sides of the strait, please be merciful</P>
      <P>The chiefs of local governments controlled by the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) extended an invitation to Tibet's spiritual leader the
Dalai Lama to visit Taiwan to console local flood victims, and President Ma
Ying-jeou approved, but with the string attached that the Dalai Lama should not
engage in any political activities while here.</P>
      <P>Ma deserves applause for his decision, as it demonstrates that humanitarianism
and mercy are beyond politics.</P>
      <P>Ma has disaffected voters by botching the relief operation after Typhoon Morakot
and would be sure to plunge into an abyss by denying the Dalai Lama's visit.</P>
      <P>Beijing has put Ma's administration in a hot spot by opposing the decision, and
the DPP is gleeful at the sale of its trick to alienate Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>We urge all political parties involved to put aside their political designs and
to be sympathetic with the flood victims.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Give the Dalai Lama freedom to act in Taiwan</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has approved a visit to Taiwan by Tibet's spiritual
leader the Dalai Lama but has limited him to engage in only humanitarian or
religious acts.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is a state with full sovereignty and Ma has no reason to attach any
strings to the Dalai Lama's visit.</P>
      <P>As a pacifist, the Dalai Lama should be given full freedom to act, and as leader
of the exiled Tibetan government, he should be allowed to promote whatever
political beliefs he fosters.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, if Ma wants to underline his capacity as head of state, he
should meet the Dalai Lama officially at his office rather than at religious
prayer gatherings or any other occasions.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Our opinion on Dalai Lama's visit -- Treasuring the thawing ties with China,
praying for the flood victims</P>
      <P>The chiefs of seven DPP-controlled counties and cities huddled the day before
yesterday over the handling of the aftermath of the Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>To our surprise, their resolution was to invite Tibetan spiritual leader the
Dalai Lama to visit Taiwan rather than finding ways to deal with the mudslides
and mountains of dirt left by the flooding.</P>
      <P>They should know that among the victims, the aboriginals are mainly Christian,
while the Taiwanese are mainly followers of Taoism, only a few of them are
Buddhists, and still fewer are followers of Tibetan Buddhism.</P>
      <P>Who will believe these local leaders' claims that their request is not political
maneuvering aimed to cause more trouble for President Ma Ying-jeou when he is
occupied with the task of reconstruction.</P>
      <P>We are surprised by the DPP's decision to kick up a political controversy at
this time.</P>
      <P>Everybody know this will damage the country's hard-earned closer ties with
China, and that Ma, with his popularity having dipped to a nadir at home, has
had to agree to the DPP chiefs' request to prevent voters from deserting him.</P>
      <P>Beijing has gone out of its way to help Taiwan ever since the disaster caused by
Typhoon Morakot, but its attempts have failed to draw a response as favorable as
that received by Taiwan when it went to the aid of Chinese victims after the
Sichuan earthquake in 2008.</P>
      <P>Now that Taiwan has requited Beijing's bona fide overtures with an invitation to
the Dalai Lama, Beijing's anger can be understood.</P>
      <P>So we have to urge China to refrain from a drastic response to the Taiwan's
decision, and we urge Ma's administration to go out of its way to mend fences
with China.</P>
      <P>We also urge the DPP and the ruling Kuomintang to play down the issue of whether
Ma should meet with the Dalai Lama during his visit.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Inappropriate time for Dalai Lama's visit</P>
      <P>Only a fool would buy the Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) claims that its
invitation to Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama to visit Taiwan has
nothing to do with politics.</P>
      <P>The country's pro-independence forces have always used the Tibetan leader as a
lever against China.</P>
      <P>When former President Lee Teng-hui invited the Dalai Lama to visit Taiwan to
show his contempt for Beijing, it was a clever political gambit.</P>
      <P>When former President Chen Shui-bian invited him to visit Taiwan, it was a poor
imitation.</P>
      <P>And when Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu followed their lead recently by inviting
the Dalai Lama, it was a dirty trick.</P>
      <P>Beijing showed its friendship toward Chen Chu by not blocking President Ma's
opening of the Kaohsiung World Games 2009.</P>
      <P>In rewarding Beijing by inviting the Dalai Lama to visit Taiwan, what does the
DPP expect to earn?  People's  respect?  Their appreciation? Or an understanding
of its evil intention to use the flood victims for its political gains?</P>
      <P>Ma should not have contradicted his own policy of a diplomatic truce with China
by approving the Dalai Lama's visit.</P>
      <P>If Beijing refuses to defer to Taipei's decision, Ma's efforts in the past year
to reconcile with China will all go down the drain.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Tibet each has its own issue to settle with China, and it is better
for the two to seek their own separate relations with China on their own. That
strategy will likely be in the best interest of both sides.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama has been unable to resolve the Tibet problem. Does the DPP really
want to use him as a lever in creating friction between Taiwan and China?</P>

    <HEADLINE>New U.S. envoy vows to boost bilateral ties</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.28  (CNA)
08/28/09  16:43:15

    <TEXT>
      <P>The new U.S. representative to Taiwan pledged Friday to continue the work of his
predecessors in further strengthening bilateral relations and supporting the
maintenance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>William A. Stanton, the new director of the Taipei office of the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT) , made the remarks at a news conference held upon his
arrival at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of the news conference, Stanton greeted the local public with a
"How Are You" in Mandarin Chinese and said he felt honored to return to Taiwan
to head the AIT Taipei office, which represents U.S. interests in the absence of
formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>"Although I last lived in Taiwan 22 years ago, I have many fond memories,
including the birth of my older daughter Kate who was therefore -- as I said in
Washington recently -- 'made in Taiwan, '" Stanton said.</P>
      <P>The new envoy lauded the enormous progress Taiwan has made in the past two
decades.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is of course an economic miracle. With virtually no natural resources
other than intelligence and hard work of its people, it is now the 26th largest
economy in the world," he said.</P>
      <P>The career diplomat also praised Taiwan's progress in democratic development.</P>
      <P>"Just after I left Taiwan, martial law was lifted, and now Taiwan is a vibrant
democracy built on the foundation of a civil society of the people of tawain and
NGOs. This is an impressive achievement that the people of Taiwan can all be
proud of," he added.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that the United States is proud of the support it has given Taiwan
in achieving those goals, Stanton said the success of U.S. policy toward Taiwan
has been built on the Taiwan Relations Act, which was enacted 30 years ago.</P>
      <P>"Our commitment to that policy is firm, and on that basis we will continue to
improve our relations," he promised.</P>
      <P>Noting  that  relations  between  America  and Taiwan  are fundamentally based
on shared values as well as common interests, Stanton said thiose values will
continue to guide the development of bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Stanton said that in the coming weeks and months, he will listen carefully to
the people of Taiwan on how the two countries may best continue to make
progress.</P>
      <P>"I also look forward to working with you, members of the Taiwan media, and plan
to hold a press conference after I have a chance to reacquaint myself with
Taiwan," he added.</P>
      <P>Stanton's most recent assignment was as deputy chief of the U.S. Embassy in
South Korea. He also had served as Charge d'Affaires ad interim and as deputy
chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Canberra, Australia. With his experience
of studying Chinese in Taipei between 1986 and 1987, he has a fair understanding
of Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The Dalai Lama hopes to console people in southern Taiwan who have suffered a
great deal during Typhoon Morakot, an official of the exiled Tibetan spiritual
leader's office said Friday.</P>
      <P>Tsegyam, secretary of the Dalai Lama Office who once served as Tibetan exile
government's representative to Taipei, made the remarks during a telephone
interview with the Central News Agency prior to his trip to Taiwan to arrange
the Dalai Lama's visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tsegyam stressed that the Dalai Lama's visit is based on the "responsibility and
obligation of a Buddhist leader."</P>
      <P>He said that when the Dalai Lama heard chiefs from the seven cities and counties
had invited him to visit Taiwan to comfort the flood-affected victims, his
immediate response was if his visit to Taiwan could help release the dead from
their suffering and comfort those who were affected by the typhoon-triggered
flooding, then he "felt he had the responsibility to go."</P>
      <P>Amid speculation that the Dalai Lama's visit could touch a raw nerve in China,
Tsegyam also said that the Dalai Lama would only go "if the visit will not cause
any troubles."</P>
      <P>The 75-year-old Dalai Lama only recently returned to his base in Dharamsala in
northwestern India after concluding a three-week visit and religious activities
in Ladakh in the northern part of that country.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama is expected to lead a nine-member team, including his three body
guards, to Taiwan Sunday afternoon for a week-long "humanitarian" visit.</P>
      <P>This will be his third trip to Taiwan, following his first visit in March 1997
and his second in March 2001,</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City officials said the Dalai Lama is expected to head for some of the
worst-hit disaster areas in southern Taiwan, including Siaolin village in
Kaohsiung County and Linbian Township in neighboring Pingtung County, Sept. 1
and Sept. 2.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Kuei-Shan Little League moved a step closer to a Little League World
Series crown Friday morning Taiwan time by taking advantage of some timely
chocolate snacks and three errors by the opponent to defeat Caribbean champion
Curacao 5-2.</P>
      <P>The win sent the Taoyuan  County team,  representing  the Asia-Pacific region,
into the tournament's International Championship Game against the Mexican
representative from Reynosa on Saturday at midnight Taiwan time.</P>
      <P>The winner will move on to vie for the World Series crown against the American
champion.</P>
      <P>Kuei-Shan Little League is hoping to become the first Taiwanese team to capture
a World Series crown since 1996. Local teams once dominated the annual
tournament, taking 17 titles between 1969 and 1996, but no team representing
Taiwan has even made it to the World Series championship game since then.</P>
      <P>Though defeating the unbeaten Caribbean champion was not easy, overcoming a
strong Mexican pitching staff that has given up only three runs in four
consecutive victories, including a 6-0 whitewash of Japan a day earlier, will be
even more challenging.</P>
      <P>The Mexicans beat Kuei-Shan 3-2 in a Pool D game earlier in the tourney, and the
Taiwanese team will likely again face starter Marcelo Martinez, who no-hit the
Asia-Pacific champion over 4 2/3 innings and struck out 12 in that game.</P>
      <P>Against Curacao, however, Taiwan showed it could figure out a tough pitcher.</P>
      <P>Curacao starter Claycandy Hariquez kept Kuei-Shan's hitters off balance with
fastballs of up to 74 miles per hour (the equivalent of a 97-mph fastball at the
Major League level) and 50-mph change-ups, allowing only two hits and striking
out seven over the first three innings of the regulation six-inning game.</P>
      <P>But then Taiwan manager Lee Cheng-ta said he told his team to concentrate on
hitting fastballs and lay off Hariquez's off-speed stuff.</P>
      <P>The strategy paid off in the fourth inning, as two singles sandwiched around a
hit batsman scored a run, and catcher Kao Yu-chieh added to the tally by scoring
on an errant throw after his RBI single.</P>
      <P>Taiwan added a run in the fifth, when Lin Hung-yuan reached on an error, went to
second on a wild pitch and scored on a base hit by Sung Wen-hua. The team then
knocked out Hariquez in the sixth with a solo home run by Cheng Tang-fu and an
RBI single by Lin.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kuei-Shan starter Ou Chin baffled his Caribbean opponents with an
excellent curve ball, and pitched a no-hitter over the first five innings.</P>
      <P>The key, Lee said, was M&amp;M chocolates, which coaches fed to Ou whenever he
appeared to tire or get nervous. As Ou mowed down opposing batters, his
teammates started to think the chocolates were lucky and had some themselves.</P>
      <P>With Kuei-shan ahead 5-0 in the bottom of the sixth and final inning, the
chocolates lost their potency, and Ou was roughed up for two runs, but Sung came
on in relief to strike out Richendly Bicentini to clinch the victory.</P>
      <P>Lee expects to start Sung against Mexico. The pitcher has appeared in all four
of Taiwan's games, never throwing more than an inning.</P>
      <P>In his three innings on the mound at Williamsport, Pennsylvania, where the World
Series is being held, he has struck out seven and allowed only one hit.</P>
      <P>With Mexico eliminating  the Japanese  champion and Taiwan eliminating Curacao,
it will be the first time since 1996 that the International final will not
feature a team from either Japan or the Caribbean.</P>
      <P>Kuei-Shan is now hoping to set another first since 1996 and become the first
Taiwanese Little League World Series champion in 18 years.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) denied Friday there was any
political plot behind the move by some of the party's politicians to invite the
exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen stressed that the Dalai Lama will come to Taiwan to
console and pray for the victims of Typhoon Morakot and she urged critics not to
overstate the visit's political implications.</P>
      <P>Tsai said with the Dalai Lama's prestige around the world, his visit will help
cast global attention on Taiwan's post-disaster reconstruction needs.</P>
      <P>"It's exciting that the Dalai Lama will take part in such an important process,"
Tsai said.</P>
      <P>By accusing the DPP of political maneuvering, it is the critics who are
politicizing the matter rather than the DPP, Tsai contended.</P>
      <P>She said if the Dalai Lama has the desire to meet with Taiwan's opposition
leaders, she will be very happy to meet him.</P>
      <P>The invitation to the exiled Tibetan leader to visit Taiwan was issued by the
chiefs of seven DPP-controlled localities in southern Taiwan that were hit hard
by the storm.</P>
      <P>The visit is tentatively scheduled for Aug. 30 to Sept. 4.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, who had turned down a proposal by the Dalai Lama to
visit in 2008 out of concern that it could hurt Taiwan's warming ties with
China, announced Thursday that the Tibetan leader will be allowed to come for
religious activities related to the typhoon's aftermath.</P>
      <P>Chang  Jung-kung,  deputy  secretary-general  of the ruling Kuomintang,  accused
the pro-independence  DPP later Friday of attempting to use the Dalai Lama to
create domestic political conflict and cross-Taiwan Strait tensions.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, by making public the Dalai Lama's planned visit before he
officially filed an application with Taiwan, the DPP was "launching a surprise
political attack" at a time when the country was busy dealing with the disaster
aftermath.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-liang, a senior DPP legislator, called on both the KMT and Beijing
Friday to take the Dalai Lama's visit in stride.</P>
      <P>Tsai suggested that President Ma arrange a meeting with the Tibetan leader to
demonstrate to the world that Taiwan is a country practicing democracy, human
rights and humanitarianism.</P>
      <P>"As a sovereign country, Taiwan can decide on its own who to invite to visit. It
is none of the business of other countries," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Also, Tsai said, the government should not restrict the Dalai Lama's activities
and speeches in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The American International Group (AIG) closed the bid for its Taiwanese unit,
the Nan Shan Life Insurance Co., on Friday. However, the financially-hit US
insurance giant declined to reveal information about the bidders or give a
timetable as to when it would decide on a buyer.</P>
      <P>According to industry sources, Primus Financial Holdings Limited, a Hong Kong-
based financial services company, was one of the parties that made a bid for Nan
Shan. Other parties that are known to have been highly interested in bidding for
the Taiwanese arm of AIG are the Fubon Financial Holding Company, Cathay
Financial Holding Company and Chinatrust Financial Holding Company, all of which
are based in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Established in July 1963, Nan Shan currently has 10 percent to 12 percent of
Taiwan's insurance market, and is one of the biggest insurance companies here.</P>
      <P>Statistics released by Nan Shan recently indicate that as of May 2009, the
company's total assets amounted to NT$1.5 trillion. Total policies in force
reached 7.94 million, with 4 million policy holders.</P>
      <P>Since the New York based AIG was hit by a financial crisis last October, there
has been considerable speculation about Nan Shan's fate. However, AIG only
announced in early August that it would sell 97.57 percent of its Taiwanese
unit's shares.</P>
      <P>Since AIG announced the sale, the company workers' union has been trying to
negotiate with the management regarding the job security of the nearly 40,000
employees at Nan Shan and the handling of the company's NT$14 billion pension
fund.</P>
      <P>Nan Shan requires employees who have worked for the company for over seven years
to contribute 2 percent of their salaries to the pension fund.</P>
      <P>Unsatisfied with the company's decision to return only 27 percent of the pension
fund's assets to the contributors, some 400 employees brought a suit against the
company at the Taipei District Court Friday, demanding a full refund.</P>
      <P>The dispute over the pension fund may pose difficulties to AIG in selling Nan
Shan, said an industry source.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Web site was created Friday by an alliance of public interest groups to ensure
transparency of the use of donations for relief and reconstruction in the
aftermath of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>"We hope all government and private fundraising units can join us so that every
penny donated can be used to its fullest through self-discipline and public
supervision, " said Cheng Hsin-chen, president of the Taiwan NPO Self-Regulation
Alliance.</P>
      <P>The alliance joined forces with the Consumers Foundation and lawyer and
accountant associations in creating and operating the Web site
"88.npoalliance.org.tw," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the new Web site will serve as a platform for public scrutiny of the
disposal or use of all donations, Cheng said more than 10 member groups of the
alliance that have launched fundraising drives to help those affected by the
storm have agreed to post all relevant information on the Web site.</P>
      <P>The groups include the United Way Taiwan, the Red Cross Society, the Eden Social
Welfare Foundation,  the Child Welfare League Foundation, the Red Heart
Association, the Children Are Us Foundation and the Chinese Christian Relief
Association.</P>
      <P>Cheng said he hopes non-alliance member organizations, such as World Vision
Taiwan,  the Buddhist Compassion  Relief Tzu Chi Foundation -- Taiwan's largest
charity -- and all government agencies that have opened bank accounts to receive
donations will also post information related to Morakot donations on the site.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics released by the Ministry of the Interior, Cheng said 21 local
and central government units and 43 private groups have registered with the
ministry to raise funds for post-disaster relief projects.</P>
      <P>"We will write letters to all those organizations to join the new platform or at
least publish relevant information in line with the principle of self-
discipline," he said.</P>
      <P>As government agencies tend to open accounts to receive public donations  before
even deciding  what post-disaster  relief or rehabilitation  programs will be
launched,  Cheng said the 21 government units should be subject to stringent
supervision.</P>
      <P>Feng Yen, an adviser to the alliance,  said that because Morakot-related
donations have totaled an estimated NT$10 billion (US$303 million) , public
supervision is very important to prevent abuses of the money.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Program to nurture indigenous students to kick off in Pingtung</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education and National Tsing Hua University jointly announced on
Friday a program to nurture indigenous students so that they can one day return
to their communities to help restore them.</P>
      <P>The program will be held at National Pinbei Senior High School in Pingtung in
southern Taiwan, one of the counties hardest hit during Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>National Tsing Hua University professors broached the idea to the Ministry of
Education after participating in flood relief efforts. Flood relief is a short-
term job, they said, but only through education and the cultivation of talent
can long-term problems be solved.</P>
      <P>The faculty of the university's Tsing Hua College, a new educational concept
launched last year, formed a disaster relief team Aug. 10 after Typhoon Morakot
pummeled southern Taiwan and triggered the most serious flooding and mudslides
in half a century.</P>
      <P>They mobilized around 350 college students to help with flood relief efforts in
the coastal towns of Jiadong and Linbian in Pingtung between Aug. 13-25,
becoming the first college students to enter the affected areas.</P>
      <P>The pilot program was supported by Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, who attended a
seminar on the school's education policy for indigenous students.</P>
      <P>Liu said he was glad to have Tsing Hua professors forming the backbone of the
project and said it will be "the beginning of better education, which will allow
the integration of the ecological concepts of aboriginal peoples and mainstream
education."</P>
      <P>The premier said he hoped the program will be expanded to the whole island and
lure more indigenous peoples to return to their community so as to "increase
their employment opportunities and let them become the guardians of nature."</P>
      <P>The premier  also announced  that indigenous  students  in flood-affected senior
high and vocational schools and colleges will not have to pay tuition or
miscellaneous fees this year.</P>
      <P>Starting next year, the tuition and miscellaneous fees of indigenous students in
senior high and vocational schools will be exempted. The measure is expected to
benefit 18,000 aboriginal students and cost the government about NT$620 million
(US$18.78 million).</P>
      <P>Under Tsing Hua's pilot program, Pinbei Senior High School will recruit  two
additional  classes of indigenous  students  from flood-affected areas starting
September 2010 with 30 students in each class.</P>
      <P>Tsing Hua university professors and leading figures from various sectors will
deliver lectures to broaden the students' horizons.</P>
      <P>In addition to their regular high school classes, they will also take courses on
ecology.  Students will also return to their communities for service during
winter and summer vacations, as well as receive psychological counseling in the
wake of the flooding.</P>
      <P>Professor Juju Chin-shou Wang, the CEO of Tsing Hua College and one of the
architects of the program, noted that mainstream society has not made good use
of the ecological wisdom of indigenous peoples.</P>
      <P>"If it had, then the disasters of the land could have possibly been avoided,  "
Wang said.  "The protagonists  of ecological conservation will be indigenous
peoples."</P>
      <P>Their ecological wisdom will be taught in the program, so that the students will
return to their communities for "restoration" instead of "reconstruction,"
according to Wang.</P>
      <P>The program in the Pingtung high school will be patterned after that at Tsing
Hua College, where students from different departments are selected based on
their passion for the future.</P>
      <P>They live together in the school dormitory to learn the values of tolerance and
appreciation, and program insists that students first learn human values and
then civic values, before focusing on gaining knowledge in a particular field.</P>
      <P>Also, additional lectures will be given at night after regular classes and
during the summer and winter vacations.</P>

      <P>Opposition party leaders said Friday that the rejection of a petition to hold a
referendum on the signing of an economic  cooperation  framework  agreement
with China is not acceptable, and they vowed to use all possible measures to
reverse the decision.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , and Huang
Kun-huei, chairman of the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , contended in a press

      <P>They said they will try all possible  options,  including administrative
petitions,  administrative  litigation  or  a constitutional interpretation, to
reverse the committee's decision.</P>
      <P>Accusing the committee of either being much too conservative or having
preconceptions while screening the referendum proposal, Tsai said it is only
fair to hold a referendum allowing people to decide the issue since they will be
affected when such an agreement is signed.</P>
      <P>The DPP proposed to have the nation's voters answer the question: "Do you agree
that the government should hold a referendum to allow the people to decide on
the signing of a Taiwan-China economic cooperation framework agreement?"</P>
      <P>A majority 13 members of the committee on Thursday voted to reject the proposal
on the grounds that it is based on a hypothetical situation that does not meet
criteria for referendum questions stipulated in the Referendum Law.</P>
      <P>Four other members of the committee voted in favor and two members abstained.</P>
      <P>Tsai contended that the existing referendum mechanism failed to serve its
purpose and pledged to apply all check and balance measures to ensure that the
welfare of the people will not be violated in the the process of realizing such
an agreement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Less than 10% aware of swine flu transmission modes: survey</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Less than 10 percent of respondents to a recent survey are fully aware how swine
flu, officially known as influenza A(H1N1), spreadescan occur, according to the
results of the survey released Friday.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey, conducted by Common Health Magazine July 9-11, found that
only 6.84 percent of those interviewed correctly identified the two ways through
which the H1N1 virus can be transmitted -- through contact with infected pigs or
environments contaminated with the swine flu virus and through contact with a
person with H1N1.</P>
      <P>In human-to-human transmission, the virus is spread by breathing in infectious
droplets from the coughing or sneezing of infected people rather than through
airborne transmission.</P>
      <P>The survey collected 1,112 valid samples, with a 95 percent confidence level and
a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percent.</P>
      <P>Up to 32.81 percent mistakenly thought that the H1N1 virus could be spread
through airborne transmission as well as through coughing or sneezing of
infected people.</P>
      <P>Another 20 percent erroneously thought that the virus could be transmitted
through airborne transmission, contact with infected people and coughing or
sneezing of infected people.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that only one-third of the respondents would stay at home
if they came down with the swine flu, while the remaining respondents said they
would still go to school or to the office.</P>
      <P>Men are more likely than women to continue their work schedule if they contract
the disease and the higher the education level, the more likely the respondents
were to go to school or to work, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>It also found that 90 percent of the respondents would go to see doctor if they
contracted the H1N1 virus.</P>
      <P>If their children come down with the virus, 60 percent of the respondents said
they would not let them go to school, but 20 percent said it would depend on the
actual situation.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at which the survey results were unveiled, Chen
Chien-jen, a former Department of Health (DOH) minister who is also an Academia
Sinica academinician, said the ratio of people with correct knowledge about the
swine flu was lower than he had expected.</P>
      <P>"This trend is worrisome because wrong perceptions of the disease could lead to
public health risks, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>He urged the government to step up publicity to provide members of the public
correct information about the swine flu to facilitate prevention of the disease.</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang, who also attended the news conference, said those
who develop flu-like symptoms, such as a fever, sore throat, runny nose, body
aches and headaches, should go to see a doctor immediately and should stay at
home to avoid transmitting the virus to others.</P>
      <P>Yaung also reminded swine flu patients to take the anti-viral drug Tamiflu in
accordance with their attending doctors' instructions to avoid developing a
resistance to the medication.</P>
      <P>He further said that hoarding Tamiflu and facial masks is meaningless.</P>
      <P>Yaung said the DOH will formulate guidelines for physicians at private clinics
to follow in prescribing Tamiflu.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ho Mei-hsiang, R&amp;D chief at Adimmune Corp. -- Taiwan's only human
vaccine manufacturer who is producing swine flu vaccines for domestic use --
said about 3,000 people die from seasonal flu and that the mortality of swine
flu is expected to be higher.</P>
      <P>According to Ho, seasonal flu mainly affects elderly people while swine flu
tends to infect young people, particularly those with underlying chronic
diseases.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou is not expected to meet with the Dalai Lama, the
spiritual leader of Tibet, during his stay in Taiwan, the Presidential Office
spokesman said Friday.</P>
      <P>The exiled Tibetan leader, who was invited by local chiefs from flood-affected
areas in southern Taiwan, is scheduled to arrive in Taiwan Sunday for a six-day
visit before leaving Sept. 4.</P>
      <P>During his visit, the Dalai Lama is expected to preside over a series of dharma
services to console people who suffered from Typhoon Morakot, which devastated
southern Taiwan with the most serious flooding and mudslides in half a century.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Ma will attend one of the services, Presidential Office spokesman
Wang Yu-chi said that, "our understanding is that the president has only planned
to attend a national mourning ceremony Sept. 7 for those killed during the
storm.</P>
      <P>"There are no plans for other activities," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wang also dismissed the possibility of the president meeting the Dalai Lama in
private.</P>
      <P>"That probably won't happen, " Wang said. "As far as we know, the Dalai Lama is
here for activities  related to religious  and humanitarian aspects."</P>
      <P>Some believe the Ma administration's approval of the Dalai Lama's visit could
damage Taiwan's warming relations with Beijing, and a meeting between Ma and the

      <P>Estimates of agricultural losses from Typhoon Morakot rose to NT$16.4 billion

    <TEXT>
      <P>Three financial holding companies in Taiwan and the Hong Kong-based Primus
Financial Holdings Limited submitted bids for the American International Group's
(AIG) Taiwanese unit, the Nan Shan Life Insurance Co., before the closing of the
bid Friday.</P>
      <P>According to industry sources, among the four bidders, Primus Financial Holdings
Ltd. and Chinatrust Financial Holding Company are most keen to acquire Nan Shan
Life, and may bid between US$1.5 billion and US$$2 billion, while the Fubon
Financial Holding Co. and Cathay Financial Holding Co.'s offers are estimated at
between US$1 billion and US$1.5 billion.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month there were speculations that Chinatrust might not submit a
bid, but the company has since demonstrated its ambition to expand its insurance
business, announcing that it will sell 2.5 billion new shares to fund its
expansion.</P>
      <P>An analysis by Deutsche Securities suggests that a merger of Chinatrust and Nan
Shan would have the least impact on the Taiwan insurance market, while
acquisition of Nan Shan by either Cathay Financial or Fubon Financial would mean
the emergence of a dominant power in the market.</P>
      <P>Cathay Financial is Taiwan's largest life insurance company in terms of market
share, but Fubon Financial can overtake Cathay if Fubon succeeds in acquiring
Nan Shan, analysts have said. Fubon is a major player in the life insurance
market with 10 percent to 12 percent of the market share, the analysts have
noted.</P>
      <P>Established in July 1963, Nan Shan is one of the biggest insurance companies in
Taiwan. Statistics released by Nan Shan recently indicate that as of the end of
June, the company's total assets exceeded NT$1.5 trillion. The total number of
policies in force were 7.97 million, with 4 million policy holders.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei hopes to impress with 2010 Taipei International Flora Expo</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/29/09  13:30:45</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA Staff Writer</P>
      <P>Taipei, Aug. 29 (CNA) The venue of the 2010 Taipei International Gardening and
Horticulture Expo will reflect the diversity of the host city, stretching from
the scenic Yuanshan hill and Xinsheng Park along the Keelung River to the
commercially active Neihu hi-tech park and Zhongshan North Rd.</P>
      <P>But the Taipei City government is not simply counting on the exposition's
setting to draw visitors.</P>
      <P>From Nov. 6, 2010 to April 25, 2011, the modern city hopes to impress the world
with colorful touches that showcase Taiwan's bountiful flora, gardening
creativity, and unique fusion of horticulture and technology.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsiung-wen, commissioner of the city's Department of Economic Development,
said the 91.8 hectare expo site is divided into four areas, with 14 exhibition
pavilions featuring Taiwan's flora and landscape, gardening and horticulture,
and stages for artistic programs.</P>
      <P>With the recognition and support of the international community, Taipei won the
right to host the event at the spring meeting of the International Association
of Horticultural Producers (AIPH) in April 2006, three years after the Taiwan
Floriculture Development Association was admitted as a member.</P>
      <P>The Netherlands-headquartered organization represents flower and plant growers
and landscape service providers around the world.</P>
      <P>Since 1960, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, and France have each hosted flora
expos more than once, and the Asian cities of Osaka, Japan, Kunming, China, and
Chiang Mai, Thailand, have held the event since 1990.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the 1990 International Gardens and Greenery Exposition in Osaka,
Japan was an acclaimed success, and Taipei hopes its presentation next year will
win similar recognition among flower admirers.</P>
      <P>Since creativity and technology have helped Taiwan's horticulture sector achieve
breakthroughs, Chen said that he believed the flora industry in Taiwan can make
impressive presentation.</P>
      <P>As the leading planner of the first internationally accredited exposition in
Taiwan, Chen has attended AIPH meetings in Europe and Asia over the past few
years to learn from the experiences of other countries and find sources of
inspiration to make the expo a success.</P>
      <P>Construction of the exhibition halls and neighborhood beautification projects
began early this year, and the city government has cooperated with Taiwan's
floraculture producers to arrange the most attractive presentation of Taiwan's
flowers, plants, and horticulture research and development.</P>
      <P>One of the designers' strategies will be to cover the expo's grounds with more
than 40 million of Taiwan's indigenous flowers, plants and trees.</P>
      <P>Chen said that by hosting the exposition, Taipei City is trying to build its
image as a garden city with an emphasis on a balanced ecosystem, but he also
indicated it could have a strong stimulative effect on a number of sectors.</P>
      <P>The NT$3.53 billion investment in the exposition, for instance, is expected to
help Taiwan's horticulture sector boost its production value by 23 percent,
according to a Council of Agriculture estimate.</P>
      <P>The tourism sector is also expected to benefit, as the exposition could draw 6
million visitors from home and abroad and sell NT$2.6 billion in tickets.</P>
      <P>Chen also estimated that the show will inject an additional NT$8.8 billion into
the local economy indirectly during its six-month run, as tourists spend money
on local accommodation, food, and other purchases.</P>

      <P>The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)
has given a positive evaluation of Taiwan's response operations in the aftermath
of Typhoon Morakot, after OCHA sent a mission to Taiwan to assess the country's
humanitarian needs.</P>
      <P>The OCHA disaster assessment and coordination mission, which was in Taiwan Aug.
24-28, reported that there is "a large and seemingly well coordinated capacity
of government as well as civilian actors on the ground."</P>
      <P>The team visited the seven most severely affected villages in Kaohsiung County
and also the southern coastal areas of Pingtung County where a massive clean-up
operation involving 13,000 people was in progress, the report stated.</P>
      <P>Another  disaster  relief team dispatched  by the Japanese International
Cooperation Agency during the same period has not come across any serious health
problems in the shelters, according to the OCHA report.</P>
      <P>The Japanese team focused its support on displaced individuals housed in
temporary shelters in Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the United States Pacific Command has concluded its humanitarian
operations in Taiwan, with cargo planes and helicopters conducting a total of 55
missions to deliver relief supplies and 20 pieces of excavation equipment to
affected areas, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Japan continues to provide relief supplies to Kaohsiung County, while 600 of the
1,000 pre-fabricated houses donated by China have reached Taiwan, it said.</P>
      <P>"The international community continues to express concern and send donations to
assist authorities in Taipei to conduct residual relief and reconstruction
activities," the report stated.</P>
      <P>To date, 77 countries, the European Union and 20 international organizations
have donated funds to Taiwan worth a total of NT$137 million (US$4.2 million),
the report said.</P>
      <P>Official figures released by Taiwan authorities show that as of Aug. 26, the
disaster caused by Typhoon Morakot had left 461 people dead and 254 others
missing, with 769,159 households directly affected and 6,000 displaced
individuals  housed in temporary shelters.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou expressed confidence Saturday that the current outbreak
of influenza A(H1N1) in Taiwan will be brought under control with the measures
being taken by health authorities.</P>
      <P>Addressing the issue in the latest issue of his weekly online video journal, Ma
said greater public awareness of the new flu strain is needed but people should
not panic over the situation.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the epidemic prevention measures adopted by Taiwan since April
are not inferior to those of other countries, and thanks to efforts made by the
Central Epidemics Command Center (CECC), an H1N1 epidemic was delayed by more
than one month.</P>
      <P>On his decision not to activate the national security mechanism for the time
being to deal with the situation, Ma explained that he reached the decision
after reading three different opinions by various segments of analysts in the
country.</P>
      <P>Those who support activating the national security mechanism immediately believe
that it will facilitate widespread use of medication by the authorities to
control the epidemic before a vaccine against the virus becomes available in mid
November, Ma noted.</P>
      <P>However, some are concerned that activating the national security mechanism too
early can cause unnecessary public panic, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, there are others who think the National Security Council should set
up a task force that would maintain close contact with the CECC in preparation
for national mobilization at an appropriate time, according to Ma.</P>
      <P>Likening epidemic prevention and control to a battle, the president stressed
that it involves a "very crucial decision" as to when to issue a command to
"open fire."</P>
      <P>"This must be handled properly. Too much is as bad as not enough," he said.</P>

      <P>A project to reconstruct a Taipei City building that was toppled in the 921
earthquake was completed Saturday, weeks ahead of the 10th anniversary of the
disaster.</P>
      <P>Former residents of the Tunghsing Building gathered in the lobby of the
reconstructed complex for a cocktail party Saturday, in anticipation of their
return to the homes.</P>
      <P>However, the residents will have to wait another three months before they can
move in, as the related paperwork is still being processed.</P>
      <P>Lin Chung-huan, director of the Urban Redevelopment Office under the Taipei City
government, said despite the many twists and turns in the reconstruction
process, the city took many steps to facilitate the project.</P>
      <P>The 12-story Tunghsing Building crumpled when a 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck
central Taiwan on Sept. 21, 1999. Some 87 residents of the building were killed
when it collapsed. It was the only building in Taipei City that was completely
destroyed by the earthquake, which was centered about 200 kilometers away from
the city.</P>
      <P>The reconstruction project, which did not start until 2004, was suspended in
October 2006 as a result of a financial crisis faced by the contractor.</P>
      <P>The project was taken over in August 2008 by another contractor, but it came to
standstill again two months later because of a similar problem.</P>
      <P>The building was completed by a third contractor that took over the project in
December 2008.</P>

      <P>Local companies will be allowed to keep any driftwood that they clear from
specified areas in the wake of Typhoon Morakot, the Council of Agriculture's
Forestry Bureau said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Driftwood  that is clogging  rivers and fishing ports and cluttering farmland
will be free of charge to those companies that clear it, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan law, unauthorized removal of driftwood from state property is not
permitted. However, the immense volume of rainfall brought by the typhoon
Aug-7-9 caused flooding and landslides that left some 400,000 tons of driftwood
in areas of central and southern Taiwan, according to Forestry Bureau
statistics.</P>
      <P>Farmers and fishermen in the affected areas have been complaining about clogged
fishing ports, irrigation channels and cluttered farmlands, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>With the help of local governments, the bureau said, it has so far managed to
clear only about of fourth of the driftwood, even though it has mobilized 1,593
people from its local offices and 709 pieces of heavy-duty machinery and
vehicles.</P>
      <P>The bureau is therefore inviting private enterprises to clear the driftwood and
is offering them the incentive of keeping whatever amount they move.</P>
      <P>The companies are required to apply for permission to clear as much driftwood as
they want from the specified areas, the bureau said, adding that the wood may
used as fuel or compost, or for art and craft or paper pulp.</P>

      <P>The government will evaluate the demand among Typhoon Morakot victims for
temporary pre-fabricated houses before erecting such structures,  Premier Liu
Chao-shiuan said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks during a visit to a military barracks in Kaohsiung County
where some of the victims are being sheltered. He was responding to reports that
the government had decided to halt the pre-fabricated housing project.</P>
      <P>Liu explained that the government is committed to providing permanent housing
for people dislocated or rendered homeless by the storm.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstance, unless there is a demand among the storm victims for
temporary housing, the government will avoid wasting resources by building too
many pre-fabricated houses, he said.</P>
      <P>Expressing his support for the central government's position on the issue,
Kaohsiung magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing said many people find it hard to adjust to
the conditions in pre-fabricated houses and prefer to remain temporarily in
military barracks, which offer a better living environment.</P>
      <P>Another option is for the victims to rent homes and claim rental allowances from
the government, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Also during the trip, Liu told residents at the shelter that the Government
Information Office will publish a weekly "reconstruction newsletter" that will
be circulated among the typhoon victims starting Sept. 1 to allow them to keep
track of the progress of the government's reconstruction efforts.</P>

      <P>Although the number of crime victims in Taiwan appears to be dropping, an
increasing number of people are not satisfied with the government's performance
in maintaining social order, according to the results of a survey released
Saturday.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the Crime Research Center of National Chung Cheng
University in Chaiyi, found that 76 percent of the Taiwan public was
dissatisfied with the government's efforts in the first half of the year to
improve social order.</P>
      <P>This was an increase of 5.3 percentage points compared with the results of a
similar survey in 2008, said Yang Shi-lung, director of the center, at press
conference Saturday.</P>
      <P>In addition, public satisfaction with the police's ability to maintain social
order also dropped in this year's poll to 39.5 percent compared with 47 percent
last year, he said.</P>
      <P>This suggests that the government is losing the people's trust, he added.</P>
      <P>However, the survey also found that the percentage of fraud crime victims fell
from 7.7 percent to 4.1 percent, theft crime victims from 16 percent to 11
percent, and violent crime victims from 5 percent to 3 percent.</P>
      <P>On the question of public safety, 57.6 percent of the respondents said they were
worried that they or their family members would become victims of crime, and
nearly 40 percent said they did not feel safe going out at night.</P>
      <P>These two figures were close to the results of the 2008 poll, Yang said.</P>
      <P>When asked about the death penalty,  42.2 percent of the respondents said they
were firmly opposed to the idea of its abolition, while 5.5 percent said it
should be dropped from the law books. However, 50 percent said they would
support the abolition of capital punishment if substitute measures are
introduced.</P>
      <P>Again, these results were close to those in the 2008 survey, Yang said.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted islandwide by telephone July 1-7 on residents age 20 or
above. A total of 2004 valid samples were collected, and the poll had a margin
of error of plus or minus 2.19 percent.</P>

      <P>If possible, she will accompany the Dalai Lama on his trip to Kaohsiung City by

      <P>According to the Kaohsiung City government, the Dalai Lama's public activities

      <P>Wang Jianzhou, chairman of the world's largest mobile carrier China Mobile Ltd.,
concluded a weeklong visit in Taiwan Saturday that spurred telecommunications
service providers and hi-tech firms to join hands to explore China's third
generation mobile business.</P>
      <P>China Mobile already has 500 million customers and is undertaking the
infrastructure development of the 3G system TD-SCDMA that is being promoted by
the Chinese authorities.</P>
      <P>During his meetings with executives of Taiwan's information and communications
companies, Wang disclosed that investments in TD-SCDMA infrastructure could
reach 400 billion yuan (US$52 billion).</P>
      <P>The construction cost of base stations alone is estimated at 120 billion yuan,
and expenses to purchase terminal facilities and other equipment will be even
higher, he said.</P>
      <P>This explained why executives of Taiwan's 3G devices suppliers were very eager
to meet Wang, although he made it clear that he had no plans to make any
purchases at this time.</P>
      <P>A research report by China Mobile indicates that China expects the number of its
users of 3G devices to reach 85 million by 2011, and a pivotal element to that
goal is device suppliers.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan's information industry -- from upstream IC designers and
manufactures to downstream production of handsets, netbooks and e-readers -- can
offer a streamlined supply chain, one of Wang's top missions during his visit
was to look for partners who can help China Mobile secure its supply chain,
local industry sources suggested.</P>
      <P>In addition to visiting the Hsinchu-based Industrial Technology Research
Institute, Wang has signed a memorandum of understanding with Taiwan's handset
maker HTC Corp. to jointly develop smartphones and has met with executives of
other leading hi-tech firms to explore possibilities for strategic alliances.</P>
      <P>Before his departure, Wang told Taiwan's media he is convinced that the
expansion of the telecommunications market on the Chinese mainland can offer
opportunities to business and industry on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

the past 24 hours an additional 11 hospitalized A(H1N1) flu cases were reported,
bringing the total of severe cases to 65.</P>
      <P>Steve Kuo, director-general of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), said more
A(H1N1) patients were hospitalized probably because the public health system has
become more cautious in its epidemic prevention and protection measures.</P>
      <P>While a further increase in the number of hospitalized cases can be expected, no
fatalities have been reported in the past two days, he added.</P>
      <P>With a new school semester about to begin in early September, Kuo urged schools
and parents take precautionary measures, such as checking the temperatures of
school children, to ensure that no infected students will be at school.</P>
      <P>To prevent cluster infections in schools, public health and education
authorities have ruled that any class with two identified infections within a
period of three days should be suspended for five days.</P>
      <P>This 3-2-5 prevention system applies to all kindergartens, elementary and
secondary schools.</P>

      <P>The Dalai Lama will arrive in Taiwan Aug. 30 and will begin his visit the next
day to areas of the country devastated by Typhoon Morakot, the Kaohsiung City
government said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu said that she will be at the Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport to welcome the Tibetan spiritual leader on behalf of her
city.</P>
      <P>If possible, she will accompany the Dalai Lama on his trip to Kaohsiung City by
high-speed rail, she added.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama was invited by local government chiefs in southern Taiwan to
comfort and pray for the typhoon victims in areas that were hardest hit by the
storm Aug.7-9.</P>
      <P>According to the Kaohsiung City government, the Dalai Lama's public activities
will be scheduled between Aug. 31 and Sept. 2. He will first hold a news
conference Aug. 31 before setting off that same day for the typhoon-affected
areas, the city government said.</P>
      <P>On Sept. 1, the exiled Tibetan Buddhist leader will deliver a speech and preside
over a prayer ceremony at Kaohsiung Arena for typhoon victims. He will meet with
Cardinal Shan Kuo-hsi of the Roman Catholic Church the following day at a hotel
in the city.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama first visited Taiwan in 1997 and again in 2001.</P>
      <P>When Typhoon Morakot struck earlier this month, it brought torrential rains
which triggered the worst flooding in the country in 50 years, devastating much
of southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As of Saturday, confirmed fatalities from the disaster had reached 571, with 106
others reported missing and 33 injured, according to the Central Emergency
Operation Center.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Visit by China Mobile chief spurs interest among 3G suppliers</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Wang Jianzhou, chairman of the world's largest mobile carrier China Mobile Ltd.,
concluded a weeklong visit in Taiwan Saturday that spurred telecommunications
service providers and hi-tech firms to join hands to explore China's third
generation mobile business.</P>
      <P>China Mobile already has 500 million customers and is undertaking the
infrastructure development of the 3G system TD-SCDMA that is being promoted by
the Chinese authorities.</P>
      <P>During his meetings with executives of Taiwan's information and communications
companies, Wang disclosed that investments in TD-SCDMA infrastructure could
reach 400 billion yuan (US$52 billion).</P>
      <P>The construction cost of base stations alone is estimated at 120 billion yuan,
and expenses to purchase terminal facilities and other equipment will be even
higher, he said.</P>
      <P>This explained why executives of Taiwan's 3G devices suppliers were very eager
to meet Wang, although he made it clear that he had no plans to make any
purchases at this time.</P>
      <P>A research report by China Mobile indicates that China expects the number of its
users of 3G devices to reach 85 million by 2011, and a pivotal element to that
goal is device suppliers.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan's information industry -- from upstream IC designers and
manufactures to downstream production of handsets, netbooks and e-readers -- can
offer a streamlined supply chain, one of Wang's top missions during his visit
was to look for partners who can help China Mobile secure its supply chain,
local industry sources suggested.</P>
      <P>In addition to visiting the Hsinchu-based Industrial Technology Research
Institute, Wang has signed a memorandum of understanding with Taiwan's handset
maker HTC Corp. to jointly develop smartphones and has met with executives of
other leading hi-tech firms to explore possibilities for strategic alliances.</P>
      <P>Before his departure, Wang told Taiwan's media he is convinced that the
expansion of the telecommunications market on the Chinese mainland can offer
opportunities to business and industry on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

      <P>A Taiwan national team that will take part in the 40th WorldSkills Competition
in Calgary, Canada, next month departed Saturday with the hope of winning medals
in 45 skills categories that range from cabinetmaking to web design.</P>
      <P>Wang Ju-hsuan, minister of the Council of Labor Affairs, met in Taipei with the
42 members of the under-23 national team and gave them some encouragement before
their departure.</P>
      <P>She expressed the hope that the team will bring home gold medals, especially as
Taiwan missed out on golds in the last competition in Shizuoka, Japan. The
Taiwan team took five silvers, three bronzes and 19 awards of excellence in the
2007 competition.</P>
      <P>The WorldSkills Competition has been held every two years since it was launched
in 1950 as a global "skills olympics." It is a world-class competition for youth
between 17 and 22 years to demonstrate their excellence in skilled professions.</P>
      <P>Some 51 countries will compete in Calgary this year in six broad sub-categories
of skills, trades and technologies. The six areas are social and personal
services, creative arts and fashion, information and  communication  technology,
manufacturing  and  engineering technology, construction and building
technology, and transportation and logistics.</P>
      <P>The competition will be held at Stampede Park, Calgary Sept.1-7.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Expertise of Taipei City rescue team on full display</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/30/09  12:27:15</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One day after Typhoon Morakot slashed through Taiwan cutting a swathe of
destruction, President Ma Ying-jeou went on a fact-finding tour of southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>When he saw that the massive flooding along a raging creek that had breached the
levee on the boundary of Chiayi County and Chiayi City, he asked an aide to
contact Hsiung Kuang-hua, chief of the Taipei City Fire Department.</P>
      <P>The TV cameras following the president were rolling as he asked Hsiung by phone
to send the Taipei City Urban Search and Rescue Team to help evacuate people
stranded by floods in the area.</P>
      <P>For the rescue team, it was an endorsement by the head of state of its
expertise, especially as the scene of the president making the request was
televised live across the country.</P>
      <P>But even before the president asked for the team's assistance on Aug. 9, 32 of
its members had already been dispatched late the previous day to Pingtung
County's Linbian township which was swamped by flood waters one-story high.</P>
      <P>One hour after the team received an 11.00 p.m. call from the National Emergency
Operation Centre, its members hit the road, and by 6 a.m. on Aug. 9 they were in
action in Linbian.</P>
      <P>On its first day of operation in the township, the team succeeded in rescuing
130 people stranded by floods, although five of its rubber rafts were punctured
by unidentifiable sharp objects in the flood waters.</P>
      <P>When it received the request from President Ma, the Taipei City Fire Department
sent a team of 37 members to Minhsiung township in Chiayi County.</P>
      <P>By Aug. 16, the department had dispatched seven other rescue teams, or 585
person/times, to help with the relief operations in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Morakot had dumped nearly 3,000 mm of rain -- nearly a year's volume -- on the
island over a period of three days, causing the worst catastrophe in Taiwan
history since a magnitude 7.6 earthquake killed more than 2,400 people on Sept.
21, 1999.</P>
      <P>As the government scrambled to deal with the aftermath of the storm, the
country's press lashed out in criticism, claiming that the authorities had not
learned anything from the earthquake disaster a decade ago.</P>
      <P>But Hsiung took issue with this view, pointing that since then Taiwan has
assembled highly trained rescue teams that have worked in disaster zones in
other countries.</P>
      <P>The Taipei City Urban Search and Rescue Team, for example, has conducted many
overseas missions in the decade since the 921 earthquake, he said.</P>
      <P>At the time of the earthquake, Hsiung was serving as chairman of the Fire
Science Department at Central Police University in Guishan, Taoyuan County and
was given a directive by the Executive Yuan to request help from overseas.</P>
      <P>Twenty-seven rescue missions from a dozen countries came to Taiwan's aid and
they competed against each other for the distinction of saving the most people,
Hsiung recalled.</P>
      <P>Among them, Hsiung said, he was most impressed by the two teams from the United
Sates, which were well organized and boasted state-of-the-art equipment.</P>
      <P>"They flew in the day after the earthquake aboard a C-5B freight carrier and
touched down at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport because the air force was
hesitant about giving them access to the Chingchuankang air force base in
Taichung -- the nearest airport to the center of the disaster," he recalled.</P>
      <P>"As soon as the plane came to a halt on the tarmac, the two rescue teams emerged
from the belly in their trucks. All their leaders asked was: 'Where should we
start? And with whom should we be in contact?'" said Hsiung.</P>
      <P>The two teams asked for no support whatsoever from the Taiwanese authorities
because they had brought with them everything they needed -- from medicine, food
and satellite communication equipment to long wave infrared locators, he said.</P>
      <P>In such circumstances, the job of search and rescue teams is to rescue people
trapped under debris, not to unearth bodies, Huang said.</P>
      <P>One year after the 921 earthquake,  the Taipei City Fire Department set up a
search and rescue team, using money from the city's budget and funds donated by
people in the wake of the temblor.</P>
      <P>The team, patterned on the structure of the similar team under the U.S. Federal
Emergency Management Agency, has 56 firefighters, four ER doctors and four
structural engineers.</P>
      <P>It has since been expanded to 123 members and has joined rescue operations in El
Salvador in the wake of an earthquake in 2001, in Iran after its historic city
of Bam was leveled by an earthquake in 2003, in Java in 2004 in the wake of a
tsunami there, and in Wenchuan, western China in 2008 after a devastating
earthquake.</P>
      <P>The city's rescue team has also carried out many disaster rescue operations at
home and is now considered one of the country's most experienced teams.</P>
      <P>"The team can go into action within one hour of receiving a call for help, it
can arrive anywhere in Taiwan within six hours, and anywhere around the world in
24 hours," Hsiung said.</P>
      <P>Its performance in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot has fully showed its mettle
and calibre.</P>
      <P>However, "there is no room for complacency, as there is always scope for the
team to upgrade its skills and training in order to prepare for any future
challenges," Hsiung stressed.</P>

      <P>A number of convicts who were sentenced to six months or less in prison are
expected to be put to work in communities hardest-hit by Typhoon Morakot,
sources from the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The assignment will be part of a community service sentencing program introduced
under an amendment to Article 41 of the Criminal Code in January this year.</P>
      <P>The program is slated to begin Sept. 1.</P>
      <P>Under the amendment, convicts sentenced to prison terms of six months or less
for petty crimes could be released on probation and allowed to do community
service in lieu of fines or time behind bars.</P>
      <P>According to MOJ statistics, 1,802 prison inmates are eligible to apply for
early release by paying fines. If they cannot afford the fines, they could apply
for community service sentencing instead, the amendment stipulates.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the amendment will benefit mainly convicted felons sentenced
to six months or less in prison.</P>
      <P>This category of convicts could include former President Chen Shui-bian's son
Chen Chih-chung,  daughter Chen Hsing-yu,  and son-in-law Chao Chien-ming, who
have been indicted for crimes related to corruption and money laundering,
according to Tsai Jui-tsung, director of the MOJ Department of Prosecutorial
Affairs.</P>
      <P>The MOJ estimates that about 1,000 inmates on probation will work for free in
social service organizations each year, which will translate into more than
NT$800 million (US$24.39 million) worth of labor.</P>
      <P>The community service program will also help alleviate problems related to
overcrowding in prisons, said Wu Hsien-chang, director of the MOJ Department of
Corrections.</P>
      <P>The total population of prisons islandwide is 63,994 inmates, which is 16.51
percent, or 9,070 inmates, over capacity, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Overcrowding is most serious in prisons in the northern cities of Taipei,
Keelung and Taoyuan, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, social service organizations have had mixed reactions to the
implementation of community service sentencing.</P>
      <P>Wang Yu-min,  CEO of the nonprofit  Child Welfare  League Foundation, said they
would welcome male convicts to do the more laborious work at the foundation,
such as moving cartons of toys and cleaning.</P>
      <P>Wang said the foundation would be willing to take on the inmates, as long as
they were not convicted of violent crimes or sexual assault.</P>
      <P>The Genesis Social Welfare Foundation, however, said it would pass.</P>
      <P>"We have enough resources to recruit volunteers, so we would be pleased to let
other charity organizations have the convicts," said a foundation spokesman.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Shihlin District Prosecutors Office said Sunday
that the convict community service program will not have an adverse impact on
public order, given that these people will be assessed and screened by
prosecutors before they are released on probation.</P>
      <P>"The program is not expected to exacerbate the unemployment problem either,"
said Yen Nai-wei, pointing out that more than 1,000 public organizations and
schools islandwide have asked for a total of 1,900 inmate workers.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Yen said, the Shihlin District Prosecutors Office will send only
200 inmates into community service in September.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President says he respects indigenous villagers' wish to relocate</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday that he fully respects the wish of residents
of Minzu Village in Kaohsiung County's mountainous Namaxia township to relocate
further downhill as their homes have been destroyed by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>During a talk with residents of Namaxia -- a town in northern Kaohsiung County
near the Central Mountain Range and home to the indigenous Bunun people -- Ma
said that he respects the villagers' wish to settle in Shanlin township, also in
Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>However, the president said, he will instruct the Executive Yuan to assess
whether the villagers should return to their mountain lands to farm after they
have been resettled.</P>
      <P>The Minzu Village residents have decided to move permanently to a tract of land
near Shanlin Junior High School, said Lin Ching-chang, a member of the Minzu
Village Self-Save Committee, during the meeting with President Ma and Premier
Liu Chao-shiuan.</P>
      <P>Lin said the villagers will ask for the right to own the land, which currently
belongs to Taiwan Sugar Corp. The villagers will also seek permission to return
to Minzu to farm their lands there, he said. They remain owners of the Minzu
land, even though their residences were damaged or buried by mudslides caused by
Typhoon Morakot, he added.</P>
      <P>Ma said he will ask the Executive Yuan and Ministry of Finance to study the
feasibility of allowing the villagers to own the land on which they will be
resettled in Shanlin township.</P>
      <P>However, it is debatable whether it would be safe for the villagers to return to
their mountain village to farm, he added.</P>
      <P>Since the typhoon wreaked havoc on southern Taiwan Aug. 7-9 causing the worst
flooding in the country in 50 years, more than 3,500 villagers in Kaohsiung
County have been placed in temporary shelters at military barracks.</P>
      <P>Of the total,  about half were from Namaxia, one of the hardest-hit areas in
Kaohisung.</P>
      <P>As of Saturday, confirmed fatalities from the typhoon disaster had reached 571,
with 106 others reported missing and 33 injured, according to the Central
Emergency Operation Center.</P>
      <P>In related news, the president reiterated in another meeting in the southernmost
county of Pingtung that the government will assist major public-interest
organizations, including the ROC Red Cross Society, to disburse cash relief aid
to the flood victims with flexibility and minimal red-tape.</P>
      <P>"I promise you that rehabilitation will not be too hard to achieve," Ma said to
representatives of the typhoon victims.</P>

of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.</P>
      <P>According to an ISECO press release, Gamzou, Israel's de facto representative to

"warm greetings of health, prosperity and peace."</P>
      <P>In addition to his greetings of "Ramadan Karim" to the A-Hung Ma Hsiao and his

    <HEADLINE>Military retains plan to procure 60 Blackhawk choppers</HEADLINE>

08/30/09  17:35:02

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) said Sunday it will go ahead with its
original plan to procure 60 U.S.-built Blackhawk helicopters, but will allocate
15 of them to the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) for disaster relief work.</P>
      <P>"We reached that decision after consulting with the Interior Ministry," the MND
said in a news statement.</P>
      <P>The MND's decision was a departure from President Ma Ying-jeou's announcement at
a news conference Aug.18 that the military will buy 45 instead of the 60
Blackhawks originally planned and will reassign NT$10 billion of its procurement
budget for the purchase of disaster relief choppers and relevant equipment.</P>
      <P>Ma's announcement came after an aging UH-1H helicopter from the MOI's National
Airborne Service Corps crashed into a mountainside and slid into a valley near
the aboriginal settlement of Sandimen in southern Taiwan's Pingtung County Aug.
11 while on a mission to help victims of Typhoon Morakot. The three crew members
aboard the helicopter were killed in the crash.</P>
      <P>The tragedy reawakened calls for the government to modernize and invigorate the
country's emergency relief capacity and facilities.</P>
      <P>The MND said in its statement that it has decided to stick to the original
number of Blackhawks because this will allow it to acquire the new helicopters
in the shortest possible time at the cheapest possible price.</P>
      <P>Noting that it has finalized all the preparatory work for the procurement deal,
the ministry said any change in the quantity could lead to delivery delays and
price adjustments.</P>
      <P>The MND further said it will give the first 15 Blackhawks delivered by the U.S.
contractor to the National Airborne Service Corps for rescue and relief
operations.</P>
      <P>"In peacetime, the 15 Blackhawks will mainly operate rescue or disaster relief
missions, but in wartime, they will be drafted for combat missions, " according
to the MND. "This way, our combat preparedness will not be affected while our
national resources can be used to the fullest."</P>
      <P>The MND said it will work out further technical details regarding the use of the
15 helicopters, in collaboration with the Interior Ministry.</P>
      <P>The UH-60 Blackhawk is a four-bladed, twin-engine, medium-lift utility
helicopter manufactured by Sikorsky Aircraft.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the Blackhawk is a multi-functional utility chopper, the MND said
acquisition of the new choppers will help upgrade both the country's disaster
relief operations and military logistics support.</P>
      <P>The National Airborne  Service Corps has long used aging, single-engine  UH-1H
choppers  provided  by the military  for post-disaster rescue and relief
operations. The aircraft are not suitable for operations at sea or in high
mountains. The corps has been pushing for the purchase of new helicopters.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan chapter of the Christian charity World Vision has decided to partner
with the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China to help with the
reconstruction of indigenous communities affected by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>"These two leading relief agencies in Taiwan will soon be determining  how to
coordinate  and share resources  to build sustainable  communities  that will
maintain the integrity  of indigenous cultures," World Vision Taiwan said in a
press release.</P>
      <P>Hank Du, executive director of World Vision Taiwan, has reached an agreement
with Taiwan Red Cross Secretary-General Steven Chen to collaborate on several
fronts to help people in storm-stricken indigenous communities rebuild their
homes and livelihoods, according to the press release.</P>
      <P>The two agencies  will openly share information  to avoid duplication of work or
waste of resources, it added.</P>
      <P>World Vision Taiwan, which has over 40 years of experience working with
indigenous communities,  will be responsible  for coordinating with the affected
communities to rebuild infrastructure, and the voices and cultural values of the
people will be fully respected, the release stated.</P>
      <P>World Vision Taiwan said that flexibility will be required to rebuild
infrastructure that incorporates sustainability, cultural and religious values,
livelihood, child education and development, environment, disaster risk
reduction, and social customs.</P>
      <P>Community participation will also be part of the process, it added.</P>
      <P>The two agencies will cooperate on rehabilitation, based on identified needs,
and local church resources will be sought to deliver service and care, World
Vision said. Other partners of the Typhoon Morakot Service Alliance will also be
invited to help restore livelihoods in affected indigenous communities, it
added.</P>
      <P>Noting that World Vision has partnered with different entities in the past in
post-disaster work, Du said such alliances contribute to greater effectiveness
and efficiency.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot lashed Taiwan Aug.7-9, dumping massive amounts of rain on the
southern parts of the country. The storm killed at least 571 people, and left 33
injured and hundreds unaccounted for. Agricultural losses are estimated at more
than NT$ 16.5 billion (US$501 million).</P>

      <P>An international news conference by the Dalai Lama that was scheduled for Monday
morning in Kaohsiung City may be canceled, a Kaohsiung city government source
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The city government was informed Sunday by the Tibet Religious Foundation  of
His Holiness  the  Dalai  Lama,  the de facto representative office of the
Tibetan government in exile in Taiwan, that the Dalai Lama will proceed to the
Typhoon Morakot disaster areas earlier than originally scheduled on Monday, the
source said.</P>
      <P>"The arrangements for the news conference have been halted, " the city
government official said.</P>
      <P>However, as of press time, the Kaohsiung city government had not notified the
130-odd media outlets from home and abroad that had registered to attend the
news conference of any cancellation of the press conference, the official said.</P>
      <P>The Tibetan spiritual leader was scheduled to arrive in Taiwan late Sunday for a
six-day visit -- his third to Taiwan. He first visited Taiwan in 1997 and again
in 2001.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama was invited by local government chiefs in southern Taiwan to
comfort and pray for the typhoon victims in areas that were hardest hit by
Morakot Aug.7-9.</P>
      <P>His itinerary includes delivering a speech and presiding over a prayer ceremony
at Kaohsiung Arena for typhoon victims on Sept. 1 and meeting with Cardinal Shan
Kuo-hsi of the Roman Catholic Church at a Kaohsiung hotel on Sept. 2, the
official said.</P>
      <P>A local media outlet reported Sunday that a ranking official from the ruling
Kuomintang made a telephone call to the Kaohsiung city government Saturday,
suggesting that Mayor Chen Chu cancel the Dalai Lama's international news
conference and make the "religious visit as simple as possible."</P>
      <P>The Kaoshiung city government declined to confirm the report.</P>
      <P>China has strongly denounced the trip but has avoided laying the blame on
President Ma Ying-jeou, who gave the final approval for the Dalai Lama's visit.
Instead, Beijing has accused the opposition Democratic Progressive Party of
sabotaging warming cross-Taiwan Strait ties by inviting someone China brands as
a "separatist."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, issued a three-point
statement Sunday prior to his departure for Taiwan for a six-day visit,
reiterating that his trip has nothing to do with politics or any political
group.</P>
      <P>The 1989 Nobel Peace Prize winner said at New Delhi Indira Gandhi International
Airport that he is traveling to Taiwan at the invitation of the Taiwanese
people, not any political group.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the main purpose of his visit is console surviving victims of
Typhoon Morakot and release the souls of those killed in the disaster from their
suffering, the Dalai Lama said he has not considered any elements other than
praying for blessings on and the wellbeing of the Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>His three-point statement was seen as part of his efforts to minimize the
sensitivity of his Taiwan trip which has touched a raw nerve in China.</P>
      <P>Analysts  said  his  visit  could  hinder  the  Tibetan government-in-exile's
negotiations with China and may even derail nascent detente between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait which began after President Ma Ying-jeou assumed
office in May 2008.</P>
      <P>The 75-year-old Tibetan spiritual leader is scheduled to arrive at Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport at around 10:30 p.m. Sunday.</P>
      <P>This will be his third trip to Taiwan, following his first visit in March 1997
and his second in March 2001.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama was invited by the heads of seven southern Taiwan cities and
counties -- known as strongholds of the pro-independence opposition Democratic
Progressive Party -- to host Dharma sermons for typhoon-affected victims.</P>
      <P>During his stay, the Dalai Lama is expected to head for some of the worst-hit
disaster zones, including Siaolin village where some 400 residents were believed

      <P>Regularly scheduled cross-Taiwan Strait flights are slated to be launched
Monday, but Taiwan is keeping it a low-key affair amid the somber mood that has
prevailed islandwide in the wake of the Typhoon Morakot disaster.</P>
      <P>"There will be no celebrations to mark the launch of the service, which will
increase the number of direct cross-strait flights from 108 to 270 per week, "
the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said.</P>
      <P>CAA officials noted that the government and Taiwanese air carriers had already
celebrated a few months ago the expansion of a special  direct charter flight
service  that was launched  to accommodate  cross-strait  travel  during  three
major national festivals.</P>
      <P>On Monday, a total of 44 round-trip direct flights across the strait will be
available, the CAA said, adding that nine of them will be between Taiwan and
Shanghai.</P>
      <P>The first China-bound  regular  flight from Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport
will be a Uni Airways flight, departing at 7:30 a.m. and arriving in Qingdao
around 10 a.m.</P>
      <P>The first China-bound regular flight from Taipei's Songshan Airport will be a
Trans Asia Airways flight, also departing at 7:30 a.m., but arriving in Shanghai
around 8:55 a.m., according to the CAA.</P>
      <P>The first  regular  flight  from China to Taiwan  Taoyuan International Airport
will be a China Eastern flight, departing from Ningbo at 9 a.m. and arriving at
10:25 a.m.</P>
      <P>The first regular flight from China to Songshan Airport will be a Shanghai
Airlines flight,  departing  from Shanghai's  Hongqiao International Airport at
9: 20 a.m. and arriving at 11 a.m., according to the CAA.</P>
      <P>With the launch of the regularly scheduled cross-strait flights, the number of
mainland China destinations has also been increased from 21 to 27.</P>
      <P>Addressing widespread public complaints about high ticket prices, CAA officials
said they had urged the air carriers to make some price adjustments.
Unconfirmed reports stated that the CAA and the Taiwanese carriers have reached
a decision that ticket prices for regular cross-strait flights will be cut by
about 15 percent.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China reached an agreement in April, in their third round of

      <P>Ten new hospitalized cases of influenza A(H1N1) were confirmed in Taiwan Sunday,
bringing the total of such cases to 75, according to the latest tallies released
by the Central Epidemic Command Center.</P>
      <P>"The rate of increase is not beyond what was expected, " said Steve Kuo,
director-general of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department
of Health (DOH) . "Generally speaking, the symptoms of all the hospitalized H1N1
patients are mild."</P>
      <P>As the number of new infections each week now exceeds 12,000, the number of
hospitalized cases can also be expected to rise, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Most notable among the new hospitalized cases is a 1-year-old girl in central
Taiwan, who is the youngest such patient in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The nine other new hospitalized cases include four males -- aged 3, 7, 13, and
27 -- and five females -- aged 12, 18, and 45, and two 6-year-olds.</P>
      <P>The 75 hospitalized cases included five fatalities, 39 patients who have
recovered, and 31 others who are still receiving treatment at hospitals, Kuo
said.</P>
      <P>With local elementary and junior high schools about to reopen Monday after the
summer break, the epidemic command center announced Sunday that the CDC will
release 2 million face masks next week in an effort to meet a possible increase
in demand and to stabilize prices.</P>
      <P>DOH Deputy Minister Chang Shan-chwen said there is no shortage of masks in the
local market right now.</P>
      <P>"What is lacking are cheap face masks. Therefore, the CDC will release 2 million
into the market, priced at NT$6 each," Chang said. The NT$6 masks will be
available at franchised outlets of four major convenience store chains around
Taiwan in seven days time, he added.</P>
      <P>Cheap masks will also be available later at drug stores, he said, adding that
the move is aimed at driving down the price of face masks.</P>
      <P>Cases of sellers hoarding masks can be reported to county and city consumer
rights protection offices, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he denied a newspaper report which claimed he had suggested that the
N1H1 vaccine, to be available soon, will not be safe for pregnant women in their
first trimester.</P>
      <P>"The  report  is not true.  I have never  made  such  a recommendation, " Chang
said, adding that pregnant women in their first trimester will be free to decide
whether or not they want to be inoculated against the H1N1 virus.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the World Health Organization and the United States have
suggested that pregnant women be vaccinated against both seasonal and swine flu
strains because they are likely to become severe cases if they are infected.</P>
      <P>"Neither the WHO nor the United States has especially recommended that the H1N1
vaccine will not be safe for pregnant women in their first trimester," he said.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the DOH has put pregnant women on the priority list for swine flu
inoculation, but they will not be forced to have the vaccine, Chang stressed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Sunday the city government will decide by Sept. 1
whether to shut down the problematic Muzha-Neihu MRT Line during the
Deaflympics.</P>
      <P>The metro line, which integrates the Muzha segment that was built by French
contractor Matra Co. in the 1990s and the Neihu segment built by Canadian
contractor Bombadier,  has experienced eight emergency shutdowns since its
inauguration July 4.</P>
      <P>Critics have suggested that the MRT line be closed during the 21st Summer
Deaflympics in Taipei Sept.5-15 to spare the city the embarrassment of a
breakdown during that period.</P>
      <P>Hau said Bombadier has been working on a project to fine tune the Muzha-Neihu
line's network system.</P>
      <P>The line has suspended operations over the past two weekends (Aug.22-23 and
Aug.29-30) to enable the contractor to fine tune the computer software project
and conduct dynamic and static testing.</P>
      <P>According to electric engineering experts with Taipei Rapid Transit Corp.
(TRTC), the ATM network program will protect the whole system from a complete
breakdown if a single facility fails or malfunctions, as it will keep the
problem confined to a single station or segment of the line.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the experts said all of the line's 24 stations have been equipped with
a second uninterrupted power system (UPS) to enhance operational stability.</P>
      <P>"After all these upgrades are completed, we will conduct an overall review to
decide whether the entire line should remain operational or be shut down during
the Deaflympics," Hau said, adding that an announcement will be made no later
than Sept. 1.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Dalai Lama arrives in Taiwan for religious visit</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, arrived in Taiwan late
Sunday for a six-day visit aimed at consoling victims of Typhoon Morakot, one of
the worst natural disasters ever to hit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 1989 Nobel Peace Prize winner traveled to the southern port city of
Kaohsiung via a bullet train shortly after his arrival at Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport, some 40 kilometers south of Taipei.</P>
      <P>During his stay, the 75-year-old Dalai Lama will spend most of time visiting
areas hit hard by Typhoon Morakot, which pummeled Taiwan Aug.7-9 and left more
than 600 people dead or missing.</P>
      <P>He originally planned to host an international news conference Monday morning,
but has canceled that event and will instead visit Siaolin village in Kaohsiung
County. Some 400 Siaolin residents were believed to have been buried alive under
a massive landslide triggered by Morakot's torrential rains.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama said at New Delhi Indira Gandhi International Airport before
flying to Taiwan that his visit was strictly non-political and a "moral
responsibility" after a massive storm devastated the island.</P>
      <P>"I'm very, very strict, (the trip is of a) non-political nature," he said in
television footage shown by TVBS cable news channel.</P>
      <P>He further said he believes his visit will not affect relations across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>His statement was seen as part of his efforts to minimize the sensitivity of his
Taiwan trip which has touched a raw nerve in China.</P>
      <P>Analysts  said  his  visit  could  hinder  the  Tibetan government-in-exile's
negotiations with China and may even derail nascent detente between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait which began after President Ma Ying-jeou assumed
office in May 2008.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama was invited by the heads of seven southern Taiwan cities and
counties -- known as strongholds of the pro-independence opposition Democratic
Progressive Party -- to host Dharma sermons for typhoon-affected victims.</P>
      <P>He is scheduled to wrap up his visit Sept.4.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Expertise of Taipei City rescue team on full display</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>08/30/09  12:27:15</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One day after Typhoon Morakot slashed through Taiwan cutting a swathe of
destruction, President Ma Ying-jeou went on a fact-finding tour of southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>When he saw that the massive flooding along a raging creek that had breached the
levee on the boundary of Chiayi County and Chiayi City, he asked an aide to
contact Hsiung Kuang-hua, chief of the Taipei City Fire Department.</P>
      <P>The TV cameras following the president were rolling as he asked Hsiung by phone
to send the Taipei City Urban Search and Rescue Team to help evacuate people
stranded by floods in the area.</P>
      <P>For the rescue team, it was an endorsement by the head of state of its
expertise, especially as the scene of the president making the request was
televised live across the country.</P>
      <P>But even before the president asked for the team's assistance on Aug. 9, 32 of
its members had already been dispatched late the previous day to Pingtung
County's Linbian township which was swamped by flood waters one-story high.</P>
      <P>One hour after the team received an 11.00 p.m. call from the National Emergency
Operation Centre, its members hit the road, and by 6 a.m. on Aug. 9 they were in
action in Linbian.</P>
      <P>On its first day of operation in the township, the team succeeded in rescuing
130 people stranded by floods, although five of its rubber rafts were punctured
by unidentifiable sharp objects in the flood waters.</P>
      <P>When it received the request from President Ma, the Taipei City Fire Department
sent a team of 37 members to Minhsiung township in Chiayi County.</P>
      <P>By Aug. 16, the department had dispatched seven other rescue teams, or 585
person/times, to help with the relief operations in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Morakot had dumped nearly 3,000 mm of rain -- nearly a year's volume -- on the
island over a period of three days, causing the worst catastrophe in Taiwan
history since a magnitude 7.6 earthquake killed more than 2,400 people on Sept.
21, 1999.</P>
      <P>As the government scrambled to deal with the aftermath of the storm, the
country's press lashed out in criticism, claiming that the authorities had not
learned anything from the earthquake disaster a decade ago.</P>
      <P>But Hsiung took issue with this view, pointing that since then Taiwan has
assembled highly trained rescue teams that have worked in disaster zones in
other countries.</P>
      <P>The Taipei City Urban Search and Rescue Team, for example, has conducted many
overseas missions in the decade since the 921 earthquake, he said.</P>
      <P>At the time of the earthquake, Hsiung was serving as chairman of the Fire
Science Department at Central Police University in Guishan, Taoyuan County and
was given a directive by the Executive Yuan to request help from overseas.</P>
      <P>Twenty-seven rescue missions from a dozen countries came to Taiwan's aid and
they competed against each other for the distinction of saving the most people,
Hsiung recalled.</P>
      <P>Among them, Hsiung said, he was most impressed by the two teams from the United
Sates, which were well organized and boasted state-of-the-art equipment.</P>
      <P>"They flew in the day after the earthquake aboard a C-5B freight carrier and
touched down at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport because the air force was
hesitant about giving them access to the Chingchuankang air force base in
Taichung -- the nearest airport to the center of the disaster," he recalled.</P>
      <P>"As soon as the plane came to a halt on the tarmac, the two rescue teams emerged
from the belly in their trucks. All their leaders asked was: 'Where should we
start? And with whom should we be in contact?'" said Hsiung.</P>
      <P>The two teams asked for no support whatsoever from the Taiwanese authorities
because they had brought with them everything they needed -- from medicine, food
and satellite communication equipment to long wave infrared locators, he said.</P>
      <P>In such circumstances, the job of search and rescue teams is to rescue people
trapped under debris, not to unearth bodies, Huang said.</P>
      <P>One year after the 921 earthquake,  the Taipei City Fire Department set up a
search and rescue team, using money from the city's budget and funds donated by
people in the wake of the temblor.</P>
      <P>The team, patterned on the structure of the similar team under the U.S. Federal
Emergency Management Agency, has 56 firefighters, four ER doctors and four
structural engineers.</P>
      <P>It has since been expanded to 123 members and has joined rescue operations in El
Salvador in the wake of an earthquake in 2001, in Iran after its historic city
of Bam was leveled by an earthquake in 2003, in Java in 2004 in the wake of a
tsunami there, and in Wenchuan, western China in 2008 after a devastating
earthquake.</P>
      <P>The city's rescue team has also carried out many disaster rescue operations at
home and is now considered one of the country's most experienced teams.</P>
      <P>"The team can go into action within one hour of receiving a call for help, it
can arrive anywhere in Taiwan within six hours, and anywhere around the world in
24 hours," Hsiung said.</P>
      <P>Its performance in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot has fully showed its mettle
and calibre.</P>
      <P>However, "there is no room for complacency, as there is always scope for the
team to upgrade its skills and training in order to prepare for any future
challenges," Hsiung stressed.</P>

      <P>A number of convicts who were sentenced to six months or less in prison are
expected to be put to work in communities hardest-hit by Typhoon Morakot,
sources from the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The assignment will be part of a community service sentencing program introduced
under an amendment to Article 41 of the Criminal Code in January this year.</P>
      <P>The program is slated to begin Sept. 1.</P>
      <P>Under the amendment, convicts sentenced to prison terms of six months or less
for petty crimes could be released on probation and allowed to do community
service in lieu of fines or time behind bars.</P>
      <P>According to MOJ statistics, 1,802 prison inmates are eligible to apply for
early release by paying fines. If they cannot afford the fines, they could apply
for community service sentencing instead, the amendment stipulates.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the amendment will benefit mainly convicted felons sentenced
to six months or less in prison.</P>
      <P>This category of convicts could include former President Chen Shui-bian's son
Chen Chih-chung,  daughter Chen Hsing-yu,  and son-in-law Chao Chien-ming, who
have been indicted for crimes related to corruption and money laundering,
according to Tsai Jui-tsung, director of the MOJ Department of Prosecutorial
Affairs.</P>
      <P>The MOJ estimates that about 1,000 inmates on probation will work for free in
social service organizations each year, which will translate into more than
NT$800 million (US$24.39 million) worth of labor.</P>
      <P>The community service program will also help alleviate problems related to
overcrowding in prisons, said Wu Hsien-chang, director of the MOJ Department of
Corrections.</P>
      <P>The total population of prisons islandwide is 63,994 inmates, which is 16.51
percent, or 9,070 inmates, over capacity, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Overcrowding is most serious in prisons in the northern cities of Taipei,
Keelung and Taoyuan, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, social service organizations have had mixed reactions to the
implementation of community service sentencing.</P>
      <P>Wang Yu-min,  CEO of the nonprofit  Child Welfare  League Foundation, said they
would welcome male convicts to do the more laborious work at the foundation,
such as moving cartons of toys and cleaning.</P>
      <P>Wang said the foundation would be willing to take on the inmates, as long as
they were not convicted of violent crimes or sexual assault.</P>
      <P>The Genesis Social Welfare Foundation, however, said it would pass.</P>
      <P>"We have enough resources to recruit volunteers, so we would be pleased to let
other charity organizations have the convicts," said a foundation spokesman.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Shihlin District Prosecutors Office said Sunday
that the convict community service program will not have an adverse impact on
public order, given that these people will be assessed and screened by
prosecutors before they are released on probation.</P>
      <P>"The program is not expected to exacerbate the unemployment problem either,"
said Yen Nai-wei, pointing out that more than 1,000 public organizations and
schools islandwide have asked for a total of 1,900 inmate workers.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Yen said, the Shihlin District Prosecutors Office will send only
200 inmates into community service in September.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President says he respects indigenous villagers' wish to relocate</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Aug. 30 (CNA)
08/30/09  16:21:27
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday that he fully respects the wish of residents
of Minzu Village in Kaohsiung County's mountainous Namaxia township to relocate
further downhill as their homes have been destroyed by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>During a talk with residents of Namaxia -- a town in northern Kaohsiung County
near the Central Mountain Range and home to the indigenous Bunun people -- Ma
said that he respects the villagers' wish to settle in Shanlin township, also in
Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>However, the president said, he will instruct the Executive Yuan to assess
whether the villagers should return to their mountain lands to farm after they
have been resettled.</P>
      <P>The Minzu Village residents have decided to move permanently to a tract of land
near Shanlin Junior High School, said Lin Ching-chang, a member of the Minzu
Village Self-Save Committee, during the meeting with President Ma and Premier
Liu Chao-shiuan.</P>
      <P>Lin said the villagers will ask for the right to own the land, which currently
belongs to Taiwan Sugar Corp. The villagers will also seek permission to return
to Minzu to farm their lands there, he said. They remain owners of the Minzu
land, even though their residences were damaged or buried by mudslides caused by
Typhoon Morakot, he added.</P>
      <P>Ma said he will ask the Executive Yuan and Ministry of Finance to study the
feasibility of allowing the villagers to own the land on which they will be
resettled in Shanlin township.</P>
      <P>However, it is debatable whether it would be safe for the villagers to return to
their mountain village to farm, he added.</P>
      <P>Since the typhoon wreaked havoc on southern Taiwan Aug. 7-9 causing the worst
flooding in the country in 50 years, more than 3,500 villagers in Kaohsiung
County have been placed in temporary shelters at military barracks.</P>
      <P>Of the total,  about half were from Namaxia, one of the hardest-hit areas in
Kaohisung.</P>
      <P>As of Saturday, confirmed fatalities from the typhoon disaster had reached 571,
with 106 others reported missing and 33 injured, according to the Central
Emergency Operation Center.</P>
      <P>In related news, the president reiterated in another meeting in the southernmost
county of Pingtung that the government will assist major public-interest
organizations, including the ROC Red Cross Society, to disburse cash relief aid
to the flood victims with flexibility and minimal red-tape.</P>
      <P>"I promise you that rehabilitation will not be too hard to achieve," Ma said to
representatives of the typhoon victims.</P>

      <P>The Taipei-based British Trade and Cultural Office (BTCO) is urging Taiwanese
companies to participate in the TechnologyWorld09 slated for Nov. 23-24 in
Coventry, United Kingdom, saying that it will boost their business potential.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, which is the U.K.'s biggest international "meet-the-buyer"
event, is the right place for technology companies looking for more business,
more innovation and more business partners, the BTCO said in a recent press
release. U.K. Trade and Investment Chief Executive Andrew Cahn was quoted as</P>
      <P>saying in the press release that each year TechnologyWorld gets</P>
      <P>better and better.</P>
      <P>"The U.K. attracts top buyers because of its track record in innovation and
excellence in technology," Cahn said.</P>
      <P>Building on last year's success, which generated an estimated 30 million pounds
(US$48.8 million), this year's event will be held Nov. 23-24 at Richo Arena in
Coventry. It will host global giants such as Panasonic, Hitachi, Nokia, Orange,
PTT and Kayagura Health Solutions, according to the BTCO.</P>
      <P>Some 200 companies from around the world have registered to participate in this
year's show in search of technology innovation, the BTCO said, adding that
evidence from TechnologyWorld08 suggests they will find it. Some 93 percent of
the businesses from 38 countries that attended the 2008 show said they were
likely to increase trade with U.K. businesses, the BTCO said.</P>
      <P>This year's show has been considerably enhanced as part of the British
government's strategic vision for the country's economic recovery, according to
the BTCO.</P>
      <P>Participating companies can arrange one-to-one meetings through the online
meeting facility and sign up for relevant sessions of the conference program, it
added.</P>

said in a news statement.</P>
      <P>The MND's decision was a departure from President Ma Ying-jeou's announcement at
a news conference Aug.18 that the military will buy 45 instead of the 60
Blackhawks originally planned and will reassign NT$10 billion of its procurement
budget for the purchase of disaster relief choppers and relevant equipment.</P>
      <P>Ma's announcement came after an aging UH-1H helicopter from the MOI's National
Airborne Service Corps crashed into a mountainside and slid into a valley near
the aboriginal settlement of Sandimen in southern Taiwan's Pingtung County Aug.
11 while on a mission to help victims of Typhoon Morakot. The three crew members
aboard the helicopter were killed in the crash.</P>
      <P>The tragedy reawakened calls for the government to modernize and invigorate the
country's emergency relief capacity and facilities.</P>
      <P>The MND said in its statement that it has decided to stick to the original
number of Blackhawks because this will allow it to acquire the new helicopters
in the shortest possible time at the cheapest possible price.</P>
      <P>Noting that it has finalized all the preparatory work for the procurement deal,
the ministry said any change in the quantity could lead to delivery delays and
price adjustments.</P>
      <P>The MND further said it will give the first 15 Blackhawks delivered by the U.S.
contractor to the National Airborne Service Corps for rescue and relief
operations.</P>
      <P>"In peacetime, the 15 Blackhawks will mainly operate rescue or disaster relief
missions, but in wartime, they will be drafted for combat missions, " according
to the MND. "This way, our combat preparedness will not be affected while our
national resources can be used to the fullest."</P>
      <P>The MND said it will work out further technical details regarding the use of the
15 helicopters, in collaboration with the Interior Ministry.</P>
      <P>The UH-60 Blackhawk is a four-bladed, twin-engine, medium-lift utility
helicopter manufactured by Sikorsky Aircraft.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the Blackhawk is a multi-functional utility chopper, the MND said
acquisition of the new choppers will help upgrade both the country's disaster
relief operations and military logistics support.</P>
      <P>The National Airborne  Service Corps has long used aging, single-engine  UH-1H
choppers  provided  by the military  for post-disaster rescue and relief
operations. The aircraft are not suitable for operations at sea or in high
mountains. The corps has been pushing for the purchase of new helicopters.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan chapter of the Christian charity World Vision has decided to partner
with the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China to help with the
reconstruction of indigenous communities affected by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>"These two leading relief agencies in Taiwan will soon be determining  how to
coordinate  and share resources  to build sustainable  communities  that will
maintain the integrity  of indigenous cultures," World Vision Taiwan said in a
press release.</P>
      <P>Hank Du, executive director of World Vision Taiwan, has reached an agreement
with Taiwan Red Cross Secretary-General Steven Chen to collaborate on several
fronts to help people in storm-stricken indigenous communities rebuild their
homes and livelihoods, according to the press release.</P>
      <P>The two agencies  will openly share information  to avoid duplication of work or
waste of resources, it added.</P>
      <P>World Vision Taiwan, which has over 40 years of experience working with
indigenous communities,  will be responsible  for coordinating with the affected
communities to rebuild infrastructure, and the voices and cultural values of the
people will be fully respected, the release stated.</P>
      <P>World Vision Taiwan said that flexibility will be required to rebuild
infrastructure that incorporates sustainability, cultural and religious values,
livelihood, child education and development, environment, disaster risk
reduction, and social customs.</P>
      <P>Community participation will also be part of the process, it added.</P>
      <P>The two agencies will cooperate on rehabilitation, based on identified needs,
and local church resources will be sought to deliver service and care, World
Vision said. Other partners of the Typhoon Morakot Service Alliance will also be
invited to help restore livelihoods in affected indigenous communities, it
added.</P>
      <P>Noting that World Vision has partnered with different entities in the past in
post-disaster work, Du said such alliances contribute to greater effectiveness
and efficiency.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot lashed Taiwan Aug.7-9, dumping massive amounts of rain on the
southern parts of the country. The storm killed at least 571 people, and left 33
injured and hundreds unaccounted for. Agricultural losses are estimated at more
than NT$ 16.5 billion (US$501 million).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An international news conference by the Dalai Lama that was scheduled for Monday
morning in Kaohsiung City may be canceled, a Kaohsiung city government source
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The city government was informed Sunday by the Tibet Religious Foundation  of
His Holiness  the  Dalai  Lama,  the de facto representative office of the
Tibetan government in exile in Taiwan, that the Dalai Lama will proceed to the
Typhoon Morakot disaster areas earlier than originally scheduled on Monday, the
source said.</P>
      <P>"The arrangements for the news conference have been halted, " the city
government official said.</P>
      <P>However, as of press time, the Kaohsiung city government had not notified the
130-odd media outlets from home and abroad that had registered to attend the
news conference of any cancellation of the press conference, the official said.</P>
      <P>The Tibetan spiritual leader was scheduled to arrive in Taiwan late Sunday for a
six-day visit -- his third to Taiwan. He first visited Taiwan in 1997 and again
in 2001.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama was invited by local government chiefs in southern Taiwan to
comfort and pray for the typhoon victims in areas that were hardest hit by
Morakot Aug.7-9.</P>
      <P>His itinerary includes delivering a speech and presiding over a prayer ceremony
at Kaohsiung Arena for typhoon victims on Sept. 1 and meeting with Cardinal Shan
Kuo-hsi of the Roman Catholic Church at a Kaohsiung hotel on Sept. 2, the
official said.</P>
      <P>A local media outlet reported Sunday that a ranking official from the ruling
Kuomintang made a telephone call to the Kaohsiung city government Saturday,
suggesting that Mayor Chen Chu cancel the Dalai Lama's international news
conference and make the "religious visit as simple as possible."</P>
      <P>The Kaoshiung city government declined to confirm the report.</P>
      <P>China has strongly denounced the trip but has avoided laying the blame on
President Ma Ying-jeou, who gave the final approval for the Dalai Lama's visit.
Instead, Beijing has accused the opposition Democratic Progressive Party of
sabotaging warming cross-Taiwan Strait ties by inviting someone China brands as
a "separatist."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, issued a three-point
statement Sunday prior to his departure for Taiwan for a six-day visit,
reiterating that his trip has nothing to do with politics or any political
group.</P>
      <P>The 1989 Nobel Peace Prize winner said at New Delhi Indira Gandhi International
Airport that he is traveling to Taiwan at the invitation of the Taiwanese
people, not any political group.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the main purpose of his visit is console surviving victims of
Typhoon Morakot and release the souls of those killed in the disaster from their
suffering, the Dalai Lama said he has not considered any elements other than
praying for blessings on and the wellbeing of the Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>His three-point statement was seen as part of his efforts to minimize the
sensitivity of his Taiwan trip which has touched a raw nerve in China.</P>
      <P>Analysts  said  his  visit  could  hinder  the  Tibetan government-in-exile's
negotiations with China and may even derail nascent detente between the two

      <P>The 75-year-old Tibetan spiritual leader is scheduled to arrive at Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport at around 10:30 p.m. Sunday.</P>
      <P>This will be his third trip to Taiwan, following his first visit in March 1997
and his second in March 2001.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama was invited by the heads of seven southern Taiwan cities and
counties -- known as strongholds of the pro-independence opposition Democratic
Progressive Party -- to host Dharma sermons for typhoon-affected victims.</P>
      <P>During his stay, the Dalai Lama is expected to head for some of the worst-hit

    <TEXT>
      <P>Regularly scheduled cross-Taiwan Strait flights are slated to be launched
Monday, but Taiwan is keeping it a low-key affair amid the somber mood that has
prevailed islandwide in the wake of the Typhoon Morakot disaster.</P>
      <P>"There will be no celebrations to mark the launch of the service, which will
increase the number of direct cross-strait flights from 108 to 270 per week, "
the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said.</P>
      <P>CAA officials noted that the government and Taiwanese air carriers had already
celebrated a few months ago the expansion of a special  direct charter flight
service  that was launched  to accommodate  cross-strait  travel  during  three
major national festivals.</P>
      <P>On Monday, a total of 44 round-trip direct flights across the strait will be
available, the CAA said, adding that nine of them will be between Taiwan and
Shanghai.</P>
      <P>The first China-bound  regular  flight from Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport
will be a Uni Airways flight, departing at 7:30 a.m. and arriving in Qingdao
around 10 a.m.</P>
      <P>The first China-bound regular flight from Taipei's Songshan Airport will be a
Trans Asia Airways flight, also departing at 7:30 a.m., but arriving in Shanghai
around 8:55 a.m., according to the CAA.</P>
      <P>The first  regular  flight  from China to Taiwan  Taoyuan International Airport
will be a China Eastern flight, departing from Ningbo at 9 a.m. and arriving at
10:25 a.m.</P>
      <P>The first regular flight from China to Songshan Airport will be a Shanghai
Airlines flight,  departing  from Shanghai's  Hongqiao International Airport at
9: 20 a.m. and arriving at 11 a.m., according to the CAA.</P>
      <P>With the launch of the regularly scheduled cross-strait flights, the number of
mainland China destinations has also been increased from 21 to 27.</P>
      <P>Addressing widespread public complaints about high ticket prices, CAA officials
said they had urged the air carriers to make some price adjustments.
Unconfirmed reports stated that the CAA and the Taiwanese carriers have reached
a decision that ticket prices for regular cross-strait flights will be cut by
about 15 percent.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China reached an agreement in April, in their third round of
negotiations, to increase the number of cross-strait flights from 108 to 270 per
week.</P>
      <P>Direct air links between Taiwan and China were opened in July last year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ten new hospitalized cases of influenza A(H1N1) were confirmed in Taiwan Sunday,
bringing the total of such cases to 75, according to the latest tallies released
by the Central Epidemic Command Center.</P>
      <P>"The rate of increase is not beyond what was expected, " said Steve Kuo,
director-general of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department
of Health (DOH) . "Generally speaking, the symptoms of all the hospitalized H1N1
patients are mild."</P>
      <P>As the number of new infections each week now exceeds 12,000, the number of
hospitalized cases can also be expected to rise, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Most notable among the new hospitalized cases is a 1-year-old girl in central
Taiwan, who is the youngest such patient in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The nine other new hospitalized cases include four males -- aged 3, 7, 13, and
27 -- and five females -- aged 12, 18, and 45, and two 6-year-olds.</P>
      <P>The 75 hospitalized cases included five fatalities, 39 patients who have
recovered, and 31 others who are still receiving treatment at hospitals, Kuo
said.</P>
      <P>With local elementary and junior high schools about to reopen Monday after the
summer break, the epidemic command center announced Sunday that the CDC will
release 2 million face masks next week in an effort to meet a possible increase
in demand and to stabilize prices.</P>
      <P>DOH Deputy Minister Chang Shan-chwen said there is no shortage of masks in the
local market right now.</P>
      <P>"What is lacking are cheap face masks. Therefore, the CDC will release 2 million
into the market, priced at NT$6 each," Chang said. The NT$6 masks will be
available at franchised outlets of four major convenience store chains around
Taiwan in seven days time, he added.</P>
      <P>Cheap masks will also be available later at drug stores, he said, adding that
the move is aimed at driving down the price of face masks.</P>
      <P>Cases of sellers hoarding masks can be reported to county and city consumer
rights protection offices, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he denied a newspaper report which claimed he had suggested that the
N1H1 vaccine, to be available soon, will not be safe for pregnant women in their
first trimester.</P>
      <P>"The  report  is not true.  I have never  made  such  a recommendation, " Chang
said, adding that pregnant women in their first trimester will be free to decide
whether or not they want to be inoculated against the H1N1 virus.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the World Health Organization and the United States have
suggested that pregnant women be vaccinated against both seasonal and swine flu
strains because they are likely to become severe cases if they are infected.</P>
      <P>"Neither the WHO nor the United States has especially recommended that the H1N1
vaccine will not be safe for pregnant women in their first trimester," he said.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the DOH has put pregnant women on the priority list for swine flu
inoculation, but they will not be forced to have the vaccine, Chang stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Will Muzha-Neihu MRT line be shut down during Deaflympics?</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Sunday the city government will decide by Sept. 1
whether to shut down the problematic Muzha-Neihu MRT Line during the
Deaflympics.</P>
      <P>The metro line, which integrates the Muzha segment that was built by French
contractor Matra Co. in the 1990s and the Neihu segment built by Canadian
contractor Bombadier,  has experienced eight emergency shutdowns since its
inauguration July 4.</P>
      <P>Critics have suggested that the MRT line be closed during the 21st Summer
Deaflympics in Taipei Sept.5-15 to spare the city the embarrassment of a
breakdown during that period.</P>
      <P>Hau said Bombadier has been working on a project to fine tune the Muzha-Neihu
line's network system.</P>
      <P>The line has suspended operations over the past two weekends (Aug.22-23 and
Aug.29-30) to enable the contractor to fine tune the computer software project
and conduct dynamic and static testing.</P>
      <P>According to electric engineering experts with Taipei Rapid Transit Corp.
(TRTC), the ATM network program will protect the whole system from a complete
breakdown if a single facility fails or malfunctions, as it will keep the
problem confined to a single station or segment of the line.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the experts said all of the line's 24 stations have been equipped with
a second uninterrupted power system (UPS) to enhance operational stability.</P>
      <P>"After all these upgrades are completed, we will conduct an overall review to
decide whether the entire line should remain operational or be shut down during
the Deaflympics," Hau said, adding that an announcement will be made no later
than Sept. 1.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama arrived at Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport late Sunday night to mixed reactions.</P>
      <P>Scores of people waving banners at the airport denounced the Dalai Lama's visit
to Taiwan, while others waited for hours at other points to catch a glimpse of
him and to greet him.</P>
      <P>At the airport, one of the banners carried by the protesters read "Tibet, Taiwan
belong to same China."</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama, accompanied by Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu, went from the arrival
terminal at the airport to the Taiwan High Speed Rail Station to board a bullet
train that was specially assigned to take him to the southern port city of
Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>At the station, he was greeted by followers of Tibetan Buddhism who offered him
"hada" as a blessing.</P>
      <P>About one hour later, the Dalai Lama, along with Chen Chu and members of the
Tibet Religious Foundation of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, the de facto
representative office of the Tibetan government in exile in Taiwan, arrived in
Kaohsiung around 1 a.m.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama was warmly greeted at Zuoying Station by a huge crowd that had
been waiting there long before he arrived. People waved "hada" and shouted the
Tibetan greeting "zhaxidele."</P>
      <P>At around 1: 15 a.m., the Dalai Lama arrived at his hotel where another huge
crowd was waiting, but he was whisked into the hotel and to his room by a side
door.</P>
      <P>Cheng Shun-lu, a devout follower of Tibetan Buddhism, said he and his family had
been waiting in the hotel lobby for over three hours in hopes of seeing the
Dalai Lama again in person. Cheng said he visited Dharamsala last year and met
with the Dalai Lama.</P>
      <P>Other followers, holding "hada, " wept in the lobby. They said although they did
not have an opportunity to speak with the Dalai Lama, they could feel his
kindness and mercy.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama, invited by the heads of seven southern Taiwan cities  and
counties  that are known  as strongholds  of the pro-independence  opposition
Democratic Progressive  Party,  is scheduled to visit Siaolin Village in
Kaohsiung County to pray for victims of Typhoon Morakot Monday morning. Siaolin
was one of the villages that suffered the worst devastation in the storm earlier
this month.</P>
      <P>He will also give Dharma sermons for typhoon victims in several other battered
areas.</P>
      <P>An international news conference by the Dalai Lama that was scheduled for Monday
morning in Kaohsiung City was canceled before his arrival.</P>
      <P>His itinerary includes delivering a speech and presiding over a prayer ceremony
at Kaohsiung Arena for typhoon victims on Sept. 1 and meeting with Cardinal Shan
Kuo-hsi of the Roman Catholic Church at a Kaohsiung hotel on Sept. 2.</P>
      <P>The six-day visit is the Dalai Lama's third to Taiwan. He first visited Taiwan
in 1997 and again in 2001.</P>
      <P>China has strongly denounced the trip but has avoided blaming President Ma Ying-
jeou, who gave the final approval for the Dalai Lama's visit. Instead, Beijing
has accused the opposition Democratic Progressive Party of sabotaging warming
cross-Taiwan Strait ties by inviting someone China brands as a "separatist."</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Kuei-Shan Little League team lost to the Americans 6-3 in a
championship game in Williamsport, Pennsylvania Sunday to take second place in
the 2009 Little League World Series.</P>
      <P>The defeat dashed the dreams of the Taoyuan County team, which is representing
the Asia-Pacific region, to win the title after they defeated the Mexican team
from Reynosa Saturday night Taiwan time.</P>
      <P>Kuei-Shan was in pursuit of the World Series title, which Taiwan last won in
1996.</P>
      <P>Taiwan  once dominated  the annual tournament,  taking  17 championship titles
between 1969 and 1996, but between 1997 and 2008 failed to even make it to the
World Series.</P>
      <P>On Sunday, Pennsylvania time, Kuei-Shan was ahead 3-0 in the beginning of the
third inning of the championship game after Sung Wen-hua struck a two-point home
run and Ou Chin swung a solo homer.</P>
      <P>The American team from California scored one point in the bottom of the third
inning on an error by the Kuei-Shan defense.</P>
      <P>However, the U.S. team added three more points in the bottom of the fourth
inning with two hits, taking advantage of two wild pitches. They surged ahead
6-3 in the fifth inning after adding two more points from three hits and one
wild pitch.</P>
      <P>Kuei-Shan tried their best but failed to score further until the sixth or final
inning.</P>
      <P>Starter/hitter Ou Chin,  who baffled California early with breaking balls and
gave dashing performances in the games against the Caribbean and Mexican teams,
wept when his team lost.</P>
      <P>The game was broadcast live in Taiwan in the early hours of Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Lee Jen-teh, secretary-general of the Chinese Taipei Student
Baseball  Federation,  the Kuei-Shan  baseballers  were technically on a par
with their American rivals, but they were too nervous to win the game.</P>
      <P>"They were defeated by the pressure they felt within themselves " Lee said.</P>
      <P>Despite the defeat, Lee said, the Kuei-Shan little leaguers performed
outstandingly during the World Series in Williamsport.</P>
      <P>"Many viewers back home in Taiwan have been moved by the performance of the
Kuei-Shan little leaguers," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee also expressed appreciation to the Taoyuan County government for its efforts
to promote baseball at the grassroots level.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chinese team will not attend Deaflympics opening: organizers</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chinese team that will participate in the Deaflympics Taipei 2009 is not
expected to attend the opening ceremony on Sept. 5, a top organizer of the event
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The 100-strong Chinese team is scheduled to arrive in Taiwan around 9: 40 p.m.
Sept. 5, which means it will miss the opening which is scheduled for 7: 30 p.m.
the same day, said Emile C. J. Sheng, chief executive officer of the organizing
committee for the Taipei Deaflympics.</P>
      <P>The Chinese team to the World Games in Kaohsiung in July also did not attend the
opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>When asked by reporters at a news conference Monday whether the Chinese team was
skipping the Deaflympics opening because of the Dalai Lama's current visit in
Taiwan,  Sheng said he had no information to that effect.</P>
      <P>"I also have no idea whether the Chinese team will take part in the closing
ceremony," Sheng added.</P>
      <P>However,  the  80-member  Thousand-hand  Bodhisattva  Dance Performance Group
from China, comprised mainly of hearing impaired young women, will perform at
the opening ceremony, he confirmed.</P>
      <P>Regarding the order of appearance of the teams at the opening ceremony, Sheng
said that France will lead the procession, in keeping with International
Committee of Sports for the Deaf (ICSD) protocol. France was the first nation to
sponsor the Deaflympics.</P>
      <P>As the host, the Chinese Taipei team will appear last, Sheng added.</P>
      <P>According to Stan Lai, ceremony general director, the opening of the Deaflympics
will be a "memorable event that will call forth the beauty of the human heart
and reach out to the deaf community."</P>
      <P>It will be divided into 12 acts, including a performance titled "Impossible
Dream" by renowned Taiwanese model Patina Lin.</P>
      <P>Completely covered in body paint, Lin will float across a 50-meter projection
screen to create the illusion of a goddess walking through air and water. She
will also perform along with children from schools for the hearing-impaired,
using sign language to express the message of "Power in Me," Lai said.</P>
      <P>World-renowned deaf percussionist Evelyn Glennie has been invited to perform at
the opening ceremony, as well as the local drumming group U-Theatre, and more
than 80 children from schools for the hearing-impaired in Taipei and Taichung
cities, according to Lai.</P>
      <P>The Deaflympics  is one of four games  regulated  by the International Olympic
Committee (IOC) . Its events are similar to those of the Olympic Games and are
governed by the same rules.</P>
      <P>The 21st Summer Deaflympics in Taipei is expected to bring together about 4,000
athletes and sports officials from 101 countries around the world.</P>
      <P>The games will feature 20 sports, namely athletics, badminton, basketball,
bowling, cycling, football, handball, orienteering, shooting,  swimming,  table
tennis,  tennis, volleyball,  beach volleyball, water polo, wrestling freestyle,
wrestling Greco-Roman, karate, judo and taekwondo, according to the ICSD.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Monday:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Tuvalu face the same relocation question</P>
      <P>Taiwan's South Pacific ally Tuvalu has donated US$210,000 -- 1 percent of its
gross domestic product -- to Taiwan for its Typhoon Morakot relief operation.</P>
      <P>However, few local residents are aware that Tuvalu is troubled by a similar
question of relocation of its people as Taiwan because of the threat of
inundation by rising sea levels caused by global warming.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's problem is caused by its people's excessive development of mountain
areas that has led to prevalent mudslides and the excessive drawing of
underground water that has prompted subsidence of some of the island's coastal
areas.</P>
      <P>With all our sympathy for flood victims, we still have to point out that if
these people do not alter their methods, the tragedy of flooding is doomed to
repeat itself when the next typhoon hits the island.</P>
      <P>We feel pity that a bill enacted by the Legislative Yuan for the reconstruction
of the disaster areas last week waives the requirement for environmental impact
assessments before new land development.</P>
      <P>It lays the groundwork for the next disaster.</P>
      <P>Yes, we need reconstruction as soon as possible, but should not we pause a while
and review our policy of pursuing economic development at the cost of the
environment?</P>
      <P>Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama canceled a planned news conference upon
his arrival in Taiwan to spare the host country the problem of irritating China.
The Foreign Ministry permitted him to enter the country without a visa, while
the Democratic Progressive Party, which extended the invitation for him to
visit, has refrained from milking his trip for political mileage.</P>
      <P>It is the best scenario and one that would create room for greater confidence
between Taipei and Beijing in their dealings with each other.</P>
      <P>However, a group of people under the direction of the ruling Kuomintang, which
does not see eye to eye with the DPP on inviting the Dalai Lama to Taiwan,
claimed that his visit is not necessary because Taiwan has many leaders of
various religions who can pray for the victims of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>But those who make that argument do not understand that the Dalai Lama's visit
shows that Taiwan is a democracy rather than a puppet of China, as it can
accommodate people of different opinions, and that the blessings of whatever god
and in whatever quantity are always welcome here.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Help homeless flood victims</P>
      <P>As the legislature rushed last week to enact a bill that would expedite
reconstruction in the aftermath of the Typhoon Morakot disaster, some protestors
outside the legislature denounced the clauses in the bill that would give the
government the power to relocate aboriginal communities in mudslide-prone areas.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, there are only a few cases of successful relocation of such
communities.</P>
      <P>Experience shows that it takes three to 10 years to relocate such communities,
and that the most difficult tasks are to obtain suitable sites and reconcile the
different opinions among the people to be resettled.</P>
      <P>We urge the authorities to be patient in its attempts to persuade the members of
the communities to relocate.</P>
      <P>We also call for the participation of private charities, not only because their
caring input is necessary to the process, but also because elected officials are
usually not in office long enough to see the relocation through to the end.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Some politicians defame the Dalai Lama by distorting his religious visit</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama is regarded worldwide as prestigious religious leader, but is
condemned by China as a separatist.</P>
      <P>How can a person who bears no arms and has no access to armed forces be
considered a thorn in the side of a regime with nuclear weapons? It is because
of the Dalai Lama's charisma and mettle and the worldwide backlash against an
oppressive Chinese regime.</P>
      <P>President Ma was in no position to reject the Dalai Lama's visit because of
public anger against his administration's botched relief operations in the
aftermath of Typhoon Morakot, but China is not reconciled to Ma's decision.
Therefore, there are some politicians who are fronting for Ma and toadying to
China.</P>
      <P>Those politicians who denounce the Dalai Lama's visit as part of a political
scheme have exposed their own intentions to strike discord between the Tibetan
spiritual leader and local religious leaders.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan had rejected the Dalai Lama's visit, it would have undermined its
claims to democracy and relegated itself to the status of a colony of China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President respects MND's plan to go through with Blackhawk purchase</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou fully understands and respects the Ministry of National
Defense's (MND's) decision to stick to its plan to procure 60 U.S.-built
Blackhawk helicopters, MND spokesman Yu Sy-tue said Monday.</P>
      <P>The president expressed his understanding of the MND plan after hearing several
high-ranking military officials defend the need for the purchase based on
military considerations, Yu said.</P>
      <P>Ma instructed the MND to consult with the Ministry of the Interior  (MOI)
further  on the  allocation  and use of the high-efficiency helicopters after
they are acquired from the United States, Yu added.</P>
      <P>The MND announced Sunday that it will go through with the procurement of 60
Blackhawk helicopeters, with 15 of them to be allocated  to the MOI to beef  up
Taiwan's  disaster  relief capabilities.</P>
      <P>The MND's decision was a departure from Ma's announcement at a news conference
Aug. 18 that the military would buy only 45 of the 60 Blackhawks originally
ordered from the United States and reallocate the remaining NT$10 billion
(NT$303.77 million) of the budget for the Blackhawks to buy disaster relief
choppers and related equipment.</P>
      <P>The president's announcement came after an aging UH-1H helicopter from the MOI's
National Airborne Service Corps crashed into a mountainside near the aboriginal
settlement of Sandimen in southern Taiwan's Pingtung County Aug. 11 while on a
mission to help victims of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>The three crew members  aboard  the more than 30-year-old helicopter were killed
in the crash.</P>
      <P>The tragedy reawakened calls for the government to modernize the country's
emergency relief capacity and equipment.</P>
      <P>The MND said in its statement that it has decided to stick to the original
number of Blackhawks because this will allow it to acquire the new helicopters
in the shortest possible time at the cheapest possible price.</P>
      <P>"In peacetime, the 15 Blackhawks will mainly be used for rescue or disaster
relief missions, but in wartime, they will be called on for combat missions, "
said the MND statement.</P>
      <P>The UH-60 Blackhawk is a four-bladed, twin-engine, medium-lift utility
helicopter manufactured by Sikorsky Aircraft.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the Blackhawk is a multi-functional utility chopper, the MND said
acquisition of the new choppers will help upgrade both the country's disaster
relief operations and military logistical support structure.</P>

      <P>The government will do its utmost to communicate with Beijing to avert a
possible blow to the warming cross-Taiwan Strait relations that might be caused
by the present visit to Taiwan by the Dalai Lama, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Deputy Chairman Liu Te-shun said Monday.</P>
      <P>Liu reiterated that the visit by the Tibetan spiritual leader is purely a
religious one to console and pray for the victims of Typhoon Morakot who were
killed or lost their homes and loved ones in massive flooding and landslides
earlier this month.</P>
      <P>He stressed that Taiwan has no political considerations at all for the visit of
a person branded by China as a "separatist."</P>
      <P>China's Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council repeated a protest a day
earlier over the Dalai Lama's visit to Taiwan, which it warned will harm cross-
strait ties.</P>
      <P>In response to the protest, Liu said the government will "use all its strength
to maintain and promote the gradually formed mutual trust between the two
sides."</P>
      <P>He added that efforts are being made to maintain the stable development of
cross-strait links, which were icy for a large part of nearly 60 years until
President Ma Ying-jeou opened his arms to China.</P>
      <P>Liu, however, declined to give direct answers to reporters' questions on whether
or not the Dalai Lama's visit will have a negative impact on the signing of a
planned Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) between Taiwan and
China, or on the launch of a fourth round of talks between Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , or on the upcoming Deaflympics 2009 in Taipei
slated for Sept. 5-15.</P>
      <P>Asked about China's cancellation of a celebration for the inauguration of direct
cross-strait flights between Taipei and Harbin in northeastern China that day,
Liu said the MAC would be trying to find out the reason for the cancellation.</P>
      <P>The cancellation of planned celebrations for the launch of the regularly
scheduled flights also spread to all other Chinese cities offering the services,
a move that was blamed by corporate sources on the Dalai Lama's visit.</P>
      <P>"It is a serious issue in China that no-one wants to touch, " they said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Li Yafei, assistant director of China's State Council Taiwan Affairs
Office, told reporters on the sidelines of a "Taiwan Week" in Dandong, Liaoning
Province, that the Dalai Lama's visit to Taiwan has affected cross-strait links.</P>
      <P>"We are concerned as to how this develops, " he said.</P>
      <P>Wang Yi, director of the office, was originally scheduled to attend the opening
ceremony for the "Taiwan Week" but canceled his attendance at the last minute,
appointing Li to show up instead.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama arrived in Taiwan a day earlier for a six-day visit at the
invitation of the administrators of seven southern Taiwanese cities and counties
that are known as strongholds of the pro-independence opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>China has strongly denounced the trip but has avoided blaming Ma, who gave final
approval for the Dalai Lama's visit. Instead, Beijing has accused the DPP of
sabotaging the warming cross-Taiwan Strait ties.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's share prices rose marginally Monday,  with the weighted index, the
market's key barometer, increasing 16.09 points, or 0.23 percent, to close at
6,825.95.</P>
      <P>The local bourse opened at 6,844.91 and fluctuated between 6,848.96 and 6,760.05
during the day's trading session.</P>
      <P>A total of 3.07 billion shares changed hands on market turnover of NT$85.45
billion (US$2.60 billion).</P>
      <P>Seven of the eight major stock categories gained ground, with construction
shares moving up the most at 4.6 percent. Foodstuff stocks surged 2.6 percent,
textile shares rose 1.9 percent, paper and pulp issues advanced 1.6 percent,
cement stocks were up 1.5 percent, plastics and chemicals gained 0.5 percent,
and machinery and electronics issues closed 0.3 percent up.</P>
      <P>Only banking and financial shares lost ground, dropping 1.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Construction shares rebounded after having dropped sharply since the beginning
of the third quarter, while shares in the biotechnology sector also played a
major role in the day's positive showing because of an acceleration in the scale
of the influenza A(H1N1) outbreak.</P>
      <P>However, shares in the banking and financial, tourism and transport sectors
underperformed, thanks to concerns that a visit to Taiwan by the exiled Tibetan
spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, the A(H1N1) flu epidemic and a planned Cabinet
reshuffle next month will have a negative impact on the economy.</P>
      <P>Gainers outnumbered losers 1,163 to 1,047, with 203 stocks remaining unchanged.</P>
      <P>Foreign institutional  investors were net buyers of NT$759 million-worth of

      <P>One analyst  said that the market will not rise or drop significantly in the

      <P>The Central Weather Bureau's (CWB's) computing ability will be five times faster
and stronger than it is at present once its forecasting  technology and
equipment are upgraded, bureau officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>At the moment, Europe's weather computing ability is 24 times faster than that
of Taiwan, the United States' computing ability is 11 times stronger than that
of Taiwan, and even China's ability is 1.7 times stronger than Taiwan's,
according to Chen Chia-ping, deputy director of the CWB's computer center.</P>
      <P>The bureau announced Aug. 28 that it will invest NT$1.9 billion (US$59 million)
over the next six years to strengthen its forecasting technology.</P>
      <P>The upgrading plan has been mooted by the CWB since 2007 but took on greater
urgency after widespread criticism of the bureau for inaccurate rainfall
forecasting prior to the arrival of Typhoon Morakot and the massive
precipitation it brought that devastated southern Taiwan with flooding and
mudslides  in early August, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>The government took the brunt of the blame for failing to respond more promptly
and efficiently to the disaster wrought by Morakot, but some officials felt the
weathermen could have provided more timely rainfall forecasts.</P>
      <P>"The new equipment is expected to enable our meteorologists to provide much more
timely and long-range rainfall projections, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>The number of areas covered by weather forecasters and monitoring stations will
also be increased from the current 22 cities and counties to 300 townships
nationwide once the upgrading engineering is completed, he added.</P>
      <P>In addition, the CWB currently begins forecasting the path of tropical storms
approaching Taiwan five days in advance, which will be increased to seven days
in advance once the equipment upgrade has been made.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese hip hop group Kou Chou Ching won the awards for "Best Remix Song" and
"Best Music Group" at America's Just Plain Folks (JPF) Music Awards Sunday,
becoming the first Taiwanese artists to be honored by the nonprofit music awards
program.</P>
      <P>The group's first full-length album "Kou!! It's Coming Out!!! " received four
nominations in the competition, and aside from winning in the "Best Remix Song"
and "Best Music Group" categories, placed second for "Best Asian Album" and
fifth for "Best Asian Song."</P>
      <P>Kou Chou Ching has been mixing traditional nanguan, Taiwanese recital chants,
Taiwanese opera, hakka eight note music,  and Taiwanese and aboriginal songs
with hip hop, reggae and other popular music styles since 2003, recreating a new
genre that is rich in Taiwanese consciousness and culture.</P>
      <P>They have appeared in the media in more than 30 countries and have been
introduced as the "Voice of Taiwan, " "Taiwan's Big Hip-Hop Hope," and "Taiwan's
Hip-Hop Ambassadors."</P>
      <P>According to the JPF's Web site (www.jpfolks.com), 42,000 albums and 560,000
songs were submitted to the competition this year. The award ceremony was held
in Nashville, Tennessee, on Aug. 29</P>
      <P>The JPF Awards were started in 1999 as a simple way to recognize the best music

    <TEXT>
      <P>Five more patients with influenza A (H1N1) were hospitalized in Taiwan Monday,
bringing the total to 80 since the outbreak began, according to the latest
tallies released by the Central Epidemics Command Center.</P>
      <P>Steve Kuo, director-general of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the
Department of Health (DOH), said the rate of increase was not beyond
expectations.</P>
      <P>Kuo said the new patients include three males and two females ranging in age
from 8 to 49 who come from northern and central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Of the 80 patients hospitalized to date, five have died and 36 have  recovered.
The youngest  hospitalized  case involves  a 23-month-old girl whose condition
is mild, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kuo said the CDC will release enough of the anti-viral drug Tamiflu
to treat 250,000 people to health offices in cities and counties around Taiwan
Tuesday to meet the demand.</P>
      <P>That will leave the government with a Tamiflu capsule inventory large enough to
treat another 260,000 people, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>"There  has been  no pressure  yet at grassroots  medical institutions to obtain
Tamiflu, " Kuo said, but he explained that if the capsules in stock are not
sufficient to meet demand, the CDC will release the powdered form of Tamiflu it
has in inventory so that hospitals can produce the liquid form of the drug.</P>
      <P>Kuo outlined the Tamiflu situation after Chen Chien-jen, a DOH minister under
the previous administation, said in a letter published in a local newspaper
Monday that all of Taiwan's Tamiflu inventory was purchased when the Democratic
Progressive Party was in power.</P>
      <P>The Academia  Sinica academician  argued  that the current Kuomintang government
has an insufficient supply of anti-viral medication to cope with the ongoing
fight againt swine flu.</P>
      <P>According to Kuo, the CDC's inventory of Tamiflu and another anti-viral drug
Relenza is sufficient for use by 18 percent of Taiwan's population, and he said
the epidemic command center has decided to raise the inventory to cover 30
percent of the population.</P>
      <P>Kuo said the command center will publish a report Tuesday on its procurement of
anti-viral drugs.</P>
      <P>At present, aside from the powdered form of Tamiflu, which can cover more than 2
million patients, and the Tamiflu capsules, the government has also inventoried
enough Relenza to treat 970,000 patients.</P>
      <P>It has also stocked four tons of shikimic acid, the base material to produce
Tamiflu, which could quickly be used to manufacture enough of the drug for
another 1 million patients.</P>
      <P>In the future, for every three doses of anti-viral drugs the government intends
to buy, two will be Tamiflu and one will be Relenza to be able to treat the H1N1
patients who develop a resistance to Tamiflu.</P>

      <P>More than 100 business tycoons lent their support Monday to an Executive Yuan-
initiated home and industry reconstruction program in the areas badly damaged by
Typhoon Morakot earlier in the month.</P>
      <P>They included Hon Hai Precision Industry Chairman Terry Gou, Far Eastern Group
Chairman Douglas Hsu, Kinpo Group Chairman Rock Hsu, Taipei-based Chinese
National Federation of Industries Chairman Chen Wu-hsiung, and ASUSTek Computer
Chairman Johnny Shih.</P>
      <P>The entrepreneurs attended a ceremony hosted by Premier Liu Chao-shiuan at the
Executive Yuan to launch the government's move to seek  the  business  sector's
help  with  the  post-disaster reconstruction.</P>
      <P>In his address, Liu expressed hope that the sector can use its special skills
and resources to help build not just "houses" but "homes" for the typhoon
victims.</P>
      <P>Introducing the government's plans to invite enterprises to get involved in the
home reconstruction, Liu stated that the projects will be carried out according
to a "green concept" and that the new buildings will be equipped with "smart
living" systems including safety- and environment-monitoring networks, as well
as Wi-Max connections.</P>
      <P>In terms of the restoration  of industrial and commercial activities in typhoon-
battered areas, Liu said the government has mapped out plans to develop niche-
market agriculture and tourism in the affected areas to help create employment
opportunities.</P>
      <P>Gou suggested that the government could impose a special tax on stock market
deals in an effort to raise funds to deal with flood problems and he also
advised the government stop increasing its debts.</P>
      <P>The typhoon swept through Taiwan Aug. 7-9, triggering the worst flooding  in 50
years in southern Taiwan and causing serious casualties and losses. As of 5: 30
p.m. Monday, the death toll had reached 602 with 81 people still reported
missing.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A local research team has developed a mobile image query with pseudo-object
system that can help shoppers learn more about prices for similar products.</P>
      <P>"The new system allows a mobile phone user to get information about the
appearances, styles, and prices of items similar to the product a consumer plans
to buy, " said Winston H. Hsu, an associate professor at NTU's Graduate
Institute of Computer Science and Information Engineering, who led the research
team to develop the new system.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, the shopper needs only to photograph the product with a mobile
phone to get related information almost instantly.</P>
      <P>"By so doing, the shopper will get a sense of prevailing market prices," Hsu
said.</P>
      <P>"I got the idea to develop the system after I went shopping with my wife one
time at a local department store," he recalled.</P>
      <P>His wife intended to buy a handbag for NT$50,000.</P>
      <P>"She asked me whether it was too expensive. I had no idea about handbag prices
then and could not give her any advice, " Hsu said, prompting him to develop the
multimedia system.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the system has been patented and that he is discussing cooperative
projects with local system developers and online shopping companies.</P>
      <P>The system will also be applied in the future to identify local landmarks, Hsu
said.</P>
      <P>"For instance, if you reach a location and have no idea about a certain
building, you can photograph it and then get information on it online," he
explained.</P>
      <P>The system was one of the 23 multimedia products developed under a cooperative
project between NTU and the National Science Council, all of which were
introduced at a news conference held earlier in the day.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Dalai Lama visits storm-affected areas in southern Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Dalai Lama drew welcoming crowds in southern Taiwan Monday as he began his
tour of areas hard-hit by Typhoon Morakot and prayed for those who lost their
families and homes in flooding and mudslides caused by the storm.</P>
      <P>In Siaolin village, which had hundreds of its residents buried alive by a
landslide in the storm, the exiled Tibetan leader put his palms together in
prayer while a monk next to him recited a Buddhist sutra.</P>
      <P>Braving the sweltering heat, many typhoon-affected victims took the belongings
of their loved ones who perished in the storm to the site, hoping that their
souls could rest in peace following the Dalai Lama's prayer.</P>
      <P>After the ceremony, which lasted 10 minutes, the Dalai Lama greeted the typhoon-
affected victims surrounding him.</P>
      <P>He said that although many survived the typhoon, some people lost their family
members and good friends, and he wanted to share their sorrow and sadness, which
is the main purpose of his visit.</P>
      <P>Facing the dogged media throng around him, he was articulate and did not shun
from sensitive political questions.</P>
      <P>He stressed that his visit has "no political agenda" and that he has nothing to
discuss with the leader of this country, saying he doesn't "want to create any
inconvenience (for) anybody."</P>
      <P>Asked about his views on cross-strait relations, he said that Taiwanese
politicians, including those from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) , do not seek "separation" from China.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan should have really close unique links with mainland China," the Dalai
Lama said.</P>
      <P>He later traveled to Jiadong, a town on the southwestern coast of Pingtung
County that was heavily flooded during the typhoon, to pray for the quick
recovery of the town and its people.</P>
      <P>In a pouring rain that began when he arrived in the coastal town, the Dalai Lama
said people were traumatized because of the disaster, but urged them not to lose
faith but start a new life.</P>
      <P>Shortly after he left, the pouring rain stopped and the sun came out, and many
of his followers interpreted the temporary rain as a good omen for the affected
area and its victims.</P>
      <P>Before heading to disaster areas Monday morning, the Dalai Lama was greeted
outside his hotel in Kaohsiung by about 20 aboriginal protesters from Paiwan and
Rukai tribal villages in Pingtung County that were also battered by the typhoon.</P>
      <P>They were unhappy that the Dalai Lama did not plan to visit aboriginal villages
during his time in Taiwan and that he had only come with prayers but no
substantial relief resources.</P>
      <P>They displayed white banners displaying the words, "We don't want the Dalai Lama
politics, we want his food and shelter," and "We need relief resources, not
verbal prayers."</P>
      <P>They said, however, that they would be happy if the Dalai Lama consented to stay
in Taiwan for a longer period of time to help the victims.</P>
      <P>There were also several supporters and members of the U.N. For Taiwan
Association who welcomed the Tibetan spiritual leader's visit.</P>
      <P>About 40 policemen were dispatched to maintain order around the hotel where the
Dalai Lama was staying.</P>
      <P>Beijing has said it "resolutely opposes" the Dalai Lama's visit, and a Chinese
official involved in Taiwan affairs warned Sunday night that his trip "is bound
to have a negative influence on the relations between the mainland and Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Unflustered by the commotion, the Dalai Lama said the diversity of responses was
a wonderful sign of democracy and freedom of speech, and he emphasized that he
did not plan any political statements but came here solely for humanitarian
purposes.</P>
      <P>"We are not seeking separation for Taiwan, but the fate of Taiwan depends on the
more than 20 million people, " he said. "You are enjoying democracy and that you
must preserve. I myself am totally dedicated to the promotion of democracy."</P>
      <P>Despite the Dalai Lama's insistence that his trip is strictly for humanitarian
and religious purposes, some of his itinerary has been changed.</P>
      <P>A press conference scheduled for Monday and a speech scheduled in the Taoyuan
Arena for later in the week were canceled and an event in the 15,000-seat
Kaohsiung Arena has been moved to the Garden Villa, which can only accommodate
an audience of 700 people.</P>
      <P>Chow Mei-li, the president of the "Taiwan Friends of Tibet, " accused China of
putting pressure on Taiwan's authorities to cancel or downsize the events.</P>
      <P>However, Dawa Tsering, chairman of the Tibet Religious Foundation of H.H. The
Dalai Lama, explained that the Tibetan leader changed the venue of the Kaohsiung
speech because it would have required 5,000 policemen to maintain order at
Kaohsiung Arena, which in the Dalai Lama's opinion was too much.</P>
      <P>Dawa Tsering also said the Taoyuan Arena speech was canceled because the site
had already been booked.</P>

      <P>Former Health Minister Yeh Ching-chuan has lost a primary held by the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) to determine its nominee in the year-end race for magistrate in
eastern Taiwan's Hualien County.</P>
      <P>Yeh, known as a hero in the war on SARS in 2003, was defeated by Tu Li-hua, the
county's former Agricultural Development Office chief, in a three-day telephone
poll.</P>
      <P>Tu won the support of 54.5 percent of the interviewed voters in the county to
secure the KMT's nomination as its candidate in the county chief election.</P>
      <P>Yeh, who resigned from the post of health minister earlier this month to run in
the primary, said he had too little time to prepare for the race.</P>
      <P>He also said he will be glad to stump for Tu if she asks for his assistance in
her campaign activities.</P>
      <P>Despite the failure, Yeh will remain in Hualien until the end of the year to
offer services to his supporters.</P>
      <P>Fu Kun-chi, a KMT legislator who was excluded from the primary by the party's
Organization and Development Committee because of a conviction on illegal stock
speculation  that he is currently appealing, has still not decided whether to
run in the county magistrate election as an independent.</P>
      <P>Hualien County is one of the most strongly pro-KMT districts in Taiwan, and Tu
is almost a sure winner of the race if the popular Fu does not enter the race.</P>

      <P>The postponement of Su's trip, which came after the Dalai Lama arrived in Taiwan

    <HEADLINE>Record number of snake-eating turtles seized at Kaohsiung Airport</HEADLINE>

      <P>A total of 1,255 protected Chinese yellow margined box turtles have been seized
at Kaohsiung International Airport, a customs official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The snake-eating turtles, known by the scientific name Cuora flavomarginata,
were uncovered last weekend when customs officers inspected an export shipment
that was listed as green-headed turtles, or Ocadia sinensis, on the customs
declaration form, the official said.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time that the Kaohsiung customs office has ever seized such
a large number of protected animal species to be sent abroad, the official said.</P>
      <P>The turtles were placed in 50 well-packed cases, each containing three plastic
containers separated by dividers. Unfastening the screws securing the dividers
proved difficult and time-consuming, but customs officers discovered the
protected turtles in the containers below those packed at the top of each
carton.</P>
      <P>A close examination by experts from National Pingtung University of Science and
Technology confirmed that the animals were a protected species barred from being
exported, the official said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the would-be exporter has violated the Wildlife Protection Act and
smuggling regulations, the official said the customs office has referred the
case to relevant authorities for processing.</P>

      <P>A speech to be made by the Dalai Lama on Tuesday will be broadcast live, the
Tibet Religious Foundation of His Holiness the Dalai Lama said Monday.</P>
      <P>The foundation, in a press release, said the Dalai Lama had originally  planned
to give a speech on "One World,  Common Responsibility" Sept. 1 at Kaohsiung
Arena, which has more than 10,000 seats.</P>
      <P>But the organizer, out of concern for the personal safety of the Tibetan
spiritual leader and a wish to mitigate the inconvenience brought to others, has
changed the speech venue to Garden Villa, the hotel and conference center where
he is currently staying.</P>
      <P>Only 1,200 people will be able to attend the speech in person, but Public
Television Service will broadcast it live from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. and televise it
again at midnight.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama's prayer service for the typhoon-affected victims is scheduled
for between 9: 30 a.m and 11: 30 a.m. and will still take place at Kaohsiung
Arena.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama, who arrived in Taiwan Sunday for a six-day visit to console
typhoon-affected victims in southern Taiwan, will meet with Cardinal Paul Shan
Kuo-hsi Wednesday between 9:30 a.m. and noon.</P>
