takes into consideration their capacity. A fool, on the other hand,
is easy to please, but difficult to serve. If you go beyond your duty
to please him, he will be pleased. But in his employment of men, he
expects them to be able to do everything."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>PANAMA'S PRESIDENT LIKELY TO POSTPONE ROC VISIT AGAIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Panama  City,  March  31 (CNA)
(By H.T. Chung and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The state visit to the Republic of
China by Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso may be further
postponed, probably to June, diplomatic sources here said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Moscoso recently told ROC Ambassador in Panama Lan Chih-min that
she may not be able to visit Taiwan in April as previous scheduled
owing to factors concerning various domestic affairs, but added a
postponement would have nothing to do with any "diplomatic
intervention."</P>
      <P>Moscoso was originally scheduled to visit Taipei in January but
later changed her mind on the advice of relevant Panamanian officials
concerning the ROC presidential election on March 18.</P>
      <P>Moscoso, who accepted an invitation by former ROC Foreign Affairs
Minister Jason Hu last August, decided to postpone her first state
visit to Taiwan until late March or early April, after the ROC's
presidential election.</P>
      <P>The state visit will now likely be delayed until June, but a
definite schedule will have to be worked out by officials from Panama
and Taiwan, Lan said.</P>
      <P>Panama is one of the ROC's most important diplomatic allies in
Central America. ROC Premier Vincent Siew attended Moscoso's
inauguration in Panama City in August 1999 and President Lee Teng-hui
traveled to Panama in September 1997 to attend the World Congress of
the Panama Canal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWANESE GROUPS PROTEST JAPAN'S HANDLING OF WARTIME DEBTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  April 1 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A delegation of members from five different
groups representing former Taiwanese soldiers in the Japanese
Imperial Army protested here on Friday the Japanese government's
handling of debts owed to them for their service during World War II.</P>
      <P>Led by Republic of China legislators Fan Yang-sheng and Yang
Tso-tsou, the ten representatives of former Taiwanese soldiers in the
Imperial Army or their relatives showed up Friday afternoon at the
Tokyo headquarters of the Japan Interchange Association, a
semi-official agency in charge of Taiwan affairs, and presented a
letter of protest to its chairman Toshio Goto.</P>
      <P>In the letter, the protesters criticized the Japanese government
for compensating Taiwanese citizens by only 120 times the face value
of money owed to them from more than five decades ago while giving
Japanese debtors payments at 70,000 times the original amount owed.</P>
      <P>The letter also expressed their opposition to the five year
deadline which fell on March 31, after which the debts will be repaid
at par value only.</P>
      <P>They also demanded that any unclaimed funds, worth about 23
billion yen, should be deposited in banks pending any remaining
claims by Taiwanese citizens in the future.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Japanese foreign ministry were present when
the protesters handed over the letter to Goto, who promised to convey
it to the Japanese government.</P>
      <P>In a press conference on Friday evening, Fan said that Japan
should not unilaterally decide the amount they owe and the method of
repayment without first consulting with Taiwanese claimants.</P>
      <P>Kuo Lien-fu, a representative of former Taiwanese soldiers in the
Japanese Imperial Army, complained at the press briefing that the
Japanese government owed an average of 1,000 yen to each of the
Taiwanese claimants they represent, which is equivalent in value to
about 0.97 hectares of farmland in Taiwan at the time, or NT$10
million (34.1 million yen) now.</P>
      <P>However, each of these claimants will only receive 120,000 yen
(NT$34,800), or less than one month's wages for the average Taiwanese
worker nowadays, under the Japanese government's formula.</P>
      <P>This discriminatory and arbitrary treatment of wartime claimants
has drawn the wrath of many Taiwanese citizens who would rather spurn
the Japanese government's offer than accept the insulting "handouts."
Therefore, more than two thirds of the claimants have refused to
accept the Japanese government's compensation thus far, said Kuo.</P>
      <P>He vowed to press ahead with the demands of Taiwanese claimants
until the Japanese government grants them just compensation.</P>
      <P>The Japanese government debts to Taiwanese citizens stem from 50
years of colonization of the island between 1895 and 1945. They
consist mainly of the salary in arrears to Taiwanese who were
recruited as soldiers at the end of War World II.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HAS CAPABLE SELF-DEFENSE FORCES: COHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  March  31  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Defense Secretary William Cohen
Friday declined to comment on a "highly classified" Pentagon
assessment of Taiwan's military capability reported by The Washington
Post, but he said he is satisfied that Taiwan still has a very
capable military.</P>
      <P>In response to a similar question about Taiwan's military
capability, State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin told a routine
press briefing that "I think Cohen noted that it was our view that
Taiwan did have capable self-defense forces."</P>
      <P>"The fact that we work on such reports is, in and of itself, a
demonstration that this is a topic of concern to us and that it's
something that obviously informs our decision-making, given our
obligations under the Taiwan Relations Act," stressed Rubin.</P>
      <P>The Washington Post quoted a new classified Pentagon report as
saying that Taiwan is perhaps more vulnerable to Communist Chinese
attack now because of its isolation and the fact that it cannot
exercise with other countries using its weaponry.</P>
      <P>After meeting the Ukrainian defense minister, Cohen told
reporters that he is not in a position to comment publicly on the
report on Taiwan, other than to say that Taiwan is still "very
capable in terms of its military capability, but that there are
recommendations -- there are always recommendations for ways to
improve its capability through training and exercises and other types
of activities."</P>
      <P>"But we conduct a number of reports, consistent with the Taiwan
Relations Act, to assess Taiwan's defense capabilities, and report
accordingly. And that will continue in the future," added the defense
secretary.</P>
      <P>Cohen, the commander-in-chief of the US Pacific Command and some
Pentagon officials have said they do not feel that China is now
capable of attacking and taking over Taiwan. When pressed with the
question, Cohen said that "what we have said is Taiwan should not
seek independence, and China should seek to bring about a
reconciliation through peaceful means."</P>
      <P>Cohen also did not respond to questions regarding Taiwan's recent
requests for Aegis-class destroyers and other advanced defensive
weapons systems.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US SHOULD CONTINUE TO SHOW STRONG SUPPORT FOR TAIWAN: EXPERTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  March  31  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington, March 31 (CNA Washington should continue to show
strong support for democratic and free Taiwan, according to a
Washington-based think tank.</P>
      <P>The victory of Democratic Progressive Party presidential
candidate Chen Shui-bian signals first and foremost that democracy is
thriving in Taiwan, wrote Larry M. Wortzel, director of the Asian
Studies Center at the Heritage Foundation, and Stephen Yates, a
senior policy analyst at the center, in an executive memorandum
published Friday.</P>
      <P>But they also noted that it signals an important change in the
relationship between Taipei and Beijing. "As long as the Kuomintang
was in control in Taipei, Beijing could pretend that unification
across the Taiwan Straits was possible through party-to-party
negotiations. Taiwan's democratic transformation since its first
direct presidential elections in 1996 may have chipped away at this
myth, but Chen Shui-bian's victory has shattered it," pointed out the
two experts on Asia.</P>
      <P>To resolve the issue of reunification, they wrote, "Beijing must
now deal with a government that carries no baggage from the days of
China's civil war in the 1940s."</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan's security and the survival of its democracy are
vital US national security interests, Washington should send US
representatives to attend the inauguration of the president-elect
when the KMT relinquishes power to send a clear signal to Beijing
that the American people support democracy, said Wortzel and Yates.</P>
      <P>The authors added that the United States should also voice
support for the principles of the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act
which passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 371-40. "The
TSEA acknowledges the democracy on Taiwan and that the Republic of
China no longer claims to rule the mainland. More important, it
ensures that Taiwan can defend itself from military aggression."</P>
      <P>In addition, they said, Washington should continue to seek the
simultaneous entry of Taiwan and Communist China into the World Trade
Organization, "which would help the mainland develop rules and norms
that would improve economic ties and communication with Taiwan and
bring China more fully into the international community."</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP ENVOY AGAIN CALLS ON BEIJING TO SHOW CREATIVITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  March  31 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A top representative of the Republic
of China's President-elect Chen Shui-bian to the United States on
Friday once again called for Beijing to show creativity in
cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>The Democratic Progessive Party's Chiou I-jen, at a press
conference prior to his departure from Washington, D.C., urged
Beijing not to stick to its own interpretation of `one China.'
Instead, he said Beijing should have a more creative attitude toward
the current impasse in the Taiwan Strait, saying that history is made
by creativity. "Refusing to change is not conducive to creating
history," Chiou added.</P>
      <P>Chiou told reporters that it would be greatly conducive to
creative interactions across the strait if Beijing would still give
serious thought to the `one China' formula defined by Wang Daohan,
chairman of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS), several years ago.</P>
      <P>Wang defined `one China' not as the Republic of China or the
People's Republic of China, but as a unified China to be formed
sometime in the future, according to Chiou. He said this definition
is viable and feasible and is most likely to be accepted by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chiou said the DPP's bottom line is similar to recent statements
by US President Bill Clinton that any decision concerning Taiwan's
future must be agreed to by the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He added that the DPP has set no prerequisites for Taiwan's
future, noting that the party takes heed of the people's will --
whether it be for reunification with the mainland or for
independence.</P>
      <P>Chiou said Chen's stance is to understand through dialogue
Beijing's definition of the `one China' policy, adding that Taiwan
will not jump the gun to talk about whether or not to accept
Beijing's `one China' policy before understanding the exact
definition.</P>
      <P>Over the past three days in Washington, D.C., Chiou has met with
US officials, lawmakers and China hands on cross-strait and
US-ROC-PRC relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US MISSILE DEFENSE PLAN THREATENS NUCLEAR PEACE: EXPERTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, March 31 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several well-known missile experts meeting
in Ottawa Friday have joined in a chorus of rising concern over a
United States missile defense plan, saying its implementation would
seriously threaten global nuclear peace.</P>
      <P>"We're playing with the fundamental (principles) of the
non-proliferation treaty," said John Steinbruner, director of
International Security Studies at the University of Maryland.</P>
      <P>The 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile pact that has kept nuclear peace
between Russia and the US is at risk, he said.</P>
      <P>He and others were expressing concern that US President Bill
Clinton or his successor will proceed with the US$12.5-billion
project, now in the testing stage.</P>
      <P>The scaled-down Star Wars system is being touted as a capable
defense against the potential launch of a few missiles by "rogue
states" such as Iraq or North Korea.</P>
      <P>Steinbruner said a better idea would be to work towards
international agreements to share missile monitoring data,
surveillance information and early-warning efforts.</P>
      <P>North Korea has indicated it would get out of the nuclear arms
business in exchange for compensation -- another option that should
be explored, he added. "It's probably quite possible to buy them
out."</P>
      <P>Steinbruner and nine other ballistic missile experts discussed
tougher missile control, including international early-warning and
tracking efforts.</P>
      <P>Implementation of a new US defense system would only deepen
Russian paranoia and insecurity, said Taira Koybaeva. "We should be
sensitive to that," said the Russian-born business and political
communications professor at Utah State University.</P>
      <P>Canada should weigh the reaction from other countries if it
supports implementing such a system, said John Garnett, a missile
expert in defense studies at King's College in London, England.</P>
      <P>US Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre recently urged Canada to
join the system or risk being left out of key NORAD (North American
Aerospace Command) decisions.</P>
      <P>Canada contributes US$320 million a year to NORAD, 10 percent of
the command's budget. But Canada's federal government has not been
formally asked to make a decision.</P>
      <P>Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy has raised
concern about the system's destabilizing effect on the balance of
nuclear power which has been achieved through treaties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE BUDGET FAR FROM SUFFICIENT SAYS ROC DEFENSE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Defense Minister Tang Fei on Saturday would
not comment on a Pentagon assessment that Taiwan is more vulnerable
to attack from mainland China than generally recognized.</P>
      <P>Tang, who has been invited by President-elect Chen Shui-bian to
be the next premier of the Republic of China beginning on May 20,
said it is improper for him to comment on the latest and highly
classified Pentagon assessment at present since he has not yet seen
the contents of the report.</P>
      <P>He noted, however, that "if the assessment proved to be correct,
we should be willing to do some soul-searching and review our defense
policy."</P>
      <P>Tang, meanwhile, reiterated that Taiwan's defense budget,
equivalent to 2.6 percent of the gross national product (GNP) this
year, is far from sufficient in meeting national security needs.</P>
      <P>He added that even if the budget were raised to 3.5 percent of
the GNP next year, it would still be too low in terms of beefing up
national defenses in the face of the growing military threat from
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Tang made the remarks at a workshop sponsored by National Taiwan
University's Law School.</P>
      <P>He noted that even if the defense budget is raised to 3.5 percent
of the GNP, representing about 17 percent of the nation's overall
budget, it won't be enough to help gear up Taiwan's combat readiness
as about 50 percent of the budget will be allocated to paying the
salaries of military personnel, who number about 382,000.</P>
      <P>At the workshop, Tang, who declined to comment on the offer of
the post of premier, said that in the face of Beijing's persistent
sable rattling and verbal assaults, Taiwan must construct a
nation-wide psychological and civilian defense that includes the
entire population within one year.</P>
      <P>Although remaining low-key on the topic of the premiership, Tang
spoke broadly on his views concerning government organization,
diplomacy, and cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Tang said he feels the ROC Armed Forces should emulate the US
Pentagon's efforts at keeping the nation's entire defense system
flexible and able to quickly readjust itself every three or four
years based on the current strategic situation and the appearance of
any new threats to the nation's security.</P>
      <P>On the diplomatic front, Tang said Taiwan should actively reach
out to nurture trust with neighboring countries. He noted that no one
will help the island unconditionally, so all the ROC can do is extend
the offer of help to others first.</P>
      <P>On cross-strait relations, Tang said mainland China will pose a
genuine and serious threat to Taiwan by 2010, when its military
modernization program is completed. In addition to continuing to work
to improve cross-strait relations, Taiwan should at the same time
upgrade its combat preparedness as well as surveillance capabilities
of mainland Chinese military movements, he said.</P>
      <P>On the question of possibly taking up the premiership, Tang
reiterated that, as a Kuomintang-government official, he will follow
the instructions of the party, saying the final decision is up to the
Kuomintang.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WHO CARES FOR FORMER TAIWANESE SOLDIERS IN JAPANESE ARMY (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  1 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fifty-five years after the end of Japan's
colonization of Taiwan, the deadline for Taiwanese claimants for
compensation by the Japanese for war time services finally came to
pass March 31, supposedly putting the issue to rest once and for all.</P>
      <P>However, the Japanese government's handling of the compensation
issue has given rise to more disputes than it was intended to
resolve, and more than half of the eligible creditors have
deliberately shunned the program rather than accept the petty
compensation offered by Tokyo.</P>
      <P>Many Taiwanese claimants consider the minuscule amount of
repayment as an insult rather than as a settlement of compensation
claims made by the people of Taiwan for debts owed to them by Japan
during the period of Japanese rule of the island from 1895 to 1945.</P>
      <P>Most of the claims stem from among the 207,000 Taiwanese who were
recruited into the Japanese Imperial Army to serve as soldiers or
paramilitary members near the end of World War II.</P>
      <P>These "honorable" draftees were assigned to battlegrounds in
mainland China, the Southern Pacific islands or for work in Japan.
About 53,000 of them died in the war or are still unaccounted for.</P>
      <P>Their payments in arrears and savings deposited at military post
offices during the war constitute the major part of the Japanese
government's debt to Taiwanese citizens.</P>
      <P>Other claims include deposits made by ordinary Taiwanese citizens
at post offices and payments due to Taiwanese life insurance policies
holders.</P>
      <P>The Japanese government, which estimated the number of claimants
in Taiwan at 4.47 million, has set aside 35.3 billion yen to cover
compensation claims over five years.</P>
      <P>However, according to statistics released by the Japan
Interchange Association, which is in charge of processing the claims
in Taiwan, only 55,000 claims for late payments to soldiers have been
filed out of a total of 84,000 cases. About 43,000 claimants, or 51
percent of the total, actually collected their compensation by the
March 31 deadline.</P>
      <P>As to the military deposits with post offices, about 53,000
claims were made, but only 29,000 claimants, or 48 percent, have
collected their repayment.

    <TEXT>
      <P>As a result, only 11 billion yen of the 35.3 billion budget has
been paid out.</P>
      <P>Liu Yung-chung, a Taiwan activist for former Taiwanese soldiers
in the Imperial Army, claimed the repayment program is unfair and the
payment offered to Taiwanese citizens too low, leading most Taiwanese
claimants to opt out of the program.</P>
      <P>Liu said that it is ridiculous that the Japanese government
established its policy for settling its debts with Taiwanese citizens
without consulting with the claimants first. The rate of compensation
and the time frame within which the creditors could make their claims
were both decided upon without asking for Taiwanese creditors' input
or approval.</P>
      <P>To their indignation, the most insulting aspect of the program is
its discriminatory nature. Taiwanese citizens were offered
compensation at only 120 times the face value of the money owed to
them while Japanese citizens who served in the army were given 7,000
times the original amount owed.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese claimants' calls for fair treatment seem to have
fallen on deaf ears as Japan apparently is continuing it arrogant
colonial attitude toward Taiwan, said Liu.</P>
      <P>These former soldiers from Taiwan who fought against China during
the World War II can hardly expect to get any help from authorities
in the Republic of China government, which doesn't have diplomatic
ties with Tokyo. Their only avenue of appeal to the Japanese
government is through non-official channels.</P>
      <P>Japan has actually repeatedly demanded that the debt issue be
settled through negotiations with Taiwan, but only if China's debts
to Japan are also included in negotiations and settled too.</P>
      <P>Knowing that it owes much more to Japan, the Republic of China
government has preferred to not open talks with Tokyo on this issue
and leave the matter in the hands of legislators, encouraging them to
negotiate with Tokyo in private.</P>
      <P>In the absence of government leadership and backup, , Taiwanese
claimants have formed different groups, numbered at about a hundred
at its peak, to pursue their claims. They have aired conflicting
demands and have never formed a joint front in talks with Japan to
put pressure on the Japanese government.</P>
      <P>The war has been over for 55 years, now these former Taiwanese
soldiers in the Japanese Imperial Army are fading away, their lives
having been divided between two former rival countries, with few
people caring about their plight. It seems they can do nothing but
blame their ill fortune and carry their grief with them to their
graves.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TANG FEI'S APPOINTMENT SEEN AS OPPORTUNITY TO MODERNIZE ROC ARMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  March  31  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A researcher at a United States
think tank said on Friday that Tang Fei's appointment as the premier
of the Republic of China will present the best opportunity for
modernizing the nation's army and upgrading its military
capabilities.</P>
      <P>Michael Swaine, a researcher at the California-based Rand
Institute, made the remarks to CNA after Washington Post cited a
classified Pentagon report as saying that Taiwan is perhaps more
vulnerable to Communist Chinese attack now because the island's
military capabilities have been weakened through years of diplomatic
isolation.</P>
      <P>Swaine pointed out that if one sees the purpose of the Pentagon
report as prodding the US to sell Taiwan more advanced weapon
systems, it will be a misinterpretation, saying that Taiwan does not
lack military hardware but does need to improve training,
maintenance, the execution of its software, and the integration of
various systems.</P>
      <P>Swaine said that Taiwan's advanced weapons are not being used to
their fullest extent and that it is futile to accumulate a large
volume of new weaponry.</P>
      <P>Swaine, who criticized Taiwan on this point in his report last
year, noted that Taiwan's army has been controlled by the Kuomintang
over the past five decades, preventing it from engaging in real
reforms.</P>
      <P>He noted that even after related laws and regulations, such as
the organic law of the Ministry of National Defense, have been
passed, they have not been able to meet the nation's security needs.</P>
      <P>But he said that with Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progress
Party as the new president and with the KMT's Tang as the premier,
the two parties will be able to work together to forge consensus on
national defense policy and on the military budget.</P>
      <P>Under a civilian leader, the army will be monitored closely, and
this will be an important opportunity for the modernization of
Taiwan's army.</P>
      <P>Swain said that the report he presented late last year has some
similar views with those expressed in the Pentagon report, but they
are both irrelevant studies.</P>
      <P>He said that even the ROC army has tacitly admitted that there
are some problems with its military capabilities and that Taiwan has
to seriously address the question.</P>
      <P>Swain's report was presented to the Pentagon for reference prior
to its recent classified report. He understands that the Pentagon
thinks his report is "useful" and "helpful," judging from the fact
that military information on both sides of the Taiwan Strait is very
limited.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 1 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui on
Saturday issued a decree to convene the fifth session of the third
National Assembly (NA) on April 8.</P>
      <P>Acting NA Speaker Chen Ching-jang said that the main purpose of
convening the NA session is to amend the Constitution to the effect
that the NA will become an "empty-frame" institution.</P>
      <P>He noted that NA deputies will adopt a resolution to ask the
Central Election Commission to put off the May 6 NA election for one
or two months so that they will have sufficient time to amend the
Constitution.</P>
      <P>Last September, the NA passed a bill to extend the four-year term
of NA members by two years and 42 days until June 30, 1992.
Their term was originally scheduled to expire on May 19, 2000.</P>
      <P>But the Council of Grand Justices ruled last week that the
decision was "invalid." As a result, the Central Election Commission
decided to hold the new NA elections on May 6.</P>
      <P>The NA caucuses of the Kuomintang and the Democratic Progressive
Party have agreed to let the NA become an "empty-frame" institution
and asked President Lee to issue a decree to convene the NA session
to amend the Constitution.</P>

      <P>Acting Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan said
on Saturday that he expects the party will rise again by winning the
elections for legislators and county magistrates in two years and by
regaining the presidency in 2004.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while speaking at the first meeting of the

defeat in the March 18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Forty-five of the 54 reform council members attended the meeting,
presided over by Lien himself.</P>
      <P>Lien stressed that the party must undergo self-examination and
all-out reform so as to display a fresh image to the public, adding
that "we must rise again from where we fell down."</P>
      <P>During the three-hour meeting, members of the reform council
exchanged views on the disposal of party assets and on the party's
status and organization, as well as discussing how to carry out party
policy more thoroughly and how to solicit the support of the younger
generation.</P>
      <P>In the coming weeks, ten groups made up of members of the Reform

grass-roots opinions on reforming the party. They will then submit
concrete suggestions on reform by the end of May.</P>
      <P>In the recently held presidential election, the KMT ticket of

      <P>Chen was responding to a report by the Washington Post that said
Jeremy J. Stone, president of the Federation of American Scientists,

      <P>Stone, who assisted in United States arms negotiations with
Russia and is a close friend of Nobel laureate Lee Yuan-tseh,
president of the nation's highest research institute Academia

      <P>Chen, who is a member of the pro-Taiwan independence Democratic

going to Beijing. While in Taiwan, he met with Chen and Lee, Chen's
top adviser who had previously expressed his willingness to

(By K.C. Huang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has gradually transformed into a
democracy, said a US academician at a Saturday seminar held here.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a symposium which was jointly sponsored by an
ROC-funded academic foundation and New York University, Robert
Scalapino, an honorary professor of the University of California at
Berkeley, said Taiwan has gradually transformed into a full democracy
from an authoritarian regime. He noted that late President Chiang
Ching-kuo made a tremendous contribution in that peaceful process.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Taiwan's democracy may still face a strong
challenge from dictatorship, he suggested that President-elect Chen
Shui-bian join forces with all of Taiwan's political camps to reduce
political tensions on the island and open political talks with
mainland China to improve bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's political culture is characterized by political
localization, the identification of the so-called "new Taiwanese"
concept, an aspiration for a civilian leadership, and political
uncertainties in cross-Taiwan Strait relations, Scalapino stressed
that Taiwan's leadership must pay heed to the people's desire that
Taiwan maintain the current status-quo with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Answering questions from the audience, Scalapino expressed his
belief that the United States should continue sticking to its "one

    <HEADLINE>'ONE CHINA' DISPUTE RESULTS FROM LACK OF MUTUAL TRUST: AIT HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Dallas,  April  1  (CNA)
(By Hui-Yen Chang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A lack of mutual trust is the key factor
behind the differences between Taiwan and mainland China on the
definition of the disputed "one China" principle, said the top US
liaison official with Taiwan on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Richard Bush, head of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT),
which represents US interests in lieu of official relations between
the two countries, said Taiwan and mainland China should try to seek
terms acceptable to both sides so as to restart bilateral talks. The
United States will not lean toward either side on this issue, he
noted.</P>
      <P>Commenting on mainland China's insistence that the "one China"
principle drafted by Beijing should be a precondition of reopening
bilateral talks and on Taiwan's stance that the "one China" framework
is only one issue which needs further discussion, Bush reiterated
that Washington acknowledges Beijing's "one China" position and that
Taiwan forms a part of China.</P>
      <P>Although the United States understands the reason behind the
differences between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland over the
definition of the "one China," the AIT chief said both sides should
try to find a way to mend their differences. "The United States will
not neither speak for nor seek to change either side," he asserted.</P>
      <P>It's better for Taiwan and the mainland to talk than not to talk,
Bush claimed, urging the two sides to find some sort of an agreement
to resolve their problems.</P>
      <P>The AIT chairman made the remarks while giving a speech on
post-election Taiwan-US relations at a seminar.</P>
      <P>Answering questions from the audience following the speech, Bush
stated that although the proposed "Taiwan Security Enhancement Act"
(TSEA) has a good name, the US administration does not think that the
bill will substantively help strengthen Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>Saying that passage of the TSEA will produce many problems and
will escalate tensions across the Taiwan Strait, he emphasized that
Taiwan's security relies primarily on the determination of its people
and the island's own military clout, followed by economic cooperation
between Taiwan and mainland China and a US supply of defensive
weapons.</P>
      <P>The TSEA, already overwhelmingly approved by the US House of
Representatives, still awaits passage by the US Senate.</P>
      <P>Bush, the top liaison official in charge of United States'
dealings with Taiwan, stressed that America will not do anything
which would hurt Taiwan and that the United States has made very
clear to the mainland that it will play a role should China launch a
military attack against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Citing remarks by US President Bill Clinton that Taiwan and
mainland China should resolve their disputes peacefully, Bush
repeated that Washington will not force Taiwan to conduct
negotiations with the mainland nor act as an intermediator between
the two sides.</P>
      <P>Considering the issue from a long-term prospective, Bush said,
Taiwan security will be better safeguarded if it settles its disputes
with the mainland. But he added that this does not mean that Taiwan
should fully give in to mainland China's terms, while the mainland
should also behave itself.</P>
      <P>According to the AIT chairman, the United States has repeatedly
urged the mainland China to explain the benefits of reunification to
the people of Taiwan, rather than deploying missiles aimed at Taiwan
or issuing sternly-worded statements to the island. Such conduct will
only increase fears and resentment among the Taiwan people toward
Beijing and damage bilateral links, he noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Maintaining good ties between the peoples
of Taiwan and the United States is more important than changing the
name of Taiwan's representation in America, said American Institute
in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman Richard Bush on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Bush said the AIT has maintained very good relations with
Taiwanese living across the United States and that is much more
important than changing the name of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Offices (TECO) scattered in this country.</P>
      <P>According to Bush, he had not previously heard a proposal that
the Taiwan representation's name be changed into "Taiwan Economic and
Cultural Office."</P>
      <P>The AIT chief made the remarks while answering questions on the
issue from W. C. Feng, representative of the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office in Houston. He flew here from Washington to give a
speech to a Taiwan-US association at the invitation of Feng.</P>
      <P>As to Taiwan's efforts to join the World Trade Organization
(WTO), the leading US representative official in dealings with Taiwan
said that the US' stance on this front is that Taiwan should be
admitted into the WTO if the island completes all necessary
preparations.</P>
      <P>While expressing his belief that Taiwan's WTO membership should
not be attached to other conditions, he acknowledged that other WTO
member states may have a different viewpoint.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S PCB MANUFACTURERS MOVE PRODUCTION ABROAD TO LOWER COSTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 3 (CNA)
(By Kevin F. and Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Among Taiwan's major electronics products,
PCBs (printed circuit boards) have been one of the leading foreign
exchange earners, but rising production costs and a growing local
environmental consciousness have led many PCB manufacturers to move
their production lines out of Taiwan, with many choosing mainland
China as their new site.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's electronics industry began producing PCBs in the 1970s,
and the island has become one of the world's leading sources of
supply. As a labor-intensive processing industry, the PCB sector
needs to either expand its production capacity or elevate its
production technology to lower production costs.</P>
      <P>Many of the medium and small-sized PCB factories in Taiwan,
because of limited research and development resources, tended to
lower their production costs mainly by boosting production capacity.
This expansion has inevitably led to overproduction and has caused
cut-throat competition. Since production costs in Taiwan are
comparatively higher than those in neighboring countries, Taiwan's
PCB manufacturers have sought to move their plants out of the
country.</P>
      <P>Another reason for these manufacturers moving production out of
Taiwan is a growing environmental consciousness among local people
who have begun to demand that waste water produced by PCB
manufacturers be properly processed.</P>
      <P>Because of the high costs of investing in environmental
protection facilities, many of Taiwan's PCB manufacturers have chosen
to move their production plants to countries with cheap labor and
lower production costs while keeping their R&amp;D and marketing
divisions in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Among the leading PCB manufacturers, Compeq Manufacturing Co.,
WU's Printed circuit Board Manufacturing Co., Chin-Poon Industrial
Co., Gold Circuit Electronics, Elite Material Co., Cadac Electronics
Co., Unicap Electronics Industrial Co., Wertex Precision Electronics
Co., Ya Hsin Industrial Co., Uniplus Electronics Co., and Csun
Manufacturing Ltd. have all set up plants in mainland China. The
mainland market has absorbed a considerable amount of these plants'
output.</P>
      <P>Southeast Asia is another choice for Taiwan's PCB manufacturers
wanting to move their production lines closer to the market. Qualitek
Electronics Co., for example, has invested NT$300 million in building
a PCB plant in Malaysia. The PCBs produced at that plant supply
telecommunications device manufacturers, including Motorola.</P>
      <P>At present, not every manufacturer that has moved their
production to mainland China is making profit, so they have applied
the same strategy of boosting production capacity in order to lower
production costs that they did in Taiwan years ago. This strategy
will likely be effective given the enormous potential of the mainland
market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US MISSILE SYSTEM CALLED `HIGH-TECH HAMMER FOR ROGUE FLEAS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  April  2  (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Canadian analyst on Sunday called US
plans to spend US$13 billion on an anti-missile system "a high-tech
hammer for a few rogue fleas."</P>
      <P>Eric Margolis, foreign editor for the Toronto Sun, said the
mushrooming folly called NMD, or National Missile Defense, makes
about as much strategic sense as building a second Maginot Line along
the Texas border to defend the US against invasion by Guatemala or El
Salvador.</P>
      <P>NMDs is to consist of 100 interceptor missiles and ground-based
radars, plus a constellation of space-based warning and targeting
satellites, he said.</P>
      <P>The program has powerful backers in Congress, the military, and
in industrial circles. America's NATO allies, the Persian Gulf
emirates, and Japan are being pressed to participate in this scaled
down version of the Star Wars program, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Canada, joined at the hip to the US through NORAD, the North
American Air Defense Command, is under particular pressure, he added.</P>
      <P>Margolis said NMD technology remains unproved, with only one
questionably successful test in a string of failures. But leaving
aside the difficulty of hitting an incoming warhead in space, what
makes this concept so harebrained is what military men call "threat
assessment."</P>
      <P>According to NMD proponents, "rogue states" - Iran, Iraq, Libya,
North Korea, Sudan, Afghanistan, and possibly Syria- may develop
long-range missiles (ICBMs) capable of hitting North America. With
the important exception of North Korea, such claims are preposterous
and comical, Margolis said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BUSINESS AND INDUSTRIAL SECTORS ATTACH HIGH EXPECTATIONS TO CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  3  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Most members of Taiwan's business and
industrial sectors have attached great expectations to
President-elect Chen Shui-bian and his potential for helping
accelerate the country's economic development after he is
inaugurated.</P>
      <P>Business and industrial sources said it is believed that Chen's
election as the new president of the Republic of China will help
expedite the implementation of major financial and industrial
policies and thus will be conducive to a positive and long-term
revitalization of the country's overall economy.</P>
      <P>The proposed high-speed railway plan and the recently-approved
"mini direct links" with mainland China are considered two
centerpieces of the new government scheduled to take office on May
20, the sources noted.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Shih-fang, president of Procomp Technology, said Chen's
election would have a "negative impact on the business and industrial
sectors in the short term but would become beneficial in the long
run."</P>
      <P>Hsieh estimated that Chen, from the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), will try his utmost to change the
stereotyped view of himself as an opposition leader after he takes
office.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said Chen will probably be low-key in his style as the head
of state, at least for the urgent purpose of easing cross-strait
tensions and for broadening his base of support.</P>
      <P>Universal Scientific Industrial Chairman H.P. Chang said he hopes
Chen will always put the nation's interests ahead of all other
considerations and always bear in mind the future of the people and
the country as well.</P>
      <P>For the sake of the sustainable development of science and
technology industries, which are now backbone of Taiwan's economic
growth, Chang said the new government should accelerate moves to
induce more talented Chinese from abroad to return to Taiwan to help
raise the island's competitiveness in world markets.</P>
      <P>An executive of Accton Technology urged Chen to put his high tech
policy promises introduced in his white paper into action. He noted
that one of Chen's promises included establishing a ministry of
science and technology under the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Science and Technology, if established, will not
only help Taiwan develop its high-tech and related industries, but
will also provide these industries with formal channels to
communicate with the government, the executive said.</P>
      <P>Voices from the petrochemical industry, meanwhile, expressed
concerns about the timetable for the implementation of the "mini
direct links" with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Noting that about 30 percent to 40 percent of all of Taiwan's
petrochemical products, including PVC, PP and PE products, have been
absorbed by mainland China over the past several years, leaders of
the petrochemical industry said direct shipping links between Taiwan
and mainland China are critically important for the survival and
sustainable development of this sector.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT TIES SAID BIGGEST CHALLENGE TO NEW ROC ADMINISTRATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  April  2  (CNA)
(By K. C. Huang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The biggest challenge President-elect
Chen Shui-bian's new administration faces will be the handling of
cross-Taiwan Strait relations, scholars from Taiwan and the United
States agreed in a seminar in New York on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-yen of the US-based Formosan Association for Public
Affairs stressed that Chen's major challenge will be how to ensure
freedom and democracy in Taiwan despite pressure from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that the future of Taiwan will be decided by the
people of Taiwan, and that it will be dangerous for the US to try to
force Chen to accept the "one China" principle espoused by the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Cheng F. Lee, financial expert and a professor at Rutgers State
University in New Jersey, said that Taiwan should not rashly lift its
present ban on the "three direct links" -- trade, post, and transport
-- with the mainland, saying the links should be established slowly
and with patience.</P>
      <P>He said the establishment of the "three links" will result in the
loss of more than half of Taiwan's foreign reserves, which stand at
more than NT$100 billion, adding that the amount of Taiwan's
investments on the mainland is already too much.</P>
      <P>Professor Kuo Chien-chung of Tamkang University noted that Chen,
although from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, has
sounded conciliatory notes since winning the March 18 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that after Chen's inauguration, more urgent questions
will be related to trade and investment with the mainland. These
include whether he will continue to follow the present "go slow, be
patient" policy toward investment on the mainland and also the
question of political and economic contacts with the mainland after
both Taipei and Beijing enter the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>Kuo also said that a credible triangular relation between the US,
mainland China, and Taiwan has to be established in order to
help improve cross-strait relations. He added that Chen should also
use all available channels to maintain contact with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Kao Ying-mao of Brown University suggested that both sides put
aside their dispute over the "one China" issue and focus on the
maintenance of prosperity and stability on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Kao said that it is important for the two sides to continue to
have dialogue and maintain contact and that talks should be "flexible
and serious." He also said that he was glad to see the DPP support
second track talks, even third track talks, to try to break the
cross-strait stalemate.</P>
      <P>Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation and Beijing's Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait are the two intermediary
bodies currently entrusted with conducting cross-strait talks. The
talks, however, were suspended after Beijing reacted furiously to
President Lee Teng-hui's redefinition of cross-strait ties as
"special state-to-state relations" in July 1999.</P>
      <P>Kao criticized mainland China's assessment and strategy
concerning the Taiwan issue, saying that Taiwan does not rule out
unification with the mainland. He also stated the direct links with
the mainland will only be achieved one step at a time.</P>
      <P>He also noted that leaders in Beijing do not feel there is an
urgent need for unification, but they do have to deal with pressure
from within.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan should adjust its traditional defense
strategy to one of "intimidation" and also make the development of
cruise missiles more of a priority, adding that Taiwan would also
have to declare that it would not use the weapons first.</P>
      <P>Kao also stressed that the US should not dance with Beijing's
"one China" principle and not let the mainland dictate what it wants
to do.</P>

      <P>Chiou I-jen, DPP representative to the US, made the remarks as he
prepared to wind up his visit to the United States, which took him to
Los Angeles, Washington D. C. and New York.</P>
      <P>But Chiou said that he does not know if the US will sell advanced
Aegis radar-equipped warships to Taiwan or about the situation
regarding the present ROC administration's military purchases from
the US.</P>
      <P>Chiou said the policy of the new administration of Chen Shui-bian
will be continuous and that Chen will honor any agreements reached by
the previous government.</P>
      <P>On reports in the New York Times that the mainland China is
considering a possible compromise, meaning that talks would take
place under the "one China" umbrella, but each side would define
"China" in its own way, Chiou said that the news has yet to be
confirmed.</P>
      <P>He also said that Chen's approach and statements since his
election victory have won a positive response from the US. But he
would not say that tensions don't exist across the Taiwan Strait now,
adding that Taiwan has made efforts to reduce tensions and that he
hopes the mainland will do the same.</P>
      <P>Chiou said that he met with lawmakers, officials, and members of
US think tanks during his visit. He stressed that this was a routine
visit, saying that he has come to the US seven times since assuming
the post of DPP representative to the US.</P>
      <P>Though Chiou has kept a low profile since his arrival on March
27, it is believed that he has carried messages from Chen and has
tried to establish communication channels between Chen and the US.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NOBEL LAUREATE'S CROSS-STRAIT AFFAIRS AD HOC GROUP BEGINS OPERATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  3  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The supra-party ad hoc committee on
cross-strait affairs chaired by Nobel laureate Lee Yuan-tseh convened
its inaugural meeting on Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee's group is expected to discuss the latest cross-strait
relations in the wake of Taiwan's presidential election and make its
initial analysis so as to provide President-elect Chen Shui-bian with
a clearer picture of the situation. Chen will then be able to refer
to this analysis in formulating his cross-strait policies, sources
closed to Lee said.</P>
      <P>In his speech marking the election, President-elect Chen said
that easing tension and seeking stable relations with mainland China
are the top priorities among all the policies of his new government.
Chen also said that he will push for direct trade, transport and
communications links with mainland China before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Lee's ad hoc committee is expected to be the major advisory body
to Chen on shaping Taiwan's cross-strait policies.</P>
      <P>Apparently poised to replace part of the functions of the
existing cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council and the
quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation, Lee's committee is
vitally important, particularly under Beijing's current insistence
that cross-strait dialogue be resumed only under the "one China"
prerequisite, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Lee, the Nobel Prize winner for chemistry in 1986, has declined
Chen's offer to head the new administration as premier and has said
that he would like to keep his status as "neutral" in his capacity as
president of Taiwan's highest research institute, Academia Sinica.
However, he indeed promised Chen that he would contribute his wisdom
and time to help solve cross-strait problems.</P>
      <P>However, as of Monday, the ad hoc cross-strait committee was not
fully organized yet as formal membership and their job descriptions
had yet to be settled, the sources said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>8.4 MILLION CC OF DONATED BLOOD DISCARDED ANNUALLY DUE TO FAT LEVELS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Doctors on Monday warned Taiwan's potential
blood donors not to eat too much fat in their daily diets, otherwise
they may easily be disqualified from donating, sources from the
Chinese Blood Services Foundation said.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Chinese Blood Services Foundation, which runs
the only official blood bank in Taiwan, said because donated blood is
sometimes found to be "too fatty," the foundation must throw out an
average of 8.4 million cc of donated blood every year.</P>
      <P>The figure is equivalent to the donations of some 30,000 people
who donated their blood in vain because the blood extracted from
their veins was unusable, Foundation officials said.</P>
      <P>Doctors suggested that when planning to donate blood, potential
donors should consume less food containing high fat levels for one to
two weeks before giving blood.</P>
      <P>The foundation's analysis also found that blood containing high
levels of lipids, a group of organic compounds that includes fats,
oils, waxes, sterols and triglycerides, tends to appear in blood
donated by male donors.</P>
      <P>This hyperlipoproteinemic blood also tends to appear during
wintertime. The analysts believe that the Taiwanese' habit of eating
rich foods during the winter season is the major reason for the
"fatty" blood.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the blood foundation called for potential blood
donors not to make the donations if they were not healthy enough. It
said people should refrain from donating blood if they have had their
teeth removed within the previous 72 hours, and should never donate
if they have heart disease, hypertension, asthma and even influenza.</P>
      <P>Alcoholics, drug abusers, syphilis patients, HIV carriers and
AIDS patients are of course definitely prohibited from making such
donations, foundation officials assured.</P>

      <P>Tang, a senior member of the current ruling Kuomintang (KMT), has

    <HEADLINE>DPP MAY NOT RULE OUT 'ONE CHINA' PRINCIPLE: PARTY CADRE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  3  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
needs to understand the content of Beijing's "one China" principle
before considering to reopen talks with the mainland under the
current framework, a ranking DPP official said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Bi-khim, director of the DPP's International Affairs
Department, said the DPP may not rule out the possibility of
accepting Beijing's demands to rekindle talks under the "one China
principle," but added that it first must gain a deeper understanding
of the "one China" framework drafted by Beijing.</P>
      <P>Hsiao made the remarks in response to recent media reports that
mainland China is willing to reopen negotiations with Taiwan if
Taiwan accepts the "one China" principle agreed upon by both sides in
1992 -- there is only "one China" in the world, but the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait can have its own interpretation of the meaning of
the term.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the reports about Beijing's stance were very
encouraging to the DPP, she said the top priority for Taiwan and
mainland China at present is to build mutual trust and strengthen
bilateral communication in order to lay a sound foundation for future
exchanges.</P>
      <P>The DPP will become Taiwan's ruling party after President-elect
Chen Shui-bian is inaugurated as the Republic of China's tenth
president on May 20.</P>
      <P>Chen's victory in the March 18 presidential election brought an
end to the Kuomintang's five-decade long rule in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Echoing remarks made by Chen, Hsiao went on to say that the DPP
views the "one China" principle as an issue which requires further
discussion by both sides to see whether it would produce any benefit
for people on the two sides across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Hsiao also expressed the hope that both Taiwan and mainland China
can be more flexible in exchanging opinions so as to find common
ground to compromise and conciliate.</P>
      <P>Turning to the "special state-to-state relationship" theory aired
by President Lee Teng-hui in July 1999 to describe the links between
the two sides, Hsiao reiterated that the theory is just a description
of the current status-quo between Taiwan and mainland China and that
the DPP will not amend the Constitution to include it.</P>
      <P>American Institute in Taiwan Chairman Richard Bush, the leading
US liaison official in charge of the United States' dealings with
Taiwan, also suggested at a Saturday seminar in Dallas that both
Taiwan and the mainland should try to find new terms acceptable to
both in order to serve as a foundation to restart bilateral talks.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China's exports of hi-tech
products between 1990 and 1999 showed an increase of more than 50
percent, according to a report revealed Monday by the Board of
Foreign Trade (BOFT) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>The report on research and analysis on trade development in
Taiwan during the ten-year period was made by Prof. Chen Po-chih of
National Taiwan University at the request from the BOFT.</P>
      <P>The study found that:</P>
      <P>--The proportion of labor-intensive export products decreased
from 41 percent in 1990 to 35 percent in 1999.</P>
      <P>--The ratio of capital-intensive export products increased from
51 percent to 64 percent during the ten-year period.</P>
      <P>--The proportion of technology-intensive products increased from
27 percent of exports in 1990 to 42 percent of 1999's total.</P>
      <P>Chen Ching-ho, an official of the BOFT, pointed out that the
study shows that the structure of the ROC's export industry is
developing toward an increased emphasis on less labor intensive, more
capital-intensive and hi-tech products.</P>
      <P>At the same time, he said, the quality of human resources has
also shown a marked increase as employees with college educations and
higher levels of education have increased from 16 percent of Taiwan's

      <P>Their hour-long talks focused on post-earthquake reconstruction

      <P>She stressed that well-trained talent is the hope of society, and
that the country's hopes rest on education. Therefore, priority must

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  3 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's top negotiator with Taiwan will
not attend the inauguration of the Republic of China's
President-elect Chen Shui-bian on May 20, the Hong Kong-based Wen Hui
Pao daily quoted a mainland Chinese official as reporting Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen said after his victory in the March 18 presidential election
that it would be conducive to the development of cross-strait
relations if Wang Daohan, chairman of mainland China's Association
for Relations Across Taiwan Strait, were to come to Taiwan on May 20
to attend his inauguration.</P>
      <P>The mainland Chinese official said that no matter what national
name Taiwan uses during the inaugural ceremony, "We will not attend."</P>
      <P>The official indicated that Chen has not yet definitely
recognized the one-China principle and that the Democratic
Progressive Party that Chen belongs to has not yet abandoned its
Taiwan-independence platform. These are the main factors that hinder
the resumption of cross-strait talks on the unification of China, he
said.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait must engage
in exchanges under the one-China principle.</P>
      <P>Chen has extended an olive branch to Beijing by nominating the
caretaker Kuomintang government's Defense Minister Tang Fei as the
head of the new cabinet. The move is also seen as an effort to
alleviate fears of Taiwan's population that Beijing would stage a
military attack due to Chen's past support of Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>However, Chen recently remarked that "one-China" should be a
subject to be discussed with Beijing, not a prerequisite to a renewed
dialogue. His remark is seen as complicating efforts to break the
impasse between Taipei and Beijing over the resumption of talks on
unification.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Estrada administration has reassured
Mindanao residents that will continue to pursue the peace process
with rebel groups such as the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).</P>
      <P>Presidential Peace Process Adviser Manuel Yan said that the
government is now paving the way for the resumption of formal talks
with the MILF scheduled for May 2. "We are going on as scheduled. The
technical working group is meeting," Yan said in a radio interview.</P>
      <P>He added that the recent skirmishes between MILF and government
troops have not been a deterrent to the peace process, which
President Joseph Ejercito Estrada wants completed before the end of
the year. "We are still going on with the peace talks," Yan said.</P>
      <P>Last Thursday, Estrada told reporters in Tacloban City that
he is confident that the government can reach a peace accord with the
MILF within the year.</P>
      <P>Mr. Estrada added that he had received a message from MILF
Chairman Hashim Salamat which said that he wants to develop Mindanao
while the government and MILF discuss peace. "We will continue with
the peace process and advance the development of Mindanao with the
MILF," Estrada said.</P>
      <P>The President noted that this has given him added inspiration to
ignore his critics' brickbats, and concentrate instead on developing
Mindanao into the country's next food basket.</P>
      <P>According to the President, he is now waiting for Salamat's
formal word that the MILF would join hands with the government in
developing Mindanao. Earlier, the President received a similar
commitment from Salamat that said the MILF will cooperate with the
government's ongoing programs to develop Mindanao.</P>
      <P>Mr. Estrada said his administration is likely to line up programs
such as infrastructure for irrigation projects, schoolrooms and
hospitals.</P>
      <P>Once these programs are completed, Mr. Estrada said, investors
are expected to go to Mindanao and generate jobs for the residents
there. Such a development, he pointed out, would complement ongoing
government efforts to transform Mindanao into the nation's food
basket through integrated plans for agricultural modernization.</P>

expected fail to reach the industry's original target of 5.5 million
tons because of flooding and large scale damage caused by Cyclone
Steve. However, its exports to Taiwan and other countries will not be

production this year will reach about 5 million tons, up from 4.9
million tons in 1999.</P>
      <P>Australia's sugar producers this year are facing a slump in world
sugar prices, which have tumbled to a 14-year low, a situation which
is expected to remain throughout this year, White said.</P>
      <P>He said exports to major Australian markets will not be affected
by the shortfall in production. Indeed, there will be increases to
some markets, including the Middle East.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is considered a large potential market and Australia wants
to increase its shipments to the island due to the strength of
Taiwan's purchasing power, a spokeswoman said. In 1999, Australia
exported about US$10 million worth of sugar to Taiwan, down from
US$13 million in 1998.</P>
      <P>Australia exports about 80 percent of its sugar production and

    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  April 3 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Calling Taiwan independence a "road to
nowhere", Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa urged Taiwan's
leader on Sunday to open negotiations with mainland China on peaceful
unification with the theory of "one China" as a principle.</P>
      <P>Speaking to leaders of Chinese community in Toronto during a trip
to Canada, the head of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
under The People's Republic of China strayed from his prepared speech
to comment on Taiwan's dispute with mainland China. The cross-strait
controversy flared anew recently after a candidate from a
pro-independence party was elected president in Taiwan on March 18.</P>
      <P>"As the chief executive of Hong Kong, I should devote my energy
to my job. But as a Chinese person, I cannot help be concerned with
the future of Taiwan and Chinese reunification, as are all my fellow
countrymen," said Tung who has rarely stepped into the thorny
controversy between Taiwan and mainland China since he took the helm
in Hong Kong in 1997.</P>
      <P>"It is the common hope of all Chinese that their country will be
reunified as soon as possible. I believe it is a wish harbored by all
Chinese. Taiwan independence is a road that would lead to nowhere but
war," he said.</P>
      <P>"No one would like war - a peaceful reunification is the right
way to go. I heartily hope Taiwan's leaders will realize this, and
come to terms with reality as early as possible. Anything could be
raised for discussion with Beijing if only Taiwan admits there is one
China," he added.</P>
      <P>"As for Hong Kong, I think it is my duty to fully carry out the
'one country, two systems' formula that Beijing devised for national
reunification, and make Hong Kong an example to convince Taiwan that
this formula does work," said Tung.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong leader brushed aside earlier reports that Taiwan
might fire missiles at Hong Kong in retaliation for a Beijing missile
attack against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I think there is no question of Taiwan's missile attacks against
Hong Kong. This report was ascribed to Liu Tai-ying, chairman of the
Business Management Committee under Taiwan's Kuomintang, who made
these irresponsible remarks while visiting Thailand late last year,"
he said.</P>
      <P>He also played down the possible ill effects on Hong Kong of
Taiwan's proposed direct trade links between its offshore islands and
mainland China, saying that many mainland ports have long opened
direct trade links with foreign countries, and that Hong Kong has not
been the gateway to China for a long time.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has thus far banned direct trade and transportation with
mainland China. Transportation of goods and personnel between the two
sides are made through Hong Kong.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MANILA OFFICIAL DENIES RUMORS OF UPCOMING CHEN VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila  April  03  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Philippines will not play host to
Taiwanese President-elect Chen Shui-bian before he takes the oath of
office on May 20, Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon Jr. said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Earlier, a foreign affairs official who requested anonymity
claimed that there were groups in the Philippines who were rushing to
prepare for a Chen visit before his inaugural, as Chen is still
legally a private citizen, and could be allowed to enter the country.</P>
      <P>Siazon said the decision to not host Chen would prevent any
damage that a Chen visit would cause Manila's relations with Beijing.
The Philippines adheres to a one-China policy and thus Taiwanese
leaders are not granted visas to enter the country.</P>
      <P>The secretary said that Beijing's Ambassador Fu Ying requested
the Philippines to refuse to allow any visit by Chen.</P>
      <P>"They just want us to keep out of the issue between China and
Taiwan. I understand that we want to have a positive contribution to
cross strait relations because we will be affected if they get worse.
We don't want to aggravate the situation," Siazon stressed.</P>
      <P>Siazon said Beijing merely wanted to guard against a Chen visit
to the country, despite denials from Chinese businessmen and the
Taiwanese carrier Eva Airways that any such plan existed.</P>
      <P>"He's a president-elect and our role here is to contribute in
calming and improving the situation the Taiwan Strait. We don't want
to be players in the domestic internal problems between China and
Taiwan," Siazon said.</P>
      <P>The secretary said the country already has enough domestic
problems, and doesn't need to add to them by hosting Chen.</P>
      <P>Siazon also said Chen is hardly a private citizen even if he has
yet to take his oath, since he is a president-elect.</P>
      <P>Chen, who ran as head of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party, was elected president in an upset on March 18.</P>
      <P>Foreign affairs officials said soon after Chen's election,
Beijing summoned the Philippines Ambassador to China, Romualdo Ong,
while Beijing Embassy charge d'affaires Sun Heping called on the
authorities in Manila.</P>
      <P>Both meetings were reportedly for the purpose of relaying
mainland China's policies, which included its opposition to a Chen
visit to Manila. Beijing also requested the Manila government to
refrain from sending any congratulatory messages to the new
administration, and to refrain from sending a representative to
attend Chen's presidential inauguration in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Beijing is extremely suspicious of Chen because his party
supports independence for Taiwan, a move that mainland China has
warned would lead to war. The two sides of the Taiwan Strait split
after a civil war in 1949, and mainland China has repeatedly
threatened use force to affect a reunification.</P>
      <P>Chen is a former Taipei Mayor who lost office to a Nationalist
Party challenger in 1998. He is untested in the international arena
where he will face growing pressure to negotiate with Beijing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN NOT FAIRLY TREATED SAYS ROC REPRESENTATIVE TO US</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York, April 3 (CNA)
(By K. C. Huang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's representative to
the United States said that "there is a kind of unfairness" in the
treatment Taiwan receives even though it is "a model student for
freedom, democracy and a market economy."</P>
      <P>Stephen Chen, the director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Representative Office, made the remarks in an interview published in
the New York Times on Monday.</P>
      <P>"We don't mind if the United States has rapprochement with
mainland China -- we think it's good to bring the PRC into the
family of civilization," said Chen.</P>
      <P>But the 66-year-old diplomat said what "we ask is that the
interests of Taiwan not be sacrificed."</P>
      <P>The report said that Chen represents the interests of 22 million
of the freest and richest people in Asia, but as the US maintains no
diplomatic relations with Taiwan and has recognized the Beijing
government as the sole representative of the people of China, Chen
and his staff of nearly 200 are barred from the premises of the State
Department.</P>
      <P>They are also not invited to White House parties, and meetings
between them and US government officials often take place in hotel
coffee shops, or as Chen put it, "in a neutral setting."</P>
      <P>The New York Times story described Stephen Chen as "at an embassy
that is not an embassy, an ambassador who is not an ambassador and
who can only imagine what it is like to be a full-fledged member of
Washington's diplomatic corps."</P>
      <P>Chen said he has been snubbed because of America's "obvious
effort to appease Beijing," the paper reported.</P>
      <P>The paper gave a brief introduction to Chen's career life and his
work after the US severed diplomatic ties with the ROC in 1979.</P>
      <P>The report said that since Washington switched diplomatic
recognition to Beijing, Taiwanese diplomats have learned how to be
innovative, especially in Washington, where they "employ some of the
city's most powerful lobbyists and retain close ties to many
prominent conservative members of Congress."</P>
      <P>Chen said his office has an annual lobbying budget of about
US$1.2 million and contracts with 15 firms, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Chen has been a frequent visitor to Capitol Hill in recent weeks
as Taiwan seeks congressional approval for the sale of a list of
sophisticated weapons, said the report.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN AS PRIME DESTINATION FOR MACAU STUDENTS MAY BE CHALLENGED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Macau,  April  4  (CNA)
(By C. H. Jen and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has always been the favorite
destination for Macau high school students in pursuit of a higher
education overseas, but whether this trend will continue remains to
be seen.</P>
      <P>Over the past decade, the number of Macau students taking part in
exams to enter Taiwan college and university has continued to rise.
The number who took the examination last year totaled 663, up from
only 181 in 1990.</P>
      <P>One noteworthy phenomenon during that period was that despite the
fact that it was generally believed that most Macau students would
avoid coming to Taiwan in 1997 because of the sensitive nature of the
political climate due to the return of Hong Kong to mainland Chinese
rule, 468 students still took the entrance examination in that year.
The number rose to 539 in 1998.</P>
      <P>The number further rose to a new high of 663 in 1999 even though
Macau was returned to mainland Chinese rule that year, demonstrating
that Macau students would not let a changed political environment
affect their plans for an advanced education in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Analysts said the continued flow of Macau students to the
Republic of China has been due to several reasons, including the fact
that studying in Taiwan is cheap, Macau is geographically close to
Taiwan, and Taiwan openly welcomes overseas students.</P>
      <P>Another important reason is the fact that after their return to
Macau, graduates of Taiwanese universities and colleges usually enjoy
very promising career prospects. Official estimates put the number of
Macau students that have studied in Taiwan at between 2,000 and
3,000, with most of them now serving in major positions in Macau.</P>
      <P>The opening up of mainland China in recent years however has
begun to affect Taiwan's dominance in this area as more and more
students from Macau are choosing to study there instead.</P>
      <P>A Macau official in charge of handling student entrance
examinations recently noted that he is not ruling out that perhaps
the unique political situation in Macau, along with mainland China's
threats against Taiwan prior to March 18 presidential election, may
have led some Macau parents to be reluctant about sending their
children to study in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He added that these parents' misgivings may have further
increased when Chen Shui-bian of Taiwan's pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party won the March 18 presidential election in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Whether there will be any major changes in the number of Macau
students coming to Taiwan for advanced studies remains to be seen, he
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is scheduled to accept registration for Macau students
between April 10 and 15 and will hold entrance examinations on June 3
and 4.</P>

members of think tanks to collect their views for reference in the

      <P>On media reports that he may serve as the secretary-general of
National Security Council, Chiou only said that he hopes the present

    <DATELINE>Berlin,  April  3  (CNA)
(By James Kuo and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>European researchers are concerned about
the situation across the Taiwan Strait and widely believe that ties
between Taiwan and mainland China have reached a critical stage to
choose between war and peace, an ROC envoy said here on Monday.</P>
      <P>Lu I-cheng, an ambassador-at-large of the Republic of China, said
that this widely held belief of European experts on the current
cross-strait situation represents a marked difference from the
general feeling of the Taiwan population, who he said appear to
remain defiant despite mainland China's sternly worded verbal attacks
prior to the country's March 18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lu, who is currently on a European tour to introduce Taiwan's
development, told CNA that most European political analysts and media
organizations seem to assume that the election of Chen Shui-bian,
candidate of the pro-Taiwan independence Democratic Progressive
Party, has led Taiwan-mainland relations to a critical point -- war
or peace.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that his current European trip had been planned
before the presidential election, the ROC envoy said he has been
asked about the election result at every stop he has made.</P>
      <P>However, he admitted that European researchers have a better
understanding of Taiwan than he had thought, which is an indication
that Taiwan's pragmatic diplomacy has borne fruit.</P>
      <P>As to the question of why the people of Taiwan can remain so
defiant in the face of fierce pressure from Beijing, Lu attributed
the phenomenon partly to Taiwan leaders' fullness of understanding
about the interactions between Taiwan and mainland China, and partly
to a lack of understanding on the same issue among the Taiwan
population.</P>
      <P>But the ROC envoy said he agrees with the view that there is no
danger of war at present between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Lu, who has already visited Britain and France, is slated to
proceed to Brussels on Wednesday, where he will call at the

    <HEADLINE>TANG FEI MEETS WITH TOP KMT OFFICIAL TO DISCUSS PARTY'S DECISION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  4 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Defense Minister Tang Fei paid a visit on
Tuesday to Liu Chao-shiuan, the deputy convener of the outgoing
Kuomintang's (KMT) reform committee, to discuss the party's intention
behind its decision on his prospective acceptance of the premiership
of the new Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The KMT reportedly has decided to allow Tang to accept as an
individual the premiership offered by President-elect Chen Shui-bian,
but only after Tang files for a suspension of both his party
membership and his right to participate the party's activities.</P>
      <P>Since Tang has to date not received any formal notice about the
matter, he went to the Executive Yuan to meet Liu, who is also the
vice premier, to gain a more thorough understanding of the KMT's
inclinations and its final decision.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Lin Fong-cheng was reported Monday as
having said that the KMT would allow Tang as an individual to form a
Cabinet for Chen's new government. "As soon as Tang and Chen have
talked the issue over and submitted an application to KMT Acting
Chairman Lien Chan for approval, the KMT will make an announcement
upon the matter," Lin said.</P>
      <P>However, the KMT will neither endorse Tang's administration nor
be responsible for it, Lin stressed.</P>
      <P>Tang stayed in the Executive Yuan for an hour before leaving.
After returning to the defense ministry complex, Tang and his staff
discussed the timing and procedures for declaring to the KMT Central
Committee that he has accepted President-elect Chen's offer as
premier and is applying for a suspension of the his party membership
as well as the participation in any KMT activities.</P>
      <P>Tang will meet with Chen in the near future to discuss matters
pertaining to the rights of the formation of a new Cabinet and the
nomination of its members, according to informed sources.</P>
      <P>Tang was offered the premiership by Chen last Wednesday but
insisted that he would accept the offer only after the approval of
the KMT.</P>
      <P>Since the KMT has indicated that the party has agreed in
principle to Tang's taking the post as premiership, the issue is seen
as being likely to have a happy ending.</P>
      <P>The KMT secretary-general was reported as saying that the
nation's interests are ahead of the interests of the party and that
the KMT is pleased to see its members make contribution to the

    <HEADLINE>ROC EXPANDING AGRO-TECH AID TO PANAMA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Panama  City,  April  3  (CNA)
(By H.T. Chung and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's plans to
extend agricultural technology aid to Panama will remain unchanged
after the new ROC president and his administration take office on May
20, an ROC official stationed in Panama said on Monday.</P>
      <P>In fact, Taiwan is increasing budget allocations to Panama to
expand the scope of its agricultural technological assistance to the
Central American country, said Li Hsieh-pei, chief of the ROC
agricultural mission in Panama.</P>
      <P>In the aid expansion, an extra budget of US$1.5 million will be
allocated to the mission, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Of the budget, US$400,000 will be used on a milk fish aquaculture
plan to be initiated in Gatun Lake in central Panama. If the plan
proves workable, and it is shown that the fish farm doesn't cause
biological imbalance and pollution in the lake, further investment
will be made, said Lee.</P>
      <P>Another US$300,000 will be used to finance the development of 30
cooperative farms around Panama, which will be part of a "Poverty
termination" project initiated by Panamanian President Mireya
Moscoso.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan mission will not only put up the cash to help develop
the farms, Lee said, it will also have its own technicians assist
with the development, helping the Panamanian farmers to gain their
own expertise and experience in agriculture.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taiwan mission is also helping Panamanian farmers
in Los Santos in central Panama to improve their tomato crops. By
applying advanced genetic techniques, rather than using fertilizer
and pesticide chemicals, the Taiwan mission is helping the
Panamanians to grow better tomatoes, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan mission is currently also working in El Valle, helping
local farmers grow environmentally-friendly and chemical-free organic
vegetables; in Veraguas, helping fishermen gain harvest from the
ocean; and in both areas, helping farmers with rotation farming
techniques to grow fruits while letting the farmlands lie fallow, Lee
noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN TO RELY ON NEW AD HOC GROUP'S ADVICE FOR HIS INAUGURATION SPEECH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  4  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President-elect Chen Shui-bian said on
Tuesday that he would rely heavily on the consensus expected to be
reached by the recently-created ad hoc committee on cross-strait
affairs as basis to formulate his inauguration speech.</P>
      <P>Chen said it is expected that the supra-party cross-strait
affairs ad hoc committee chaired by Nobel laureate Lee Yuan-tseh will
reach a consensus on Taiwan's latest cross-strait policy within a
month. The consensus would be seen as the common thought of the
general population, the government and the opposition parties in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that cross-strait relations is one of the most
challenging tasks to his new administration, and added, "We should
give Lee more time and more room to elaborate on the issue."</P>
      <P>Chen said he hopes that through Lee's ad hoc group, which will be
a high-performance think tank manned by 15 to 20 China scholars and
strategists, his cross-strait policies will be shaped and made public
when he delivers his inaugural speech on May 20.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee, the Nobel Prize winner for chemistry in 1986,
stressed that the supra-party ad hoc committee on cross-strait
affairs is a private unofficial mechanism organized to offer opinions
and suggestions on cross-strait issues to the president.</P>
      <P>The president-elect's top private consultant said top goal of his
ad hoc committee is to come up with ideas which will help break the
cross-strait impasse and begin a new era in cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Lee, who declined Chen's offer to be premier and insisted on
continuing at his post as president of Taiwan's highest research
institute, Academia Sinica, said as a top advisor of the president on
cross-strait relations, he will "do his utmost -- whenever and
whatever is needed."</P>
      <P>Lee noted that if necessary, he would like to travel to the
mainland, in his capacity as Chen's private adviser, to meet mainland
Chinese leaders for talks.</P>

      <P>The world's air safety record improved in
1999 despite some major crashes which included the Egypt Air flight
that went down Oct. 31 off the coast of Massachusetts, killing 217
people on board, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
reported Monday.</P>
      <P>The Montreal-based organization said that 20 airplane accidents
with passenger fatalities occurred worldwide during last year,
killing a total of 492 passengers. The year 1998 saw the same number
of accidents, but with a total of 905 fatalities.</P>
      <P>The number of air passengers on scheduled services exceeded 1.5
billion worldwide in 1999. The ratio of passenger fatalities per 100

from 0.035 in 1998.</P>
      <P>On non-scheduled air services, made up mainly of charter flights,
there were 24 airplane accidents involving deaths. These accounted
for 142 fatalities, compared with 210 deaths in 25 accidents in 1998.</P>
      <P>The airplane accident statistics excluded light aircraft that
carry one to seven people.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, there were six illegal incidents in 1999 involving

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  4 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia will increase its immigration
intake level by nearly 10 percent in fiscal year 2000-01, boosting
the number to 76,000 from the current level of 70,000 in a bid to
meet the growing demand for skilled workers throughout the country as
a result of a strong economy.</P>
      <P>In a statement faxed to the CNA on Tuesday, Immigration Minister
Philip Ruddock said the 76,000 places will include an increase of
5,000 spots in the Skill Stream.</P>
      <P>"The further shift in the balance of the program towards the
Skill Stream will deliver additional economic, budgetary and
employment benefits, particularly given the skill shortages that have
emerged in the Australian economy," he said.</P>
      <P>He added that the increase in the number of places in the Skill
Stream has become possible because of the success of the new points
test in attracting young immigrants with strong English language
skills and qualifications in high demand occupations such as IT and
accounting.</P>
      <P>To increase the attraction of Australia to skilled labor, Ruddock
mentioned the government will also allow a small increase in the
intake level of family members, with the number rising to 34,400 from
the present level of 32,000 between July 1, 2000 and June 30, 20001.</P>
      <P>In addition to the overall intake level of 76,000, the Australian
government will also reserve 12,000 spots a year for people seeking
entry based on humanitarian reasons, representing no change from the
current level.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLINTON NOTES EVEN ROC PRESIDENT WANTS MAINLAND CHINA IN WTO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Apr. 3 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While pressing the US Congress to grant
Communist China permanent normal trade relations status, President
Bill Clinton emphasized Monday that even Taiwan's newly elected
leader Chen Shui-bian wants to see mainland China in the World Trade
Organization.</P>
      <P>Rep. Dick Armey (R-Texas), the House majority leader, meanwhile,
told reporters that the House of Representatives will vote before May
29 on the historic US trade agreement with China, saying "I want it
done as quickly as possible, by the end of May at the very latest."</P>
      <P>In an address to the Democratic Leadership Council in San Jose,
California, Clinton said it is quite significant that the people with
the greatest interest in seeing mainland China change agree with his
administration's efforts to bring China into the world trading
system.</P>
      <P>"The citizens of Taiwan, despite all their tensions with Beijing,
by and large want to see China in the WTO. And so does Taiwan's newly
elected leader. It's a very important point," noted the president.</P>
      <P>Clinton also announced that the chief executive officers of over
200 high-tech firms and more than 40 governors from across the United
States and its territories have sent letters to senators and members
of Congress urging them to grant China permanent normal trade
relations status in order to maintain economic growth and prosperity
for high-tech companies as well as families in their states and
territories.</P>
      <P>The president reiterated his stand that opening mainland China to
the internet and other aspects of free trade will liberalize its
society and ease the grip of the Chinese Communist Party. He also
warned that voting down the trade bill will cost the United States
both in terms of trade and in its ability to influence Chinese
policy.</P>
      <P>"The main consequence of this will be to hurt America
economically and to dramatically strain our relations with China at a
time when we need to maintain a positive ability to impact their
conduct," stressed Clinton.</P>
      <P>Republican leaders have said previously that they would only
schedule a vote once President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore had
rounded up 90 to 100 Democratic votes to ensure House passage of the
PRC-WTO agreement.</P>
      <P>White House officials said they were confident enough that
Democrats would support the US trade agreement with China to ensure
passage. But Armey said that "we'll all have to redouble our efforts.
The Senate is clearly committed. The problem is in the House."</P>
      <P>Rep. David Bonior (D-Mich.), the House minority leader, estimated
last week that at least 135 of the 211 Democrats in the House opposed
the legislation.</P>
      <P>And 25 of the Democratic opponents, including Bonior himself and
the only Taiwan-born congressman David Wu from Oregon, urged
President Clinton in a March 31 letter to oppose granting China
permanent normal trade status until there is visible progress in such
areas as human rights, environmental protection, and the transfer of
missile and nuclear technology to countries the US considers rogue
states, such as North Korea, Iran and Iraq.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXPERT SAYS BEIJING'S WAIT-AND-SEE APPROACH BODES ILL FOR TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 4 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's wait-and-see approach toward
Taiwan since the island's election of a president who is a member of
the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) bodes ill for
Taiwan over the long term, said a Chinese affairs expert here on
Monday.</P>
      <P>Bates Gill, a researcher at the Brookings Institution, told a
symposium organized by Washington-based think tank The Heritage
Foundation that Beijing is closely monitoring Taiwan President-elect
Chen Shui-bian's words and deeds. He said that they are awaiting a
positive sign, hopefully from Chen's inaugural speech when he is
sworn in on May 20.</P>
      <P>Another reason behind Beijing's foot-dragging on issuing an
official response to the election of Taiwan's new president is the
current debate in the US Congress over granting permanent normal
trade relations (NTR) status with the US to the mainland. A vote on
the issue is scheduled in May.</P>
      <P>Beijing would rather wait until its NTR status has been granted
before resuming a heavy-handed approach toward Taiwan, said Gill.</P>
      <P>The looming power struggle in the run-up to the scheduled
reshuffling of Beijing's ruling team in 2002 is further prompting
leaders there to get tough with Taiwan as a way to boost their
position within the Chinese Communist Party, Gill added.</P>
      <P>Unless both sides of the Taiwan Strait are willing to be more
flexible in defining their "one China" policy, any dialogue between
them would be scuttled by deep-rooted discrepancies, said Gill.</P>
      <P>Tien Hung-mao, director of the Institute for National Policy
Research in Taipei, told the forum that Chen has already sharply
compromised his pro-independence stance because of Beijing's fierce
hostility toward an official independence declaration.</P>
      <P>However, Chen is not ready to accept Beijing's "one China policy"
which runs head-on against his long-standing preference for an
independent Taiwan, said Tien. The conflict has deepened since
Beijing's Taiwan policy shifted from a "blockade of Taiwan
independence" to "pressing for national reunification", and talks
with Beijing under Beijing's terms is nothing less than capitulation,
said Tien.</P>
      <P>Tien urged Beijing to mitigate its stance or the policy will
backfire, as Taiwan's public think that Chen has already conceded too
much to Beijing.</P>

      <P>Philippine President Joseph Ejercito
Estrada called Tuesday on scientists based at the International Rice
Research Institute (IRRI) to help resolve the problems of poverty and
food security in the Philippines and the rest of Asia.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the 40th anniversary of the IRRI held at the Heroes
Hall of Malacanang, the Chief Executive said that without science
finding new ways to increase food production, the gap between the
rich and poor of this world will remain well into the millennium.</P>
      <P>He noted that the onset of the 21st century presents enormous
challenges such as poverty, hunger, environmental distress and
population growth which continue to put pressure on food supplies
everywhere.</P>
      <P>Rice research is one of the few hopes that the Philippines has to
overcome these challenges, the President said, as he stressed that
the country is fortunate to have "IRRI here with us."</P>
      <P>The IRRI is an autonomous, non-profit agricultural research and

    <HEADLINE>WEI JINSHENG WARNS OF BEIJING ATTACK IF TAIWAN DECLARES INDEPENDENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  April 3 (CNA)
(By M.J. Tsou and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Top mainland Chinese democracy activist Wei
Jinsheng on Monday warned of genuine military actions to be taken by
mainland China in the face of Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Wei, now living in exile, told a French weekly that according to
reliable sources from mainland China, the Chinese communists have
actively geared up preparations for military, political and
diplomatic moves against Taiwan after Chen Shui-bian, candidate of
the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, was elected
president of Taiwan on March 18.</P>
      <P>"The communist Chinese are preparing a sweeping military action
against Taiwan any minute when Taiwan declares independence," Wei
said in an interview with the New Observer (Nouvel Observateur).</P>
      <P>Wei noted that unless the international community stands out in
opposition, Beijing is likely to jump the gun and launch an assault
across the strait.</P>
      <P>Wei said he is in firm opposition to Beijing using force to bring
Taiwan under its control, and he would call for an international
convention if Beijing indeed launches a military assault against
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wei called for Taiwan to discard the idea of
independence. For one reason, Beijing would not sit idly by towards
Taiwan's declaration of independence, and for another, independence
is not necessary as democratization is a road that mainland China is
certain to walk on soon, he said. He added that after mainland China
has been democratized, Taiwan would find reunification with the
mainland easier.</P>
      <P>Wei stressed that Taiwan is asking for a war if it declares
independence.</P>
      <P>Wei also lambasted France's promotion of "useful dialogue
diplomacy" with Beijing as a means to maintain cordial relations with
mainland China, saying that the French government has been used by
Beijing as one of its major diplomatic blue chips for political gains
in the international community.</P>
      <P>Wei, who maintains close watch on domestic affairs in mainland
China despite living in exile, said he has been in constant worry
that human rights abuses have gotten only worse and worse on the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Excessive prostitution, increasing numbers of labor strikes, a
skyrocketing suicide rate, frequent reports of employees murdering
their employers and some 30 million jobless people wandering from
city to city around the mainland are only part of the picture of
today's China, Wei said.</P>
      <P>Beijing's strangling human rights policy on the mainland has been
increasingly tightened, encouraged by the Western governments'
weakness and timidity, Wei pointed out.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CAUTIONS AGAINST APPLES FROM WASHINGTON STATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  4  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Lilian wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An environmental protection group in
the United States has cautioned importers of apples from Washington
State to be on guard against pesticides.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Working Group (EWG) said tests on apples from
Washington State found pesticides on two of 25 apple samples at
levels that exceed the US government's daily safe exposure level for
children.</P>
      <P>For years, Taiwan had been the largest importer of Washington
state apples, with their ranking only falling to third place last
year after Canada and Mexico sharply increased their imports. Some 60
percent of America's annual apple exports come from Washington State.</P>
      <P>The EWG said tests conducted by an independent laboratory found a
total of eight pesticides present on the apples, including one,
endosulfan, that has been banned by Taiwan's Council of Agriculture.
Methyl parathion, which has been banned by the Environmental
Protection Agency in the US, was also found to be present.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CAN, EWG's scientist Richard Wiles said that
in the group's view, all importers, including Taiwan, should take
note of the test results, although he did stress that this does not
mean Taiwan should ban US apple imports.</P>
      <P>Wiles said that the US and Taiwan last year signed a memorandum
of understanding on the inspection and quarantine of agricultural
products. He noted that it seems that Taiwan has lowered its
inspection standards under US pressure, adding that the EWG thinks
Taiwan should stick to its original standards.</P>
      <P>The EWG has urged supermarkets to adopt "test and tell"
initiatives to protect the interests of consumers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPAN WILL MAINTAIN CLOSE TIES WITH TAIWAN: CEPD CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April   5  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) Chairman P.K. Chiang said on Wednesday that new
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, like his predecessor, will
continue to maintain close substantive relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Mori, 62, had just been elected prime minister by the two houses
of the Japanese Diet (parliament) to succeed Keizo Obuchi, who
remained in a coma after suffering a stroke a few days earlier.</P>
      <P>Chiang said that like Obuchi, Mori is very friendly toward
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He noted that he became acquainted with Mori more than 20 years
ago when he worked for the Republic of China Embassy in Tokyo, and
added that when he was the ROC economics minister, he held talks with
Mori, who was Japan's minister for international trade and industry
at the time.</P>
      <P>Chiang recounted that two years ago, Mori, who was serving as
secretary-general of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP),
reminded Chiang that economic and trade relations between Japan and
Taiwan were no longer as close as in the past.</P>
      <P>That was why he decided to bring together major Taiwan
enterprises to form the so-called "Three-Three Society" to promote
economic and trade relations with Japan, said Chiang.</P>
      <P>He expressed the belief that Taiwan-Japanese relations will be
further strengthened under the Mori administration.</P>
      <P>In the premiership election, Mori was supported by the LDP, the
Komei (Clean Government) Party and the Conservative Party. He
retained all the Cabinet ministers of the Obuchi administration.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHOULD KEEP SILENT ON ARMS FROM US: ROC DEFENSE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 5 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should keep mum about US arms sales
to Taiwan in order to ensure the maximum benefit for the country,
according to National Defense Minister Tang Fei.</P>
      <P>Remaining silent is the best policy for Taiwan with regard to US
arms sales to the island, because by so doing, Taiwan honors its
promise to the United States and avoids infuriating Beijing, Tang has
reiterated.</P>
      <P>Since many different factors can affect the United States'
decision to sell weapons to Taiwan, the Ministry of National Defense
(MND) has always adopted a low profile, and has traditionally
declined to comment publicly on such issues, in order not to
complicate the situation for the US side, according to MND officials.</P>
      <P>The remarks came on the heels of recent media reports about the
US sale of four Aegis destroyers to Taiwan. In addition to these
vessels, Taiwan also hopes to purchase early warning radar systems,
conventional submarines and updated Patriot missiles from America.</P>
      <P>Although earlier reports said the United States has agreed to
provide Taiwan with the state-of-the-art Aegis warships, the latest
news in Taiwan on Wednesday was that the United States has made a
decision not to sell Taiwan any of the vessels this year.</P>
      <P>The conflicting reports were released through various different
channels, and sources familiar with the MND's military procurement
operations said the motives behind the release of the information
were unclear.</P>
      <P>A local analyst also pointed out that in addition to strong
pressure from Beijing, the US administration also has to face
internal pressure from the US Congress on arms sales to Taiwan. The
issue is expected to be a topic of hot debate between the Republican
and Democratic parties prior to America's presidential election later
this year, he added.</P>

      <P>A Republic of China Air
Force officer at Chiayi airbase denied on Wednesday that the
unscheduled landing of an Air Force F-16 jetfighter in Makung,
Penghu, was a forced landing.</P>
      <P>Col. Chien Chien-chun told reporters that the Chiayi-based
single-seater F-16, piloted by Col. Hsu Sze-yao, was on a training
sortie and landed at Makung Airport at around 1 p.m. that day because
one of the plane's instruments was not working properly.</P>
      <P>Chien stressed that the landing was a "correct landing for
examination," not a "forced landing" as reported by the media.</P>
      <P>He said that a "forced landing" means the jet is unable to fly,
and added that such a landing might cause damage to the jet.</P>
      <P>Chien said the F-16 would remain at Makung Airport until air

      <P>Acting Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan on
Wednesday received Defense Minister Tang Fei, who has been designated
by President-elect Chen Shui-bian as the new government's premier.</P>
      <P>According to KMT spokesman Jason Hu, Lien told Tang that the KMT
has agreed to allow the staunch KMT defense minister to serve as
Chen's premier in a "personal capacity." Chen was the Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) candidate in the March 18 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>During his tenure as premier, Tang will maintain his KMT
membership, but will have to suspend his party activities.</P>
      <P>Hu said that during the talks, Lien told Tang that he will sign
Tang's application for KMT approval to work for the DPP government,
and that there is no need to submit the application to the KMT
Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>As for other KMT members who may be recruited to the Chen
government, Hu said the KMT's basic stance is neither to encourage
nor endorse such moves.</P>
      <P>It is believed that the DPP government will retain and recruit
some ranking KMT officials in the new administration which Chen
intends to make a supra-party government serving all the people of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The new government is to be inaugurated on May 20, and Chen said
that his Cabinet line-up will be fixed by the end of this month.</P>

foreign envoys stationed in Taipei on Thursday to explain the foreign

Republic of China, will attend the briefing.</P>
      <P>The incumbent foreign minister said he will also attend the

introducing the foreign dignities, since he did not take part in the
formulation of the new government's foreign policy. All the major
principles of the ROC's new foreign policy will have to be decided by
the soon-to-be ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), he noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman
Lin I-hsiung paid a visit on Wednesday to James Soong, chairman of
the newly founded People First Party (PFP) to seek PFP support for
the abolition of the upcoming National Assembly election.</P>
      <P>Lin, accompanied by DPP Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun, were
seeking Soong's support for canceling the National Assembly election
currently slated to take place on May 6, and for diluting the power
of the body.</P>
      <P>In response to the DPP request, Soong said that the PFP is not
opposed to a revision of the Constitution or to the abolition of the
assembly.</P>
      <P>However, he said the most important issue is whether matching
measures will be established to take account of any changes, so that
the responsibilities formerly undertaken by the assembly will be
taken care of.</P>
      <P>The DPP and the outgoing Kuomintang went into negotiations last
week on the issue of constitutional revisions, and reached an
agreement on seven points, which included canceling the National
Assembly election and freezing its powers.</P>
      <P>It remains to seen whether an emergency meeting of the current
assembly can be convened and whether this inter-party agreement can
be transformed into a Constitutional amendment before the election.</P>
      <P>There has been a great deal of speculation lately that the KMT
intends to avoid giving an opportunity to the PFP to find a new
political arena in the National Assembly, and it has been reported
that the KMT would rather cooperate with the DPP to abolish the
institution altogether.</P>
      <P>Both the KMT and the DPP have been obliged to adopt a two-pronged
approach to the issue -- start handling nominations for the May 6
assembly poll while simultaneously proceeding with plans to strip the
institution of its powers and abort the election.</P>
      <P>As to the stance of the PFP, Soong said that the party has been
preparing for the election but would not insist on the holding of
such an election.</P>

Chien-jen on Wednesday hailed Japan's democratic system, as Yoshiro
Mori moved to become Japan's new prime minister earlier the same day.</P>
      <P>Japan's quick political rehabilitation is an indication that
transition of political power is fully ensured by the country's
constitution, which in turn is an impressive trait which demonstrates
Japan's mature democracy, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that President Lee Teng-hui, Premier Vincent Siew
and his own ministry, through the ROC representative office in Tokyo,
have all sent messages of condolence to express Taipei's regret over
the stroke suffered by former Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who

      <P>Republic of China Foreign Minister Chen
Chien-jen said on Wednesday that Wednesday's change in the Japanese
government will not affect relations between Taipei and Tokyo.</P>
      <P>The ROC and Japan have long maintained close substantial
relations, and newly appointed Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori has always
been friendly toward Taiwan, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Mori became Japan's 85th prime minister after winning an
overwhelming majority in Japan's Upper and Lower Houses on Wednesday
to replace Keizo Obuchi, who remained in a coma caused by a stroke
two days ago.</P>
      <P>Although some aspects of bilateral relations could be stronger,
the ROC and Japan have close relations in the cultural and economic
fields, and any changes in the Japanese Cabinet will not affect the
current Taipei-Tokyo relations, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that Mori, who has visited Taiwan on a number of
occasions, has always had a friendly attitude toward Taiwan, which is
good news for the ROC.</P>
      <P>He also said he had heard nothing from either the Presidential
Office or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about a possible visit to
Japan by President Lee Teng-hui after he steps down from office on
May 20.</P>

    <DATELINE>Berlin,  April  4  (CNA)
(By Kuo Wu-heung &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In stark contrast to its threatening
rhetoric against Taiwan before the island's presidential election,
Mainland China kept a low profile after the outcome of the election
for fear of the impact of Taiwan's democracy on its own society, said
an envoy of the Republic of China on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Loh I-chen, an ambassador at large from Taipei, told a group of
German politicians, academics and journalists here on Tuesday that
what scares Beijing most is the defeat of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT)
in the election and the oncoming transfer of authority in Taiwan,
which indicates the maturity of Taiwan's democracy.</P>
      <P>Beijing has kept a muted reaction to the results to avoid
bringing the issue to the attention of the mainland Chinese public,
not least because it could inspire its people to take their cue from
Taiwan and demand democracy, said Loh.</P>
      <P>This could explain why Beijing trotted out its leaders to
lambaste Taiwan during the run-up to the March 18 election but then
refused to comment on the results, other than saying that it will
keep watching the new leader's policies.</P>
      <P>Beijing was in the grip of similar apprehension in 1991 when a
burgeoning democracy took hold in Russia following the collapse of
the Soviet Union. But Russia's political development is seen as less
menacing as that in Taiwan, which is ruled by the same ethnicity as
mainland China and is separated from it only by a narrow strait.</P>
      <P>Although President Lee Teng-hui is blamed by critics for the
election defeat of his own party, the KMT, Loh said that Lee has
ensured himself a position in history by bringing Taiwan's democracy
to a level of maturity that will soon see the peaceful transfer of
authority via election.</P>
      <P>Although speculation was rife in Taipei before the ballot-casting
day that President Lee preferred to have the opposition candidate
Chen Shui-bian as his successor, rather than the KMT candidate Lien
Chan, Loh said there is no indication that Lee has not supported Lien
with all his heart.</P>
      <P>Loh arrived in Berlin early this week. He is currently on a tour
of Europe, and is slated to head for Brussels on Wednesday.</P>

-- Hsu Chung-hsiung, Lee Chia-hsiung and Lin Yao-hsing -- at Academia
Sinica.</P>

the island for five decades, and, therefore, possesses a lot of
expertise. He went on to say that the new government is especially
keen to recruit KMT talent in the financial and economic areas.</P>

      <P>Controversy is brewing over Israel's
sale of aircraft equipped with advanced early warning radar systems
to mainland China, the Far Eastern Economic Review reports in its
April 13 issue.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the mainland Chinese military has signed

Warning and Control System, or AWACS, plane from Israel Aircraft
Industries and is expected to exercise options to buy more.</P>
      <P>The United States is concerned that the acquisition of more such

Taiwan. The aircraft are Russian Beriev A-50 planes fitted with
Israeli radar.</P>

William Cohen tried to dissuade Israeli leaders from selling mainland
China any more such aircraft.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CHAIRMAN CALLS ON BEIJING TO ACT LIKE A `GREAT COUNTRY'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman
Lin Yi-hsiung on Thursday called on mainland China to act like a
"great country" and try its best to seek mutual benefits for both
sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lin said the DPP, turning from Taiwan's major opposition party to
the ruling party on May 20, has always advocated goodwill as a means
of fostering exchanges across the strait.</P>
      <P>He added that as a "small country," Taiwan should not provoke
mainland China in any way. Instead, Taiwan should try "soft touches"
to enable Beijing to understand that its existence is not capable of
causing any threat to mainland China.</P>
      <P>For Beijing's part, Lin said it should demonstrate the
"magnanimity" of a major country towards Taiwan, rather than
constantly saber-rattling and causing anxiety in the international
community.</P>
      <P>Lin stressed that any ideological differences across the strait
can wait to be discussed later, while practical affairs concerning
the immediate interests of the people on both sides should be solved
quickly. When mutual trust is built up through increased cooperation
over practical affairs, leaders from the two sides will then find it
easier to conduct higher-level talks, noted Lin.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks during an exclusive interview with a local
radio broadcasting corporation.</P>
      <P>On party politics in Taiwan, Lin said it is too early and too
optimistic to say that the split of the Kuomingtang, which has ruled
Taiwan continuously for 55 years, will lead to the DPP becoming the
long-term ruling party in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As DPP chairman, Lin said he would like to stress that "only by
nurturing deep attachments to the people and the land, will the DPP
survive and prosper. And only by constantly maintaining a fresh
approach in formulating policies, will the party have a bright
future."</P>
      <P>It is useless for the DPP simply to rely on the split of another
party for its own success, he said.</P>
      <P>On plans to reduce the functions of the National Assembly, Lin
said the DPP will invite representatives from the KMT and the
newly-established People First Party to jointly discuss relevant
issues so as to work out the most viable and satisfying solution
concerning the National Assembly.</P>
      <P>The usefulness of the National Assembly has been widely
questioned since its major function of electing the president of the
Republic of China ended eight years ago when Taiwan held its first
direct presidential election.</P>
      <P>On complaints by Vice President-elect Annette Lu about her "not
being consulted" by President-elect Chen Shui-bian concerning the new
Cabinet line-up, Lin said that the VP has no specific powers under
the ROC Constitution beyond replacing the president when he is unable
to perform his duties.</P>
      <P>Lin said all politicians grow in experience over time, adding
that he hopes that Lu will pay closer attention to the contents of
the ROC Constitution and at the same time discard her
self-centeredness.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA BECOMES BIGGEST PERCEIVED THREAT T0 US</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 5 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Communist China has replaced Russia as
the nation perceived by Americans to be the most threatening to the
United States and Americans have become more worried about Communist
Chinese threats to invade Taiwan, according to a new public opinion
poll.</P>
      <P>In back-to-back presentations at the Nuclear Security Decision
Makers Forum in Albuquerque, two University of New Mexico researchers
said their surveys also show most Americans support a strong nuclear
weapons arsenal, with that support growing over the last several
years, reported the Albuquerque Tribune on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Survey interviews suggest Americans are worried more about
Communist Chinese threats to invade Taiwan, terrorist incidents
around the world, and a generally more confusing and unstable world,
said Kerry G. Herron, associate director for security studies at
UNM's Institute for Public Policy, adding that "the world is not
perceived as being safer than during the Cold War."</P>
      <P>Institute Director Hank Jenkins-Smith pointed out that while
Americans in surveys in 1993, 1995 and 1997 generally supported
stable funding of the US nuclear weapons program, last year's survey
revealed much stronger support for increasing that funding.</P>
      <P>Support for nuclear weapons appears to be driven by the American
public's concern about the political turmoil in Russia, Communist
China's saber-rattling in Asia, and the potential for nuclear
terrorism by nations opposed to US interests, explained
Jenkins-Smith.</P>
      <P>The surveys, conducted in the fall of 1999 to gauge public
knowledge about and support for US nuclear policy, were paid for by
Sandia National Laboratories. But Herron said the labs have taken a
"completely hands-off approach" to the surveys while continuing to
finance them.</P>
      <P>He added that two researchers will brief Sandia executives next
month on the 1999 survey results. But he declined to detail most of
those results before the Sandia briefing.</P>
      <P>Generally, Herron said, Americans see more benefits than risks
from nuclear weapons, though women are concerned more than men about
the risks from the United States' own nuclear arsenal.</P>
      <P>The 1999 data also shows that more Americans see a need for
nuclear weapons and more believe that funding should be increased to
support nuclear weapons programs. The 1993 survey found 63 percent of
Americans favored the retention of US nuclear weapons, and that
response rose to 79 percent in 1999.</P>
      <P>While 51 percent of those Americans surveyed in 1993 believed
that nuclear weapons funding should decrease, last year 61 percent
favored increased spending on them, said Herron.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLINTON ASKED TO BLOCK PETROCHINA'S LISTING ON NYSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 5 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Twenty-five members of the US House of
Representatives have appealed to President Bill Clinton to block the
PetroChina Corporation, a subsidiary of Beijing's China National
Petroleum Company (CNPC), from being listed on the New York Stock
Exchange Friday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a diverse collection of business groups, human rights
activists and political leaders gathered in Washington Wednesday
calling on President Clinton to halt PetroChina's planned initial
public offering, claiming that the company's ties to the Beijing
regime make it likely that the money generated will support
activities that undercut American foreign policy.</P>
      <P>In a letter to Clinton dated March 31, Rep. David Bonior
(D-Mich.), the House minority whip, and 24 colleagues noted that the
money raised by PetroChina on the New York Stock Exchange would be
used to finance exploration and development operations that "would
pose a direct threat to the population, resources and fragile
environment of Tibet."</P>
      <P>The money will also help the Sudanese government intensify its
civil war against its non-Muslim minority in the south. CNPC is
currently engaged, or preparing to engage, in oil exploration and
development activities in Sudan "in violation of official US policy,"
emphasized the lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Groups gathered here to denounce the PetroChina initial public
offering and calling on the Clinton administration to halt it
included Amnesty International, Students for a Free Tibet, America's
largest labor organization the AFL-CIO, Freedom House, and the US
Business and Industrial Council.</P>
      <P>The congressmen pointed out that PetroChina is a subsidiary of
CNPC, which owns 40 percent of Sudan's Greater Nile Petroleum
Operating Company. It is scheduled to be listed on the New York Stock
Exchange and hopes to bring a US$5-7 billion initial public offering
to market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US HOUSE TO VOTE ON NTR STATUS FOR CHINA IN MAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  5  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Rep. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.),
speaker of the House of Representative, announced Wednesday that the
vote on permanent normal trade relations status for Communist China
will be held in late May.</P>
      <P>President Bill Clinton immediately welcomed the decision by
Hastert to hold a vote on the US-PRC trade agreement during the week
of May 22 and promised an all-out effort to persuade reluctant
Congress members to support the controversial measure.</P>
      <P>Although the Senate is clearly committed to approving the
measure, Rep. David Bonior (D-Mich.), the House minority whip,
estimated last week that at least 135 of the House's 211 Democrats
opposed the legislation. Many Democrats argue that by giving up the
annual congressional review on Communist China's trade status, the
United States will lose its ability to influence Beijing's human
rights practices.</P>
      <P>But in welcoming Hastert's announcement at a White House
conference on the new economy, Clinton insisted that the
tariff-cutting deal will liberalize mainland Chinese society. "It
also slashes those tariffs which protect the state-run industries in
China which in large measure have been the instrument of single-party
control there. So I think it will lead to an opening of the society
and a rise of freedom and personal choice," said the president.</P>
      <P>The White House wants an early House vote on permanent normal
trade status for Communist China, fearing that support for the
historic US-PRC trade agreement on Beijing's accession to the World
Trade Organization will erode with the approach of the November
elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BAUER CRITICIZES CLINTON'S TRADE POLICY TOWARD BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  5  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republican conservative leader said that the distortions
produced by the trade-trumps-all China policy continue to mount, with
Secretary of Defense William Cohen publicly rebuking Israel for
selling an advanced airborne radar system to Communist China, while
allowing U.S. ambassador Joseph Prueher to throw a gala dinner party
in Beijing for Communist Chinese military representatives and U.S.
defense contractors under investigation for illegally providing
secret missile data to Communist China.</P>
      <P>The Washington Times reported Tuesday on a dinner hosted by
former U.S. Pacific commander-in-chief Prueher at his residence
in Beijing for executives of Hughes Electronics, SpaceSystems
Loral, ChinaSat and representatives of Communist China's military
space program.</P>
      <P>The dinner was held at the request of a Loral executive
to discuss the delayed launch of a mainland Chinese civilian
communications satellite. The lauch was postponed when the two
U.S. contractors had their export licenses suspended.</P>
      <P>"Hughes and Loral are under investigation for illegally
sharing missile data with China. ChinaSat, a government-owned
company, recently launched the first of a series of advanced
military satellites giving China a new command, control and
intelligence capability that will dramatically enhance the
People's Liberation Army's ability to manage its armed forces in
combat.</P>
      <P>He added that "In view of recent congressional reports
detailing China's illegal acquisition of U.S. arms secrets,
including nuclear weapons, it is inappropriate for the American
ambassador to be aiding Chinese companies engaged in military
activities."

    <HEADLINE>NEW ROC GOVERNMENT TO BOLSTER TIES WITH EUROPE SAYS CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  6  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Bolstering ties with the European Union
(EU) will be one of the top diplomatic priorities of the new Republic
of China government to be inaugurated on May 20, President-elect Chen
Shui-bian said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>As time passes and the situation in the world changes, the EU
will become a focus of attention by the new ROC government, Chen said
during a meeting with envoys from 12 EU member countries that
maintain representative offices in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Organized by the French Institute in Taipei, top liaison officers
of the 12 European representative offices in Taiwan paid a courtesy
call to Chen to exchange views with him on possible changes of
Taiwan's relations with the EU.</P>
      <P>The representatives included those from France, Britain, Spain,
Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, Sweden, Ireland,
Switzerland, Denmark and Italy.</P>
      <P>Chen said that despite the intensity of campaigning during the
hotly-contested presidential election, he had taken the time to visit
Britain, the Netherlands and Belgium to learn about the EU's allied
government, regional integration of the union, and the so-called
Third Road or Middle-Road politics so as to broaden his knowledge in
world politics.</P>
      <P>He noted, however, that the existing formula of cooperation among
parties in the EU is not applicable to Taiwan's current political
situation, adding that a non-party or supra-party government is
reckoned to be more viable after he takes office on May 20.</P>
      <P>Chen said in the past, the Kuomintang-ruled ROC government
focused its diplomatic efforts on the United States and Japan. As the
world situation has changed over time, he said his new government
will shift part of its attention to Europe so as to strengthen
bilateral relations with that part of the world.</P>
      <P>Chen added that his new government will be a multipurpose
government that will pay attention to all affairs, and which will
attach great importance to human rights protection, humanity and
environmental protection diplomacy. The EU also attaches great
importance to these issues, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, despite its overt difficulties in world diplomacy, is
more than willing to take greater responsibility as a member of the
international community and would like to play a greater role in
non-government and cross-government organizations, Chen emphasized.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT ISSUE TOPS ADMINISTRATION PRIORITY SAYS PREMIER-DESIG.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  6  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The cross-strait issue will be the top
priority of the new administration to be sworn in on May 20, said
Premier-designate Tang Fei on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Tang, defense minister in the outgoing Kuomintang (KMT)
government, said seeking a solution to the thorny cross-strait issue
will be the first priority of the new government, followed by reforms
of internal affairs and policies.</P>
      <P>Although the new government has vowed to conduct sweeping
administrative reforms, Tang said, almost all existing administrative
policies will need to be extended, so the reforms will not result in
a complete turnabout.</P>
      <P>It is unlikely that more than 80 ministerial-level officials in
36 Cabinet agencies will be given to new faces overnight.</P>
      <P>Tang noted that the KMT has agreed in principle to his
premiership in his capacity as an individual rather than a KMT
member, adding that he will soon submit an "application" to the KMT
for the party's official approval which would allow him to take up
the new post.</P>
      <P>On possible differences in policy formulation between himself and
President Chen Shui-bian, Tang said that as government leaders, they
should patently understand that democracy necessitates compromise,
respect for different opinions, and a willingness to seek agreement
when differences occur.</P>
      <P>On reports that President Lee Teng-hui has expressed worry over
the ROC military's combat readiness, Tang said it is true that the
ROC Armed Forces have sustained great pressure, mainly because of the
increased military threats from mainland China, and partly because of
a relatively low defense budget.</P>

      <P>Republic of China President-elect Chen
Shui-bian said on Thursday that the administration under his
leadership will honor all accords and commitments that have already
been inked with foreign countries.</P>
      <P>Chen made his assurance at a meeting with envoys of allied
countries. The envoys were accredited before the ROC government on
Thursday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say that foreign policy of the new administration
will maintain continuity and stability, and will also further
participate in international organizations so as to meet the
challenge of globalization.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the new administration must demonstrate Taiwan's
creativity and strength to the world, and that Taiwan's international
presence must be developed on the global stage.</P>
      <P>Chen also expressed his hope that heads of state of countries
that have maintained diplomatic relations with the ROC will attend
his inaugural ceremony on May 20.</P>
      <P>Burkina Faso Ambassador Jacques Y. Sawadogo, who is also dean of
the Diplomatic Corps in Taipei, on behalf of that organization

    <HEADLINE>CHEN AND TANG DISCUSS PRINCIPLES OF FORMING CABINET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 6 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Defense Minister Tang Fei, who is expected
to serve as premier of President-elect Chen Shui Bian's incoming
government with the formal approval of Acting Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Lien Chan, said on Thursday that he and the president-elect
have to date only talked about the principles of forming a new
Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Tang, a senior member of the outgoing KMT, had repeatedly said he
would not leave the party to assume the premiership. He has been
allowed by the party to serve as head of Chen's cabinet as an
individual after a temporary suspension of his KMT membership, but
the KMT would neither endorse nor be responsible for his performance.</P>
      <P>Tang stressed that he and the president-elect, a stalwart of the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), have not discussed specific
individuals to head the various departments -- they only discussed
principles for the formation of the new Cabinet.</P>
      <P>As to the speculation that Council for Economic Planning and
Development Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, a close friend of Tang, is
being considered for the vice premiership, Tang said that the matter
has not been discussed.</P>
      <P>Tang made the remarks in a TV interview with Jaw Shau-kong, a
former New Party heavyweight.</P>
      <P>Tang noted that there are more than 70 ranking administrative
officials in the government. He said that replacing them all in a
one-time reshuffle would be imprudent, if normal operations of the
government are taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>Since almost all departments under the Executive Yuan need
professionals to run them, he decided while discussing the issue with
Chen that getting the right person in the right place is most
important, he noted.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the political party affiliation is another problem
he must face when making his choices for the Cabinet, said Tang.</P>
      <P>Tang noted that there are 35 organizations under the Executive
Yuan, and that time is running short before Chen takes the helm of
the administration on May 20. Therefore, he added, discussion between
the president-elect and himself has been limited to principles,
instead of details, about appointments for the new Cabinet.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP AIDE DENIES MEETING WITH RANKING BEIJING OFFICERS IN US</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April   6  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chiu I-yen, representative of the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to the United States, denied a
report on Friday that he had met with ranking Beijing military
officers during a recent trip to America.</P>
      <P>Chiu categorically denied the Washington-dispatched report by
Japan's Sankei Shimbun on the same day. He reiterated that there are
no envoys acting as mediators between Taiwan and mainland China, and
that neither are there any special communication channels between the
two sides.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside the report that he held an unofficial meeting on
the "one China" issue with ranking mainland Chinese military leaders
during a recent tour in America, Chiu clarified that the major
purpose of his trip to the United States was to attend a seminar.</P>
      <P>But Chiu admitted that it is true that the seminar was attended
by experts from Taiwan, mainland China and the United States,
including one officer of the People's Liberation Army who had
expressed his viewpoint on some topics related to the military
situation between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>"Maybe that is the reason resulting in the misunderstanding," the
DPP official explained, stressing that he personally had never
discussed the "one China" issue with the mainland Chinese officer.</P>
      <P>Chiu made the remarks while answering questions from reporters
after participating in a meeting between President-elect Chen
Shui-bian and foreign envoys stationed in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Chen had dispatched an envoy to mainland China
following his election as president on March 18, the DPP cadre ruled
out such possibilities, emphasizing that no special communication
channels exist between Taiwan and the mainland, except the
cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council and the quasi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation.</P>
      <P>Chiu returned to Taipei on Tuesday after a nine-day tour of the
US, where he met lawmakers, officials and members of think tanks.</P>

      <P>Chief of the General Staff Gen. Tang
Yiau-min has turned down an offer from President-elect Chen Shui-bian
to head the Ministry of National Defense under his administration,
incumbent Defense Minister Tang Fei said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Tang Fei, who has been designed as Chen's premier, said in an
interview with a local radio station that he and Chen are now
weighing other candidates.</P>
      <P>Given the complexity of defense affairs, it is impossible to have
a civilian take the reins at the ministry before the Organic Law of
the Ministry of National Defense Affairs is enacted, and the new
defense minister should be chosen from among career servicemen, said
the fighter pilot-turned-minister.</P>
      <P>He dispelled concerns that his appointment as premier, like that
of former military leader Gen. Hau Pei-tsun who took the helm of
government under President Lee Teng-hui in 1990, will open the door
to military interference in politics.</P>
      <P>"Instead of pursuing the post, I have been asked, or summoned, to
head the government, and there is a mechanism in democracy to prevent
military men from unduly influencing government that works by cutting
the links between military men-turned-politicians and the armed
forces. There is no way in which any leader can interfere with the
democratic system by riding on the back of the armed forces," said
Tang.</P>
      <P>He brushed aside questions on whether he has been asked to form a
Cabinet for Chen or invited to join a Cabinet put together by Chen,
saying he will line up the new Cabinet subject to Chen's approval.</P>
      <P>Tang, who met with Kuomintang Secretary-General Lin Fong-cheng
earlier in the day to officially inform his party that he will accept
Chen's job offer, said in the interview that he understood the KMT's
"no support, no endorsement" stance on his decision, and that he
would rather earn public support through comprehensive policies than
through the backing of any political party.</P>
      <P>Noting that compromise is quintessential to a democracy, Tang
said he will not insist on having everything his own way. Instead, he
said, he will concede when his opinion clashes with that of the
president to ensure a smooth working relationship with the head of
state.</P>
      <P>He also said that contrary to the opinions of some "analysts," he
is not worried that he is destined to be a short-term premier used as
a stop-gap until Chen can foster a premier from his Democratic
Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Tang said he expects to remain in the job until the end of 2001,
when the current legislature comes up for election, and added that
whether he will stay on after that will depend on his job
performance.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP MEMBERSHIP EXCEEDS 200,000 AS OF WEDNESDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 6 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The membership of the newly founded People
First Party (PFP) exceeded 200,000 as of Wednesday, a party spokesman
said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Sun Ta-chien said he is confident that the membership will
surpass one million within six months, and is convinced that the PFP
will grab 100 National Assembly seats in the National Assembly
election scheduled for May 6.</P>
      <P>Sun said the PFP will propose on Friday or Saturday a list of
nominees who will run in the National Assembly election.</P>
      <P>The Central Election Commission stipulates that all candidates
must register with the commission from April 9 through April 13.</P>
      <P>After the finalization of the list of nominees, the PFP will hold
two or three press conferences and public hearings to introduce the
nominees and to issue a statement on the party's participation in the
election.</P>
      <P>The PFP was founded on March 31 by James Soong, an independent
candidate in the March 18 presidential election. Soong was chosen to
be party chairman and Chang Chao-hsiung, Soong's running mate in the
presidential election, was picked as vice chairman.</P>
      <P>The party immediately started to enlist members through Soong's
presidential election campaign organizations, all of which will
eventually become local PFP headquarters.</P>
      <P>Sun said the PFP hopes that membership will surpass two million
within two years, and pointed out that if this goal can be achieved,
the party will be Taiwan's largest political party competing in the
legislative elections scheduled to be held at the end of next year.</P>
      <P>Sun, who was also a spokesman for Soong during the presidential
election campaign, said the PFP has yet to finalize its structure,
but added that when complete, the structure will be "streamlined."</P>

(By S.C. Peng and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing will not engage in any form of
dealings with Taipei unless President-elect Chen Shui-bian recognizes
the "one China" principle, an official with the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) said on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The official told CNA that ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan, who
currently lives in Shanghai, would not have met with Chen's envoy in
Beijing, and that reports to the contrary in the Taiwan media should
be checked carefully. He pointed out that Wang, in his capacity as
mainland China's top negotiator with Taiwan, will only act in
compliance with Beijing's policy.</P>
      <P>Beijing will only decide its next move toward Taiwan after
weighing Chen's inaugural speech on May 20, according to the
official.</P>
      <P>A Taiwan-based Internet newspaper reported recently that Chen of
the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party dispatched a secret
envoy to the mainland the very next day following his election as
Taiwan's president on March 18.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a spokesman for the mainland Chinese Foreign Ministry
declined to comment on the report about Chen's secret envoy, saying
only that any comments on the issue should come from the Taiwan

    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  6  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US State Department has accused
Lockheed Martin Corp. of violating the Arms Export Control Act by
providing an assessment of a motor on the Asiasat-2 communications
satellite to a state-owned communist Chinese conglomerate.</P>
      <P>But a spokesman for Lockheed Martin denied that the company had
violated export laws and said it obtained a Commerce Department
license before its scientists assessed the mainland Chinese-made
satellite motor.</P>
      <P>Both The Washington Post and The Washington Times reported on
Thursday that the State Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls
informed Lockheed Martin of its findings in a letter dated April 4,
and gave the largest American defense contractor 30 days to respond
to the civil charges, which could result in a fine of as much as
US$15 million and ban the company from exporting satellites or
satellite technology for up to three years.</P>
      <P>The allegations are similar to those lodged in 1998 against
Hughes Electronics Corp. and Loral Space &amp; Communications, two other
US satellite manufacturers which have been under criminal
investigation for possibly passing sensitive data to mainland China.</P>
      <P>The Hughes and Loral investigations triggered intense controversy
in Congress, with Republican lawmakers accusing the Clinton
administration of being lax in its oversight of high-tech exports to
mainland China due to the influence of illegal campaign contributions
and intensive lobbying.</P>
      <P>Although the Lockheed Martin case does not involve violations of
criminal laws, State Department spokesman James Rubin called it "a
serious matter" and said export control officials decided to take
action "based on the facts and the gravity of the charges."</P>

      <P>Wang, a member of the Kuomintang, will step down together with

    <HEADLINE>US CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION TO CHINA URGED TO DEMAND FACTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  6  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Prominent leaders of human rights,
environmental, labor and animal welfare organizations in the United
States Thursday called on members of Congress preparing to visit
mainland China to demand the facts on the state of human rights and
the fate of religious, democratic and labor rights leaders there.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), the
largest animal protection organization with over 7.5 million members,
Thursday announced its opposition to granting Communist China
permanent normal trade relations status. HSUS and the Animal Welfare
Institute are also organizing a peaceful demonstration against
granting permanent NTR to China on Capitol Hill on April 12.</P>
      <P>The coalition of various organizations that support the annual
congressional review of China's human rights record wrote in a letter
released Thursday that "truth is off limits in China. That Beijing is
uniquely able to obtain vital intelligence about the fate of human
rights, religious, democratic and labor rights leaders in China
creates a moral obligation to do so."</P>
      <P>The group, which includes renowned mainland Chinese human rights
activists Wei Jingsheng and Harry Wu, is planning a "Going Away
Party" for the House delegation. At the farewell gathering just
before they leave for China, the group will present members with
"propaganda survival kits."</P>
      <P>Constituents in each delegation member's congressional district
are also organizing local town hall meetings to hear the results of
their representative's investigation of the human rights concerns
outlined in the letter to the delegation.</P>
      <P>"Unlike their Chinese hosts who remain accountable only to a
powerful Communist elite, members of Congress are still accountable
to the people they serve," said George Becker, president of the
United Steelworkers of America.</P>
      <P>The letter to the congressional delegation called on the members
to ask "tough but fair questions" in four major areas of concern:
democracy and free speech; religious freedom; forced labor,
starvation wages and crushed independent unions; and environmental
and animal welfare.</P>
      <P>The letter urges the delegation to insist on being allowed to see
imprisoned journalists, religious and labor leaders and leaders of
the democratic opposition to the Communist regime. It also calls on
the delegation to visit a forced-labor camp, the site of the Three
Gorges Dam project, a garment manufacturing sweat-shop, and a dog and
cat fur processing plant.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SENATORS URGE CLINTON TO SUPPORT TAIWAN'S ENTRY INTO WHO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  6  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Twenty-one US senators have urged
President Bill Clinton to take concrete steps to support Taiwan's
participation in the World Health Organization, saying that denying
the people of Taiwan access to the benefits of the highest possible
level of health is "a gross dereliction of duty by the WHO, and
should not stand unchallenged."</P>
      <P>Sen. Jesse Helms (R-NC), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, and 20 colleagues from both the Republican and Democratic
Parties wrote in a March 31 letter to President Clinton that the most
recent government report concerning Taiwan's participation in the WHO
describes the practical problem of Communist China's opposition to,
and the limited international support for, Taiwan's participation.</P>
      <P>But they stressed that "the report fails to address the crux of
the issue -- the people of Taiwan are being systematically denied
access to the benefits of organizations such as the WHO, the primary
objective of which is the attainment by all people of the highest
possible level of health."</P>
      <P>Since April 7, 2000 has been declared World Health Day by the
WHO, the senators added that "we are presented with a unique
opportunity to address this important issue."</P>
      <P>While the Clinton administration report concludes that Taiwan's
entry into the WHO should be supported, the senators pointed out that
"it does not create a systematic plan for reaching that objective. We
believe it is incumbent on the administration to support more
vigorously humanitarian efforts by the people of Taiwan to gain
access to international health policy planning."</P>
      <P>They told the president that "in the case of Taiwan's membership
in the WHO, functional humanitarian concerns greatly outweigh matters
of organizational form. Accordingly, a failure by your administration
to properly champion the participation by Taiwan in the WHO would be
a decision to place matters of mere political convenience above
overriding humanitarian concerns."</P>
      <P>"Good health is a basic right of every citizen of the world and
access to the highest possible standards of health information and
services is necessary to help guarantee this right," stressed the
senators.</P>
      <P>They added that "unless the United States is willing to stand up
and take the lead on this issue, the definition of `all people' will
continue to exclude the people of Taiwan. We urge you to take
concrete steps to ensure that no people are denied the highest
possible standards of health or other human rights by the political
limitations of international organizations to which the United States
is a party."</P>

    <HEADLINE>HOLY STONE IS TAIWAN'S STOCK MARKET CHAMP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  7  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>High profits from comparatively low
investments have made Holy Stone Enterprise Co., a MLCC
(multi-layered ceramic capacitor) producer, Taiwan's stock market
champion, with its stock price rising to NT$700 from NT$72 when it
was first listed on Taiwan's OTC(over-the-counter) securities market
on Jan. 13, 2000.</P>
      <P>Holy Stone President Bill Tang emphasized that the company's
performance in the stock market won't cause any complications in the
company's culture or in the working habits of its employees, saying
he expects that they will apply the fortunes they've made from the
stock market toward benevolent purposes.</P>
      <P>Following are excerpts from CNA reporter Chang Liang-chih's
interview with Bill Tang:</P>
      <P>Q: What is the situation in the passive components market?</P>
      <P>A: In the passive components market, the supply is currently not
sufficient to meet the demand. In the meantime, the Japanese
manufacturers are cutting down their production volumes. The
insufficient supply situation is expected to last until the third
quarter of this year. While most of the manufacturers are boosting
their production capacities, the insufficient supply problem will
likely be solved by the end of this year or early next year.</P>
      <P>If the market situation turns from insufficient supply to over
supply, prices of passive components are likely to decrease. The
impact on individual companies will depend on their production
processes and capacities, as well as their marketing strategies.</P>
      <P>Q: How has Holy Stone been able to achieve such high profits?</P>
      <P>A: The passive components and semiconductor manufacturing
industries have recovered from a gloomy market last year and Holy
Stone has benefited from the market recovery. The company's strong
performance can be attributed to a good strategy -- market-oriented
research and development planning and R&amp;D-oriented manufacturing.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, passive components are applied components
for its downstream assembled products. Holy Stone started its
business as a professional agent for electronic components. As a
manufacturer, the company has learned to see things from the
customer's standpoint when designing its products. Holy Stone became
a passive components manufacturer last year, after it has already
become well aware of the market.</P>
      <P>As a manufacturer with its own market channel, Holy Stone can
keep up with the latest market trends and concentrate on products
with high profits. Even if market prices make a downward adjustment
in the fourth quarter of this year, Holy Stone will be able to handle
the price cut.</P>
      <P>Q: What is your biggest concern at the present time?</P>
      <P>A: The hike in the company's stock price has made our employees
the new rich in the electronics sector. I hope that the newly won
fortunes won't cause any complications to the company's culture or to
our people's working habits. Holy Stone is a big family, and each
member of the company should share their achievements with their
family members.</P>
      <P>In terms of company developments, I care most about production
quality and capacity and personnel development. The market,
personnel, and technology are all vital to a company's growth.</P>
      <P>Q: What are Holy Stone's future prospects concerning production
capacity and R&amp;D planning?</P>
      <P>A: Referring to MLCC production, Holy Stone expects to achieve an
annual production growth rate of between 70 percent and 100 percent
with the completion of our second MLCC plant in Luntan, central
Taiwan early next year. The production capacity is set at 2 billion
pieces. It is estimated that company revenues will reach NT$5 billion
next year.</P>
      <P>The production capacity of our first plant in Luntan is expected
to reach 500 million MLCC units by the fourth quarter of this year,
with an annual growth rate of 66.67 percent.</P>
      <P>In view of the booming telecommunications market, Holy Stone is
also working on specific small-sized products for mobile phone sets.</P>
      <P>As many downstream customers have moved their production lines
out of Taiwan, Holy Stone should study ways of remaining close to the
market. The Holy Stone board of directors recently held a meeting
where they approved the planning of indirect investments in mainland
China's coastal regions.

      <P>The Republic of China Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) said on Friday that it has expressed Taipei's grave
concern to Israel about the country's planned arms sales to mainland
China.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials said that the ministry, through its representative

    <HEADLINE>US URGED TO SEND MINISTERIAL-LEVEL OFFICIAL TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 6 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A business council has urged the White
House to send a ministerial-level official to Taiwan to attend a
business conference slated for mid-June.</P>
      <P>Rupert J. Hammond-Chambers, acting president of the US-ROC
(Taiwan) Business Council, confirmed on Thursday that its chairman,
Frank Carlucci, sent a message to the National Security Council
urging the Clinton administration to send the official to attend the
annual meeting to promote trade relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The council noted that Taiwan is the United States'
seventh-largest trade partner, its eighth-largest export market, and
its fifth-largest buyer of agricultural produce, adding that
bilateral trade has grown 7.5-fold over the last two decades.</P>
      <P>The 24th Annual Joint Business Conference of the US-ROC (Taiwan)
Business Council and ROC-USA Business Council is slated for June
14-16, four weeks after the May 20 inauguration of Chen Shui-bian as
president of the ROC.</P>
      <P>With the annual joint conference held right after the
inauguration of Chen and the nation's other economic and financial
leaders, Hammond-Chambers is expecting keen interest among US
businessmen in attending the meeting to learn more about the changes
in Taiwan and its new leaders.</P>
      <P>The Clinton administration is now scrambling to solicit support
for awarding permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status to
mainland China. If Congress votes to give PNTR status to Beijing by
the end of May, it is expected that arranging for financial officials
to visit Taiwan in mid-June will be less difficult.</P>
      <P>A former US government official said that the Clinton
administration has in the past sent a ministerial-level official to
attend the major conference. If the United States fails to send the
same level of official to Taiwan, it will send the wrong message to
both sides of the Taiwan Strait, which he said would be an
unfortunate development.</P>
      <P>During the last joint conference in San Antonio, Texas, ROC
Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang invited US Commerce
Secretary William Daley to attend the Taipei meeting. Daley was the
first US commerce secretary to attend the joint conference, but
whether he will be the first commerce secretary to visit Taiwan will
be up to the White House.</P>
      <P>The Clinton administration sent Energy Secretary Bill Richardson
to Taipei to attend the 22nd joint conference in 1998, and
Transportation Secretary Federico Pena to the 20th joint conference
in 1996.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the US-ROC (Taiwan) Business Council said in a press
release that David Laux, president of the council over the past
decade, resigned from the post on April 1.</P>
      <P>The press release said that Laux will now serve as the head of
the US-Taiwan Business Forum, an organization dedicated to
cultural, educational, and business exchanges between the United
States and Taiwan. The forum solicited donations last year to help
relief efforts following the devastating Sept. 21 earthquake.</P>
      <P>The 73-year-old Laux, formally a Taipei Office Managing Director
of the American Institute in Taiwan, served as president of the
US-ROC Business Council in 1990, which later changed its name to the
US-ROC (Taiwan) Business Council.</P>
      <P>Laux accompanied Carlucci to visit Taipei in late March and
early April, and met with President Lee Teng-hui, President-elect
Chen Shui-bian, and various other high-ranking officials to exchange
views on the Taiwan situation in the wake of the March 18
presidential election which saw the Kuomintang end its five-decade
rule in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, the press release stressed that Laux's resignation had
nothing to do with the KMT ouster.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES DROP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  7 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves at the
end of March totaled US$113 billion, registering a drop for the first
time in 21 months, according to figures released on Friday by the
Central Bank of China (CBC).</P>
      <P>The figures show that Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves rank
third in the world, behind only Japan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Although the volume of reserves at the end of March was down by
US$636 million compared with the previous month, it registered an
increase of US$19.99 billion as compared with the same period of last
year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves at the end of February
achieved a record high of US$113.6 billion as a result of factors
such as sustained foreign capital inflow.</P>
      <P>The plunge in March was mainly due to the quarterly demand at the
end of each season, a rush by importers to purchase US dollars, and a
reluctance among exporters to sell US dollars, according to an
analysis by CBC officials.</P>
      <P>Some importers and the general public rushed to purchase US
dollars on March 20, the first business day of the monetary market
after the March 18 presidential election, leading to a drop in the
government's foreign exchange reserves, said market observers.</P>
      <P>The turnover of the Taipei foreign exchange market rose to
US$1.88 billion on March 30, the highest single day volume in 30
months, which required an intervention by the CBC, the observers
added.</P>
      <P>The intervention, which was needed to avoid a large-scale
depreciation of the NT dollar and which was aimed at coping with the
public rush for US dollars, consisted of the CBC dumping a large
amount of US dollars, which led to the drop in the island's foreign
exchange reserves, Taipei foreign exchange traders noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves have nevertheless exceeded the
benchmark of US$100 billion for eight consecutive months since August
1999, according to officials of the Foreign Exchange Department under
the CBC.</P>

      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), said on Friday that
several political parties, including the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), have asked him about his intention to join the new government.</P>
      <P>The lineup of the new government has become a focus of interest
following the March 18 presidential election which saw the

      <P>With his knowledge of cross-Taiwan Strait relations and
international affairs, Lin has been widely tipped as a possible
member of President-elect Chen Shui-bian's new Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Lin said that some of his friends in the DPP have inquired about
his intentions, and have invited him to accept the offer of a Cabinet
post in Taiwan's first peaceful transition of political power.</P>
      <P>Lin said that at such a critical juncture in cross-strait

    <HEADLINE>ROSY MARKET PROSPECTS FOR PASSIVE COMPONENTS THIS YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  7  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
(By Chang Liang-chih and Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei, April 7 (CNA): Taiwan's passive components manufacturers
have been enjoying brisk sales since the second half of 1999 when
several leading suppliers in Japan shifted their production lines to
other products with higher added value. Their Taiwanese counterparts
then took up the vacated production role.</P>
      <P>Resistors, capacitors and inductors are major passive components
for all kinds of electrical appliances. Demand for passive components
in the international market has continued to grow over the past 10
years amid booming popularity of electronics, telecommunications and
household electrical appliances.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's passive components manufacturing industry has
experienced many ups and downs in its 40 years of history. The key to
its success in this high-tech, capital intensive industry has been
expanding production capacity to an economically feasible scale.</P>
      <P>In 1998 downstream PC manufacturers initiated the low-price
marketing strategy, and Taiwan's passive components suppliers
suffered severely due to profit cutting. In order to cut down their
production costs, leading manufacturers such as YAGEO Corp.,
Pan-Overseas Industrial Corp. and Team Young Advanced Ceramics Co.
moved their production lines to mainland China and other developing
countries.</P>
      <P>The world outlook for passive components turned rosy early last
year amid escalating demand for mobile telephones. Among Taiwan's
passive components manufacturers, multi-layered ceramic capacitors
(MLCC) for mobile telephone handsets are most graced by the
recovering market.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Japanese passive components makers have shifted their
production lines to components for high added value
telecommunications devices.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan's passive components manufacturers have taken over
the market for computer components vacated by the Japanese, they have
also developed production lines of MLCCs to meet the continuously
growing demand of the telecommunications market.</P>
      <P>Moving their production lines to countries with lower production
costs and expanding production capacities are the typical strategies
of Taiwan's passive component suppliers. Most manufacturers expect
that the market will continue to grow and good profits will pile up
at least until the end of this year.</P>

      <P>In the latest of a series of "house
cleanings," the Kuomintang stripped 53 prominent party members of
their party memberships for supporting non-KMT candidates in the
March 18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>In addition to Yen Ching-piao, speaker of Taichung County
Council, one legislator, eight National Assembly deputies, 19
councilmen, and nine party deputies received their marching orders.</P>
      <P>All of them were supporters of independent presidential candidate
James Soong, with the exception of one, who was punished for stumping
for Democratic Progressive Party candidate Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Chien Wei-chang, director-general of the KMT Evaluation and
Discipline Committee, told a press conference after his committee
handed down the punishments that some committee members had suggested
mercy, but the committee decided to follow the precedent set up in
the handling of other party defectors.</P>
      <P>Admitting that the party's power base has been jeopardized by
divesting so many local party leaders of their memberships at one
time, Chien said nevertheless that discipline should be the priority.</P>
      <P>More heads will roll, said Chien, when his committee turns to
grassroots party members who supported non-KMT candidates in defiance
of the party's call to rally behind party candidate Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>The KMT finished a humiliating third in the presidential election
after its members split the vote between KMT candidate Lien Chan and
former KMT secretary-general James Soong, who was expelled from the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Almost two-dozen founding members of the
hard-line Independence Party (IP) announced on Friday their decision
to drop out of it, as they say that the party has completed its
mission.</P>
      <P>IP founding chairman Lee Cheng-yuan and the party's first
secretary-general Lee Sheng-hsiung called a conference to make public
their declaration, endorsed by a total of 23 members.</P>
      <P>Although they suggested that the whole party should be disbanded,
they claimed that they will not join the soon-to-be ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>DPP candidate Chen Shui-bian won Taiwan's March 18 presidential
election and will be inaugurated as the Republic of China's tenth
president on May 20.</P>
      <P>Since the IP has completed its current mission of terminating the
Kuomintang's 55-year rule in Taiwan, Lee Cheng-yuan said it is no
longer necessary to stay in an organization that is increasingly
losing its importance as an opposition party.</P>
      <P>Stressing that they fully respect the wishes of those who want to
stay in the party, they said from now on they will join forces with
all the people of Taiwan to strive for sovereignty and to fight
mainland China's attempts to invade or swallow up this island.</P>
      <P>The IP, set up in 1997, was a splinter-group of the
pro-independence DPP.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, incumbent IP Chairman Cheng Pang-cheng also
called a news conference to express his regret, shock and
consternation over the former stalwarts' collective decision to

      <P>Outgoing Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui said in Kaohsiung on Friday that after he leaves his
presidential post on May 20, he will do more to benefit Taiwan's
minority groups.</P>
      <P>He told some 700 representatives of local organizations over a

because he felt that he had completed his mission for the country.</P>
      <P>Once he steps down as president next month, Lee stated that he
will use his more neutral stance do more to care for the poor, the
handicapped and other minority groups.</P>
      <P>The president was in Kaohsiung to extend his appreciation for the
support lent to him by the people there over the past 12 years.</P>
      <P>He was accompanied by Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng,
former Presidential Secretary-General Huang Kun-huei and former
Presidential Deputy Secretary-General Huang Cheng-hsiung.</P>
      <P>Lee told the gathering that the ROC on Taiwan has undergone

      <P>Although the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) has won the presidential election, it will not have a
controlling grip on the government as the Kuomintang did, said the
DPP Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with Raymond F. Burghardt, director of the American
Institute in Taiwan Taipei Office, Lin said his party will fully
respect President-elect Chen Shui-bian's authority in lining up
Cabinet members.</P>
      <P>However, the DPP chairman said, it is the duty of any party
member who is elected to public office to toe the party line on
national policy.</P>
      <P>Lin dismissed as "impossible" media reports that Chen has sent a
secret messenger to Beijing, saying that his party denounces
back-channel diplomacy. Any government's activities should be
conducted publicly and under the vigilant eye of the public, he said.</P>
      <P>Chen had boasted about forming a non-partisan administration long
before he was elected on the DPP ticket. Since his election victory,
he has designated a KMT government minister as his premier.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mandarin Airlines will open a direct
Taipei-Saipan flight route on May 1, sources with the airlines said
on Friday.</P>
      <P>With an area of 124 square kilometers (48 square miles), Saipan
is the biggest of the Northern Mariana Islands. The central Pacific
island was the scene of fierce fighting during World War II.</P>
      <P>The attractions of Saipan and the surrounding islands include
scenic splendors and maritime activities. It is the nearest tourist
resort to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the past, Taiwan tourists had to transfer planes to reach
Saipan. Japanese holiday-makers had accounted for the majority of
arrivals on Saipan before the outbreak of the Asian financial turmoil
in 1997.</P>
      <P>Since then, the number of Japanese tourists to Saipan has
decreased significantly. Saipan authorities are now actively tapping
Taiwan's tourist market.</P>
      <P>After considering Saipan's prospects as a destination for Taiwan
tourists, Mandarin Airlines decided to open the direct Taipei-Saipan
flight route on May 1. During the initial stage, the airline plans to
offer two flights per week, on Mondays and Fridays. Flight time will
be three-and-half hours.</P>
      <P>Mandarin Airlines merged with Formosa Airlines in August 1999.
The firm now operates the domestic flight routes left by Formosa
Airlines, and is actively expanding its international flight routes.</P>
      <P>In November and December of last year, Mandarin Airlines began
flying to Taipei-Rangoon (Myanmar) and Taipei-Chiang Mai (Thailand),
respectively. The Taipei-Saipan link is Mandarin Airlines' third
international flight route.</P>

      <P>Counterfeited golf gear with a street value
of about NT$100 million (US$3.33 million) was seized in a Taipei
sports shop on Friday, said prosecutors at the Taichung District
Prosecutors' Office.</P>
      <P>Investigators found 700 false club heads, shafts and golf bags
bearing the well-known brand names of Call Away, Mizuno, S. Yard and
Honma in a golf shop's warehouse. The shop's owner was accused of
selling bogus golfing gear last year by the US television network the
National Broadcast Corporation (NBC).</P>
      <P>The shop owner had been caught by a hidden camera selling false
clubs to NBC reporters who pretended to be buyers.</P>
      <P>Following the report, Taiwan investigators launched a probe, but
were unable to obtain evidence because the shop owner had already
removed the illegal products after NBC broke the news.</P>
      <P>Friday's raids on storehouses of the shop were carried out after
a fake golfing equipment manufacturing ring was busted in Taichung
early last month.</P>
      <P>On tips provided by members of the ring, investigators raided the

      <P>President-elect Chen Shui-bian on Saturday
paid a brief courtesy call on Adm. Ni Yue-si, former chief of the
General Staff and a strategic consultant to the president.</P>
      <P>Chen lauded Ni as an outstanding military leader who can serve as
an example for the Taiwan public not only because of his
extraordinary expertise in his profession but for his methods of
learning, working and treating people.</P>
      <P>The 86-year-old former military strongman insisted on standing
from his wheelchair to salute the new head of state who is scheduled
to be inaugurated on May 20, according to Ni's son, John, who is
currently director-general of the Small- and Medium-Sized Business
Administration under the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>There had been speculation that Chen's visit to Ni was related to
his imminent appointment of a naval brass-hat as his defense minister
to replace incumbent Defense Minister Tang Fei of the outgoing
Kuomintang government, who has been appointed premier.</P>
      <P>Ni was a navy chief before being appointed Republic of China
ambassador to Turkey and chief of the general staff.</P>
      <P>After the meeting, Chen declined to comment on whether he will
name a naval officer as defense minister, saying only that the
appointment will be based on the principle of seeking balance in the
military.</P>
      <P>Observers say that the appointment of Adm. Ku Chung-lien, the

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  8  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China has quickly exploited
Australia's recent attack on the UN human rights system, with its
envoy in Canberra allegedly saying both countries share common
frustrations with the world organization.</P>
      <P>The Sydney Morning Herald on Saturday reported that a counselor
from the mainland Chinese embassy in Canberra made the comment in
talks with officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
(DFAT), and offered Beijing's sympathy with Australia's stance on
mandatory sentencing laws now being introduced in the Northern
Territories and Western Australia.</P>
      <P>However, when the daily contacted the mainland Chinese embassy in
Canberra, a spokesman flatly denied that the counselor had made any
such comment during his routine talks with DFAT officials.</P>
      <P>Australia made a scathing attack on the UN Human Rights
Commission (UNHRC) after its committee described the laws as racially
discriminatory. Under the laws, minor crimes such as shoplifting by
kids, mainly Aborigines, can be severely punished by jail terms.</P>
      <P>Mainland China is now in the midst of an international campaign
to defeat a US-sponsored resolution to condemn Beijing's human rights
abuses and violations now being considered by the UNHRC.</P>
      <P>The Clinton administration has asked Australia to support its
resolution to condemn mainland China, but Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer has signalled that Canberra will refuse to give Washington
such backing, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>Australia has since 1997 refused to support any condemnation on
mainland China's human rights abuses. Instead, Canberra uses
bilateral annual talks with Beijing to voice its warning or
opposition to widespread mainland Chinese violations, preventing
public disputes over this issue.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 8 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Irritated by a ruling of the Grand Justices
Council against the National Assembly (NA), one NA delegate moved on
Saturday to abolish the council through a constitutional amendment.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the first day of a snap meeting, assemblyman Hsieh
Ming-hui accused the Grand Justices of overstepping their authority
by annulling a decision by the country's supreme lawmaking body
responsible for amending the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The Grand Justices Council ruled late last month that the NA's
decision by a secret ballot last September to extend its members
terms is invalid because of its self-interested nature and the lack
of transparency in the vote.</P>
      <P>Riding on the backlash of his colleagues against the ruling,
Hsieh accused the Grand Justices Council of infringing on the
law-making powers of the assembly and of threatening to upset the
democratic process by abusing its power to explain the Constitution.</P>
      <P>He also derided the Grand Justices as hypocritical, and claimed
the council has itself issued a self-serving ruling to guarantee its
members the stature of regular judges with a lifetime salary, despite
the fact that their terms are for just eight years.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Grand Justices Council have handed down a total
of 499 rulings in the last 55 years, or 10 rulings on average per
year, Hsieh said it is not worthwhile to have a body which does such
little work but for which each of the 15 grand justices are paid a
staggering NT$350,000 (US$11,600) per month by the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>He claimed a proposal to do away the Grand Justices Council has
already been signed by about 70 NA deputies, above the minimum
requirement of 63 signatures for any constitutional amendment
proposal. He added that he will present the initiative for debate in
the near future.</P>
      <P>The NA concluded its preparatory meeting for a snap conference on
Saturday, during which delegates took turns to lambaste the Grand
Justices Council as one of the causes of the country's
"constitutional chaos."</P>
      <P>Acting NA Speaker Chen Ching-jang said after the meeting that the
delegates will try to make the assembly a nominal organization
elected and convened only as the need arises.</P>
      <P>Under a plan negotiated by NA delegates of the Kuomintang and
Democratic Progressive Party, the body will shift its main job of
amending the Constitution to the Legislative Yuan, while keeping the
rest of its responsibilities.</P>
      <P>If everything goes as planned, the proposal to eviscerate the
assembly will pass the third and last reading on April 25, just in
time to prevent the next National Assembly election slated for May 6.</P>
      <P>Tired of being described as the culprits of Taiwan's
"constitutional chaos" because of their tinkering with the country's
basic law, many delegates are more than willing to abolish the
National Assembly for good.</P>
      <P>During Saturday's meeting, they tabled a proposal to ask the
Central Election Commission to postpone the National Assembly
election pending the outcome of the current session.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MARCH EXPORTS AND IMPORTS HIT SINGLE-MONTH HIGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's import and export trade each hit
single-month highs in March, marking resounding double-digit growth
for the sixth consecutive month, the Ministry of Finance (MOF)
reported on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exported US$11.98 billion-worth of products in March, and
imported US$11.54 billion-worth of commodities, for a monthly surplus
of US$440 million, said MOF officials.</P>
      <P>The shining performance indicates that Taiwan's brisk foreign
trade has not been affected by the March 18 presidential election,
the officials noted.</P>
      <P>They attributed the March growth -- 15.2 percent for exports and
23.8 percent for imports -- mainly to a continued expansion of
business in major trading areas including the United States, Asia and
Europe.</P>
      <P>In March, Taiwan exports to Japan, South Korea and Southeast
Asian countries soared 35.1 percent, 43 percent and 22 percent,
respectively, while imports from the United States, Japan and
Southeast Asia surged an average of 15 percent, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>Cumulatively, Taiwan exported US$32.90 billion-worth of
commodities in the first quarter of this year, up 18.5 percent from
the same period of the previous year, while it imported US$31.57
billion-worth of goods, up 25.7 percent.</P>
      <P>As a result, Taiwan posted a trade surplus of US$1.33 billion for
the first three months of the year.</P>
      <P>While electronics, telecommunications, machinery, iron and steel
products and optical goods and equipment enjoyed brisk export trade
in the first quarter, products from traditional manufacturing
industries also posted improved sales, they said.</P>
      <P>By area, exports to the United States grew 9.2 percent in the
first quarter, while exports to Asia jumped 27.5 percent.</P>

soared 25 percent during the period, according to MOF tallies.</P>
      <P>MOF officials estimated that the upturn trend in two-way trade
will continue to gain momentum for the rest of this year as world
economies pick up steam and global demand grows.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WHITE-COLLAR WORKERS CARE MOST ABOUT GETTING ALONG WITH CO-WORKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  8  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's white-collar workers' principal
concern is getting along with co-workers, according to the results of
a survey released on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The survey conducted by Cheers, a quarterly magazine launched by
the monthly Commonwealth, found that getting along with colleagues
and superiors is the major source of happiness or worry for the
country's white-collar workers, estimated at 3.56 million.</P>
      <P>Asked about the most painful facet of the workplace, the top two
answers from the respondents had to do with human relations: not
getting along with direct superiors (35.7 percent}, and not getting
along with colleagues (34.5 percent).</P>
      <P>The survey of 396 college graduates aged over 20 also found that
42 percent feel their sense of achievement in their work falls far
short of their expectations, while 43 percent feel it more or less
matches their expectations.</P>
      <P>Sixty-six percent of those polled said work is one of the most
important parts of their lives, equal to family and religion.</P>
      <P>Asked about their impressions of their top three favored jobs,
only 17.7 percent said their most desired job would be challenging,
while 17.3 percent said their favorite job would pay a high salary.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, 35 percent said they are not satisfied with
their wages, with manufacturing industry workers expressing the
greatest discontent (41.5 percent), followed by telecommunications
industry personnel.</P>
      <P>High-tech industry workers expressed dissatisfaction with their
working hours, with 86 percent of the respondents saying they work
more than eight hours a day, and up to 12 percent working more than
12 hours a day.</P>
      <P>Asked about their loyalty to their companies, it was found that
the respondents tended to show more loyalty to themselves than to
their companies, hardly surprising in this time of mergers and
reorganizations.</P>
      <P>Asked what they would do in the face of company belt-tightening
and a 10-percent salary cut when the company is in trouble, the
survey found that 31.1 percent of those polled would work even harder
to help tide the company over its difficulties, but 53.6 percent said
they would do their share of work but would not shoulder the
company's difficulties.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, 6.7 percent said their working attitude would
become more lax, while 8.7 percent said they would jump ship for a
new job as soon as they could.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHIEF OF GENERAL STAFF NOT MULLING OFFER OF DEFENSE MINISTER JOB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  8  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chief of the General Staff Tang Yao-ming
said on Saturday that out of consideration for national stability, he
will not take the helm of the Ministry of National Defense (MND).</P>
      <P>Tang explained at a press conference that as a subordinate of
National Defense Minister Tang Fei, who has been invited by
President-elect Chen Shui-bian to serve as the nation's premier, and
for a personal promotion, he should accept the offer to serve as
national defense chief.</P>
      <P>But he noted that Chen's inauguration on May 20 will see a
drastic change of political scene, and if this was to be coupled with
similar changes in the military, it would affect national stability.</P>
      <P>Tang said that he had already exchanged views with the
commander-in-chiefs of the three branches of the armed services, and
that they had accepted his decision.</P>
      <P>But he also stressed that he will not interfere or comment on the
lineup of the new administration, adding that the military will fully
support whoever serves as the defense chief.</P>
      <P>The lineup of Chen's Cabinet has become the focus of intense
scrutiny in the wake of the March 18 presidential election, which saw
an end to more than 50 years of Kuomintang rule in Taiwan, and the
victory of Chen and his pro-independence Democratic Progressive
Party.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SENATE LEADER PRESSES FOR ARM SALES TO TAIWAN WHILE SUPPORTING TSEA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  7  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
(R-MS) is pressing for arms sales to Taiwan while aggressively
supporting a bill designed to strengthen military ties with the
island, his spokesman said on Friday.</P>
      <P>John Czwartacki dismissed as an "irresponsible piece of
journalism" a report in Friday's Washington Times that Lott intended
to kill the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act (TSEA) in exchange for
the administration's promise to sell four Aegis guided-missile
destroyers to the island.</P>
      <P>Lott "wants both the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act and a robust
package of arms for Taiwan", Czwartacki stressed.</P>
      <P>President Bill Clinton's administration opposes the TSEA, which
calls for closer military ties with Taiwan, and is reviewing Taiwan's
request to purchase the four Aegis destroyers.</P>
      <P>Claiming it will tilt the power balance across the Taiwan Strait
and embroil the United States more deeply in the Taipei-Beijing
dispute, Clinton's administration had lobbied against the TSEA even
before the bill cruised through the House of Representatives on Oct.
26. It has since been shelved by the Senate at the request of the
White House.</P>
      <P>By the same token, the Pentagon is being cautious in weighing the
sale of the destroyers that would address the island's weakness in
defenses against a Beijing missile attack.</P>
      <P>The Washington Times said Lott, one of the co-sponsors of the
TSEA, tried to use the bill as leverage against the government to
press it for concessions on arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If the Pentagon approves the deal, two of the four destroyers --
with a price tag of US$1 billion each -- will be built in Lott's home
state of Mississippi, and will boost the senator's re-election
campaign in November.</P>
      <P>The newspaper quoted sources as saying that defense officials
opted to offer Taiwan a "watered-down" version of the destroyer
without the air defense system or Tomahawk cruise missiles.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CETRANET'S VIRTUAL TRADE MART SERVING BUSINESS COMMUNITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  8  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As Taiwan's leading trade promotion
organization, the China External Trade Development Council (CETRA)
plays a pioneering role in the business world, and in the new
Internet era, CETRA has been keeping up with developments.</P>
      <P>The "Virtual Trade Mart" proves its effectiveness in this regard.</P>
      <P>For the last two years, CETRA has gradually developed an Internet
service of all its trade information. The CetraNet website provides
not only information on CETRA activities, but also data on
international trade opportunities, an introduction to Taiwan
manufacturers and traders, and official statistics.</P>
      <P>The "Virtual Trade Mart" is a service for Taiwan traders and
foreign buyers. The online mart includes over 35,000 Taiwan companies
and 150,000 product items. Foreign buyers can locate whatever
products or services are listed on the website through e-mail or fax.</P>
      <P>CETRA Deputy Secretary-General Thomas Tsou said that many
manufacturers are amazed by the effectiveness of the online trading
system, and some of them report receiving online orders or inquiries
every week.</P>
      <P>Tsou attributed the effectiveness of the "Virtual Trade Mart" to
CETRA's years of efforts in developing an enormous data bank with
over 100,000 items of business information, including Taiwan
manufacturers, traders, foreign buyers and international trade fairs.
This data bank is open to CETRA members free of charge.</P>
      <P>Many small- and medium-sized businesses took their first step
into the Internet world through the "Virtual Trade Mart," according
to Melody Lin, deputy director of CetraNet Center.</P>
      <P>Lin said that 37,000 Taiwan manufacturers have registered with
the "Virtual Trade Mart," and claimed that trade revenue of these
manufacturers accounts for 95 percent of the nation's foreign trade
value. These manufacturers can be taken as an index of the
development of e-commerce in Taiwan, she said.</P>
      <P>In many international conferences and seminars on e-commerce,
CETRA delegates are very often questioned on online trading by their
counterparts from Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, and Taiwan,
together with Japan and Hong Kong, is considered advanced in
e-commerce among Asian countries, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>Tsou emphasized that CETRA hopes to further explore trade
opportunities for Taiwan traders with all the convenience provided by
the Internet environment. Since the concept is well accepted by
industry, CETRA is now studying possibilities to provide more
services in cash flow, commodity flow and logistics through the
Internet.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DALAI LAMA TO VISIT TAIWAN AGAIN THIS YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader
of Tibet, will make his second visit to Taiwan later this year,
sources from the Tibet Religious Foundation said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>However, owing to his tight schedule for this year, which was
arranged a year ago, the Dalai Lama will be unable to visit in May to
attend President-elect Chen Shui-bian's inauguration slated for May
20, a foundation spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Although the Dalai Lama cannot come in May, he will definitely
visit Taiwan before the end of this year to propagate Buddhism and to
meet some "old friends" of his, the spokesman added.</P>
      <P>The Tibetan leader, revered among his people as a god-king, paid
a four-day visit to Taiwan in March 1997.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said bilateral relations between Taiwan and Tibet
have grown by leaps and bounds ever since the 1997 visit, and
religious exchanges became increasingly close between the two sides,
enabling the Tibet Religious Foundation to be established in Taipei
smoothly in September of the same year, he added.</P>

(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) will
convene a meeting to discuss putting off the May 6 National Assembly
election after receiving formal notification from the assembly, CEC
Deputy Secretary-General Tsai Li-hsueh said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The assembly adopted a resolution earlier in the day to shelve
the election for the time being because assembly deputies will amend
the Constitution in the coming weeks to eviscerate the assembly into
an "empty-frame" institution.</P>
      <P>As the National Assembly election is expected to cost more than
NT$1 billion (US$32.3 million), the deputies thus moved to call for
the election to be shelved for the time being.</P>
      <P>The CEC has already announced that it will accept registrations
between April 9-13 from those wishing to participate in the election
scheduled to be held on May 6. The four-year term of the incumbent
assembly deputies expires on May 19.</P>
      <P>Now that the assembly has adopted the resolution to call for
postponement of the election, however, the CEC will convene a meeting
of its members after the resolution is forwarded to it through the
Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The assembly has 339 seats, of which 239 are elected from among
25 counties and cities, as well as lowland and highland aboriginal
regions. Eighty others are elected from the nationwide constituency,
with a further 20 elected from among overseas Chinese communities,
both through a system of proportional representation.</P>
      <P>The Kuomintang, which lost its 54-year reign of power on Taiwan
to the Democratic Progressive Party in the March 18 presidential
election, has completed its nomination of candidates for the assembly
election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US IGNORING MAINLAND CHINESE THREAT TO TAIWAN, ANALYSTS CLAIM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  8 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States has totally ignored
the nature and magnitude of the mainland Chinese threat to Taiwan,
according to American defense analysts.</P>
      <P>Brian Kennedy, vice president of the Claremont Institute in
California, claimed recently that Taiwan does not have effective air
or missile defense systems. "But the US commitment appears to be
somewhat unclear, and that is the real danger for Taiwan," he went
on.</P>
      <P>"A very dangerous situation will occur if we are ambiguous about
our willingness to defend Taiwan. We should be very willing to
discuss with China and Taiwan future relations so that a democratic
unification can occur. But we should make very clear that we are not
willing to acquiesce to a reunification by force," emphasized
Kennedy.</P>
      <P>The defense analyst said US ambiguity on whether it will come to
Taiwan's defense in the event of an attack by mainland China is
inviting a situation similar to that which existed in the Middle East
immediately before the Gulf War. By not unequivocally stating its
intention to stand by Kuwait, the United States led Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein to believe he could attack Kuwait with impunity.</P>
      <P>"They say the mainland is not going to attack and even if it
wanted to, it could not do it. But in the past year people have been
forced to admit there is a threat to Taiwan's security that is new
and potentially more dangerous," noted Stephen J. Yates, a senior
policy analyst in the Asian Studies Center at the Washington-based
Heritage Foundation.</P>
      <P>He was commenting on questions raised by a new, unpublished
Pentagon report, which says Taiwan is more vulnerable to attack from
mainland China than generally recognized because Taiwan's isolated
military has fallen behind technologically.</P>
      <P>The highly classified Pentagon report points out problems with
the Taiwanese military's ability to defend against aircraft,
ballistic missiles and cruise missiles.</P>
      <P>The United States has presumed Taiwan is strong enough to defend
itself and does not need more advanced US weapons, Yates said. "But
in the last few months people have begun to realize that Taiwan's
defense systems and equipment have atrophied after two decades of
diplomatic isolation. Not only is there a greater threat from the
mainland, but Taiwan is less capable of efficiently marshaling its
own resources to defend itself."</P>
      <P>Taiwan is unnecessarily -- and some say unlawfully -- being
penalized for lack of diplomatic recognition from the United States
because of the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979. According to this Act,
the Clinton administration is required to consult with Congress and
to provide Taiwan with defense articles and services based solely on
Taiwan's defense needs, "not based on the politics of US-China
relations and certainly not based on any expressed opposition by
Beijing to arms sales to Taiwan," stressed Yates.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ABOLISHING GRAND JUSTICE COUNCIL WON'T RESOLVE ISSUE: SOONG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hualien,  eastern  Taiwan,  April  9  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chairman of the newly
established People First Party (PFP) James Soong said on Sunday that
a National Assembly (NA) proposal to abolish the Grand Justice
Council will not resolve the problem.</P>
      <P>Soong said that the system of government must be respected and
that any abolishing or establishing of government institutions should
be carefully evaluated beforehand.</P>
      <P>The NA proposal to abolish the Grand Justice Council because it
is dissatisfied with the council's explanation of a constitutional
issue is a knee-jerk reaction which does not resolve the issue but is
no more than a quarrel over a matter of emotion rather than reason,
Soong said.</P>
      <P>Soong made the remarks at the inauguration of the office of the
PFP's Hualien chapter.</P>
      <P>He also said a NA resolution last August to extend the tenure of
NA deputies runs counter to the voice of the populace, violates
democratic, social and procedural justice.</P>
      <P>Asked about the future of NA, Soong said that although the PFP
has agreed to the establishment of a unicameral parliament, a lot of
related measures must be addressed to achieve that end.</P>
      <P>Soong also said that both the Kuomintang and the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) should echo the voice of people and not
monopolize national policy because of party interests. If they do
not, he went on, the populace will "use their votes to express their
opposition," he added.</P>
      <P>Asked about news reports that Legislator Liao Fu-pen (KMT-Yunlin)
wants to join the PFP, Soong said that the PFP welcomes those who
share the ideals of the PFP's four-point assertion.</P>
      <P>The four-point assertion is: maintain cross-Taiwan Strait peace;
maintain political democratization; maintain social justice; and

    <HEADLINE>PUBLIC ENDORSEMENT URGED TO ABOLISH NATIONAL ASSEMBLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  9  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An alliance formed among more than 20
social activity organizations on Sunday launched a public drive to
abolish the National Assembly (NA), and urged major political parties
to join forces with them.</P>
      <P>The "Public Alliance to Abolish the National Assembly" urged the
public and the four leading political parties -- the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), the People First Party (PFP), the Kuomintang
(KMT) and the New Party -- to give their endorsement by signing on at
the "www.taiwanrepublic.com/sayno.htm" website, and announced that
they will sponsor a large-scale rally next Sunday to demonstrate
their bid.</P>
      <P>Although abolishing the NA has been a common aspiration of the
people of Taiwan, according to a spokesman for the alliance, he added
that it is inconceivable that the political parties are preparing for
a re-election of NA deputies on the one hand, while shouting for the
abolishment of the body on the other.</P>
      <P>"Another NA election will only cost more money and make the issue
more complicated," he argued.</P>
      <P>The Council of Grand Justices ruled last month that a two-year
term expansion by the current NA was unconstitutional and that an
election should be held to elect new deputies.</P>
      <P>A number of NA deputies from the DPP and KMT were to hold a
meeting on Sunday to study ways to abolish the body before the May 6
election date, thus preventing the PFP, led by former Taiwan Governor
James Soong, from gaining a foothold in the NA.</P>
      <P>Soong lost the March 18 presidential election to the DPP's
President-elect Chen Shui-bian by a slim margin of 2.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Central Election Commission (CEC) and its branches
around the island began receiving registrations for the fourth NA as
scheduled, despite a demand from the current NA that the election be
postponed.</P>
      <P>The registration will run through Thursday, and candidates will
draw their campaign numbers on April 22, three days before the
election campaign officially kicks off, CEC Vice Secretary-General
L.S. Tsai said.</P>
      <P>As to the NA's election postponement demand, Tsai said the CEC
will discuss the issue after receiving formal notification from the
NA, while all election arrangements will continue to be made in
compliance with the law.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THREE DIRECT LINKS NOT POSSIBLE THIS YEAR: TAIWAN BUSINESSMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  April  9  (CNA)
(By S.C. Peng and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan businessmen with operations in
mainland China are pessimistic about the likelihood of the
establishment of the "three direct links" between Taiwan and mainland
China within this year.</P>
      <P>Although the setting up of direct trade, transport and postal
links across the Taiwan Strait ranks high on the policy agenda of
Taiwan's President-elect Chen Shui-bian, mainland-based Taiwan
businessmen feel that the issue is no longer a bargaining chip for
Taiwan in its dealings with mainland China.</P>
      <P>"If Chinese communists promised to open the three direct links
now, it undoubtedly would be a big face-saver for Chen," one
businessman commented, pointing out that "mainland China will not do
so at present judging from the current situation between the two
sides."</P>
      <P>"In fact, the establishment of the three direct links has a
greater political than economic effect for the mainland," the
businessman, a Beijing-based transport operator from Taiwan who
requested anonymity, told CNA.</P>
      <P>The mainland Chinese authorities are fully aware that Taiwan
businesses will be the major beneficiary of the proposed opening of
the three direct links across the Taiwan Strait because of Taiwan
firms' greater competitiveness, he said, adding that "the Chinese
communists understand very well that the establishment of such ties
will not benefit the mainland on the economic front."</P>
      <P>As the matter will bring only political benefits to mainland
China, Beijing is in no hurry to talk about the issue with Taiwan at
present," he observed, claiming that "Chinese communists are waiting
for the best moment to discuss the issue with Taiwan in order to seek
the maximum benefits on the political front."</P>
      <P>Even though direct transport ties were to be opened between the
two sides, the setting of the status of the cross-strait routes would
also be another problem, another Taiwan businessman surnamed Huang
told CNA.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan wishes to set the cross-strait routes as
"international" freight routes, mainland China's desire is to
designate Taiwan-mainland routes as "domestic" ones, he elaborated,
saying that a better solution might be to assign the cross-strait
routes as "regional lines" which would in return affect the number of
flights and price-setting between the two sides."</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan media reports that mainland Chinese authorities
have accused some Taiwan companies of cashing in on the mainland
while supporting pro-independence forces in Taiwan, a businessman
from Taiwan told CNA that they are not worried about any retaliation
by Beijing.</P>
      <P>The businessman, a supporter of the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) who also asked not to be named, asserted that
backing the DPP and its President-elect Chen does not mean he backs
Taiwan's split from the mainland.</P>
      <P>Lamenting the fact that some ranking Beijing officials hold
exactly this belief, the Taiwan businessman claimed that Chen will be
able to bravely broaden Taiwan-mainland relations, and added that he
does not think Chen would sell Taiwan out, pointing to the example of
former US President Richard Nixon, who he said was an staunch
anti-communist but was able nevertheless to break a decade-old
impasse between Beijing and Washington.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, most large Taiwan companies should have taken
measures to avoid political risks before investing in the mainland,
he noted.</P>
      <P>Turning to the question of the personal safety of Taiwan
businessmen in mainland China, most Taiwan executives working there
said they are not troubled by the problem as they are "simple
businessmen" who are not interested in politics.</P>
      <P>No matter which party is in power, stabilizing public confidence
should be the top priority for the government, they contended,
voicing the belief that "there will be no retaliation from Beijing."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT-ELECT CHEN TALKS ABOUT CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  April  9  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In an interview with Washington Post columnist Lally
Weymouth in Taipei, Chen said "Of course we want to move in a
direction of reconciliation and dialogue. We do not want
conflict. But in cross-strait relations, we feel it is important
to have goodwill and sincerity. Only then can relations improve.
But goodwill and sincerity cannot be only one way."</P>
      <P>As to the Democratic Progressive Party's long-standing
pro-independence position, Chen told Weymouth that "We do
advocate the right to self-determination, but that is not the
same as advocating Taiwanese independence. Our platform says that
Taiwan's independence must be decided by the people of Taiwan (in
a referendum). But having the right to hold a referendum does not
mean that one must immediately do so. As president-elect, I will
not initiate a referendum on the independence-unification
question. Unless China invades or uses force, we will not declare
independence unilaterally."</P>
      <P>As to the "one China" principle, the president-elect pointed
out that "If the 'one China' principle is defined as Taiwan being
a province or local government of the People's Republic of China,
this is not acceptable to the vast majority of people in Taiwan.
Nor can (China) expect Taiwan to become the second Hong Kong. How
can they expect me, as president of this country, to accept
Taiwan's demotion in status to a province?"</P>
      <P>Chen added that "If the mainland insists that acceptance of
'one China' is a precondition, it will be hard to resume
dialogue. We prefer to see it as an issue that can be discussed
(in talks). We can discuss the definition of 'one China' and
arrive at a consensus."</P>
      <P>Chen said "We hope talks can start with no predetermined outcome
and that both sides can respect each other on an equal basis. But if
China does insist on a precondition and an ultimate outcome, then
such talks would not appear equal."</P>
      <P>Chen noted that whether he would like to visit mainland
China "is not a matter of whether I want to go but whether the
PRC has the goodwill to let me go. I would like to lead a
delegation on a friendship visit to the PRC. I also sincerely
want to invite China's leaders like President Jiang Zemin or
Premier Zhu Rongji to come to Taiwan. And I have invited Mr. Wang
Daohan (China's veteran cross-strait negotiator) to attend my
inauguration. But according to newspaper reports, they are not
interested in such an invitation."</P>
      <P>As to Taiwan's relationship with the United States, Chen
said there are three key areas for improving or consolidating: to
continue upholding the universal values of democracy and freedom,
to maintain peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, and
to continue to increase trade and commercial relations between
the two countries.</P>
      <P>"We feel that a democratic China will contribute to
permanent peace in this region. Therefore, we support U.S.
efforts to improve its relations with China. While we seek to
normalize the cross-strait relationship -- especially in the area
of business and trade -- we are happy to see the United States
and China improve their economic relations. Therefore, I am
willing to support the U.S. normalization of trade relations with
the PRC. The improvement of U.S.-China relations is not
necessarily harmful for Taiwan," said Chen.</P>
      <P>He is convinced that Taiwan's military preparedness has
improved significantly over the past few years, but there
certainly is also room for improvement, especially in areas of
professional training and ability to use modern or high-tech
defense equipment. "We also need to improve U.S.-Taiwan military
cooperation," stressed Chen.</P>
      <P>When talking about the outgoing Kuomintang government's arms
purchasing strategies, Chen said "We have only one national
interest: The welfare of the people must not be endangered by a
transition of government. And therefore, we have said that the
(annual U.S.-Taiwan arms sales) talks scheduled for April should not
be delayed simply because of a transition of government."</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT FORMALLY GIVES GREEN LIGHT TO TANG SERVING AS NEW PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  10  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Acting Chairman of the Kuomintang Lien
Chan has approved National Defense Minister Tang Fei's request to
serve as the premier in the next administration.</P>
      <P>Tang requested the approval from the KMT Central Committee in a
written report on Friday, and Lien formally gave him the green light
on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Tang, a KMT veteran, was invited by President-elect Chen
Shui-bian to help form the Cabinet in the wake of the March 18
presidential election, which saw Chen of the Democratic Progressive
Party come to power, ending more than five decades of KMT rule on the
island.</P>
      <P>Tang said in his report that, considering the tense state of
cross-strait relations and the stark national security situation, he
decided to assume the post of premier without giving too much thought
to possible criticism from others.</P>
      <P>But "as there is no precedent" in KMT party history for a KMT
member serving in the major post under a different political party,
Tang said he asked for the KMT Central Committee's approval.</P>
      <P>Lien agreed to Tang serving as the premier, but said that he must
do so in his own capacity and suspend all political activity during
the period of his premiership.</P>
      <P>KMT Spokesman Jason Hu also said the stance of the KMT is clear,
which is that in the true spirit of party politics, the DPP's
invitation to KMT members to serve in the new government should be
conducted through party-to-party consultations. If they are not
conducted in this manner, the KMT will not endorse KMT members who
join the new cabinet, Hu added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT-ELECT CONTINUES MEETING POLITICAL, SOCIAL HEAVYWEIGHTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President-elect Chen Shui-bian continued
to meet with political and social heavyweights on Monday in an
apparent bid to seek support for his efforts to put together a
broad-based Cabinet.</P>
      <P>To broaden the base of support for his government, which is
scheduled to take office on May 20, Chen has taken the valuable time
before his inauguration to consult with key figures of other parties
and independents to exchange views in order to govern effectively.</P>
      <P>Garnering only 39.3 percent of the vote, Chen won the March 18
presidential election and became a "minority" president. Meanwhile,
his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is still in a minority in the
legislature.</P>
      <P>Chen met with Premier Vincent Siew of the Kuomintang government
on Monday to exchange views on administrative affairs.</P>
      <P>During the one-hour closed-door talk, according to government
spokesman Chao Yi, Chen expressed appreciation to Siew for the
out-going government's decision to use money from the National
Stabilization Fund to stabilize the Taiwan stock market and for
convening an emergency national security conference immediately after
the presidential election.</P>
      <P>For his part, Siew said he hopes that the major policies started
by his Cabinet will continue after Premier-designate Tang Fei takes
office. These policies include a sweeping reform of the country's
police rank and file, and an up-ward adjustment of the military's
salary and treatment.</P>
      <P>Chen also consulted with Siew over his appointment of Defense
Minister Tang Fei as premier. Siew gave a thumbs-up to Tang's
performance during his tenure as defense minister.</P>
      <P>Also on Monday, Chen met with UFO Radio Chairman Jaw Shao-kang to
exchange views "mainly on political ideas," according to the
government spokesman.</P>
      <P>Chen said he has long admired Jaw for his superb communication
skills -- as a legislator, a Cabinet-level official, as well as a
media executive -- demonstrating extraordinary abilities and charisma
in all of these posts.</P>
      <P>Jaw lost to Chen in Taipei's mayoral election six years ago. Two
years ago, when Chen determined to seek a re-election, Jaw forecast
that Chen would win the presidential election if he lost the mayoral
bid. Even though almost nobody took his prediction very seriously
back then, it proved to be amazingly accurate.</P>
      <P>After his meeting with Jaw, Chen declined to disclose whether he
is going to offer Jaw a Cabinet post, but did stress that he will
recruit all the high-caliber men and women he can to work in his new
government, including talent from the Kuomintang, the New Party, and
the newly-formed People First Party.</P>
      <P>Chen also told Jaw that he is fully confident that he will open a
new era for Taiwan on the thorny issue of cross-strait relations
during his tenure as president. He called on decision makers in
Beijing to follow suit by demonstrating goodwill and sincerity so as
to help break the impasse across the strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT APPEALS FOR `PATIENCE' ON REFORMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Kuomintang spokesman on Monday appealed
for "patience" from the public and "a little more time" to carry out
party reforms.</P>
      <P>Jason Hu made the remarks in a radio interview before the KMT 
held the second meeting of its reform committee, which was formed
after the party's humiliating defeat in the March 18 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan, the candidate of the KMT, which boasts 2
million members, finished third in the election, managing only 23.1
percent of the vote, far behind Democratic Progressive Party Chen
Shui-bian's 39.3 percent, and independent candidate James Soong's
36.8 percent.</P>
      <P>Hu said that the public may not yet see signs of the party's
reforms, but he asked for "a little more time," saying that members
of the party will travel around the island to gather grassroots
opinions and then spend one or two weeks compiling this information
before having the report ready in about six months time.</P>
      <P>Hu said the work needs to be done cautiously as it may involve
reforms in the party's organization.</P>
      <P>Hu stressed that Lien Chan, the KMT's acting chairman, has told
him that if there are diverse views on how to reform the party, the
public will have to have patience as the reforms will take time since
they are not going to be based on the views of one person.</P>
      <P>As for the defection of KMT members and disciplinary actions
taken against them, Hu said the KMT must deal with them resolutely
according to the party's regulations. If the party fails to do so, he
asked how can it expect voters to support KMT-nominated candidates in
the next election.</P>
      <P>The KMT has launched a series of disciplinary actions against
several of its members for openly supporting candidates other than
the KMT's Lien Chan in the March 18 presidential election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF READY TO READJUST ITS POSITION, FUNCTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  10  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The quasi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), consigned by the ROC government to conduct actual
exchanges with mainland China, is scheduled to meet Wednesday to
review its previous work and its role in the future.</P>
      <P>C.V. Chen, the first SEF secretary-general and incumbent board
director, initiated the SEF meeting of board directors and
supervisors, saying that it is time for the SEF to discuss its future
position and functions now that a new government is taking shape. He
also pointed out that, according to the ROC National Reunification
Guidelines, Taiwan is entering the middle-stage era, or the era of
starting an official dialogue with the mainland.</P>
      <P>SEF Vice Chairman Shi Hwei-yow said the SEF is ready for a major
personnel reshuffle as a new government gets ready to take office
following opposition Democratic Progressive Party candidate Chen
Shui-bian's election as the new ROC president on March 18.</P>
      <P>Shi said the SEF will remain open on its future as well as on its
personnel arrangement. The foundation will continue its commitment to
doing things for the government and will continue to strengthen its
functions as a private-run body as well, Shi stressed.</P>
      <P>The SEF was founded in 1991 on the commission of the ROC
government to handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence of formal
contacts between the two sides. Fifty-three donors jointly raised
NT$670 million (US$21.6 million) to finance SEF activities.</P>
      <P>As about half of its board directors and supervisors are
government officials, and its ranking executives, including the
chairman, secretary-general and deputy secretary-general, were
appointed by the government, a major personnel reshuffle is seen as
imminent and inevitable with the inauguration of President-elect Chen
on May 20.</P>

      <P>President-elect Chen Shui-bian on Monday
met with US Senator John Rockefeller (D-WV) at Chen's campaign
headquarters for a discussion on a wide range of issues.</P>
      <P>Rockefeller, who maintains close connections with both Taiwan and
mainland China, said both sides of the strait should exercise
restraint to avoid conflict at a time when mainland China faces
various internal difficulties and Taiwan is seeing a change of
government.</P>
      <P>Currently chairman of the US-ROC Business Council, Rockefeller
told Chen that he is more than willing to play a greater role in
efforts to bolster US-Taiwan relations, whether they be military or
political.</P>
      <P>Rockefeller said he has noticed that President-elect Chen has
been "intelligently careful" in making decisions about the line-up of
his new government.</P>
      <P>He added that he is particularly impressed with Chen's strong
efforts in trying to reduce cross-strait tension and in fostering
even closer ties with the United States.</P>
      <P>When asked by Taipei reporters whether he approves of a second
visit to the United States by President Lee Teng-hui, Rockefeller
said he does not see such a visit as a plus to relations among the
US, Taiwan and mainland China, at least for the moment. He said any
move that may cause misunderstandings or unnecessary provocations is
the last thing that is needed at this time.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is launching an
anti-Western campaign in order to tighten its control over free
speech by purging outspoken reform-minded intellectuals at high-level
institutions and in the media, according to a report by the
Australian on Monday.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Beijing, the daily reported several academics
have lost their jobs, and the editor and founder of two popular
publications in Beijing -- Jingping Consumer Guide and the national
weekly China Business -- has been ordered sacked.</P>
      <P>Another daily in Nanking -- Jiangnan Times -- was ordered closed
down after it reported on the murders of a Daimler Chrysler
representative and his wife and two children, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>The purge follows warnings by president Jiang Zemin against
"bourgeois liberalism," a Communist Party catch-all phrase, and an
editorial in a party newspaper proclaiming that "Marxism is the
leading ideology at higher institutions."</P>
      <P>The daily quoted a sacked Beijing Academy of Social Sciences
academic as saying that "political persecution is mainly happening at
state-run work units and institutions and is aimed at taking away the
economic livelihood of people advocating liberalism."</P>
      <P>The daily reported the crackdown also follows a February riot by
20,000 miners in a town 400 km northeast of Beijing in which police
and soldiers fought pitched battles with workers protesting over

    <TEXT>
      <P>Eyeing the huge and potentially
lucrative market of mainland China, computer and peripherals
suppliers in Kaohsiung are organizing a trade promotion tour to
Fujian Province's Xiamen City.</P>
      <P>The trade mission, scheduled to depart for Xiamen Thursday, is
planning to secure a base in Xiamen's Electronics City to promote
sales of Taiwan-made computers and peripheral products, said Chen
Chin-ho, chairman of the Kaohsiung Computer Association.</P>
      <P>According to the Association's survey, sales of computers and
related products in Xiamen City alone totaled 5.6 billion renminbi
(US$700 million) in 1996, and soared to reach 10 billion renminbi
(US$1.25 billion) in 1999.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP SHOULD NOT BECOME SINGLE MAJOR PARTY: FORMER DPP LEGISLATOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 10 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Legislator Hsu Kuo-tai said on Monday that the DPP, which will be the
ruling party after May 20, should not be allowed to become the single
major party in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsu made the remarks when he paid a visit to the legislative
caucus of the newly founded People First Party (PFP). He filed an
application for the membership of the PFP in order to maintain
consistency in his role as a member of the opposition, Hsu announced.
He added that he would also urge his brother Hsu Hsin-liang, to
interact benignly with PFP Chairman James Soong.</P>
      <P>Hsu Hsin-liang is a founding member of the DPP and served two
terms as its chairman before he broke ranks to run as an independent
in the March 18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuo-tai pointed out that Hsu Hsin-liang would not retire from
the island's political arena after his defeat in the presidential
election. Moreover, the former DPP chairman shares some ideology with
Soong, Hsu Kuo-tai added.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuo-tai was received by Chiu Chuang-huan, convener of the PFP
legislative caucus. Chiu noted that positive interaction between Hsu
and Soong is very likely, adding that the general public has called
for the PFP to recruit Hsu Kuo-tai, so that he can run as a PFP
member for a deputy-at-large seat in the National Assembly.</P>
      <P>Joining the PFP three days ago, Hsu Kuo-tai said that the future
political direction of the Hsu family is still up in the air. He was
referring to his brother Hsu Hsin-liang and Hsu Hsin-liang's wife Hsu
Chung Bi-hsia, who is also a DPP legislator.</P>
      <P>As for himself, said Hsu Kuo-tai, he will do his best to assist
the PFP in its campaign for the upcoming National Assembly election
scheduled in early May.</P>
      <P>The "people first" ideology of the PFP is the main reason for his
joining the party, Hsu Kuo-tai said, adding that the PFP must be
strong enough to balance the power of the DPP, so that the incoming
ruling party doesn't follow the example of the outgoing Kuomintang
and become the single major party on the island.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Japanese senator said on Monday that he
believes the appropriate time to invite Republic of China President
Lee Teng-hui to visit Japan will be at the year's end, but the exact
date has yet to be decided.</P>
      <P>Masakuni Murakami, vice president of the Japan-ROC Dietmen's
Council, made the remarks after a meeting between his council and a
ROC legislative delegation led by Jao Eng-chi, vice president of the
ROC's Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Murakami noted that Japan is scheduled to host this year's G-8
summit of industrialized nations in July, and the elections for
Parliament's lower house must be held by October. At the same time,
President Lee is also preoccupied with things at home, so that it
will be convenient for both sides to arrange for the visit late this
year.</P>
      <P>The senator announced on March 7 that he will launch an
organization committee to welcome Lee to visit Japan after his
retirement from the presidency on May 20. Tokyo Governor Shintaro
Ishihara, said at the time that he will join hands with Murakami to
support Lee's visit to Japan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a major daily in Taipei said that President Lee will
visit Japan in mid-November as a private citizen.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News reported that Lee will attend the Asia
Outlook Forum in Nagano, a seminar that has taken place over the past
nine years, alternating between Taiwan and Japan. Lee is scheduled to
speak as a distinguished alumnus at his alma mater, Kyoto Imperial

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There will be no further oil product price
hikes before May 20, Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang said on
Monday.</P>
      <P>Wang made the promise during a meeting with a group of lawmakers
from the Kuomintang (KMT) and the soon-to-be ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), who suggested that the minister avoid
adjusting oil prices before May 20, when the DPP's President-elect
Chen Shui-bian takes over the helm of the central government from the
KMT.</P>
      <P>Wang said that although price increases of oil products should be
made in compliance with relevant regulations, he accepted the
proposal after considering possible consumer price hikes resulting
from the move.</P>
      <P>Statistics released by the Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) showed
that the state-run company fell short of its revenue target by
NT$5.77 billion by the end of March, and another round of price hikes
are expected if it is to meet its annual target of NT$17.7 billion.</P>
      <P>The CPC raised prices of its oil products in the domestic market
by 2.99 percent on March 29. There has been speculation that the CPC
may announce another round of price adjustments in May.</P>

    <DATELINE>Beijing,   April   10   (CNA)
(By S. C. Peng and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Long-term activities of Taiwan
businessmen in mainland China should not be affected despite current
pressure from Beijing in the wake of the election of Chen Shui-bian
as Taiwan's next president, a Taiwan businessman with operations here
said on Monday.</P>
      <P>As Beijing is seeking to attract even more Taiwan companies to
invest in the mainland, the Taiwan businessman, who asked not to be
named, told CNA that Chinese communists will not scare away all
investors from Taiwan. Taiwan investment in the mainland already
totaled US$40 billion.</P>
      <P>At present, Beijing is principally asking large Taiwan companies
to clarify their political preference. This is seen as an attempt to
force Chen to give a clear endorsement to the "one China" framework
in his inaugural speech slated for May 20, according to the same
source, who maintains close relations with relevant mainland Chinese
officials.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether long-term operations by
pro-independence Taiwan businesses in the mainland will be affected,
he admitted that Beijing will continue to pressure such firms over
the short term. However, he added that there should be no such
problem over the long run, since no Taiwan company has ever been
purged by mainland authorities in the past because of its political
position.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the reported closure of a preparatory office
belonging to the Taiwan-based Evergreen Group in Shanghai on Sunday,
officials with the Taiwan Affairs Office under the State Council told
CNA that Evergreen shut down the office on its own volition.</P>
      <P>As to the question of whether a planned trip to Beijing slated
for April 26 by Stan Shih, chairman of Taiwan's computer giant Acer
Group, has hit a snag, the officials said they need to further check
the issue.</P>
      <P>Acer and Evergreen executives stationed in Beijing could not be
reached for confirmation of the news.</P>
      <P>Li Bingcai, deputy director of the State Council's Taiwan Affairs
Office, recently issued a stern statement to those Taiwan businesses
of promoting the independence movement on the island while cashing in
on in the mainland. His remarks were publicized by the official

    <TEXT>
      <P>Stock exchange tax revenue totaled NT$14.5
billion during the month of March, setting a single month record for
the past three years, according to statistics released by the
Ministry of Finance on Monday.</P>
      <P>The MOF said that total national tax revenue reached NT$156.4
billion (US$5 billion) in March, representing an increase of NT$5.8
billion or 3.8 percent over the same period during the previous year.</P>
      <P>The stock exchange tax topped the list with an 89.4 percent
growth rate, followed by business income tax with an 11.2 percent
increase.</P>
      <P>However, revenues from business tax, income tax and unitary
income tax showed negative growth of 6.9 percent, 1.6 percent and
10.7 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Apparently affected by the March 18 presidential election, the
Taiwan Stock Exchange fluctuated wildly in March. The weighted index
plummeted 617 points in a single day on March 13. Transaction volume
on the first trading day after the election totaled a paltry NT$79.6
billion, only to soar to reach a record high of NT$292.1 billion on
March 28.</P>
      <P>The MOF forecasts that revenue from stock exchange tax will break
the NT$122 billion mark by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>As of the end of March, total national revenues from tax had
accumulated to NT$938.1 billion (US$30 billion), a decrease of NT$7.4
billion or 0.8 percent as compared with the previous year.</P>
      <P>Business tax decreased by NT$24.4 billion or 11.4 percent, land
tax income decreased by NT17.9 billion or 14.1 percent, and revenues
from tariffs and duties fell NT41.5 billion or 1.9 percent.</P>
      <P>However, revenues from stock exchange taxes increased by NT$36.8
billion or 66.5 percent in comparison with the previous year. The MOF
said that 46.7 percent of its projected annual tax revenues have
already been raised.</P>

      <P>The number of Internet-accessible mobile
phone users are expected to reach 3 million in Taiwan by the end of
this year and will unleash a price war which might see phones offered
free to subscribers, a cell phone operator said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The number of mobile phone users hit 10 million last year in
Taiwan, and is expected to reach 14 million this year, which will
make the island the second-largest mobile phone market in Asia.</P>
      <P>In light of the development pattern overseas, the
Internet-accessible, or Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) mobile
phone introduced to the island early this year will reach numbers
similar to web surfers who use Internet Service Providers -- 3
million in Taiwan -- within the first year of its debut on a

operator.</P>
      <P>Predicting that four or five brands of WAP phones will hit the
market in Taiwan by May, Cheng said a fierce price war similar to
that for cellular phones last year, is looming, whereby companies

subscribe to their systems for a fixed period of time.</P>
      <P>Citing an overseas survey, Cheng said Internet users through WAP
phones will account for 41 percent of the total by 2005, compared
with 46 percent through fixed-line telephones, and 4 percent through
cable TV lines.</P>

      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui
is mulling a tour of several European countries after his term
expires on May 20, senior government sources revealed on Monday.</P>
      <P>The tour, tentatively slated to take place between June and July,
will include the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Austria, according to

      <P>No European states recognize the Republic of China
diplomatically, with the exception of the Vatican and Macedonia, but
neither state will be included in Lee's trip, said the sources.</P>
      <P>However, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Chen
Ming-cheng denied that his ministry has any knowledge about such a
trip, and pointed out that it has not been asked to make any
arrangements in this regard.</P>
      <P>He further noted that owing to Lee's "special status," it would
take time to prepare such a tour for him, even after his departure
from public office.</P>
      <P>Lee's trips to nations without diplomatic ties with Taiwan have
stirred up controversy in the past because mainland China, which
deems Taiwan a part of its territory, is paranoid about Lee's
presence in any country which recognizes Beijing.</P>
      <P>Most notable in this regard was Lee's private visit to the United
States in 1995 which led to such a furious protest from Beijing that
even ties between Washington and Beijing were strained.</P>

(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The outgoing Kuomintang has decided to
hold an extraordinary national congress from June 24-45 in Taipei to
elect a new chairman, party Spokesman Jason Hu said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The KMT, which suffered a humiliating defeat in the March 18
presidential election and lost its 54-year control of Taiwan, made
the decision at a meeting of the party's Central Committee earlier in
the day.</P>
      <P>The congress will also focus its discussions on revising the KMT
charter and on setting up a series of reform programs.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui stepped down from his post late last
month to take responsibility for the party's election defeat, and
Vice Chairman Lien Chan was named acting chairman.</P>
      <P>Lien has pledged to reform the party in order to win back the
party's ruling status in the next presidential election four years
hence.</P>
      <P>Addressing calls by some party members for a popular election of
the party chief by all KMT members rather than just by the congress
delegates as has traditionally been the case, Hu said that no
decision has been made in this regard.</P>
      <P>However, Hu went on to say that the new election may still need
to be elected by delegates in accordance with existing protocol
because a change in the electoral process would necessitate a charter
revision, a move which he described as inappropriate at present.</P>
      <P>To show its determination to undertake reforms, the meeting also
decided to hold the congress at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall instead
of the International Convention Center because the center gives the
impression of being too "luxurious," other party sources said.</P>
      <P>The party has previously held its congresses at the center, which
is considered Taipei's highest-class convention site.</P>

      <P>President-elect Chen Shui-bian said on
Tuesday that he is confident of Premier-designate Tang Fei's speedy
recovery from his "slight malaise."</P>
      <P>Chen said that Tang had reported the results of his physical
examination to him, and he had "full confidence in his full
recovery."</P>
      <P>Chen also said Tang's "slight malaise" will not affect his

found to have a tumor in his chest. Doctors have advised that he
undergo surgery to remove the benign thymoma.</P>
      <P>The 68-year-old Defense Minister has undergone regular physical
checkups every year since 1989 and has always received a clean bill of
health, except for a slightly higher level of fat in his blood.</P>
      <P>Tang began to feel an abnormal lowering of his upper eyelid in
late March. A hospital checkup found that he was suffering from
ptosis, an abnormal drooping of the upper eyelid caused by muscle
weakness, said doctors.</P>
      <P>Further tests found a tumor, measuring 3.2 x 2.6 x 1.8 cm in

    <HEADLINE>US-PRC STRAINS COULD LEAD TO CHANGES IN PRC NUCLEAR POLICY: STUDY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, April 11 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Whether Communist China holds to a low
alert-minimum deterrence posture remains to be seen as strains in
US-PRC relations and Beijing's militant stand toward Taiwan could
lead to changes in its `no-first-use' nuclear weapons policy,
according to a new US study.</P>
      <P>William Burr, an editor at Washington's National Security
Archive, wrote in his study on the Chinese nuclear weapons program
that the US missile defense program could also have a destabilizing
effect.</P>
      <P>Even though US missile defense programs are supposedly aimed at
countering threats from rogue states such as Iraq and North Korea, if
the systems are ever actually deployed, they could encourage major
Communist Chinese investments in both intercontinental and
sea-launched ballistic missile deployments and spark a new arms race.</P>
      <P>Informed public debate about US-PRC relations and Beijing's
nuclear posture would be advanced if the US intelligence
establishment released older studies on Beijing's nuclear policies,
said Burr, adding that unfortunately that may not happen soon.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that congressional panic over espionage in the
wake of spying allegations against Taiwan-born scientist Wen Ho Lee
and the Communist Chinese nuclear program has led to a more hostile
climate for declassification and also legislation forcing executive
branch re-review of millions of pages of documents that had been
slated for archival release.</P>
      <P>Besides delaying the release of older documents, the backlash in
Congress has undoubtedly bolstered anti-declassification recidivism
in the intelligence agencies, noted Burr. For example, the Central
Intelligence Agency has so far refused to declassify National
Intelligence Estimates on Communist Chinese nuclear forces from as
far back as the mid-1960s.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, Burr said, before Congress checked White House
declassification programs, some intelligence reporting and analysis
on the earlier phases of the Communist Chinese nuclear program became
available through the Freedom of Information Act at the National
Archives.</P>
      <P>A selection of US Air Force, State Department, Defense
Intelligence Agency and CIA documents suggest considerable competence
in tracking Communist Chinese nuclear and missile tests, as well as
missile training activities. But what also comes across is "a very
limited, as well as rather inaccurate, knowledge of Chinese missile
deployments during the late 1960s," added Burr.</P>
      <P>For example, even though Beijing had begun to deploy the Dong
Feng-2 medium range ballistic missiles in the fall of 1966, US
intelligence failed to detect the deployment until later in the
decade, said the study.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN'S INAUGURATION SPEECH WILL PUT PUBLIC AT EASE: DPP OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  11  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
heavyweight said on Tuesday that he doubted that President-elect Chen
Shui-bian, who is a DPP member, will offer any surprises on
cross-strait policy in his inauguration speech.</P>
      <P>But DPP Secretary-General You Hsi-kun said Chen in his inaugural
address will "make some statement" that will put the public at ease,
and that Chen is currently working with experts and scholars on the
speech.</P>
      <P>You, in an interview with a local radio station, said the policy
of the DPP has been public knowledge over the years, and he doubted
that Chen will announce any major policy changes in his inauguration
speech on May 20.</P>
      <P>Since Chen won the election in the March 18 presidential
election, he has shown caution in addressing cross-strait relations
and has sounded conciliatory notes to Beijing, which has a
deep-rooted mistrust of the pro-independence DPP.</P>
      <P>You noted that the Taiwan public has high hopes for Chen's
inauguration speech, as it is an opportunity to assuage Beijing's
misgivings about the DPP and help smooth cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>On local reports that mainland China is trying to boycott Taiwan
investors in the mainland who are in support of Chen, You said that
he will gather more information on this issue.</P>
      <P>He said that cross-strait relations are more at ease now than
before the March 18 presidential election, which saw Chen win the
fierce election, ending more than five decades of Kuomintang rule.</P>
      <P>You said that the DPP is making efforts to express its utmost
good will, hoping that there will be positive exchanges between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>You also commented on reports that Professor Chiu Hungdah of the
University of Maryland has decided to resign as a member of the
National Unification Council (NUC) and as an ambassador-at-large
because he does not think Chen identifies with the three-stage
process to national unification. You said he hopes Chiu will
communicate with the DPP and think twice before making the decision.</P>
      <P>Though mainland China has insisted on "one China" principle as
the precondition for restarting cross-strait talks, Chen has said
that as long as it is considered as one issue and not the guiding
principle, he is willing to talk about anything.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait talks were interrupted after Beijing reacted angrily
to President Lee Teng-hui's redefinition of cross-strait ties as
"special state-to-state relations" in July 1999.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT TIES TOP ISSUE FOR NEW GOVERNMENT: VICE DEFENSE HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Relations with mainland China are the top
priority Taiwan's new government must handle following the election
of Chen Shui-bian as the island's new president, Vice National
Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a monthly meeting of the Ministry of National
Defense, Wu said that the danger of war has always existed in the
Taiwan Strait, and that the Republic of China's military will neither
"provoke war" nor "be afraid of war" during the current situation
between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Although things have remained quiet in the Taiwan Strait since
the end of Taiwan's March 18 presidential election, the vice national
defense minister stressed that cross-strait ties are the greatest
challenge facing the new government.</P>
      <P>Quoting reports by Hong Kong newspapers, Wu said the Chinese
Communist Party's Central Military Commission has in recent months
established new high-tech military facilities and deployed advanced
weapons in its Nanjing and Guangdong military zones. This only
indicates that the danger of war always exists between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait, he noted.</P>
      <P>Recently, a litany of invective from mainland China against
Taiwan has refocused international attention on the Taiwan Strait as
one of the world's hot flash points, the vice national defense chief
pointed out, adding that Beijing's continued verbal attacks and
military intimidation still cast a shadow of uncertainty over the
future of bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>In compliance with the ROC's constitution, the ROC military must
obey the nation's head of state and protect its 23 million people
should the island be attacked, Wu said, but also expressed his hope
that Taiwan and the mainland can cooperate on a basis of reciprocity
and mutual trust to create a "win-win" situation for both sides.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's recent presidential election, he claimed, is a
reflection of the island's full-fledged democracy and a proof of the
implementation of the "popular sovereignty" concept.</P>
      <P>Wu, who has been designated the new national defense minister by
Chen, said he will continue to follow the current national defense
policy after taking over the post from present minister Tang Fei.</P>
      <P>In the face of fierce pressure from Beijing, Wu said safeguarding
national security and maintaining social order will be his top policy
priority.</P>
      <P>In order to lay a solid foundation for Taiwan's security, the
minister-designate said the military will focus its reform on
organizational restructuring and promotion of military education.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier-designate Tang Fei on Tuesday
named part of his Cabinet after holding a series of meetings with
President-elect Chen Shui-bian, according to sources from Tang's
office.</P>
      <P>Tang announced that You Hsi-kun, secretary-general of the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), has been named vice premier,
replacing Liu Chao-shiuan of the outgoing Kuomintang (KMT)
administration.</P>
      <P>Wei Chi-lin, incumbent chairman of the Cabinet-level Research,
Development and Evaluation Commission, has been named
secretary-general of the Executive Yuan, succeeding the KMT's Hsieh
Shen-shan, Tang noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, incumbent Vice Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen will be
promoted to defense minister to fill the vacancy that will be left by
Tang, who is the current defense minister under the KMT
administration.</P>
      <P>Tang has been appointed premier of the new government by Chen,
who is apparently making every effort to put together a broad-based
Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The entire line-up of the new Cabinet will be announced in the
days leading up to Chen's inauguration on May 20, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Speculation has it that three women heavyweights from the DPP
will be recruited to accept ministerial-level posts in the new
administration, as Chen strives for balanced politics of equal
participation by talented people from both genders, all political
parties and all ethnic groups possible.</P>
      <P>The women hopefuls included Chen Chu, director of the Bureau of
Social Affairs under the Kaohsiung City Government, who is likely to
be appointed head of the Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs; Yeh

      <P>The Taiwan Area
Oceanic Squid Fishing Exports Association has asked the Argentine
Coast Guard to inmediately release the Kaohsiung-based fishing vessel
King Chuan Hsiang and 28 crewmen captured by an Argentine cutter
on April 9.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the association said that the vessel was detained
by Argentine coast guard cutter at midnight of April 9 on the high
seas, four nautical miles from the 200-nautical mile limit of
Argentine economic waters.</P>
      <P>He said that the Argentine action violated the international law
of the sea, and Argentine coastal force authorities confirmed later
that the detained vessel was operating outside Argentine waters.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that the association, in addition to lodging a
protest against the Argentine coastal force authorities, has also
asked for the inmediate release of the vessel and its 28 crewmen.</P>
      <P>According to news reports from Argentina, the 922-ton fishing
vessel with a 28-member crew on board was escorted by an Argentine
cutter to Port Deseado, where further investigations were to be made.
The reports said that at present, both ship and crewmen were safe.</P>
      <P>The vessel was detained by the Argentine cutter when it was
operating on the high seas at 47 degrees 14 minutes 18 seconds south
latitude and 60 degrees 46 minutes 02 seconds west longitude, or four
nautic miles outside of the Argentine economic waters.</P>
      <P>The Argentine cutter reportedly fired its guns to warn the vessel
to stop for inspection. The captain of the fishing vessel refused, as
he regarded that his ship was not within Argentine economic waters.
Argentine coast guard officers then forcefully boarded the vessel at
1:00 a.m. to check its navigation diary and related documents, the
reports said.</P>
      <P>According to the ship's owner, Argentine officers conversed with
him by satellite telephone and confirmed that the fishing vessel was
not located in Argentine economic waters. However, he said that he
lost contact with the vessel, only to later receive a notice from the
Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Buenos Aires informing him
that the vessel had been detained and escorted to Port Deseado.</P>
      <P>According to the navigation record provided by the shipowner, the
fishing boat did not poach in the Argentine economic waters. If this
record is correct, the Argentine coastal force has apparently
violated the international law of the sea.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW CABINET TO INTRODUCE TALENT FROM ALL PARTIES: PRESIDENT-ELECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  11  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President-elect Chen Shui-bian paid a
visit to the Legislative Yuan on Tuesday, and said he will invite
talent from all Taiwan's political parties to join his new
government.</P>
      <P>Chen and Vice President-elect Annette Lu, who have both served as
legislators during their political careers, were warmly welcomed by
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng and the various party whips.</P>
      <P>Noting that his five years of parliamentary service has given him
the training and inspiration necessary for him to win presidential
election Chen said he was returning to the legislature with
gratitude and humility, and he invited all legislators to attend his
inauguration ceremony on May 20.</P>
      <P>With just over a month to go before his inauguration, Chen said
he must exert extreme caution in his deeds and words, pointing out
that "not only Taiwan people but the whole world are watching him."</P>
      <P>"Achieving domestic stability and reviving the confidence of the
people of Taiwan" will be his top priority, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Saying that his challenges only began after his victory in the
March 18 presidential election which ended the Kuomintang's five
decades of rule on the island, Chen also explained that the lineup of
his new government will also include talent from the New Party and
the People First Party.</P>
      <P>Explaining his decision to invite National Defense Minister Tang
Fei, a veteran KMT member, to serve as premier, Chen said that the
225-seat Legislative Yuan is still dominated by the KMT, and that he
offered Tang the premiership for the sake of stability of domestic
politics and peace in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>By garnering 39.3 percent of the vote in the election, Chen's
administration is expected to be a weak government, but Chen said that
after full communication with all sides, he is confident of his
ability to form a strong and accountable government.</P>
      <P>He said he will also make good of his campaign promise by
soliciting three women to join his 10-member Cabinet.</P>
      <P>On complaints from Lu that she has been left out in the cold in
the selection of the new Cabinet, and her suggestion that a future
constitutional amendment should be considered to adjust the duties of
the vice president, Chen also promised that Lu will not be a
"voiceless deputy."</P>
      <P>Chen said that considering the diplomatic plight of the nation,
he might be unable to leave Taiwan after his inauguration, even
though he hopes to make more overseas visits, but added that Lu will
have "a plenty of chances" to visit other countries on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Saying that he will invite DPP legislators to serve in various
government agencies of the Executive Yuan, the Presidential Office
and the Examination Yuan, he said the new Cabinet will be finalized
by the end of the month.</P>
      <P>New Party whip Elmer Fung, who was also the NP's vice
presidential candidate, congratulated Chen on his victory, and
expressed the hope that there will be no war, no added taxes, and an
eradication of "black gold," -- official corruption and links with
gangsters -- in Chen's new administration.</P>
      <P>Fung also offered his views on the "one China" principle, saying
that "one China" should not mean the People's Republic of China, that
relations between mainland China and Taiwan should not be one of a
central to local government, and that Taiwan should not be deemed a
province of the mainland.</P>
      <P>However, Chen pointed out to him that even the United States and
mainland China have different views on "one China," and added that
domestic consensus must be forged on what exactly is the "one China"
issue before it can be fully discussed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI NOT TO EXPAND MARKET BEFORE CONCLUDING WTO AGRICULTURAL TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  11  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will not expand its market for
agricultural products if the island joins the World Trade
Organization (WTO) before the body completes its new round of
agricultural talks, according to a government official on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wang Ming-lai, deputy director of the International Cooperation
Department of the Council of Agriculture under the Executive Yuan,
was referring to the difficulties facing the new round of WTO
agricultural negotiations.</P>
      <P>Since the new round of WTO agricultural talks has been boycotted
by a "Non Trade Concern" headed by the European Union and Japan, it
seems unlikely that the talks will conclude anytime soon, said Wang.</P>
      <P>An ad hoc agricultural meeting was convened by the WTO for the
promotion of the new round of talks. Wang is the representative of
Taiwan who took part in the first meeting held in Geneva recently.</P>
      <P>Wang disclosed after returning to Taipei that confrontations
between interest groups were evident. For instance, he said, the Non
Trade Concern, consisting of Japan, South Korea, Norway, and the
European Union, has sided against Australia and New Zealand.
Meanwhile, a group of "Third World" countries headed by India have
also formed a united front to fight for their own interests.</P>
      <P>The United States has advocated that the new round of talks
should be concluded within a period of three years, with topics
strictly limited in order to shorten the process. However, in view of
the present situation, said Wang, the new round of talks will
probably not be concluded within that period of time.</P>
      <P>If Taipei joins the WTO before the new round of talks end, the
island's opening of import quotas for agricultural products will be
frozen at the level to which Taiwan has already committed for 2000,
Wang noted. In other words, said the Taipei delegate, Taiwan would
not lower tariffs or increase the volume of imports of agricultural
products until the related WTO talks had been completed.</P>
      <P>The world trade regulatory body has decided to hold ad hoc
agricultural meetings in June, September and November, respectively.
The meetings will be aimed at reaching a common understanding and
consensus between different interests groups, Wang added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO KOREAS SET GOOD EXAMPLE FOR CROSS-STRAIT TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and mainland China should first put
aside the "one China" dispute and then sit down to talk through their
problems, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Lin I-hsiung
said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lin's remarks came on the heels of the latest news that the
leaders of South and North Korea are to meet for their first-ever
summit in June.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Jonathan Pollack, a senior East Asian affairs expert
at the Rand Corp., a US-based think tank, said Taiwan-mainland China
ties cannot be compared to those between the two Koreas. The US
expert made the remarks during a visit to the ROC Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.</P>
      <P>In contrast to the long-term impasse between the people of North
and South Korea, Taiwan and mainland China have long enjoyed good
substantive ties, and this should provide many good opportunities for
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to develop even better links, he
said in an analysis.</P>
      <P>However, Pollack also pointed out that the future of two-way ties
will be decided by Beijing's attitude, given that the Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) President-elect Chen Shui-bian has
offered many friendly overtures to Beijing on cross-strait issues of
major concern to both sides.</P>
      <P>At the legislature, meanwhile, Lin's call was echoed by lawmakers
from the pro-independence DPP, the People First Party (PFP) and the
Kuomintang, all of whom urged Beijing to follow the lead of the two
Koreas by showing goodwill and holding talks with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the new DPP-led Taiwan government will not declare
independence from mainland China as long as the mainland does not
attack the island militarily, DPP lawmaker Yeh Yi-Chin said the two
sides would be able to start talks as soon as Beijing decided to come
to the negotiating table.</P>
      <P>Mainland China should understand that it is better for the two
sides to talk than not talk, and should demonstrate its goodwill by
signing a cease-fire agreement with Taiwan as soon as possible,
commented Yu Cheng-tao, another DPP legislator.</P>
      <P>PFP lawmaker Chen Chin-ting argued that the fact that the two
Koreas have been able to agree to start negotiations after so many
years of separation shows there is no reason why Taiwan and mainland
China cannot do likewise.</P>
      <P>Chen also asked President-elect Chen to shrug off ideological
stereotypes in his efforts to push up for cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>According to KMT Legislator Ho Chih-hui, cross-strait economic
exchanges have helped boost progress in the mainland, and the Chinese
communists should provide better treatment for Taiwan businessmen by
separating economics from politics as a way of moving toward more
peaceful interchange.</P>
      <P>At the same time, remarks on the Korean situation made recently
by Robert Scalapino, a well-known China hand at the University of
California at Berkeley, were seen as a surprising coincidence in
light of the subsequent events in the divided Asian country.</P>
      <P>Scalapino said in a seminar held at Berkeley that Taiwan and
mainland China could consider the "peaceful co-existence" model
adopted by Seoul and Pyongyang to develop bilateral ties, a week
before the surprise announcement that negotiations will take place
between the two Koreas in June.</P>
      <P>Although Scalapino admitted that the possibility of putting the
proposal into practice is not high in the short-term, he raised two
concepts -- "concert of power and balance of power" -- for Taiwan and
the mainland to ponder.</P>
      <P>According to the US scholar, the United States and Japan should
have greater participation in discussions on cross-strait issues,
because these two countries share common interests in the region and
could serve as a balance mechanism in the process.</P>
      <P>He pointed to the example that the United States, mainland China,
Japan and Russia have all actively taken part in the negotiations
between Seoul and Pyongyang.</P>
      <P>But Scalapino also admitted that Beijing will not allow any
foreign country to meddle in cross-strait issues and added that
Washington will continue to follow its current policy of encouraging
Taiwan and mainland China to strengthen contacts rather than directly
interfering in Taiwan-mainland disputes.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 11 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local telephone help line has found that
a record high 38 percent of calls handled by the emergency assistance
organization over the past six months involved suicidal inclinations,
a figure which has rarely been so high in the past.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Life Line, an affiliate of the ROC Life Line
International, linked the high percentage of suicidal calls to the
impact of the catastrophic Sept. 21 earthquake that killed over 2,400
people, injured some 8,000 and left 100,000 others homeless.</P>
      <P>Since the quake, 21.4 percent of the calls received by the Taipei
Life Line were from callers who had thought about committing suicide
"every now and then," 7.1 percent were from callers who thought about
committing suicide "often," and 9.5 percent were from callers who had
thought about killing themselves "once," said Taipei Life Line
Secretary-General Chu Kai-yu.</P>
      <P>In contrast, similar calls showing suicidal inclination
constituted only 11.6 percent of all calls handled by the Taipei Life
Line in 1999, Chu noted.</P>
      <P>Chu said that over the past 30 years, romance and marriage
problems have always made up the bulk of the Taipei Life Line
casebook, with the number of female callers nearly doubling that of
male callers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chu added, about 32 percent of the calls over the last
six months were made by elderly people, which was also an unusually
high percentage compared with ratios of previous years.</P>
      <P>Chu called for society to pay more attention to senior citizens'
mental health care and to make more effort to prevent the elderly
from committing suicide.</P>

      <P>The Securities and Futures Commission
(SFC) under the Ministry of Finance (MOF) will permit the trading of
second-tier stocks on the island's over-the-counter (OTC) market from
April 18, SFC Chairman Lin Tzong-yeong said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Requirements for companies to be listed in second-tier stock
market are not as strict as for those companies currently listed in

      <P>At present, five companies have applied to list their second-tier
shares on the OTC market and three of them have already been given

      <P>Foreign ministers of the 113-member

code of conduct in the South China Sea to promote peace and stability
in the region.</P>
      <P>In a statement, the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs
(DFA) said Secretary Domingo Siazon Jr. spearheaded the discussions
in the historic first gathering of NAM ministers in Cartagena de
Indias in Colombia on the political situation in the South China Sea
and the wider regional, political and security situation in Southeast
Asia.</P>
      <P>NAM ministers urged all claimants to exercise restraint with a
view to creating a positive climate for the eventual resolution of
the conflict.</P>
      <P>They supported the Philippine position to resolve all sovereignty
and territorial disputes in the South China Sea by peaceful means
without resorting to force, the DFA statement said.</P>
      <P>NAM is the largest political negotiating bloc in the world and a
political forum for developing states for coordinating approaches

    <HEADLINE>`NEW ECONOMY' SYMPTOMS SEEN TO OCCUR IN TAIWAN IN FIVE YEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hsinchu,  April  11  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is likely to undergo the same
changes in its societal values in the next five years as are taking
place in the United States as a result of the swift development of
the dotcom world and "new economy," a local entrepreneur said on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Swift development in the dotcom world and "new economy" have
brought rapidly growing wealth to some Americans, but the phenomenon
has created an unprecedented impact on American society and has
completely changed traditional American values, said Morris Chang,
chairman and CEO of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.</P>
      <P>A similar impact is expected to affect Taiwan in about five years
from now, Chang predicted, as Taiwan inevitably follows in the
footsteps of the United States.</P>
      <P>Chang made the forecast on Tuesday in a speech at National Chiao
Tung University on the impact of "new economy" on society.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the change of traditional American values as
a result of the development of "new economy" is demonstrated in the
fact that "money rules all" has become the mainstream value in
American society and that marriage and family are accorded
subordinate values.</P>
      <P>He attributed the arrival of "new economy" in the United States
mainly to the swift development of the dotcom world and to tech
shares becoming cash cows on Wall Street.</P>
      <P>The tech-crazy market has in recent years created wealth worth
several trillion US dollars in America, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, the rapidly growing wealth is shared by no
more than 5 percent of the country's citizens, and has resulted in a
reshuffle of the major fortune holders in the United States.</P>
      <P>The "new economy" has also turned on its head the American
mainstream value of considering basic salary as the major source of
income, he said, adding that in 1974, only 200,000 of all American
employees possessed company shares, a number which had shot up to 10
million by 1999. This development, he continued, has resulted in
reduced loyalty to companies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND DENIES REPORTS IT WANTS TO PULL TROOPS OUT OF FRONTLINE ISLETS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) on
Wednesday denied categorically that it wants to pull troops out of
two outlying islets near mainland China's coastal city of Xiamen in
Fujian province.</P>
      <P>MND Spokesman Kung Fan-ting was responding to reports that the
Kinmen Defense Command has proposed turning over the defense of Tatan
and Ertan, less than 2,000 meters from Xiamen, to Kinmen County in
order to help boost tourism.</P>
      <P>Reports said that Kinmen County is hoping to use the two islets
to help attract tourists. Tourism in Kinmen has been on the decline
since being opened to tourists in 1993.</P>
      <P>Kung stressed that the military has never been lax in the defense
of its offshore or outlying islands.</P>
      <P>The Army's Commander-in-Chief Chen Cheng-hsiang echoed Kung's
words by saying that the Kinmen Defense Command has never
contemplated the pullout of troops from the two islets.</P>
      <P>But Kung said the MND will carefully asses the proposal based on
the following considerations, namely whether the military security of
the two islets can be assured, whether the local police force can
fully take over the security duties now being carried out by the
military, and whether the local government will apply to the MND
according to related regulations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORTY MEMBERS OF US CONGRESS CONGRATULATE CHEN'S ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  11  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Forty members of the US Congress
signed a letter written on Monday to congratulate Chen Shui-bian on
his recent election as president and to congratulate the people of
Taiwan for their historic vote that has strengthened democracy on the
island.</P>
      <P>The letter, introduced by Representative Robert Wexler (D-Fla.),
said the Taiwanese people should be praised for their commitment to
the democratic ideals of freedom and human rights and for the
dramatic voter turnout -- greater than 80 percent of registered
voters -- in the recent presidential election.</P>
      <P>The US congressmen and congresswomen who signed the letter also
included Democratic party whip in the House of Representatives David
Bonior (D-Mich.), Sam Gejdenson (D-Conn.) and Tom Lantos (D-Calif.).
In the letter, they reassured President-elect Chen that they are
committed to the security and prosperity of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>They said that there will be several important issues that Chen's
administration will undoubtedly have to address, none greater than
the future of relations with the People's Republic of China. "We hope
that you will advocate for the continuation of cross-strait dialogue
with the government of China that we believe will help reduce
tensions in East Asia," they said.</P>
      <P>The representatives said they were also extremely encouraged by
Chen's first public comments following the election and his reference
to "a journey of reconciliation to China with good intentions, active
cooperation and eternal peace."</P>
      <P>"A successful cross-strait dialogue must also include cooperation
from the Chinese government. Unfortunately, recent statements issued
by Beijing threatening to use military force against Taiwan if
prolonged negotiations to reunify the two entities are not successful
are unacceptable," the letter continued.</P>
      <P>The representatives said they will continue to insist that
Beijing renounce the use of force against Taiwan. "Taiwan should not
be compelled to accept Beijing's `one country, two systems'
formulation that presupposes the final results of any negotiations
that is not in accordance with the will of the Taiwanese people,"
they stressed.</P>
      <P>They noted that they also support expanding trade and economic
relations between the United States and Taiwan. Taiwan is currently
the seventh largest trading partner of the United States. They said
they believe that Taiwan's economic fortunes and those of the United
States would be greatly enhanced if Taiwan were able to join
international multilateral economic institutions, including the
International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JIH SUN HI-TECH FUND MANAGER CONFIDENT ABOUT ELECTRONICS STOCKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  12  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Jih Sun Securities Investment Trust
Co. Ltd. will introduce a high-technology fund to the market in mid
April, with the fund-raising ceiling set at NT$10 billion. Fund
Manager Liao Shih-kuei is confident about a bullish stock market for
electronics.</P>
      <P>Liao said that the electronics industry usually enters its brisk
season by the third quarter of the year, with monthly revenue
continually rising. He believes that Jih Sun has chosen the right
moment to introduce the new hi-tech fund to the market.</P>
      <P>Following are excerpts from an interview with Liao by CNA
reporter Teresa Tung:</P>
      <P>Q: What are the investment targets of Jih Sun's new hi-tech fund?</P>
      <P>A: We have targeted the manufacturing industries of IC
(integrated circuit), DRAM manufacturing, non-volatile memory cards,
thin film transistors-liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD),
telecommunications and fixed-network facilities, e-commerce, and
especially those electronics stocks with a high dividend payout
ratio, such as main boards, components, notebooks, and channels.</P>
      <P>Q: What makes electronics stocks the most favored?</P>
      <P>A: Electronics stocks have had high investment returns. In the
past five years, the investment return ratio for electronic stocks
has been nearly as high as 500 percent, far ahead of those for other
industries.</P>
      <P>Indexes of electronics manufacturing industries in all leading
industrial countries showed remarkable growth in the past year. Among
the top 10 open equity funds of Taiwan issued last year, six were
hi-tech funds and their average investment return ratio was 71
percent. Transactions of electronics stocks accounted for 70 percent
of Taiwan's stock transactions. Good prospects are predicted for the
next three years.</P>
      <P>The export value of the electronics manufacturing industry
represents 30 percent of Taiwan's overall export value. Stock price
fluctuations in the electronics sector were comparatively moderate,
judging from the skyrocketing growth in the electronics stock indexes
of JSDAQ (Japanese Securities Dealers Automated Quotation), KODAQ
(Korean Securities Dealers automated Quotation), and NASDAQ (National
Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation). Taiwan's
electronic stock prices may yet achieve new highs.</P>
      <P>Q: What is the difference between Jih Sun's hi-tech fund and
those issued by other securities investment and trust companies?</P>
      <P>A: Jih Sun's hi-tech fund is targeted at the five "star
industries" of the electronics sector for 2000 -- namely IC designing
and manufacturing, optical electronics, telecommunications, the
internet, and software. The economic fundamentals of the industries
are taken into consideration, with an emphasis on the growth of each
individual stock.</P>
      <P>The internet, telecommunications and electronics sectors can be
further divided into more than 30 sub-groups. Jih Sun will look at
the seasonal factors affecting each sub-group and apply great
flexibility in making investments in order to reduce risks and
guarantee good profits.</P>
      <P>Q: The weighted index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange has now
reached 10,000 points. Is it a good time to make investments?</P>
      <P>A: The weighted index should not be the only concern. The market
trend indicates the prospect of good profits in the hi-tech
industries. After the market turbulence during the presidential
election period, the long-term investment value of hi-tech stocks is
obvious. The second and third quarters of the year are usually the
brisk season for the electronics industry. For short-term
investments, now is also the right moment.</P>
      <P>Evaluating the nation's economic fundamentals, export orders
continue to pour in, foreign capital keeps coming into the stock
market, and daily purchases in the stock market after the
presidential election have mostly exceeded daily selling, and stock
market prices are expected to achieve new record highs in the coming
months.</P>
      <P>Q: What about Jih Sun's deployment of investments for its new
hi-tech fund?</P>
      <P>A: Since many listed companies on the Taipei Stock Exchange and
the over-the-counter market are launching their dividend payout
rallies, Jih Sun will invest in mostly those electronics stocks with
high growth, high profitability and a high dividend payout ratio.
Emphasis will also be put on IC designing and manufacturing, and DRAM
and fixed network. The internet and e-commerce are also sectors of
high interest.

    <HEADLINE>LIEN URGES KMT TO UNITE TO PLAY ROLE OF CAPABLE OPPOSITION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan, in his capacity
as the acting chairman of the Kuomintang, on Wednesday urged KMT
members to unite in order to play the role of a capable opposition
party.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks while meeting with KMT legislators to
express his appreciation for their stumping efforts during the
presidential campaign.</P>
      <P>Lien, noting that the nation's executive power will be turned
over to the DPP after Chen Shui-bian is inaugurated on May 20 , said
the KMT's political operation center will now be in the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>Lien said that despite the election defeat, the KMT is the real
majority party in the legislature, considering the fact that the KMT
commands more than 100 seats in the 225-seats Legislative Yuan, while
the DPP only has 70 seats.</P>
      <P>Lien urged all KMT members to join together to play the role of a
capable opposition party in order to monitor the performance of the
DPP's administration.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Lien said the KMT will initiate good
legislation that will benefit the public, stressing that the KMT must
make the welfare of the people its first priority in order to win
back the people's hearts and reverse the public's "twisted, wrongful"
impression of the KMT that was the result of the opposition party's
campaign.</P>
      <P>Lien also said that reform of the KMT must encompass every aspect
of the party, including its organization, campaign literature,
personnel, and operations, adding that the KMT needs to humbly review
itself so that it can rise up from where it has fallen.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chief of the General Staff Tang Yao-ming
on Wednesday reiterated the military's determination to follow the
government's set policy of never seeking the development of nuclear
or biochemical weapons.</P>
      <P>Tang said even in the face of heightened military threats from
mainland China, Taiwan has vowed not to possess, manufacture, or use
nuclear or biochemical weapons under any circumstances.</P>
      <P>Tang, however, noted that the armed forces of the Republic of
China are striving to research and develop defensive and deterrent
technologies and know-how against nuclear and biochemical weapon
attacks.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of a symposium on nuclear and biochemical
weapons prevention and defense, Tang said the armed forces are
actively building up pre-warning, defense, surveillance, and
emergency readiness systems to deal with nuclear and biochemical
weapons assaults.</P>
      <P>Tang called on Taiwanese citizens of all walks of life to be
aware of the dangers of nuclear and bio-chemical weapons attacks and
their aftermath, saying that Taiwan is a small island with a high
population density and any such attack would be an indescribable
disaster.</P>
      <P>During the symposium, 13 papers introducing nuclear and
biochemical weapons and their powers of destruction will be
presented, including one entitled "the PRC's nuclear and biochemical
warfare preparedness by 2010 and an assessment of its possible
threats to Taiwan."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Jason Hu, the spokesman of the Kuomintang,
on Wednesday denied reports that he will be assigned to the post of
ROC representative to the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>Local reports said that President-elect Chen Shui-bian would
invite Hu to serve as the ROC's representative to the UK, considering
his academic and political background.</P>
      <P>Hu holds a PhD. from Oxford University and has served as the
Director-General of the Government Information Office and as the ROC
Foreign Minister.</P>
      <P>Hu said that "nobody has approached him" about the matter, and
that even if someone did ask him to serve in the post, it would be
"impossible," saying that "there will be no changes."</P>
      <P>On the KMT's attitude toward its members serving in the new
Cabinet, Hu said that the party has no idea how many of its members
will be in the new Cabinet, reiterating the KMT's basic stance of
"not encouraging or endorsing" its members to do so.</P>
      <P>Hu served as foreign minister before he was invited to serve
as the secretary-general for the KMT presidential campaign office.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-jen took over the post of foreign minister after Hu
left. It has been reported that Chen has been assigned to the post of
ROC representative to the United States.</P>
      <P>The lineup of the Cabinet has become a focus of interest in
Taiwan in the wake of the March 18 presidential election. By
garnering only 39.3 percent of the vote, Chen's administration will
likely rely on talent from other parties to fill many of the major
posts and broaden support for the government.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONSUMERS WARNED AGAINST MIXING ST. JOHN'S WORT WITH SOME DRUGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, April 11 (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>St. John's Wort, an herbal product used to
treat mild depression, may interfere with medications taken for HIV
infection, heart conditions, blood clots, asthma, depression and
migraines, Health Canada warned Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Health Canada was following Britain's lead in issuing the warning
about mixing St. John's Wort with some prescription drugs. The herbal
product may also interfere with the oral contraceptive pill, the
Department of Health said.</P>
      <P>The herbal remedy decreases the efficacy of certain prescription
medicines by stimulating the production of liver enzymes that break
drugs down into inactive substances. Decreased drug levels in the
blood stream may result in the loss of a medicine's therapeutic
benefits.</P>
      <P>Health Canada has sent a letter to doctors, pharmacists and
practitioners of complementary medicine alerting them about the
possible reactions.</P>
      <P>The department noted that when used on its own, St. John's Wort
has not shown any significant health risks.</P>
      <P>But consumers are reminded that use of St. John's Wort in
conjunction with conventional antidepressants may cause "serotonin
syndrome," an excess of serotonin which can cause tremors, headaches
and restlessness.</P>
      <P>British and US authorities have both issued similar warnings last
month after an article was published in the medical publication
"Lancet" that raised the alarm about St. John's Wort interacting with

    <HEADLINE>TRADE WITH CHINA MUST BE TWO-WAY STREET: US SENATOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  11 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Sen. John Ashcroft (R-Mo.) told a
Senate hearing Tuesday that trade promises made by Communist China
"may well prove hollow unless America is ready to insist that China
abide by its commitments to cut its high tariffs and remove other
trade barriers."</P>
      <P>Renowned mainland Chinese dissident Harry Wu, meanwhile,
testified before senators that it is true that permanent normal trade
relations and World Trade Organization entry for China will further
help American companies economically, but the other major beneficiary
will be the Chinese Communist Party.</P>
      <P>"The Chinese Communist Party maintains political and economic
control in China, and WTO entry would not change that," emphasized
the former labor camp prisoner. He then showed pictures to remind the
senators of the People's Liberation Army crackdown in Tiananmen
Square in 1989.</P>
      <P>Sen. Ashcroft cited clear gains that the state of Missouri would
make under the US-PRC trade agreement, if Beijing keeps its side of
the agreement. But to win congressional approval for the pact, he
said, the Clinton administration must be prepared to demonstrate that
it is prepared to enforce the terms of the agreement if China tries
to back away from its commitments again.</P>
      <P>"In the 1992 US-China agreement, promises were made and broken.
This must not happen again. It will deprive our people of benefits
they have been promised. It will undermine American support for a
free and open trading system, because Missourians, and others, will
conclude that our government does not have the will to enforce our
rights. Fair trade must be a two-way street," stressed the senator.</P>

    <HEADLINE>IDEA  OF  ASEAN, NZ, AUSSIE FREE TRADE ZONE REVIVED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  12  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia and some members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations are reviving the idea of
merging the ASEAN Free Trade Zone (AFTA) and Closer Economic
Relations (CER), covering 12 countries with a total population of 550
million.</P>
      <P>The Australian on Wednesday reported that the joining together of
the 10-member regional free trade zone ASEAN and CER, which is made
up of Australia and New Zealand, offers gains to the member countries
of both organizations.</P>
      <P>The daily reported the new regional merger would not undermine
the cause of global trade liberalization and, in particular,
liberalization within the Asia-Pacific Economic Forum.</P>
      <P>There are distinct gains to be made by Australia because while
its tariffs are low, ASEAN has significant protectionist barriers
against Australian manufactured, agricultural and services exports.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Australian business community has already
decided it wants the AFTA-CER link.</P>
      <P>The idea of merging AFTA and CER originally came from Thailand,
and was taken up by the Labor Party government of Australia in the
early 1990s. In October 1999, Singapore encouraged the idea and
Australia's Trade Minister Mark Vaile seized the opportunity to
promote the idea, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>Other ASEAN countries such as the Philippines, New Zealand and
Indonesia also agreed with the idea of an AFTA-CER merger, the daily

      <P>The only stumbling block to the idea could be Malaysia because

      <P>US President Bill Clinton on Tuesday
pointed out that if both Beijing and Taiwan are admitted into the
World Trade Organization, it will increase their interdependence and
the cost to Beijing of a military confrontation, but if China is not

come from good US-China relations and China's membership in the WTO."</P>
      <P>Clinton noted that the economic reasons for permanent NTR status
for China are clear-cut, but the national security implications are
even more far-reaching. "Bringing it into the WTO will entwine China
in the global economy, increasing its interdependence with the rest
of the world. It will bring the information revolution -- with the
knowledge and freedom of thought that entails -- to millions of
people in China in ways its government cannot possibly control.</P>
      <P>He added that "it will accelerate the dismantling of China's
state-owned enterprises -- a process that is getting the government
out of people's lives and sparking social and political change all
over China. It will strengthen China's reforms and the reformers
behind them."</P>
      <P>The president said that is reason enough for Congress to vote for
permanent NTR status, adding that he is also concerned about what a
vote against it would do. "It would have extremely harmful
consequences for our national security. Because the economic case for
PNTR is so strong, the Chinese will see a rejection as a strategic
decision by the United States to turn from cooperation to
confrontation, to deal with China as an adversary," emphasized
Clinton.</P>
      <P>"That would undercut the reform-minded leaders who signed this
agreement with us, and strengthen the hand of hardliners who believe
cooperating with the United States is a mistake. Those are the same
forces most threatened by our alliances with Japan and Korea, the
same forces that want the Chinese military to sell dangerous
technologies, and the same forces that would pursue confrontation
with Taiwan rather than dialogue," he added.</P>
      <P>Clinton promised that his administration will spare no efforts in
the coming days and weeks to make sure that Congress and the American
people understand what the stakes are. And he is confident that when
the debate is over and the votes are cast, "Congress will do what is
right -- both for our prosperity and our security."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The US Senate's Foreign Relations
Committee is slated to hold a public hearing on the Taiwan Relations
Act (TRA) late this month, committee chairman Jesse Helms said on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Helms (R. North Carolina), said the major purpose of the planned
public hearing is to review the administration's performance in
implementing the TRA and to demand that US officials explain their
decisions on US arms sales this year to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Helms, the committee originally decided to call a
public hearing in February on Taiwan's military purchase requirements
from the United States. However, it was canceled when US officials
declined to take part in the event because they thought it might
allow Congress to have a greater voice on the issue.</P>
      <P>The US administration failed to submit a report to Congress on
the development of mainland China's military before March 1, while
Beijing issued a "notorious white paper" threatening the use of force
against Taiwan prior to the island's March 18 presidential election,
the senator noted.</P>
      <P>Expressing his belief that US administration officials will be
present at the upcoming hearing, Helms added that the Senate will

    <HEADLINE>AIG FUND MANAGER SPEAKS ON INVESTMENT IN INTERNET FUNDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  12  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The AIG Securities Investment and Trust
Co. will introduce a new fund for Internet commerce, encouraged by
the success of the Core Pacific Investment and Trust Co. in issuing a
telecommunications and Internet fund.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, AIG fund manager Fang Shi-shin spoke on
investment trends as they relate to Internet commerce. Following are
excerpts of the interview:</P>
      <P>Q: One securities investment and trust company has issued the
first fund for Internet commerce, and several similar funds are being
screened by the Taiwan Securities and Futures Institute. What is the
uniqueness of AIG's new fund?</P>
      <P>A: Most of the funds for Internet commerce are more related to
the electronics manufacturing sector for Internet appliances. The AIG
fund concentrates on Internet business and e-commerce, the trends,
and the future. Good prospects can be predicted for Internet funds in
the coming five years, taking the example of the success of hi-tech
funds in the past three years.</P>
      <P>Q: The new Internet fund will be introduced to the market at the
end of April. What is the significance of the timing?</P>
      <P>A: A bullish stock market is almost sure, judging from Taiwan's
economic fundamentals and capital market situation. The fluctuations
in the stock market will calm down one month after the presidential
election, since cross-Taiwan Strait relations and the domestic
political situation were actually the disturbing factors to the stock
market. I would say that late April is a proper time for the new fund
to enter the market.</P>
      <P>Q: The AIG Internet commerce fund has set broadband network
facilities as its investment target. How do you see the prospect for
profit?</P>
      <P>A: Broadband network has changed the horizon of telecommunication
services. Standardization of the products and services, including
Wireless Applications Protocol, General Package Radio Service and
Code Division Multiple Access has created enormous business
opportunities for mobile phone manufacturers and service providers.
Profit margins in this sector is very high.</P>
      <P>Q: What are the available e-commerce stocks in Taiwan? What are
the investment prospects?</P>
      <P>A: E-commerce in Taiwan is still at an initial stage. Many
conventional industries are seeking new roles in the Internet era
through the application of e-commerce. Internet business is
developing at an accelerated speed. An early entry into the market
may guarantee better chances. While it is a good time to invest in
e-commerce, it is the right time to introduce the new fund for
Internet business.</P>
      <P>Q: Knowing that Internet business is the trend, investors are
likely to have an interest in this sector. Would you suggest direct
stock investment or fund-buying?</P>
      <P>A: Internet-related stocks are attractive because of the high
investment returns and high risk. These stocks are often described as
two sides of a coin. An average stock investor may not be able to
make good judgments, while fund managers specialized in this business
can help investors make evaluations and reduce the risk. I would
therefore suggest that private investors should buy funds.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND SANDSTORM TO HIT TAIWAN AGAIN ON FRIDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  12  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to be hit by another
blast of sand from mainland China on Friday as a cold front from
Mongolia sweeps the yellow dust south, sources from the Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA) reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>EPA officials noted that Taiwan is not usually badly afflicted by
the sandstorms which plague northern China between late winter and
spring every year.</P>
      <P>The island has been affected by mainland sandstorms about two or
three times a year for only two to three days each time in previous
years, but the frequency and intensity are apparently much higher
this year, as Taiwan has been under the storms' influence since March
23, and new blasts of sand keep coming, with affected areas much
wider than before, the EPA officials noted.</P>
      <P>In past years, areas beyond the southern county of Tainan were
seldom affected, but this year, the whole of western Taiwan and part
of eastern Taiwan have been enveloped in yellow smog since late
March. Reports said the sandstorms have even reached as far as the
Philippines this year, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Local meteorologists are sure that the yellow smog in Taiwan's
skies is caused by the dust from northern China rather than by local
air pollution. They pointed out that observation centers on
Yangmingshan and in towndown Wanhua have found that their air filters
are showing thick yellow layers of dust instead of the black granules
that are results of air pollution from local vehicles or factories.</P>
      <P>The experts attributed the cause of the mainland sandstorms to
global weather changes, as well as improper development on the
Chinese mainland.</P>
      <P>They suggested that as it lies so close to the mainland, Taiwan
should not remain ignorant or indifferent to the annual phenomenon.
Local government authorities should encourage Taiwan private
businesses to finance tree-planting on the mainland to try to prevent
drought-affected areas of northern China from suffering further
desertification.</P>
      <P>These Taiwan businesses can also help the mainland develop more
hydraulic power plants and reduce the number of thermal power plants,
which are major culprits of air pollution, the officials added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 2,297 death certificates were
issued for victims of last year's devastating Sept. 21 earthquake,
the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the sobering DOH statistics, some 67 percent of the
victims were killed by falling objects, loss of blood, or from being
crushed in crumbling buildings, while others were buried alive,
burned to death or asphyxiated.</P>
      <P>In terms of time of death, about 56 percent of the casualties
succumbed within the first two hours of the temblor, while around 10
percent died of their injuries in the days following Taiwan's worst
quake in a century.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the DOH said it is worth noting that the number
of suicide attempts has increased in recent months. This follows
patterns previously observed in Japan, and can be attributed to the
fact that the six months immediately after a catastrophe is the most
difficult period for people living in affected areas.</P>

alleged appointees have been guarded as to their future jobs,
according to reports.</P>
      <P>Most have responded by refusing to comment, or by saying they are
undecided, or by saying they have no intention of accepting a Cabinet
post.</P>
      <P>In the wake of Premier-designate Tang Fei's confirmation of
appointments to the incoming government -- those of vice premier,
cabinet secretary-general and defense minister -- the prospective new
economics minister, Lin Hsin-yi, who is vice board chairman of the
China Motor Corporation (CMC), has told reporters he is "not clear

      <P>He declined to confirm a news report regarding his new post,
although the CMC public relations department claimed the speculation
is likely to be proved true.</P>
      <P>Lin Chung-hsiung, board chairman of the E. Sun Bank, who is
supposedly to be the finance minister in the new administration,
stressed that he has no inclination to assume the post due to
personal considerations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Patrick Liang, chairman of the Chiao Tung Bank, has

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) will
do its best to help the new government to improve ties with Beijing,
Chairman Koo Chen-fu said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In its first board meeting after the March 18 presidential
election, the chairman of the agency set up in 1991 by the government
to deal with cross-Taiwan Strait contacts, stressed the irreplaceable
role played by the SEF in bilateral ties and the valuable experience
it has accumulated in the last ten years in engagement with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Recalling his latest visit to mainland China in October, 1998,
Koo seemed to be disappointed at the nadir in bilateral ties prompted
by Beijing's furious attack against President Lee Teng-hui's
characterization of Taipei-Beijing ties as "a special state-to-state
relationship" in 1999.</P>
      <P>Koo said during his 1998 visit, he personally extended an
invitation to his Beijing counterpart, Wang Daohan of the Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait to visit Taiwan, and expressed
willingness to visit mainland China again if necessary. However, he
went on, all his efforts were made to no avail after bilateral ties
nose-dived.</P>
      <P>In a sign that he was breaking with Lee's so-called "special
state-to-state" advocacy, Koo urged Beijing to stick to a consensus
reached between the two sides in 1993 that both sides share the
concept of "one China," but with the definition subject to each
side's different interpretation as to the meaning of the phrase.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN POSTS 7.5 PERCENT ECONOMIC GROWTH IN FIRST QUARTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  12  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan posted a 7.5 percent economic
growth rate in the first quarter of the year, and exports also
registered double digit growth over the past six consecutive months,
according to statistics released by the Council for Economic Planning
and Development (CEPD) on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The same statistics show that this year's economic growth will
surpass the government's target of 6.5 percent, due to a massive
increase of private sector investment.</P>
      <P>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting &amp; Statistics
(DGBAS) under the Executive Yuan estimated in February that first
quarter economic growth would reach 7.53 percent, close to the figure
released by the CEPD on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>But the huge increase in private sector investment, orders
received for exports, and industrial manufacturing during the first
quarter of the year are seen as driving economic growth for the
entire year. Yearly economic growth is therefore expected to surpass
the projected target of 6.54 percent.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS said the weighted indices of the stock exchange (TAIEX)
and over-the-counter (OTC) market rose 16.6 percent and 40.3 percent,
respectively, compared with last year's first quarter</P>
      <P>Transaction volume in the TAIEX and OTC stock exchanges also
increased by 20 percent and 40 percent, respectively, DGBAS said.</P>
      <P>As of the end of March, foreign investors poured a total of
US$29.19 billion into the local stock market, an increase of US$16.76
billion over the same period in the previous year. Capital inflow in
the first quarter reached US$7.56 billion, representing a four-fold
increase over the previous year.</P>
      <P>This indicates that it needs to pay attention to continued
inflows of foreign capital, which may affect Taiwan's future economic
development, the DGBAS added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FTSE INTERNATIONAL TO INCLUDE TAIWAN STOCK MARKET INDEX</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  April  11 (CNA)
(By Ou Chun-lin and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange Index
International (FTSE International) will announce in the near future
the inclusion of the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TAIEX) index on its
global stock market indices list.</P>
      <P>A source with the securities industry in London made the
revelation when attending a seminar sponsored by Taiwan's National
Securities Co., in celebration of the founding of its European
subsidiary.</P>
      <P>The source said that because Taiwan made many restrictions on
foreign investment on Taiwan's stock market in the past, FTSE
International did not include the TAIEX on its list of global stock
market indices.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that Taiwan's status in international
business circles is growing more and more, FTSE International decides
to include the TAIEX on its indices list, said the source.</P>
      <P>Besides Taiwan, another 16 nations, including South Korea and
mainland China, will also be included on FTSE International's list,
he said.</P>
      <P>The source said FTSE International will probably choose stocks of
50 to 100 Taiwan companies as components of the index it made to
place on its global stock market indices list. The stocks of seven of
the Taiwan companies will be much weighted in the calculation of FTSE
International's Taiwan index, the source said.</P>
      <P>The seven Taiwan companies to be weighted are Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd., United Microelectronics Corp.,
Asustek Computer Inc., Cathay Life Insurance Co., Hon Hai Precision
Industry Co., Ltd., Nan Ya Plastics Corp., and China Development
Industrial Bank.</P>

    <HEADLINE>IMF FORECASTS TAIWAN ECONOMY TO EXPAND 6.2 PERCENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 12 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is forecasted to post economic
growth of 6.2 percent in 2000, according to a biannual report
released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>That figure means that Taiwan is expected to have the third
fastest growing economy among 28 advanced countries worldwide. The
island will be second only to Ireland and South Korea, at 7.4 percent
and 7 percent, respectively, predicts the IMF's Report on World
Economic Prospects.</P>
      <P>The fund predicts Taiwan's inflation rate, or consumer price
index, will rise from the 0.2 percent mark of the previous year to
1.8 percent, while unemployment will decline from 2.9 percent to 2.6
percent.</P>
      <P>It predicted that the island will keep its place as third fastest
growing economy in 2001, with expansion of 6 percent, a jobless rate
of 2.3 percent, and inflation of 2.1 percent.</P>
      <P>The report also revised upward the IMF's October estimate of
mainland China's growth in 2000 from 6 percent to 7 percent, which it
expects to dip to 6.5 percent in 2001.</P>
      <P>The outlook for Asia's biggest economy, Japan, is dim. The report
gives it a 0.9 percent growth for 2000 and 1.8 percent growth for
2001.</P>
      <P>As a whole, Asian developing countries lead the world with an
average 7.2 percent expected growth this year and 5.9 percent
expected growth for next year, said the IMF.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S CITIZENS 18TH RICHEST IN THE WORLD SAYS IMF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  12  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwanese people are the 18th
richest people in the world, with the nation's average annual per
capita income based on purchasing power parity expected to reach
US$16,854 this year, sources from the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In its latest World Economic Outlook report, the IMF for the
first time used purchasing power parity (PPP) as a basis for
comparing living standards among countries. PPP is more accurate than
simply translating figures for a nation's per capita gross domestic
product (GDP) from the domestic currency into some common currency
(like the US dollar) by using exchange rates.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan's economy continues to pick up momentum over the next
several years, the country's per capita income is expected to surpass
those of Britain, France and even Japan within a decade, IMF
researchers said.</P>
      <P>According to the IMF report, Taiwan's PPP stood at US$759 in
1900, but the figure dramatically increased 21-fold to US$16,854 in
2000 to become the second highest in Asia behind only Japan's
US$20,616.</P>
      <P>Taiwan would rank 25th in the world if Taiwanese citizen's wealth
were calculated based on per capita GDP using exchange rates, said
IMF researchers.</P>
      <P>According to the IMF ranking, the 10 countries with the
wealthiest citizens on average are the United States, Norway, Canada,
Denmark, Switzerland, Japan, Australia, the Netherlands, France and
Sweden, in that order.</P>
      <P>Ranking between 11th and 20th are Belgium, Austria, Britain,
Finland, Ireland, Germany, Italy, Taiwan, New Zealand and Spain.</P>

      <P>United States President Bill Clinton
and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright failed to get a concrete
commitment from Israeli Prime Minister Barak to stop the planned
Israeli sale of airborne early warning equipment to Communist China.</P>
      <P>State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin said during a routine

Tuesday that things would become uncomfortable and problematic if
Israel went ahead with its planned arms sale to China and expressed
Washington's deep concerns over this issue.</P>

understood these concerns, and that we will be discussing this issue
further with Israeli officials."</P>
      <P>In a background briefing on President Clinton's meeting with
Barak Tuesday night, a senior Clinton administration official told
reporters that the focus of the four-hour meeting in the White House
Oval Office was the Palestinian issue and that Israel's planned sale
of Falcon early warning planes was also discussed.</P>
      <P>US Secretary of Defense William Cohen had also failed to stop the

similar equipment to China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Over ten thousand American labor union
members gathered on Capitol Hill here Wednesday to lobby against
President Bill Clinton's call for Congress to grant Communist China
permanent normal trade relations status.</P>
      <P>John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, the largest labor
organization in the United States, said that "our message is that
until there is a permanent change of values in China, there will be
no permanent NTR with China."</P>
      <P>Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) commented to reporters that union
members can help determine the vote in the House of Representatives,
which is scheduled for the week of May 22. The Senate is set to pass
the legislation granting Communist China permanent NTR status.</P>
      <P>Rep. David Bonior (D-Mich.), the House minority whip, told the
rally that "workers everywhere have a right to be treated with
dignity and respect," saying that the Clinton administration's trade
accord with China would "force workers here to compete with men and
women who earn sweatshop wages."</P>

      <P>President-elect Chen Shui-bian's ad hoc
National Policy Advisory Group was dissolved Thursday after
accomplishing its historical mission, said group leader Lee
Yuan-tseh.</P>
      <P>Lee, the president of Academia Sinica, the top research institute
in Taiwan, said the National Policy Advisory Group had come together
for three meetings over the past 24 days since Chen's election. The
group helped Chen make a decision on the appointment of a premier and
helped give form to the future national policies of the new
government scheduled to be inaugurated on May 20.</P>
      <P>Some of the 13 members of the group have been recruited into the
Cabinet to be headed by Premier-designate Tang Fei, some have
accepted offers to be advisers or consultants to the president, and
some will return to their previous prestigious posts, Lee noted.</P>
      <P>Lee, the Nobel Prize winning chemist, has been appointed by
President-elect Chen to be one of his senior advisers.</P>
      <P>In the group's last meeting on Thursday, members focused the
discussion on the new government's future administrative policies,
during which President-elect Chen wrote four pages of notes, said
Lee.</P>
      <P>Now that the group has been dissolved, Lee said the members will
not make any further suggestions to Chen or Premier-designate Tang on
the line-up of the Cabinet or related personnel issues.</P>
      <P>Over the past several days, the group has offered its opinions on
appointments to the new Cabinet. Although only part of the Cabinet
has been named so far, several new faces have been appointed to posts

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>On the thorny issue of cross-strait
relations, Taiwan is striving for a dialogue with mainland China that
will maintain its dignity, rather than seeking independence, said a
Republic of China official in charge of mainland Chinese affairs in
Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), said the United States should advocate
Taiwan's democratization as a role model for the Chinese mainland.</P>
      <P>In a keynote speech at a seminar hosted by Goldwater Chair of
Arizona State University, Lin said the United States should help
protect Taiwan from the military intimidation of the People's
Liberation Army, and the US should help protect the Taiwanese economy
so as to allow it to serve as an example of efficiency for mainland
China to emulate.</P>
      <P>Lin said in recent years, the PLA has considered a military
takeover of Taiwan as its most important task, and has viewed the
United States as an inevitable barrier to accomplishing that goal.
Therefore, the PLA has envisaged the US as its top enemy in the
future, he added.</P>
      <P>When faced by occasional PLA strategic challenges, Washington and
Taipei share common interests in maintaining regional stability, Lin
noted.</P>
      <P>He added that the national interests of the United States and the
ROC are more compatible than those between the United States and
mainland China.</P>
      <P>History is on the side of the ROC and communist China will not
last in its present form, Lin concluded.</P>
      <P>Lin, a respected military strategist and mainland Chinese affairs
expert in Taiwan, arrived in Washington on Tuesday for the exclusive
purpose of delivering the speech. He departed for home on the same
day.</P>

hindered their communication and consultations.</P>
      <P>"Neither of us has ever insisted on the appointment of any
specific person for any specific post," Tang stressed.</P>
      <P>Tang, a former chief of the General Staff and a former ROC air
force commander-in-chief, revealed that several Cabinet ministers
have already been selected.</P>
      <P>For instance, Tang said the post of foreign minister will be
filled by Tien Hung-mao, a political science and international
affairs expert.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tang said incumbent Vice Foreign Minister David Lee
will remain on his current post in the new administration, and that
outgoing Foreign Minister Chen Chien-jen will serve as new Republic
of China representative to the United States.</P>
      <P>Tang went on to say that Chen Yu-hsiu, dean of the College of
Fine and Applied Arts of National Taiwan Normal University, will head
the Cabinet-level Council for Cultural Affairs; and that Wang Chun,
incumbent deputy director-general of the National Police
Administration, will be promoted to the top post of the Coastal Guard
Administration.</P>
      <P>Tang further said Yang Teh-chih, commander-in-chief of the
Combined Service Force, will retire from active military service to
head the Vocational Assistance Commission for Retired Servicemen, and
that Tainan County Magistrate Chen Tang-chan has agreed to serve as
chairman of the National Science Council.</P>
      <P>As for the new chief of the Government Information Office (GIO),
Tang said he is still mulling the issue, adding that he has ruled out
the possibility of naming a media professional to head the GIO
because such an appointment would violate current regulations.</P>
      <P>Commenting on press reports that he had rifts with Chen over the
selection of top financial and economic officials, Tang said the
reports were sheer speculation and had apparently "politicized" the
Cabinet formation issue.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 10 representatives of the
political group Frontier Thursday staged a demonstration before the
Hong Kong government headquarters, urging the government to
safeguard press freedom in the territory.</P>
      <P>The demonstration was held after Wang Fengchao, deputy director
of Beijing's Liason Office in Hong Kong, said Wednesday that the
news media of Hong Kong have the responsibility and obligation to
support China's position on unification with Taiwan and to uphold
China's unity. The media should not treat pro-independence speeches
and views of Taiwan people as normal news items, he said.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks after a Hong Kong cable TV station reported
last week an interview with Taiwan's vice president-elect Annette Lu
on cross-strait relations. She was subsequently called "the scum of
the nation" by official Chinese news media for making "separatist
remarks" in the interview.</P>
      <P>The demonstrators said they were worried by Wang's remarks
and asked the government to safeguard press freedom in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang was criticized Thursday in the editorials of Hong
Kong newspapers, including the Apply Daily, Ming Pao, and the
Economic Times, for having violated press freedom in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The editorials said that the position of Beijing, as indicated in
Wang's remarks, may hinder the implementation of "one country, two
systems" in Hong Kong and may defeat the functions of the press in
free society.</P>
      <P>Beijing has promised to let Hong Kong keep its democratic systems
for 50 years after its reversion to China in July, 1997 under the
so-called "one country, two systems" policy.</P>

      <P>US House Majority Whip Thomas D. DeLay
(R-Texas) on Wednesday lauded Republic of China President-elect Chen
Shui-bian as a "straightforward, no-nonsense type of person."</P>
      <P>Delay further said he believes that Chen, a
lawyer-turned-politician, will be "a good representative of Taiwan in
the world community."</P>
      <P>Delay made the remarks after Chen held hour-long talks with
several influential members of the US Senate and House of
Representatives via a satellite link-up.</P>
      <P>Delay said the meeting offered a good opportunity for Chen to
exchange views with US congressional members on matters of mutual
concern.</P>
      <P>The meeting also allowed US senators and congressmen to convey
their warm congratulations on Chen's election victory and to express
their admiration for Taiwan's achievement in setting the record of
first peaceful transfer of power in Chinese society, Delay said.</P>
      <P>"We want him to know that he has friends here in the Congress
that he can call on if he needs us," Delay added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen was quoted as having told the American
congressmen that numerous public opinion polls conducted in Taiwan
indicate that the people of Taiwan do not think that Taiwan is a
province of the People's Republic of China as Beijing would have the
rest of the world believe.</P>
      <P>Chen also assured the US congressional leaders that he will do
his utmost to forge a consensus among the people of Taiwan on the
so-called "one China" issue.</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan's security needs, Chen was quoted as having said
that his administration will "keep the dialogue open with both the US

      <P>Republic of China Vice Economics
Minister Lin Yi-fu visited the US Trade Representative (USTR) Office
on Wednesday to seek US support for ROC entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Lin called on Deputy USTR Richard Fisher, Assistant Asia-Pacific
USTR Donald Phillips and several other officials to exchanged views
on the progress of Taipei's and Beijing's WTO entry applications.</P>
      <P>Fisher told Lin that the Clinton administration is mobilizing to
lobby members of the House of Representatives for passage of the bill
governing permanent normal trade relations status for mainland China.
The administration hopes that the House of Representatives will pass
this bill by the end of May.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has already completed the signing of bilateral agreements
on its WTO entry with all other WTO members who demanded
negotiations, with the exception of Hong Kong. It reached agreement
with the United States in February 1998.</P>
      <P>The subsequent stagnation of Taiwan's WTO entry process has been
due mainly to hindrance from Beijing.</P>
      <P>The United States has expressed its stance that the entries of
Taiwan and mainland China into the WTO should be dealt with
separately, But some WTO members think that mainland China should
enter the world trade regulatory body prior to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has yet to sign bilateral agreements on its WTO
entry with seven WTO members -- the European Union, Costa Rica,
Ecuador, Guatemala, Latvia, Mexico and Switzerland -- before it can
join the WTO, and has provided the United States with a verbal
promise that once it is admitted to the WTO, it will not prevent
Taiwan from joining the international organization.</P>
      <P>After his Washington, D.C. meetings, Lin left for Geneva,

      <P>No by-election will be held for county
magistrates or city mayors appointed to the Cabinet if the remaining
tenure is within two years, a Ministry of the Interior (MOI) official
said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Instead, the Executive Yuan will appoint an acting magistrate or
city mayor to fill the vacancy, the official added.</P>
      <P>Annette Lu, incumbent magistrate of Taoyuan County, was elected
the 10th vice president of the Republic of China in the March 18
presidential election, and Tainan County Magistrate Chen Tang-shan
will be also appointed as chairman of the National Science Council in
the new administration of President-elect Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Lin Tzu-ling, director of the Civil Affairs Department of the
MOI, noted that by-elections must be held within three months if an
official tenders his or her resignation, is dismissed, or dies, in
accordance with regulations stipulated in the self-government law,
but only if tenure has two years or more to run.</P>
      <P>The four-year tenure for the current county magistrates runs from
Dec. 20, 1997 to Nov. 20, 2001, which means that if any magistrate or

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President-elect Chen
Shui-bian assured US Congress members on Thursday that his
administration will attach great importance to improving relations
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen made the assurance during talks with several influential
members of the US Senate and House of Representatives through a
satellite link-up.</P>
      <P>During their hour-long talks, Chen also reaffirmed that unless
mainland China attempts to use force against Taiwan or invade
Taiwan, the island will not declare independence.</P>
      <P>The lawyer-turned-politician further assured the American
congressional leaders that he has full sincerity and goodwill to
forge rapprochement with mainland China and will make every effort
to avoid adding up to any new trouble in cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>According to Chen's office, the satellite conference focused
discussion on Taiwan's security, defense needs and cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Chen said reopening of constructive dialogue
and communication channels and establishment of stable, normal
cross-strait relations are in the interest of both Taipei and
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chen said he believes that both the United States and other
Asian countries will be pleased to see cross-strait relations
develop in such directions.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Chen said his administration will make it a priority
to improve cross-strait relations and maintain peace and stability
in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen also reaffirmed Taiwan's "three noes" policy toward
mainland China during his presidential tenure: no inclusion of the
special state-to-state relationship theory into the ROC's
constitution; no referendum on the sensitive "unification or
independence" issue; and no change of the ROC's national title.</P>
      <P>Chen further said he believes that normalization of cross-strait
trade ties will offer a new opportunity for resumption of bilateral
dialogue because both sides will benefit from such developments.</P>
      <P>Noting that simultaneous entry into the World Trade Organization
can help boost normalization of cross-strait relations, Chen urged
the United States to help Taiwan and mainland China enter the WTO as
early as possible.</P>
      <P>Chen also expressed his hope that the annual Taipei-Washington
meeting on Taiwan's arms purchase requests can be held as scheduled.
The first-ever transfer of power in Taiwan should not become an
excuse for any delay in holding such an important routine event.</P>
      <P>On the cross-strait issue, Chen urged the outside world not
to hold unrealistic high expectations of his inaugural address,
stressing that cross-strait disputes have existed for more than 50
years and cannot be resolved simply by a single speech.</P>
      <P>Chen further said as Taiwan's new leader, he cannot ignore
the public opinion, adding that Beijing's "one China" definition
and "one country, two systems" unification scheme are unacceptable
to the majority of Taiwan people.</P>

      <P>Police said on Thursday that they are

China, and said they will ask for his extradition if possible.</P>
      <P>Sources from the Criminal Investigation Bureau said that rather
than having been killed by mainland Chinese gangsters as had been

Taiwan for at least a dozen kidnappings and some 30 other criminal
cases, was arrested by public security officials in Yunnan Province,
southwestern China.</P>
      <P>Jan was caught on March 31 in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan
Province, by public security officers in a drug sting set up by
mainland gangsters who were angered by Huang's extortion of Taiwan
businessmen in mainland China and eager to get him off their turf,
said the sources.</P>
      <P>Taiwan police are looking into the reports and will try to have
him extradited through the appropriate channels, the sources went on.</P>
      <P>Huang fled to mainland China in March 1995 while being hunted by
Taiwan police in connection with several high-profile kidnappings. He

      <P>Chen Chao-yih, executive secretary of the Energy Commission of

      <P>Chen said CPC produces 770,000 barrels of oil per day, an amount
which already satisfies local demand, while FPG will add a daily

until the May 6 election date, whether the vote will take place, as
the incumbent NA members are attempting to marginalize the NA through
an amendment to the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The NA passed a resolution late last year to extend the tenure of
incumbent NA members by two years and two months to January 2002, but
the Council of Grand Justices ruled last month that the resolution is
invalid, paving the way for the election.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, the political parties are desperately
preparing for the new election on the one hand, while trying to
stymie it on the other.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT COMMERCE EXPERT NAMED GOV'T SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  14  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chin Chung, a fellow researcher at the
Chung-hua Institute for Economic Research (CIER), was named on Friday
by Premier-designate Tang Fei as the next spokesperson for the
government of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Chung, 47, is currently a doctorate candidate in business at
Cornell University and has been with the private think tank CIER
since she returned from the United States some 10 years ago. She is
an expert in cross-strait business and trade exchanges.</P>
      <P>Confirming her appointment as government spokesperson, formally
known as director-general of the Government Information Office (GIO),
Chung said the people of Taiwan are attaching a lot of expectations
to the new government which is scheduled to be inaugurated on May 20.
She said she is one of the few people lucky enough to be recruited
into the new administration.</P>
      <P>Chung, who gave concrete suggestions on cross-strait trade and
investment exchanges after President Lee Teng-hui began advocating
the "No haste, be patient" policy towards mainland China six years
ago, said the greatest challenge she will face in the new post will
be how to create new ideals within the existing framework of the
system.</P>
      <P>An independent scholar and the daughter of parents who came from
mainland China, Chung said she has had little formal contact with the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) over the years, except for taking
part in several symposiums hosted by the party.</P>
      <P>In related news, the local labor sector on Friday welcomed the
appointment of Kaohsiung City Labor Affairs Administrator Chen Chu as
the chairman of the Council of Labor Affairs -- the nation's top
labor affairs post.</P>
      <P>The labor sector lauded Chen as a humanitarian practitioner who
has contributed a lot to taking care of the welfare of aborigines,
women and other less-privileged groups in society for a long time,
and has also maintained close ties with human rights groups abroad.</P>
      <P>According to Premier-designate Tang Fei, who has been busying
himself with the new Cabinet's line-up over the past few days, more
new appointments to the Cabinet will be announced over the next
several days as some posts are still under discussion.</P>
      <P>Tang on Friday also confirmed two other appointments -- Lin
Hsin-yi, an entrepreneur who is currently vice chairman of Chung Hua
Motors, to the post of economic affairs minister, and Chen Tang-shan,
who is currently the magistrate of Tainan County, as new chairman of
the National Science Council.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hao Lung-ping, convenor of the New Party's National
Election Campaigning and Development Committee, said he is giving
serious consideration to an offer of a Cabinet post by
Premier-designate Tang. Hao said his father, former Premier Hao
Pei-tsun, was pleased with the offer but wanted Hao to make his own
decision. Hao said he will make the final decision after consulting
with senior New Party officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PEOPLE FIRST PARTY COULD WORK WITH KUOMINTANG: PFP OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  14  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official of the newly-formed People
First Party (PFP) said on Friday that to work with the Kuomintang to
run in the next presidential election should be the direction of the
party's efforts.</P>
      <P>PFP Vice Chairman Chang Chao-hsiung made the remarks during an
interview on a local radio station.</P>
      <P>As for himself, Chang said he has no intention of staying in
politics and James Soong has to choose "someone who is younger to be
his running mate."</P>
      <P>Soong and Chang ran together as independents in the March 18
presidential election, garnering 36.8 percent of the vote, behind
only the Democratic Progressive Party's Chen Shui-bian and Annette Lu
who received 39.3 percent of the vote, but far ahead of the
Kuomintang's Lien Chan and Vincent Siew who received only 23.1
percent of the vote.</P>
      <P>Despite loosing the fiercely fought election, Soong was termed
the most "intriguing" figure because of his strong performance
despite not having party support.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that PFP chairman Soong, a former KMT heavyweight,
had said before the presidential election that he would not return to
the KMT and that he hoped bipartisan politics similar to that in the
United States could be maintained in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But Chang said that in response to the strong call from the
voters after the presidential election, the PFP was inaugurated on
March 31.</P>
      <P>As for the development of the PFP, Chang admitted that the ethnic
question will be a big challenge, saying that the long-term rule of
the KMT has forced many opposition elites to turn toward the
Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>But Chang also noted that a dozen native Taiwanese legislators 
from other parties have expressed their intentions of joining the PFP
caucus in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>He said that recruiting more young elites will be crucial to the
party's development.</P>
      <P>He said that a coalition with the KMT will be the direction in
which the party will focus its efforts, though he said such
cooperation will also depend on reforms within the KMT and on the
development of the PFP.</P>
      <P>Chang, a famous heart surgeon and the president of a medical
school before being invited to be Soong's running mate, said that
"there are gains and losses in life," noting that he learned a lot
during the campaign and made a lot of new friends.</P>
      <P>He said his horizons have been broadened by learning more about
some of the nation's problems at the grass-roots level and about the
development gap between the southern and northern parts of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But the newcomer to politics said the fervor generated during the
election should be channeled into broader actions of concern for the
general public, such as the formation of roving medical missions and
volunteer groups, which he said he is considering contributing to
within the party.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A three-year-old Chinese boy has won a
high court appeal to remain in Australia under the classification of
refugee because it was ruled that he and his parents would face
persecution if they were sent back to China as a result of the
mainland's one-child policy.</P>
      <P>The Australian on Friday reported Chen Shi-hai, also known as
Martin Chen, was entitled to refugee status, the Australian High
Court ruled on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen's parents, who have been detained at Port Hedland in western
Australia, had attempted several appeals through legal process, but
failed to win refugee status for their child until the High Court
overruled previous rulings, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>The latest ruling, the first of its kind for detained illegal
immigrants from mainland China, will not only allow Martin to stay in
Australia, but also his parents and older brother, ending the
years-old legal fight, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>The Chens were not allowed to marry in 1989 when they were in
China, so they took the chance of taking their eldest son illegally
to Australia aboard a boat in 1994. They were arrested at the time
and have been held in detention ever since. Martin was born in the

    <HEADLINE>AIDS `COCKTAILS' PIONEER PURSUING VACCINE STRATEGY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Dr. David Ho, a leading AIDS researcher in
the United States, said Friday in Taipei that he is working on a
vaccine strategy in the hopes that a cheaper and more convenient
method of combating AIDS will soon be available.</P>
      <P>Ho, who pioneered the use of "cocktails" treatment to combat HIV
and provided the first glimmers of hope to people with AIDS for
better and longer lives, said he is working in pursuit of a vaccine
against AIDS.</P>
      <P>While the "cocktails" treatment is only a meaningful option in
developed countries where patients and governments can afford it, Ho
said AIDS vaccines, if proven viable, will effectively stem the
spread of AIDS in developing countries.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that clinical studies of the AIDC vaccine will begin
next year in mainland China, Ho noted.</P>
      <P>Ho, who was born in the central Taiwanese city of Taichung and
moved to Los Angeles with his family in 1965 at the age of 12, was
named by Time Magazine as its "Man of the Year" in 1996 for "helping
lift a death sentence on tens of thousands of AIDS sufferers, and for
pioneering the treatment that might lead to a cure."</P>
      <P>The "cocktails" treatment has actually proven to be effective for
a large number of AIDS patients over the last four years. According
to Ho, more than two-thirds of the patients who have received
"cocktails" treatments have seen their symptoms controlled, allowing
them to lead better and longer lives.</P>
      <P>Ho arrived in Taipei Thursday to take part in a series of
activities in Taiwan aimed at promoting public awareness of AIDS and
efforts to help AIDS patients and their families.</P>
      <P>Ho made his vaccine strategy known at a press conference hosted
by the Department of Health (DOH) on Friday. Once the vaccines are
proven applicable to humans, they are expected to help stem the
deadly disease in Taiwan as well, he added.</P>
      <P>Also present at the press conference was renowned Chinese writer
Pai Shien-yung, who has made the United States his home for more than
20 years. Pai, who has never been married, is known for his many
novels, including one about gays which is believed to be based on his
own life story.</P>
      <P>Local rock singer and song writer Chi Chin vowed at the press
conference to be a lifetime AIDS prevention volunteer in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Addressing the press conference, DOH Deputy Director-general
Chang Hung-jen said that although the AIDS occurrence in Taiwan is a
relatively low ratio of 100,000:2.5, one of the lowest in the world,
Taiwan's youths are considered increasingly vulnerable to the killer
disease as their attitude toward sex is less conservative than the
older generations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIDC COOPERATING WITH SIKORSKY, AIRBUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  14  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's state-run Aerospace Industrial
Development Corp. (AIDC) is expanding cooperation with foreign
helicopter and aircraft manufacturers in the hope of further
upgrading its level of production, company sources said on Friday.</P>
      <P>After five years of strenuous research and development, AIDC
recently saw its fifth S-92 helicopter -- a revised version of
Sikorsky's UH-60 helicopter -- roll off the production line.</P>
      <P>AIDC began a cooperation deal with US-based Sikorsky in 1996 for
research, development and commercial production of S-92 helicopters.</P>
      <P>In May 1997, AIDC rolled out the first Taiwan-made S-92, a
20-seat, twin turbo-engine helicopter with a maximum range of 910 km
and maximum navigating speed of 287 kph. The model is good for
mid-range transportation for both passengers and cargo, and is also
recommended for use in rescue operations, exploration for natural
resources and for ferrying news workers.</P>
      <P>Over the subsequent three years, AIDC produced four more of the
helicopters, and it is expected that AIDC will receive contracts from
Sikorsky later this year, paving the way for the company to make
formal delivery of the S-92 helicopters to Sikorsky beginning in June
2001.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, AIDC signed a memorandum with French aircraft
manufacturer Airbus on Thursday in Paris for a mammoth project to
produce super jumbo A3XXs.</P>
      <P>The A3XX is envisaged as a super jumbo jet capable of carrying
480-650 passengers and suitable for use by Asian airlines.</P>
      <P>AIDC became the first Asian company to become involved in the
A3XX production project, which calls for an initial budget of 12.2
billion euros, with each aircraft expected to carry a price tag of
200 million euros. Planning of the project is scheduled to begin at
the end of 2000.</P>
      <P>The AIDC, formerly run by the military and currently owned by the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, has so far completed 80 percent of a
privatization process.</P>
      <P>If all goes smoothly, the company of 4,000 staff members which
earned its reputation by producing Taiwan's "Chingkuo," or Indigenous
Developed Fighter (IDF), is expected to become fully privatized at
the end of this year, the sources said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATORS URGE BEIJING NOT TO BULLY TAIWAN BUSINESSMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  14  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China legislators called on
Friday for the Beijing authorities not to intervene in the island's
affairs by bullying mainland China-based Taiwan businessmen.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers were referring to a warning made by Beijing over
the weekend that it will not permit Taiwan businessmen to pursue
economic benefits in mainland China while at the same time supporting
the Taiwan independence movement at home.</P>
      <P>Tsao Er-chung, a Kuomintang lawmaker, said during a legislative
forum on national affairs that the current cross-Taiwan Strait
situation is worse than that of 1996, when a missile crisis emerged
between the two sides. The island, noted Tsao, is now facing an
imminent threat of war.</P>
      <P>Tsao said he is very much concerned about the island's future,
especially as President-elect Chen Shui-bian of the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) warned the nation the other day
not to expect any breakthrough in cross-strait relations resulting
from his inauguration speech on May 20.</P>
      <P>Chen's inaugural speech is widely expected to outline the new
government's relations with Beijing and set the tone for cross-strait
relations during his four-year tenure.</P>
      <P>Tsao urged Chen to support the concept of "one China, with
different interpretations as to its meaning."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hong Hsin-jung, a KMT legislator from Changhua County,
called for the Beijing authorities not to intervene in the internal
affairs of the island as long as Taiwan does not declare
independence.</P>
      <P>If mainland China would like to have closer relations with
Taiwan, he said, the Beijing authorities should pursue its goal
through exchanges of trade, culture and education with the island.</P>
      <P>Lai Shi-bao, a New Party legislator from Taipei City, remarked
that it is regrettable that some Taiwan businessmen have been
penalized by Beijing for exercising their political rights.</P>
      <P>He was referring to the fact that a number of local business
tycoons reportedly have seen their planned mainland trips or projects
delayed at the request of the Beijing authorities.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, continued Lai, in view of the fact that the newly
appointed head of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council,
Taipei's chief policy-making body on cross-strait issues, is actually
a drafter of President Lee Teng-hui's "two states theory," he is
deeply worried about the future of Taiwan businessmen in mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Since there are more than 40,000 Taiwan tradespeople doing
business in the mainland, it is urgent that officials of the ROC
government, whether they are outgoing or members of the incoming
administration, should do their best to safeguard the interests of
these businessmen, Lai concluded.</P>

      <P>Republic of China President-elect Chen
Shui bian said on Friday that his inaugural speech on May 20 will not
formally comment on Beijing's "one China" principle, as he must first
wait until Taiwan reaches consensus on the issue.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during a visit to the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) under the Executive Yuan in the company of Vice
President-elect Annette Lu, where they were briefed on the current
cross-Taiwan Strait situation.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that big differences on the so-called "one
China" issue still exist between the government and opposition, and
noted that a non-partisan ad hoc committee led by Academia Sinica
President Lee Yuan Tseh has not yet touched on the issue.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that one speech would not be able to resolve
all the disputes which have occurred across the Taiwan Strait in the
past 12 years, and added that he will not create more trouble with
his inaugural speech.</P>
      <P>Instead, he continued, his speech will show to the Beijing
authorities that his government is ready to try its best to alleviate
cross-strait tension and contradiction with sincerity and goodwill,

    <HEADLINE>JUSTICE MINISTER-DESIGNATE VOWS TO WIPE OUT `BLACK GOLD'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Justice Minister-designate Chen Ting-nan
pledged on Friday that he will do his utmost to eradicate official
corruption and "black gold" politics after he assumes office.</P>
      <P>Chen, an incumbent legislator from the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), made the vow at a news conference held after he formally
accepted Premier-designate Tang Fei's invitation to join his Cabinet
as justice minister.</P>
      <P>Chen, who was known for his integrity and no-nonsense working
style during his eight-year stint as Ilan County magistrate in the
1980s, said he takes it as a great honor to join the new Cabinet and
help establish clean politics in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said he will make it his top priority to root out the
"handful" of government officials who have links with organized
crime, in order to wipe out "black gold" politics -- connections
between the government and underworld criminal rings.</P>
      <P>"Cutting off any connection between the government and organized
crime will be my top goal after assuming office," Chen said, adding
that he will pool the wisdom and resources from various quarters to
eliminate official corruption and "black gold" politics in order to
rebuild public confidence in the government.</P>
      <P>He said he will handle issues related to central-level elected
representatives with links to organized crime strictly in accordance
with the law. "I'll neither hesitate nor show any undue lenience in
dealing with issues related to legislators with links to organized
crime," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Chen said all Taiwan's political parties should learn from the
DPP's experience in nominating candidates for parliamentary
elections. Noting that the DPP has an "anti-organized crime
provision" in its nomination regulations, Chen said the DPP has never
nominated a hopeful with links to organized crime to represent the
party in any legislative election.</P>
      <P>Chen said the country's Election and Recall Law should also adopt
such a clause to ban any person with links to criminal rings from
taking part in parliamentary elections.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said he believes that the adoption of a "single
seat for a single constituency" election system can also help prevent
people with links to organized crime from entering parliament.</P>
      <P>Turning to prosecution and criminal investigation issues, Chen
said he will solicit opinions from low-echelon law enforcement
officers and various social quarters concerning restructuring the way
in which criminal investigations and prosecution systems and
procedures are carried out.</P>
      <P>Chen also gave his assurance that he will accelerate all
necessary judicial reforms. "Reform measures will be implemented very
quickly," Chen said firmly. "Nobody will be disappointed."</P>
      <P>He further said he will continue to push for legislation of
various "sunshine bills" and government ethics bills to ensure that
Taiwan can enjoy clean and transparent politics.</P>
      <P>As for the function of the Investigation Bureau under the
Ministry of Justice, Chen said he has no intention of phasing out the
bureau.</P>
      <P>He was referring to the situation a few years ago during the
notorious Pai Hsiao-yen kidnap-murder case, when the bureau and the
Criminal Investigation Bureau under the National Police
Administration traded accusations and counter-accusations that the
two bodies were hampering one another in the resolution of the case,
prompting Chen to call for abolishing the Investigation Bureau in
his capacity as a legislator.</P>
      <P>But now Chen said he will push the bureau to adjust the focus of
its work to fighting corruption and drug trafficking, as well as
intensifying surveillance and monitoring of spies from mainland China
who have infiltrated local society.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President-elect Chen Shui-bian said on
Friday his administration will study the feasibility of recruiting
high-tech experts from mainland China and foreign countries to make
up for a shortage of such personnel in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen made the statement during a courtesy call on Examination
Yuan President Hsu Shui-teh.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan needs a large number of trained science and
technology personnel to develop the island into a high-tech
manufacturing and service center.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Chen said the Republic of China must
upgrade its basic education level and consider recruiting high-tech
talents from foreign countries and even mainland China.</P>
      <P>Noting that talent recruitment should not be hindered by national
boundary and political ideology, Chen said he hopes the Examination
Yuan will help clear legal obstacles to recruiting mainland Chinese
high-tech experts who have worked in other countries for a specified
period of time.</P>
      <P>Turning to the March 18 presidential election, Chen said
his election victory signifies the importance of establishing
a sound civil service system. Chen's election marks the first
peaceful transition of power in Taiwan in more than five decades.</P>
      <P>"Transition of power among major political parties is all too
common in mature democratic countries," Chen said, adding that so
long as civil servants maintain administrative neutrality and avoid
involvement in election, they need not worry about change of the
head of state.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said he will push for revisions of current
regulations to allow high-ranking civil servants to work at private
enterprises for one year or two to "experience" the vitality and
competitiveness in the private business sector.</P>
      <P>"By so doing, I believe that our civil service system will
receive new vitality, new thinking and new vision to improve
operational efficiency," Chen noted.</P>
      <P>The president-elect also said he is very pleased to learn that
Lin Hsin-yi, vice chairman of China Motor Corp., has agreed to
serve as economics minister in his administration. "I'm convinced
that having a professional manager to head the economics ministry
will facilitate economic reforms and upgrading of national
competitiveness," he added.</P>

      <P>Beijing, April 14 (CNA): A mainland China scholar said on Friday
that the united front against Taiwan independent was being shaped as
a Beijing high ranking official expressed to welcome Acting
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan to visit Beijing if he uses a proper
status and supports the unification of China.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Hsueh-sheng(KMT- Taipei City) proposed on Friday
Acting KMT Chairman Lien Chan to make a trip for peace to mainland
China after he steps down as the vice president of the Republic of
China on May 20.</P>
      <P>In response, Zhang Ming-ching, director of Press Bureau of the

welcome to Lien's future trip.</P>
      <P>The scholar who likely kept his name said that Beijing will try

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's economic growth
rate will reach 6.66 percent this year, a local private think tank
predicted on Friday.</P>
      <P>The Chung-hua Institute for Economic Research (CIER) said its
optimistic forecast was based on the steady growth in global trade
and economic development.</P>
      <P>The CIER forecast was the highest among all figures predicted by
relevant domestic research institutions. The Cabinet-level
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics predicted
earlier this year that the country's 2000 economic growth rate will
be about 6.54 percent, while the Council for Economic Planning and
Development has projected the growth rate at 6.5 percent.</P>
      <P>In its first-quarter domestic economic performance report,
the CIER predicted that the Taiwan economy will grow at an annual
rate of 6.05 percent this year.</P>
      <P>The CIER said it has decided to upgrade its growth forecast to
6.66 percent mainly because of the country's better-than-expected
export performance in recent months as well as continued increase in
private consumption and investment.</P>
      <P>The institute pointed out that international trade has become
the driving force behind Taiwan's economic recovery since the
second quarter of last year.</P>
      <P>The CIER predicted that Taiwan's annual merchandise and service
exports will grow 8.33 percent this year and that its imports will
increase by 7.05 percent.</P>
      <P>Against this background, the CIER said Taiwan will enjoy an
estimated trade surplus of NT$257.5 billion (US$8.47 billion) this
year, which the institute said will help boost Taiwan's
annual economic growth.</P>
      <P>The CIER also forecast that the annual growth rate for private
consumption will reach 6.75 percent this year and total domestic
investment will hit 9.14 percent.</P>
      <P>With booming exports and widening trade surplus, the CIER said,
the New Taiwan dollar's exchange rate against the US dollar will
rise steadily and that the exchange rate may break the NT$30:US$1
barrier by the end of this year.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 14 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew approved on Friday a
request by the Ministry of the Interior to order the postponement of
the scheduled May 6 election of National Assembly (NA) delegates.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will inform the Central Election Commission
(CEC) to follow its decision, and it is up to the CEC to decide how
long the election should be delayed, said Shieh Shen-san, secretary
general of the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The National Assembly has currently gathered to revise the
Constitution with the purpose of doing away with itself. If assembly
delegates vote to wipe out the body by April 25, as some members have
vowed to do, then the election will be canceled, said Shieh.</P>
      <P>Chen Li-hui, secretary-general of the CEC under the Executive
Yuan said on Friday that the commission will meet soon to reschedule
the election and discuss how to handle funds deposited by those who
have already registered as candidates.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior recommended on Friday that the
Executive Yuan order the postponement after being urged by the
National Assembly to do so.</P>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Huang Chu-wen, speaking at a press
conference earlier on Friday, said that he thought the National
Assembly's request is appropriate and necessary, because there is not
enough time to call an election before current NA delegates' terms
expire on May 20.</P>
      <P>It is difficult for some of the National Assembly delegates who
intended to run for re-election to juggle their schedules between
their ongoing NA duties and extra electioneering, he added.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, preparations for the election would be in vain if
the current National Assembly abolishes the body before April 25.</P>
      <P>Fresh from the March 18 presidential election, the island could
not have another general election without further exciting the
public's already heated emotions, said Huang.</P>
      <P>Most of the 334 NA delegates were relieved Friday to learn that
the election has been postponed, especially those who intended to run
for re-election. The decision spares them the trouble of attending
the NA session in Taipei while campaigning in their home
constituencies.</P>
      <P>But Sun Ta-chien, a spokesman for the newly founded People First
Party, criticized the postponement as "an ill-thought decision and a
reckless move."</P>
      <P>The National Assembly election was originally scheduled for March
18, but delegates voted on September 4, 1999 to extend their own
terms by nearly two years, to June 2001. Much to their embarrassment,
this decision caused a public uproar, and was overruled by the Grand
Justices Council on March 24.</P>
      <P>The assembly's former speaker, Su Nan-cheng, a non-elected NA
member, had been stripped of his KMT party membership and lost his NA
seat because of his role in steering the extension bill through the
NA floor.</P>
      <P>The CEC had put the election back on track after the Grand
Justices Council's ruling. The vote had been slated for May 6.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA URGED NOT TO PRESSURE TAIWAN BIZMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 14 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers with Taiwan's leading political
parties on Friday urged mainland China not to use pressure on Taiwan
investors there as a way to interfere in Taiwan affairs.</P>
      <P>Relations between Taiwan and mainland China are at the point
where the sides must choose between making war or peace, a situation
even more dangerous than the 1996 missile crisis, said Kuomintang
Legislator Tsao Erh-chung. He also urged the public to pay great heed
to President-elect Chen Shui-bian's inaugural speech on May 20.</P>
      <P>As Chen of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party has
called on the public not to have overly high expectations about his
inaugural speech when touching on the cross-Taiwan Strait issue, Tsao
said Taiwan must not abandon the "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>"For the sake of our own security, we must support the 'one China
principle' under which each side is allowed to have its own
interpretation," Tsao stressed.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Chen has noticeably interfered in the formation
of the new cabinet's lineup by selecting pro-independence figures to
serve as foreign affairs minister, Mainland Affairs Council chief and
vice national defense minister, KMT lawmaker Wang Tein-ging suggested
that Premier-designate Tang Fei should now refuse the post.</P>
      <P>Since Tang evidently does not have much power in the new
cabinet's personnel arrangements, Tang, as a staunch
anti-independence figure, should not remain a part of a government
that is seeking independence, commented Wang.</P>
      <P>However, another KMT lawmaker, Hung Hsing-lung, called on the
Beijing leadership not try to involve itself in Taiwan affairs by
meddling in the mainland operations of Taiwan businesses, which he
said is a reflection of Beijing's hegemonic mindset and goes against
mainstream opinion in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It was Beijing's verbal attacks that helped Chen garner the most
votes in Taiwan's March 18 presidential poll, Hung said, asserting
that mainland China should instead seek to build closer relations
with Taiwan through bilateral cultural and economic exchanges.</P>
      <P>Lai Shih-pao, a lawmaker with the pro-unification New Party,
described Beijing's attempts to impose its ideology on mainland-based
Taiwan businessmen a "reversal of world trends."</P>
      <P>Blaming the current KMT government led by Premier Vincent Siew
for failing to take measures to secure the future of the more than
40,000 Taiwan firms in the mainland, Lai said Siew's administration
and the incoming cabinet should join forces to work out ways to help
improve the situation of Taiwan businessmen there.</P>

      <P>Graduates of National Cheng Kung
University are most welcomed in domestic business circles, according
to the results of a survey released on Friday by the Cheers quarterly
of Commonwealth magazine.</P>

stability, and respect for work, the survey revealed.</P>
      <P>Graduates of National Taiwan University and National Tsinghua

    <HEADLINE>'DO WHAT YOU CAN,' SAID FOREIGN MINISTER-DESIGNATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  14  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>What is pragmatic diplomacy? That is
"doing what you can," according to Tien Hung-mao, the foreign
minister-designate, on Friday.</P>
      <P>In his first meeting with the press after being selected as
foreign minister in the incoming administration of President-elect
Chen Shui-bian, Tien played down expectations for radical changes in
the island's diplomacy. Continuity in the country's diplomacy will be
maintained, he said, and he will outline his agenda after he consults
with outgoing foreign minister Chen Chien-jen.</P>
      <P>The US-educated doctor of political science dismissed as
"incorrect" a story by Reuters on Thursday wherein he is quoted as
saying that Taiwan would review its bid to rejoin the United Nations.
He stressed that continuity is the essence of diplomacy, and
adjustments in the island's UN bid, if any, will be done by the new
government through that normal process of policy formation.</P>
      <P>Noting that it is too early to announce any new diplomatic
policy, Tien said he would in the future be more gaurded when making
comments, to avoid being misquoted by the press.</P>
      <P>However, he said he will continue the pragmatic diplomacy, which
he characterized as "doing what you can and not indulging in dreams
about that which is beyond your reach."</P>
      <P>Asked about whether ties with Beijing should take precedence over
the island's diplomacy, Tien said it is not a question of mathematics
and there is no simple answer. But he said he would work on both.</P>
      <P>Tien has served as national policy adviser to the president,
adviser to the Executive Yuan, and adviser to the National
Unification Council before taking a position at a private think tank,
the Institute for National Policy Research. He has remained on that
job until now.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE ECONOMICS MINISTER SEEKING EU SUPPORT FOR TAIWAN'S WTO BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Brussels,  April 14 (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice Economic Affairs
Minister Lin Yi-fu is currently in Brussels seeking the European
Union's support for Taiwan's bid to join the World Trade Organization
(WTO).</P>
      <P>Lin met with officials from the European Commission, the
executive body of the 15-member European Union, on Thursday to
exchange views on last-stage consultations concerning Taiwan's WTO
accession and to seek their support. Lin, however, declined to say
which EC officials he has met or is going to meet.</P>
      <P>Before heading to Brussels, Lin visited the WTO headquarters in
Geneva to exchange views with relevant WTO officials on the timetable
of the 11th working group meeting on Taiwan's WTO accession.</P>
      <P>An expert on the WTO and a talented negotiator, Lin is scheduled
to depart Belgium for home on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has completed most of the bilateral consultations with and
sealed agreements with key WTO members on its bid to join the
organization. The EU represents the major exception, with talks and
an agreement still not being finalized.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, the European parliament (EP) passed a resolution
urging the 15-member EU to further boost ties with Taiwan. Most of
the 626 members attending the session in Strasbourg voted in favor of
the resolution that calls on EU member states and the European
Commission to strengthen relations with Taiwan in order to help the
island play a greater role in international organizations, including
the WTO.</P>
      <P>It is widely believed that Taiwan will enter the major world
trade regulatory body before the end of this year, at the same time
as mainland China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was granted observer status in 1992 by the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which was superseded by the WTO in
1995.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's share prices plummeted an
average of 5.4 percent on Saturday amid panic selling triggered by
Friday's Wall Street meltdown.</P>
      <P>The benchmark Taiwan Stock Exchange (Taiex) weighted price index
shed 507.81 points to close at 8,866.8, following a 3-percent decline
in the previous trading session. Altogether, the index has lost
nearly 1,000 points in the past few days.</P>
      <P>The local bourse opened weak amid bearish sentiment caused by
record point dives on both the New York Stock Exchange and the
tech-heavy Nasdaq index on Friday.</P>
      <P>Market analysts attributed the Taiex index's drastic fall
mainly to sell-off by foreign investors, who have been on the selling
side over the past few days and even worked overtime on Saturday to
sell more stocks to cope with heavy redemption pressure.</P>
      <P>The Taiex opened lower at 9,086.36 points and soon plunged below
the 9,000-point psychological barrier. The index hit a low of
8,780.08 at one point but managed to recover some grounds in the
last few minutes of trading.</P>
      <P>A total of 2.84 billion shares changed hands on a market turnover
of NT$155.72 billion (US$5.12 billion), down from the previous
trading session which saw 3.12 billion stocks change hands on a
market turnover of NT$185.43 billion.</P>
      <P>Losers outnumbered gainers 554 to 27, with 13 stocks remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>All the eight major categories lost grounds, with cement issues
registering the steepest fall at 6.3 percent, followed by
construction stocks at 5.8 percent, textile stocks at 5.7 percent,
electrical issues at 5.5 percent, and foodstuff, financial and

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier-designate Tang Fei on Saturday
continued to make fresh appointments to ministerial-level posts for
the new administration which is scheduled to be inaugurated on May
20.</P>
      <P>Tang, who was resting at his residence Saturday due to a mild
illness, confirmed that former Deputy Taiwan Governor Wu Jung-ming
has accepted his offer to become the minister of personnel under the
Examination Yuan.</P>
      <P>Wu, a key member of the newly-established People First Party, is
considered a good choice by Tang based on his previous experience as
the secretary-general of the Examination Yuan and also as a minister
without portfolio.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tang also confirmed that Chen Tin-nan, former Ilan
County magistrate and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
candidate in the last election for governor of Taiwan, has accepted
his offer to become the new justice minister.</P>
      <P>Other posts that have been filled include the position of head of
the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting, and Statistics by Lin
Chuan, a finance professor at National Cheng Chi University, and the
post of chairman of the Public Construction Commission by Lin
Neng-po, dean of National Taiwan University's management school.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsu Cheng-kuang, director of the Institute of
Ethnology under Academia Sinica, will be the new chairman of the
Mongolian &amp; Tibetan Affairs Commission, and Lin Chia-cheng, former
deputy mayor of Taipei, will be chairman of the Research, Development
and Evaluation Commission, said Tang.</P>
      <P>Tang, who is scheduled to check into hospital Sunday for
treatment of a benign thymoma in his chest, said other people have
also been offered appointments, including Tseng Chih-lang, president
of National Yang Ming University, who has been offered the post of
education minister. Tseng, however, is unlikely to accept the
appointment because of strong voices of opposition from within his
school.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yu Cheng-hsien, meanwhile, has been
offered the position of head of the National Sports Council but has
said he will need more time to think about it. Yeh Chu-lan, a DPP
legislator, has been offered the post of minister of transportation
and communications. Yeh said there are still some personal factors
she needs to consider before she makes her final decision.</P>
      <P>Tang said he is still contacting people regarding the post of
interior minister, which Chang Po-ya, the independent mayor of Chiayi
City, evidently turned down on Friday.</P>
      <P>Hao Lung-ping, convenor of the New Party's National Election
Campaigning and Development Committee, also turned down an offer by

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau on Saturday
continued to issue warnings that the heavy rains Taiwan is
experiencing may trigger devastating floods and landslides in the
northern and central parts of the island.</P>
      <P>Weathermen said the thunderous monsoon rains that slammed into
Hong Kong on Friday morning, overturning motorbikes, swamping cars,
and driving residents from flooded homes, reached Taiwan in the small
hours of Saturday morning.</P>
      <P>The monsoon rains, brought by a cold front from northern China,
forced Hong Kong schools to close and six flights to reroute to
Taiwan on Friday.</P>
      <P>By Saturday morning, weathermen said, 55 mm of rainfall had been
recorded on Yangmingshan north of Taipei city and 17 mm of rainfall
had been recorded in the central Taiwanese township of Wuchi.</P>
      <P>Although the torrential rains are expected to subside beginning
Sunday, weathermen have still urged residents in central Taiwan,
particularly in mountainous areas, to stay alert against possible
mudslides and landslides caused by the heavy rains.</P>
      <P>The heavy rains over the last day were accompanied by strong
winds, weathermen said, adding that vessels operating off Taiwan's
north and northeastern coasts and in the northern section of the
Taiwan Strait, as well as in the Bashih Channel, should be
particularly careful.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President-elect Annette Lu on
Saturday expressed the hope that world leaders will adopt a
"preventive diplomacy" to forestall any possible "irrational" moves
by mainland China after the inauguration of the new ROC government.</P>
      <P>Lu also urged United States President Bill Clinton to consider
inviting leaders from both sides of the Taiwan Strait to meet in
Washington D. C. for a dialogue.</P>
      <P>Lu said that world leaders who have expressed concern about
security in Taiwan Strait should "waste no time" in dealing with the
issue of cross-strait relations before Beijing attempts any
irrational moves because it is not satisfied with President-elect Chen
Shui-bian's inaugural speech on May 20.</P>
      <P>Chen said on Friday that his inaugural speech will not touch on
the "one China" principle espoused by Beijing because he must first
seek domestic consensus on the issue.</P>
      <P>Chen also said the speech won't solve all the disputes that have
developed across the Taiwan Strait over the last dozen years,
although he did add that he will express to Beijing his government's
intention of doing its utmost to ease cross-strait tensions.</P>
      <P>Because of the recent unfriendly remarks coming from the
mainland, Lu expressed the hope that world leaders will swiftly adopt
a "preventive diplomacy" on the issue of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Lu also said that Beijing's remarks have not only been directed
against her, but the "people of Taiwan," and she urged Taiwanese
citizens to show unity behind the new government.</P>
      <P>Before Taiwan's presidential election, Beijing issued a
white-paper policy saying that it will use force against Taiwan if it
puts off reunification negotiations indefinitely. It also sternly
warned the people of Taiwan against voting for any pro-independence
candidates, indirectly referring to the Democratic Progressive
Party's ticket of Chen and Lu.</P>
      <P>After the election, Beijing also lashed out at Lu, calling her a
"lunatic," traitor, and the "scum" of the Chinese nation for her
remarks stressing Taiwan's sovereign status.</P>

      <P>US Senate Democratic leader Thomas
Dsachle Friday expressed his opposition to putting the Taiwan
Security Enhancement Act (TSEA) on the Senate agenda at the present

      <P>He was responding to the Senate majority leader, Sen. Trent

profound consequences, both diplomatically and regionally within

    <TEXT>
      <P>US State Department spokesman Jamie
Rubin said Friday the US-PRC agreement that helps pave the way for
China's World Trade Organization entry is a national security issue
and if Congress rejects it, it will be a major setback for relations
between the two countries and could have an effect on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While addressing a conference of the US National Newspapers
Association in Washington, Rubin pointed out that US-PRC relations
are always in a fragile state and "a setback in our relationship
could have an effect on Taiwan, where there is a very sensitive
situation, where we are trying to walk a very careful line between
our support for Taiwan unofficially, while still holding to a policy
of `one China.'"</P>
      <P>In addition, the spokesman said, "we need China's help on real
problems, such as the North Korea problem. The North and South Korean
leaders are about to meet in a historic summit in June and it holds
the potential to really change dramatically the danger presented by a
heavily armed Korean Peninsula."</P>
      <P>"So these are concrete foreign policy needs that we think would
be harmed and jeopardized severely by a major setback in China
relations that would occur if this vote is turned down," added Rubin.</P>
      <P>The US Senate is almost certain to pass the legislation that
grants China permanent normal trade relations status, but the House
of Representatives is still divided on whether to pass similar
legislation in a vote scheduled for the week of May 22.</P>

      <P>The Sydney Morning Herald on Saturday reported that the Swedish

      <P>The CAA chief made the announcement while attending a celebration

      <P>Chang said a total of 17 million passengers made domestic flights
in Taiwan last year, with 76 percent of them using Sungshan Airport
as their departure or arrival point, showing that the airport
provides a valuable service to the public.</P>
      <P>Noting that up to 50,000 passengers arrive and depart from

      <P>An observation deck will also be built in the west wing of the
airport, allowing the public to observe the take off and landing of
planes, said Chang, adding that the project is expected to be
completed by 2003.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said that out of all 17 of the domestic and
international airports in Taiwan, only those in Taipei and Kaohsiung,
as well as CKS International Airport, make money. In order to
increase profitability, he said he will introduce the idea of
corporate management to Taiwan's other airports, adding that
improvements in the airports' eateries will also be made in this

      <P>Workers at the Ministry of Transportation
and Communications (MOTC) hope Legislator Yeh Chu-lan, their
minister-to-be, will boost the staff's morale by disposing of the
rampant cronyism in the ministry.</P>
      <P>The MOTC staff was surprised by the appointment of Yeh as their
head, because the Democratic Progressive Party legislator has had no
previous experience in MOTC affairs and has never served as an
administrator.</P>
      <P>It will likely take some time for the newcomer to become
aquatinted with the MOTC's business, especially with the complicated
issues involved in aviation, telecommunications, shipping, and road
and railway transportation.</P>
      <P>Although the MOTC staff have said they don't care who their new
head is, some of them have expressed the hope that Yeh will be able
to rid the ministry of the cronyism which has dampened the workers'
morale.</P>
      <P>A MOTC employee who spoke on condition of anonymity blamed the
last several MOTC heads for packing the ministry with their
associates, especially the outgoing minister Lin Fong-cheng, who
brought his confidants from the Ministry of Interior where he served
as minister into the MOTC and placed them in senior posts.</P>
      <P>As a result, the staff said, most of the senior posts were filled

    <TEXT>
      <P>The average hourly earnings of Taiwan's
production workers is at about the same level as those of Hong Kong
and South Korea, but is slightly lower than that of Singapore,
government sources said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to an international survey of production workers'
earnings in economies around the world by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics of the US Department of Labor, the average hourly wage of
workers in South Korea's manufacturing sector stood at US$5.00 in
1998, the lowest figure among the four "Asian dragons," said
officials from the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD).</P>
      <P>The hourly wage of production workers in Taiwan averaged US$5.20,
compared with Hong Kong's US$5.50 and Singapore's US$7.80, said CEPD
officials, quoting the US Department of Labor figures.</P>
      <P>The CEPD officials added that the figures are considerably
different if calculated in the respective currencies of the four
states instead of US dollars.</P>
      <P>When calculated in their own national currencies, the average
hourly wages of production workers in South Korea and Hong Kong in
1998 were 1 percent higher than those in 1997, while the average in
Taiwan increased 4 percent and the average in Singapore surged 6
percent over the same period.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the US Department of Labor survey also indicated that
Hong Kong had a ratio of 3.2:100 between non-wage earnings and all
the labor earnings of production workers, the lowest among the four
"Asian dragons." The ratio was 9.1 in Taiwan, 16.9 in Singapore, and
17.5 in South Korea.</P>
      <P>The ratio of non-wage earnings and all labor earnings is a gauge
of the flexibility of a job market. A higher ratio indicates a lower
flexibility of a job market, the officials noted.</P>

      <P>Pai Sheng-san, the honorary Chairman of

"China" from its name.</P>
      <P>In a meeting of the Koumintang's reform committee, Pai moved to
rename the Kuomintang, which translates into English as the "China
Nationalist Party."</P>
      <P>Calling himself a party member of many years, Pai said he found
the political trend in Taiwan is away from mainland China, adding
that the KMT will isolate itself from mainstream opinion by sticking
to its present name.</P>
      <P>Although Pai's proposal raised the eyebrows of those attending
the meeting, Ou Ching-teh, the deputy mayor of Taipei City who
chaired the meeting, called Pai's idea deserving of serious study.</P>
      <P>In the two-hour meeting, the reform committee did agree to clean
up the party's image by cutting KMT links with business tycoons and
gangsters and by delivering on party chairman Lien Chan's promise
during the presidential election to set up a trust fund to manage the
party's assets and enterprises.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the committee urged the party to aggressively engage
in public service for minorities and the disadvantaged within
Taiwan's society; to democratize the party's administration; to set
up a system where party candidates for public office are chosen
through primaries; and to set up a think tank to study public
policies.</P>
      <P>Ou said at the meeting that KMT should refrain from nominating
candidates with links to organized crime or with corrupt backgrounds,

    <HEADLINE>LIEN'S MAINLAND VISIT TO CONTRIBUTE TO CROSS-STRAIT TIES: HU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  15  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Outgoing Vice President Lien Chan's
planned visit to mainland China, if realized, will have a positive
effect on relations across the Taiwan Strait, ruling Kuomintang
spokesman Jason Hu said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lien, who now serves as KMT acting chairman, has expressed his
hopes to visit some major foreign countries and mainland China
after stepping down from the vice presidency on May 20.</P>
      <P>Hu, a former minister of foreign affairs, said he believes that
if Lien can realize his mainland travel plan, it will certainly
contribute to the Republic of China's national interest and
cross-strait rapprochement.</P>
      <P>"Given Lien's longtime immersion in cross-strait and diplomatic
affairs, I'm convinced that his mainland visit will help boost
constructive engagement between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
and even the ROC's national development," Hu explained.</P>
      <P>KMT sources said several party stalwarts, including Hu, KMT
Deputy Secretary-General Shao Yu-ming and Legislators Ting
Shou-chung and Chen Shui-saint, are actively promoting Lien's
mainland travel plan.</P>
      <P>As mainland China is still unwilling to resume dialogue with
Taipei, Hu said Lien's mainland travel plan cannot be unilaterally
"planned."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said
it will be pleased to see Lien make a "journey of peace" to mainland
China after his vice presidential tenure ends on May 20.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Wu An-chia said the MAC has coordinated with
other government agencies to set up a mechanism for screening
applications by retired high-ranking government officials or
political appointees to visit the mainland.</P>
      <P>Under current government regulations, Lien will have to file his
application with the Ministry of the Interior (MOI). "So long as
Lien's mainland travel plan does not involve any major national
secret, the MOI's screening panel is unlikely to reject his
application," he added.</P>
      <P>During a Friday meeting with KMT legislators, Lien said after he
steps down from the vice presidency, he plans to first visit some
major foreign countries and then make a trip to the mainland where
Lien spent his childhood and formative years.</P>
      <P>In response to Lien's statement, a Beijing official said Friday
evening that if Lien supports unification of the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait, he would be welcome to visit the mainland in a
"proper capacity."</P>

    <HEADLINE>RALLY CALLING FOR ABOLISHMENT OF NATIONAL ASSEMBLY POSTPONED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  15 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A large-scale rally scheduled to be held
on Sunday calling for a public drive to abolish the National Assembly
(NA) has been postponed, according to a news release issued by an
alliance on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Public Alliance to Abolish the National Assembly (PAANA), a
body comprised of more than 20 social activity organizations, noted
that since the Executive Yuan has decided to postpone the NA
elections scheduled for May 6, and since such a development is
beneficial to the revision of the constitution, a demonstration
calling for the abolishment of the NA is not necessary for the time
being.</P>
      <P>However, the alliance will keep a close watch on future
developments concerning the NA, said a PAANA spokesman.</P>
      <P>The majority Kuomintang (KMT) struck a deal earlier with the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the newly founded People First
Party (PFP) to reduce the assembly to an ad hoc body with most of its
powers to be taken over by the legislature.</P>
      <P>Under the tri-party accord, the NA in the future would only meet
to decide constitutional reform plans and presidential impeachment
resolutions initiated by the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The government on Friday decided to postpone the elections for NA
members, whose tenures expire this May 20. According to reports,
Premier Vincent Siew signed a directive to the Central Election
Commission to postpone the NA elections as a response to a resolution
passed by the NA urging a delay while they handle the constitutional
amendments that will decide the future of the body.</P>
      <P>Both the KMT and the DPP Assembly caucuses favor constitutional
amendments that would drastically weaken the NA and would thus make
an immediate election unnecessary. The two parties hold sufficient
votes to pass the amendments if members abide by their caucuses'
decision. However, some have shown their opposition already.</P>
      <P>This being the case, the PAANA urged in its news release that the
public continue to pay close attention to upcoming meetings of the
NA, which is scheduled to hold an open vote on Sunday to take up the
proposed constitutional amendments for their first reading.</P>

      <P>"Therefore, our two sides should use wisdom and innovative
thinking to resolve our disputes and improve bilateral relations,"
Chen urged in a speech delivered at a Lions Club meeting.</P>
      <P>The lawyer-turned-politician said all people on the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait should have confidence in their capability to
resolve thorny cross-strait problems and work out a mechanism for
constructive consultation and interaction.</P>
      <P>Noting that ethnic and partisan disputes will undermine
national unity and strength, Chen said national interest should
always come above any personal and partisan interests. "We should
stand united and forge a national consensus to enhance our
bargaining chips vis-a-vis mainland China," he added.</P>
      <P>Chen reaffirmed his determination to do his utmost after
assuming office on May 20 to push for the establishment of an
effective mechanism for constructive cross-strait dialogue and
consultation.</P>
      <P>Turning to domestic affairs, Chen dismissed as "sheer
speculation" press reports that he is at odds with Premier-designate
Tang Fei over Cabinet selections and that some members of the
just-disbanded "National Affairs Advisory Group" had actively
recommended candidates for various Cabinet posts.</P>
      <P>"All those reports were unfounded," Chen said categorically,
adding that he has never had any difficulty communicating with Tang
and that none of the National Affairs Advisory Group members have
ever recommended any hopeful for any government post.</P>
      <P>Chen lauded Tang, incumbent defense minister, as an open-minded
person with democratic thinking. "We respect each other and have
consistently exchanged views and discussed issues freely and
frankly," he explained, adding that they have had no difficulty
working out mutually acceptable options when they were divided by
some Cabinet selections.</P>
      <P>Chen said many recent press reports concerning Cabinet selections
were simply speculation, adding up to confusion and hindrance to
finalizing a new Cabinet line-up.</P>
      <P>Chen further said the disbanding of the National Affairs
Advisory Group didn't involve any behind-the-scenes tricks or
maneuvering.</P>
      <P>Chen said some Group members will join the new Cabinet and that
the remaining others will either be named senior advisers to the
President or national policy advisers after he assumes the
presidency.</P>
      <P>Chen said Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh, also head of
the just-disbanded National Affairs Advisory Group, will be the "top
senior adviser" to him, adding that Lee will have an office in the
Presidential Office after the May 20 presidential inauguration.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Lee will head a cross-party panel to help
forge a national consensus on highly sensitive issues concerning the
development of relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  April 15 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An association of university students
in Hong Kong Saturday issued a statement criticizing the remarks
made Wednesday by a Beijing official on the responsibility and
obligation of the press in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Wang Fengchao, deputy director of Beijing's Liaison Office in Hong
Kong, said Wednesday that the news media of Hong Kong are obliged to
support China's position on the issue of unification with Taiwan. The
media should not treat speeches advocating Taiwan independence as
ordinary news items, he said, adding that Hong Kong news media have
the responsibility and obligation to uphold China's unity.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks after Taiwan's vice president-elect
Annette Lu talked about cross-strait relations last week in an
interview with a Hong Kong cable TV station. She was called "the
scum of the nation" by China's official news media for making
"separatist remarks" in the interview.</P>
      <P>The statement said that Wang had trampled press freedom in Hong
Kong and that, only when freedom of speech and freedom of the press
are ensured, can the news media cover news events objectively and
fairly. The students also urged Beijing to refrain from attempting to
restrict press freedom in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The statement was delivered Saturday to the Liaison Office by
some 20 student representatives of three universities in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Wang's remarks also caused public outcry earlier this week from
news media and political groups in Hong Kong.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>People First Party (PFP) Vice Chairman
Chang Chao-hsiung said on Saturday that his party will not promote
party-to-party exchanges with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chang said in an interview with CNA that as the Republic of
China faces many hindrances and obstacles on the diplomatic front,
the PFP will actively promote party-to-party engagements
with major political parties in the United States, Japan,
European countries and even Russia.</P>
      <P>"I believe increased contact and exchanges with major political
parties in those countries will help expand the ROC's diplomatic
frontiers and enhance its presence and visibility in the
international community," said the cardiologist-turned-politician
who teamed up with independent presidential candidate James
Soong to run in the March 18 election.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chang said the PFP will not forge any
party-to-party exchanges with the mainland as the political system
there remains a one-party dictatorship.</P>
      <P>Chang went on to say that the PFP, which was established after
the Soong-Chang team lost the hotly contested presidential election
with a razor-thin margin, would be willing to support
President-elect Chen Shui-bian in negotiating with mainland China to
safeguard Taiwan's security, dignity and national interests so long
as Chen does not promote Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Chang said Taiwan need not provoke mainland China but should
also not be easily daunted by Beijing's saber-rattling, adding that
the PFP supports Chen's call for forging a national consensus on the
development of relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN TO USE 'SOFT' APPROACH IN DEALING WITH CROSS-STRAIT ISSUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President-elect Chen Shui-bian on Sunday
invoked the wisdom of a soft and subtle approach advocated by ancient
Chinese philosophers in his dealing with thorny cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>In the latest of his conciliatory gestures to the mainland since
winning the March 18 presidential election, Chen of the
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party has used reassuring
words to try to assuage misgivings about the his new government.</P>
      <P>He said that the soft and subtle approach is "not a sign of
weakness, or capitulation," but rather "a determined mind and a
higher form of wisdom."</P>
      <P>Chen said his defeat in the Taipei mayoral election in late 1997
has taught him to be "humble" and learn to rise up from losing.</P>
      <P>He also said a soft approach can "diminish rivalry and bridge
distances" and that it also can "help communication and prevent
making enemies." He further stated that so long as there is "goodwill
and sincerity," he is confident of easing tensions across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen said that both sides of the Taiwan Strait share the cultural
heritage of such an approach advocated by classic thinkers Lao-tsu 
(604 B.C. - 531 B.C.) and Chuang-tsu (C 300 B.C.). He advocated using
ancient Chinese wisdom to help solve cross-strait issues, rather than
one side imposing its will on other.</P>
      <P>Chen also reiterated his ideas in forming a government of the
people, saying that he has to consider all factors, including party
and factions, gender and ethnic groups, in forming the government.</P>
      <P>He said he will use "love and patience" in running the
government, and he expressed the hope that the public will allow the
members of the new Cabinet to show their mettle.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks when he was speaking to the annual meeting
of Multiple District 300 Lions Clubs International members in
Taichung, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen vowed that after his inauguration on May 20, he will try to
bridge the gap of development between cities and townships, and also
speed up the development of Taichung.</P>
      <P>He said that he would make good on his campaign promises to
upgrade Taichung city to a municipality; to establish an
international airport in Taichung, the third one in Taiwan after CKS
International Airport and Kaohsiung Airport; and to set up a
science-based industrial park in Taichung after similar ones in
northern and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also said that the new government attaches great importance to
post-quake reconstruction after the devastating Sept. 21 earthquake,
which hit central Taiwan severely.</P>
      <P>Chen vowed that a minister-without-portfolio in the Executive
Yuan will be in charge of the reconstruction efforts and that he
would visit the quake-affected areas at least once every month to
hear the voice of the people and monitor reconstruction efforts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN REAFFIRMS 'THREE NOES' TO SHOW GOODWILL IN CROSS-STRAIT ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  April  16  (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President-elect Chen
Shui-bian said that "maintaining peace and stability across the
Taiwan Strait and safeguarding the interests of Taiwan are the
highest goals and moral obligations" for him as a president.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in an interview with a Japanese daily, the
Sankei Shimbun, which published the interview on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen reaffirmed the "three noes" policy to show his good will and
sincerity in easing cross-strait friction. He said that he would not
promote "special state-to-state relations" between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait, which was vehemently opposed by the mainland after
President Lee Teng-hui first broached it in July 1999.</P>
      <P>He also said that he will not put the question of Taiwan
independence or unification with the mainland to a referendum, and
will not change the name of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>To ease troubled cross-strait relations, Chen of the
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party has sounded
conciliatory notes to the mainland since winning the March 18
presidential election.</P>
      <P>However, Chen also said that "Taiwan's independent sovereignty is
a historical and political fact," and that both sides of the Taiwan
Strait should use "one China" as an issue, not as a principle as
espoused by the mainland for cross-strait communications and
exchanges.</P>
      <P>He also urged Beijing not to pin overly high hopes on his
inaugural speech on May 20, saying that the cross-strait issue is a
complex one which has remained unsolved over the past five decades.</P>
      <P>But he said that he will stress "sincerity and goodwill" in the
speech, and he hopes that there will be reciprocal response from the
other side of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He said that Beijing has demanded that Taiwan accept the "one
China" principle as the cross-strait dialogue, but as both sides have
different interpretations of what "one China" means, it will not be
possible to accept the principle without first reaching a consensus
on the issue among Taiwan's public.</P>
      <P>Trying to assuage misgivings of the public, he also said that he
will continue to uphold the national flag of the Republic of China,
and will not change the content of the national anthem. He said that
he is most concerned about "peace in the Taiwan Strait, security of
the nation, and how to pursue reforms with stability," and that the
national flag and anthem will not even be a question.</P>
      <P>On the prospect of ROC-Japan relations, Chen said that he met
with the new Premier Yoshiro Mori when he visited Japan last year and
that their friendship will continue. Mori was then the
secretary-general of the Liberal democratic Party.</P>
      <P>Though there are no diplomatic relations between the two nations,
he foresees that younger political figures from both nations will
have more exchanges and promote bilateral cooperation.</P>
      <P>He lauded the outgoing President Lee as the "father of reform,"
and that he will continue to pursue the reforms pioneered by Lee.</P>
      <P>He also said that he would not visit Japan before his
inauguration, but he expressed the hope that President Lee will be
able to visit Japan after stepping down from office.</P>

election.</P>

members of the Lions Club for rescue and reconstruction work after
the earthquake last year. Central Taiwan was devastated by a killer
earthquake that jolted Taiwan on Sept. 21, 1999, claiming more than
2,400 deaths and causing heavy damage to property.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT POISED TO ENSURE PEACEFUL POWER TRANSITION: GIO HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  April  15  (CNA)
(By M. C. Chou and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang will continue to promote
government operations during the current period, although the party
is to hand over the helm of the central government to the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) next month, ROC Government spokesman Chao Yi
said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chao, a KMT member who serves as the incumbent head of the
Government Information Office (GIO), vowed that the KMT-led cabinet
will fulfill its obligations as a "care-taker" government during the
present period before the DPP's President-elect Chen Shui-bian is
inaugurated as the Republic of China's next president on May 20.</P>
      <P>The KMT has learned a lesson from its defeat in Taiwan's March 18
presidential race, and will do its best to ensure a smooth power
transition in compliance with democratic rules, the GIO
head stressed. Taiwan is determined to stick to its democratization
goal regardless of the election result, he added.</P>
      <P>As the KMT has also played a role in Taiwan's democratization,
Chao claimed that it is natural that the party will continue to
advocate that path, although it must bow out following a rule of 54
years on the island.</P>
      <P>The KMT's top priority at present is to help ensure a smooth
transition of power and maintain social order, he emphasized,
pointing out that the KMT, for the sake of national interest, is also
willing to allow its members to be recruited by the DPP-led new
government.</P>
      <P>The GIO chief, on behalf of the ROC government, also expressed
gratitude to European media for their support of Taiwan during the
most difficult times for the country.</P>
      <P>Chao made the remarks while answering questions from reporters
with major international journals, such as Figaro and Le Monde. He
flew into Paris earlier the same day on the first leg of a two-week
European tour.</P>
      <P>When asked about whether a pro-independence Chen would proclaim
Taiwan independence, Chao ruled out such a possibility.</P>
      <P>Describing Chen as a mild man and singling out his "new middle
way" philosophy to rule the country, Chao asserted that the
president-elect will not risk Taiwan's security and added that Chen,
who has claimed several times to be President Lee Teng-hui's best
successor, will undoubtedly handle Taiwan's relations with mainland
China with great care.</P>
      <P>Chen, as an idol for Taiwan's younger generations and a symbol of
Taiwan's future hope, will not act as a strongman, he noted.
According to the GIO chief, Chen will do his best to promote ethnic
unity in Taiwan and maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait as a way to
meet the high expectations that the vast silent majority have for
him.</P>
      <P>Although the KMT will soon become an opposition party, Chao
forecast that there will ample room for his party and the People
First Party (PFP) to cooperate in the future on working toward common
goals.</P>
      <P>Former Taiwan Governor James Soong, who lost the March 18
presidential poll to Chen of the pro-independence DPP by a slim
margin of 2.5 percent, serves as the PFP's chairman.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TANG'S TUMOR REMOVING OPERATION SMOOTH AND SUCCESSFUL: SURGEON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 16 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier-designate Tang Fei's operation to
remove a tumor was smooth and successful, the Veterans General
Hospital said on Sunday.</P>
      <P>"Everything is all right and smooth," said chief surgeon Huang
Min-hsiung when he emerged from the operating room at 12:20 p.m.</P>
      <P>The incumbent defense minister checked into the hospital on
Saturday to undergo a surgery to remove a thymoma tumor, measuring
3cmx3cmx2cm in size.</P>
      <P>Tang was diagnosed to have suffered from a thymoma, a chest tumor
between the lungs, and also myasthenia gravis, a nerve disease that
carries the symptoms of weakness and fatigue of the facial muscles,
after a check-up early this month to the hospital.</P>
      <P>President-elect Chen Shui-bian visited Tang in the hospital
shortly after a trip to Chiayi city, which is in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Initial studies indicate that the tumor was benign, and it would
take Tang two weeks to recover, the hospital said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, President-elect Chen went to the Shin Kong Memorial
Hospital on Saturday afternoon for treatment of decayed teeth.</P>
      <P>Chen and Tang have been busy in the past few days picking
ministers for the new Cabinet. Chen will take office on May 20 and
the line-up of Tang's Cabinet will be fixed by the end of this month.</P>
      <P>Chen had called on Chiayi Mayor Chang Po-ya at noon the same day
to persuade her to accept the post as new cabinet's interior
minister. Chang has not yet agreed to take the post.</P>

      <P>Some 400,000 employees and family
members of the businesses affiliated with China's Zhong Gong
meditation group jointly sent an open letter to the United Nations
Human Rights Commission Sunday, urging it to censure Beijing for
violating their basic human rights.</P>
      <P>In the letter, sent through the Hong Kong-based Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China, they said
that since last October the Chinese government has closed down more
than 3,000 firms affiliated with Zhong Gong and confiscated 810
million yuan (US$98 million) of their assets in a government
crackdown on the organization.</P>
      <P>The petitioners said that by doing so the Chinese government has
deprived them of their right to work, and that they now live in
abject poverty.</P>
      <P>Along with Falun Gong, Zhong Gong was banned last July as an
"evil cult."</P>
      <P>The letter said Zhong Gong, which claims to have some 10 million
followers in China, has done nothing evil or illegal. Like Falun
Gong, Zhong Gong is an organization dedicated to the promotion of a
traditional breathing and meditating method better known as "qi gong"
in China.</P>

      <P>The Fujian-registered fishing boat "Minchangyu F306" was forced

northeastern coast at around noon on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Two CGA patrol vessels approached the fishing boat at around 1:00
p.m. and told it over loudspeaker to leave ROC waters. After the
warnings were ignored, the coastal police boarded the "Minchangyu

nearest Taiwan port.</P>

      <P>The Australian representative to the
Republic of China painted a rosy picture concerning his country's
trade and people-to-people relations with Taiwan, particularly in the
period after Taipei joins the World Trade Organization as expected,
possibly later this year.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Australian, Sam Gerovich, head of the
Australian Commerce and Industry Office in Taiwan, said that "we are
confident that the dynamics of our commercial relations will continue
to develop irrespective of whom is president."</P>
      <P>"We do need to consider whether changes in cross-strait relations
create problems for potential investors or traders. We can expect the
economic and people-to-people relationships to move forward," he
added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in a dispatch from Taipei, the Australian reported
that Australia's two-way trade with Taiwan rose to US$4.81 billion in
1999, with Canberra enjoying a huge trade surplus.</P>
      <P>Gerovich noted that the memorandum of understanding signed
between the Tuntex Group and the Australian LNG consortium last year
would pave the way for the annual importation by Taiwan of four
million tons of LNG from the Northwest Shelf in western Australia for
the next 20 years.</P>
      <P>Gerovich said there are no major outstanding trade issues between
Australia and Taiwan and Canberra looks forward to Taiwan's entry

      <P>"Once Taiwan is in the WTO, the existing tilt in the playing
field toward the United States and the resulting market distortions
will be eliminated," he told the daily.</P>

to active buying by four government-related funds.</P>
      <P>The benchmark Taiwan Stock Exchange (Taiex) weighted price index

    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator on Monday called for the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) to pay closer attention to the
problem of stolen Republic of China passports being sold illegally
for high prices.</P>
      <P>At an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan, New Party
Legislator Lai Shih-pao said a forged ROC passport has a market value
of about NT$200,000 (US$6,555) and questioned whether MOFA officials
have any idea about this problem.</P>
      <P>Ku Fu-chang, director-general of the MOFA's Bureau of Consular
Affairs, answered that he had heard that figure quoted before but
added that he doubts whether such a market exists with the price
being so high.</P>
      <P>Ku admitted that forged ROC passports have been in high demand in
recent years as an increasing number of Asian people are trying to
get their hands on one in order to be able to leave their countries.</P>
      <P>Quoting an MOFA survey, Ku said that out of the some 1.2 million
to 1.4 million passports issued each year by the MOFA, about 21,000
are reported lost. Of the lost copies, only about 200 are found to be
forged and used by other people.</P>
      <P>Lai ridiculed the MOFA's handling of the issue of forged
passports, saying that the MOFA has helped create illicit business
opportunities worth over NT$4 billion (US$131 million) annually for
organized crime rings simply because it has not improved its policies
to prevent illegal practices.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of the Kuomintang Central Advisory
Council Presidium expressed their concerns about the fate of the
party in a seminar on Monday.</P>
      <P>More than 10 members attended the seminar on the KMT's party
reform and cross-strait policies. They plan to take their views to
acting KMT Chairman Lien Chan with whom they have a scheduled meeting
on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang Tso-jung, the former president of the Control Yuan, said
that the urgent question now for the party is how to regain power in
the next four years, adding that he is "pessimistic" about the
prospects of this judging from the KMT's current approach and
situation.</P>
      <P>Wang said the election defeat of the KMT, which boasts 2 million
members but could only manage a third finish in the March
18 presidential election, could mean the collapse of the party.</P>
      <P>Wang suggested that Lien Chan should have an open mind and seek
the return of those KMT members who were stripped off their
membership because of political reasons.</P>
      <P>He also said the KMT should have direct elections for the party's
chairman, instead of the current practice of KMT delegates choosing,
adding that only by doing so can there be any hope of retaking
political power.</P>
      <P>Several members also suggested that not only the party's
chairman, but also its Central Standing Committee members be directly
elected, and that the party's congress be held every two years,
instead of every four years, to enliven the party's organization and
galvanize the unity of KMT members.</P>
      <P>They said the KMT should seek to attract those who have ideals
back into the party's fold and make the party more appealing to young
voters.</P>
      <P>Irwine W. Ho, former secretary-general of the National Assembly,
said that the crisis of the century-old party stems from the loss of
confidence of veteran KMT members and the party's unattractiveness to
young voters.</P>
      <P>Clement C. P. Chang, former Minister of Transportation and
Communications, suggested that the party begin nurturing talent now
for future elections.</P>

economically, politically and socially before they get better as the

      <P>In a dispatch from Beijing, the daily on Monday carried a report
that stated China is facing a lot of headaches as it formulates its
tenth Five Year Plan for the period between 2001 and 2005.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that China must begin to dismantle its arcane
system of protective tariffs, cut subsidies to its failing state-run
enterprises, dig its banks out from under a mountain of bad debt, and
allow foreign competitors to a slice of its domestic industries
following its entry into the World Trade Organization later this
year.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted a senior official of China's State Development
and Planning Commission as predicting that its economy will grow
between 7 and 8 percent in the next five years following growth of
7.1 percent in 1999.</P>
      <P>But a 7 to 8 percent growth rate will only be achieved if China
succeeds in entering the WTO later this year. If it fails to, then it
will find it difficult to achieve an average growth rate of 6 percent
during its tenth Fifth Year Plan, the official said.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that China has been slow to publicize
industry-specific policies aimed at complying with WTO membership
conditions, though it has shown great willingness to make changes.</P>
      <P>The slow changes are being caused by the fact that domestic
interests are protecting industries and jobs following massive
layoffs over the past two to three years, the daily reported.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MEDICINE, LAW TOP SUBJECTS FOR TAIWAN STUDENTS SEEKING IN MAINLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  April  17  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Law and medicine, particularly Chinese
traditional medicine, were top choices for Taiwanese students seeking
higher education on the Chinese mainland.</P>
      <P>The two areas were most popular with Taiwanese students because
qualification thresholds in China are much lower than those in
Taiwan, and graduates of those subjects are likely to have promising
career future, according to Taiwanese student circles in Shanghai and
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Currently there are about 200 Taiwanese students studying
medicine in Shanghai. Due to the relatively low entrance
requirements, Taiwanese students who cannot attend medical schools in
Taiwan find it much easier to enroll in China.</P>
      <P>Some Taiwanese students who have even failed to pass the
mainland's entrance examinations were nonetheless admitted into
medical schools after their parents made donations to the schools,
said a Taiwanese student surnamed Lee at Shanghai Medical University.</P>
      <P>Lee said he chose to study medicine in Shanghai because students
on the mainland have greater access to clinical experience than
students in Taiwan. For example, he said, more than 20 students would
have to share one clinical table for an anatomy class in Taiwan,
compared with four students on the mainland.</P>
      <P>However, Lee admitted that, on the whole, teaching facilities in
mainland Chinese medical schools lag behind most of Taiwan's.
Furthermore, Taiwan authorities do not recognize academic degrees
conferred by mainland schools, prompting Taiwanese students who have
studied on the mainland to seek further education beyond China.</P>
      <P>On average, Lee noted, about 30 percent of such students turned
to the United States for further studies, 20 percent stayed on the
mainland after they obtained a medical degree, and many of the rest
turned to other career areas.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese student studying at Beijing University's law school
said he chose to study law on the mainland in the belief that laws
and related expertise will be in great demand in years to come as the
era of cronyism, where one must depend on personal connections for
societal achievements, will soon pass in China. Rule of law is
expected to become the norm in the not-too-distant future.</P>
      <P>The student, surnamed Yang, said that experts who know both
mainland Chinese and Taiwanese legal systems will be in great demand
after both Taiwan and mainland China enter the World Trade
Organization.</P>
      <P>The number of students from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau who
applied to study in law schools in Beijing totaled about 100 this
year, evidently an increase over past years, Yang added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>QUAKE VICTIMS IN NANTOU COUNTY NOT SATISFIED WITH RELIEF EFFORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  17  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An alliance of quake victims in Nantou
County in central Taiwan on Monday demanded that quake relief efforts
there match those of neighboring Taichung County.</P>
      <P>Teng Shuang-ching, spokesperson for the alliance, noted that more
than seven months have passed since the devastating Sept. 21
earthquake that hit Taiwan. Taichung and Nantou Counties bore the
brunt of damage during the massive temblor.</P>
      <P>Teng said that reconstruction works in Nantou County have
repeatedly let quake victims there down. He added that not only the
is the assessment of damaged housing still incomplete, but subsidies
and compensation for the quake-affected areas don't compare to those
of Taichung County.</P>
      <P>The alliance demanded that relief efforts in Nantou County should
be at least the same as that in Taichung County, if not better.</P>
      <P>Teng also demanded that Nantou County government publicly reveal
how NT$1.6 billion (US$52.46 million) of donated quake relief funds
is being used.</P>
      <P>The alliance had originally planned to stage a protest in front
of the Nantou County government building, but had instead decided to
meet with county officials.</P>
      <P>Deputy County Magistrate Lai Ying-fang promised that the county
government will consider the views of the quake victims in future
relief efforts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER-DESIGNATE TANG RECOVERING WELL AFTER SURGERY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  17  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Defense Minister and Premier-designate
Tang Fei was recovering well Monday after undergoing an operation to
remove a chest tumor the previous day, according to the hospital.</P>
      <P>Tang took some rice gruel for breakfast Monday morning, and was
to undergo breathing therapy in the afternoon. He is expected to be
moved from the intensive care ward to an ordinary one on Tuesday,
said Chief Surgeon Huang Min-hsiung of Taipei's Veterans General
Hospital.</P>
      <P>The tumor, known as a thynoma, was discovered when Tang underwent
a check-up earlier this month. He reportedly has gone for the
check-up as he was experiencing symptoms of myasthenia gravis, a
nerve disease that leads to symptoms of weakness and fatigue of the
facial muscles. The condition is a side-effect of the tumor.</P>
      <P>According to the initial examination of the tumor, it was benign,
and Tang is expected to take at least two weeks to recover. However,
Huang said the hospital would make a follow-up investigation and
continue its evaluation for six months.</P>
      <P>The chief surgeon also noted previously that the thynoma, a
tumorous growth on Tang's thymus gland, had not spread to Tang's
surrounding internal organs. He added that the thymus gland had been
completely removed, as is common practice during such operations.</P>
      <P>Huang said to the public after the operation that with the aid of
medicine, over 90 percent of patients recover to some extent from
myasthenia gravis.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the new government of President-elect
Chen Shui-bian and Premier-designate Tang is to be inaugurated on May
20, Tang's current health condition is of particular public concern.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, MAINLAND EXPECTED TO ENTER WTO BY END OF YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 17 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and mainland China are expected to
join the World Trade Organization (WTO) by the end of this year, Vice
Economic Affairs Minister Lin Yi-fu said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The matter will be clarified in early June after the US Congress
makes its decision granting "permanent normal trade relation (PNTR)"
to the mainland in late May; and whether an additional round of talks
between the mainland and the European Union, slated for next month,
will conclude smoothly, said Lin.</P>
      <P>As long as the two major factors affecting Taiwan's bid to join
the WTO can be duly addressed before late May, the vice economics
minister said that the timing for Taiwan's entry into the
Geneva-based world trade regulatory body will be easier to estimate.</P>
      <P>However, Lin pointed out that the international community has
come to a consensus that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should
join the WTO at the same time.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lin also revealed that Taiwan should be able to act
as an observer in the WTO's next round of negotiations, slated for
the near future, before the WTO grants formal membership to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chung Chin, a research fellow at the Chung-hua
Institute for Economic Research and the director general-designate
for the Government Information Office, said at a seminar that trade
liberalization is a global trend and that the entry of Taiwan and
mainland China into the WTO will impact Taiwan's market and help
local businesses improve their competitive edge.</P>
      <P>Turning to the political significance the WTO membership would
bring to the both sides, Chung commented that Taiwan should try to
seek an equal footing with the mainland in the organization in order
to prevent increased pressure from Beijing.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and mainland China were allowed to join the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum at the same time in 1991, but Taiwan was
facing greater isolation within the body due to Beijing's political
pressure, pointed out Chung.</P>
      <P>Urging the incoming government of President-elect Chen Shui-bian
of the Democratic Progressive Party to adopt new and open thinking to
deal with the problem, she forecast that the future of cross-strait
economic activities will develop by leaps and bounds.</P>
      <P>Tsai Hung-ming, executive secretary of the Chinese National
Federation of Industries, forecast that Taiwan will continue to
receive discriminatory treatment in international trade organizations
if mainland China stands in the way and views Taiwan as an economic
zone under its jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, H. T. Lu, a business management professor at Chung
Yuan Christian University expressed his opinion that the inclusion of
Taiwan and mainland China in the WTO will provide a channel for the
two sides to strengthen two-way exchanges.</P>
      <P>Mainland China wishes to enter the WTO as a means of underscoring
its powerful role in the Asia-Pacific region, while Taiwan wants to
join it in the hope of increasing contacts with its non-diplomatic
allies, the academic said.</P>
      <P>In addition to seeking to form business alliances across the
globe, he also suggested that the Taiwan business community consider
the mainland Chinese market as an international outlet and further
upgrade the quality level of their production.</P>
      <P>Echoing his view, W. J. Lee, director of the business management
school of Ming Chuan University who chaired the symposium, called on
the government to work out a comprehensive package of measures to
deal with the situation Taiwan will face after its admission into the
WTO.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the local economy will be hard hit by Taiwan's
WTO membership in the short term, and the government should make
necessary arrangements for the impact.</P>
      <P>All opinions voiced in the seminar will be referred to Chen's new
government to help it deal with relevant problems, and the seminar
will be broadcast on the Public Television Network this coming
Sunday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC'S TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS SECTORS GROWING SHARPLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  17  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's transportation, storage and
communications sectors grew substantially last year, making up 20
percent of the country's real economic growth, according to
statistics released by the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) on Monday.</P>
      <P>The MOTC attributed the growth mainly to the effects of
liberalization of the island's communications market.</P>
      <P>The statistics indicate that the gross product of Taiwan's
transportation, storage and communications sectors in 1999 totaled
NT$671 billion (US$21.6 billion), up 17.47 percent over the preceding
year, and accounting for 7.41 percent of the nation's gross domestic
product.</P>
      <P>Taiwan registered a 5.67 percent real economic growth rate last
year, 20 percent of which consisted of the transportation, storage
and communications sectors.</P>
      <P>MOTC officials expect that these sectors will contribute even
more to growth in 2000 because of further liberalization of the
communications market this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIDS 'COCKTAILS' PIONEER TO SERVE AS ROC'S TOP BIOTECH ADVISER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President-elect Chen Shui-bian on Monday
invited David Ho, a leading AIDS researcher in the United States, to
serve as the Republic of China's top adviser in biotechnology
development.</P>
      <P>Chen extended his invitation during a meeting with Ho, who is
currently on a weeklong visit to Taiwan to take part in a series of
activities aimed at promoting public awareness of AIDS and efforts
to help AIDS patients and their families.</P>
      <P>Chen said he hopes that Ho, who was born in the central Taiwan
city of Taichung and moved to Los Angeles with his family in 1965 at
the age of 12, can help upgrade Taiwan's biotechnological
development.</P>
      <P>Chen further said he believes that technological development,
particularly in the biotechnology field, can serve as a bridge for
dialogue and communication among Taiwan, mainland China and the
United States.</P>
      <P>"I earnestly hopes that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and
the United States can forge closer technological cooperation to help
ensure lasting peace in the region," Chen added.</P>
      <P>Ho has pioneered the use of "cocktails" treatment to combat HIV,
which causes AIDS, and provided the first glimmers of hope to AIDS
patients for better and longer lives. He is now working on a vaccine
strategy in the hopes that a cheaper and more convenient method of
fighting the deadly disease will soon be available. A Ho-led US
research team may begin clinical testing on AIDS vaccine in mainland
China next year.</P>
      <P>Chen said he hopes that Ho's research activities in the United
States, mainland China and Taiwan can benefit all the three sides
and further help ensure peace in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Ho, also an academician of the ROC's highest research body
Academia Sinica, said he is more than willing to assist in Taiwan's
biotechnological development.</P>
      <P>Ho said Taiwan should focus efforts on three key points in
boosting biotechnological development -- talent cultivation,
attracting overseas ROC experts to return to Taiwan for research
work and research program financing.</P>
      <P>According to Ho, many overseas ROC scientists are willing to
contribute to their homeland so long as the government here can
offer suitable working terms and research climate.</P>
      <P>Ho, who made friends with Chen during Chen's stint as Taipei
mayor from 1994 through 1998, said he hopes that Chen's
administration will take more active steps to support various
high-tech and biotech research programs. If Chen offers a formal
invitation after assuming office, Ho said he will be very pleased to
serve as a biotech adviser to the new ROC government.</P>
      <P>Ho was named by Time Magazine as its "Man of the Year" in 1996
for "helping lift a death sentence on tens of thousands of AIDS
sufferers, and for pioneering the treatment that might lead to a
cure."</P>
      <P>The "cocktails" treatment has actually proven to be effective for
a large number of AIDS patients over the last four years. According
to Ho, more than two-thirds of the patients who have received
"cocktails" treatments have seen their symptoms controlled, allowing
them to lead better and longer lives.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Year 2000 Trend Setting &amp; Technology
Conference was held in Taipei on Monday with more than 100 experts
and industrialists from home and abroad participating.</P>
      <P>The conference was jointly sponsored by Stanford University's
Scholastic Foundation and the Taiwan Chapter of the Stanford
University Alumni Association. The meeting's purpose is to promote
the interchange of ideas and experiences in the semiconductor,
Internet, and information technology industries.</P>
      <P>Morris Chang, chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.,
Ltd. (TSMC), said that the local integrated circuit (IC) industry
must cultivate more design talent and strengthen basic industrial
know-how.</P>
      <P>Chang said that although the use of peripheral products are
increasing as a result of the emergence of the Internet, the PC still
is the mainstream worldwide trend. He added that semiconductors will
enjoy brisk sales in the future, and cited an expected 25 percent
annual growth rate for TSMC over the next two years.</P>
      <P>Chang says that the local semiconductor industry must cultivate
technological skills and improve basic industrial studies in the face
of a strong challenge from the mainland China semiconductor industry.
He predicted that the semiconductor market in mainland China will be
larger than that of Japan in 10 years, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>Jim Plummer, a world-renowned semiconductor expert, and Annelee
Saxinian, an expert on trend analysis, delivered keynote speeches at
the meeting. They argued that a thorough diagnosis and analysis of
the direction of Taiwan's future industrial development and
competitiveness must be conducted.</P>
      <P>Hsih Chin-tai, director of the Industrial Institute for Research
and Development, pointed out that the global population of Internet
users has topped the 50 million mark, the highest number since
figures became available four years ago. The population will only
increase further as emerging broadband technologies increase web
connection speed and ease of use, Hsih said.</P>

      <P>A Chinese dissident, who was a member

prostitutes."</P>
      <P>The information center said that since the end of 1998 Chinese
authorities have sent five other dissidents to labor camps on
charges of having sex with prostitutes, and that Yao's family hope
the United Nations Human Rights Commission will condemn Beijing for
sending political dissidents to labor camps on false criminal

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's passport validity
period will be extended from the current six years to 10 years in
line with the practice adopted by major democratic countries around
the world.</P>
      <P>The move is a key point included in a passport regulations
amendment bill passed at a joint meeting of the Legislative Yuan's
foreign and overseas Chinese affairs committee and several other
relevant legislative committees on Monday.</P>
      <P>Vice Foreign Minister Wu Tzu-dan said the proposed extension of
ROC passport validity is aimed at reducing the workload of relevant
government agencies and meeting the standards of advanced democratic
countries.</P>
      <P>According to the draft amendment bill, the validity period for
diplomatic and official passports will be extended to five years from
the current three years.</P>
      <P>The amendment bill also eases restrictions on passport
requirements for adult men who have not yet fulfilled mandatory
military service. Under the revised rules, those men will no longer
be required to apply for government approval before filing passport
applications. Instead, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will
add a stamp to the passport indicating that the holder has yet to
fulfill compulsory military service.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the draft bill adds regulations detailing the
scenarios where MOFA can legally reject passport applications, such
as at the request of judicial offices or where applicants are found
to have presented false personal data. Current regulations do not

    <HEADLINE>PENTAGON RECOMMENDS POSTPONEMENT OF ARMS SALES TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  17 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Pentagon is to recommend against
the sale of four Aegis destroyers to Taiwan, but will agree to sell
the island long-range radar and advanced medium-rang air-to-air
missiles (AMRAAM), the Washington Post reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of two-day negotiations in Washington, D.C.
between the United States and Taiwan on arms sales, the paper quoted
sources close to the talks as saying that the Defense Department will
also recommend putting off decisions on the sale of several other
weapons such as submarines and P-3 Orion anti-submarine aircraft.</P>
      <P>The sources said that the Pentagon's opinions could prevail in
the Clinton administration because of the sensitivity in
Taipei-Beijing ties following Taiwan's election of a pro-independence
president.</P>
      <P>Given Washington's desire to see Beijing opening dialogue with
Taipei, it would be inappropriate to encourage Taiwan's attempt to
secede from mainalnd China and thereby worsen the climate between the
two by arms sales to Taiwan at present, said the sources.</P>
      <P>Instead, the sources said, Washington will wait and see how
Taiwan's president-elect Chen Shui-bian will deal with Beijing after
he is sworn in on May 20 before making any decision on sensitive arms
sales.</P>
      <P>However, the Pentagon will favor sale of a long-range radar
system known as PAVE PAWS, to Taiwan, so long as Taipei can show how
it would be integrated into its air defense system, said the Post.</P>
      <P>The radar would allow Taiwan to peer deep into mainalnd China's
airspace and guard against any attack by ballistic missiles.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon also backs the sales of AMRAAM to Taiwan, provided
the system is stored on US soil and Taiwanese forces are trained in
its use in the United States.</P>
      <P>Under the Pentagon's recommendation, the missiles would be moved
to Taiwan only when mainland China acquires a similar, Russian-made
missile called the AAX-12.</P>
      <P>Another weapon the Pentagon will not oppose to selling to Taiwan
is an upgraded version of the Maverick air-to-ground missile.</P>
      <P>Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, who plays
a vital role in arms sales to Taiwan, could also add Orion aircraft
to the shopping cart to soothe Taiwan's allies on Capitol Hill, said
the Post.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's request to buy Aegis destroyers, which can track more
than 100 targets on land, in the air and at sea simultaneously, posed
a dilemma for the White House, which is carefully walking a tightrope
between Taiwan's supporters in Congress and Taiwan's archrival,
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is outdated in military technology and is more vulnerable
to Beijing's attack than generally supposed, according to a Pentagon
report leaked late last month, and under the terms of the Taiwan
Relations Act, the United States has committed itself to supplying
Taiwan with arms for its self defense.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT NATIONAL CONGRESS  BROUGHT FORWARD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  17  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang has brought forward the
date of its party congress from June 24-25, to June 17-18, a party
spokesman said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The congress, called after the party was soundly defeated in the
March 18 presidential election, was originally scheduled for June
24-25 at the posh Taipei International Conference Center, but was
relocated to the more modest Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Taipei to
show the party's shame for its humiliating performance in the
election and its determination to make a comeback.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Jason Hu said the date for the congress had to be
brought forward because the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall had already
been leased for other use on June 24 and 25.</P>
      <P>The party congress is expected to elect a party chairman and
members of the Central Standing Committee, the party's policy-making
group.</P>
      <P>A meeting of the party's Central Advisory Committee, consisting
mainly of elder KMT statesmen, will be held a day before the
congress, said Hu.</P>
      <P>Former KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui, who is also the country's
president, was forced to step down one week after the presidential
election to take the blame for the party's failure. His place is
expected to be succeeded by Vice Chairman Lien Chan, who has already
taken the helm of the party as acting chairman.</P>

      <P>The first group of Taiwan's second-tier
stocks will be listed on the market as scheduled on Tuesday, despite
big losses of Internet companies on the Nasdaq over the weekend, Vice
Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang said on Monday.</P>
      <P>It is expected that more companies will apply to be listed as
second-board Taiwan Innovative Growing Entrepreneurs (TIGERs) at the
end of April, said Ding Ke-hwa, vice chairman of the Securities &amp;
Futures Commission (SFC) under the Ministry of Finance.</P>
      <P>The first three TIGER companies to be listed on Tuesday will be
Trade-van Information Services Co., Info Pro Group Inc. and Yem Chio
Co.</P>
      <P>Ding also said that the SFC will try to enlarge the scale of the
Taiwan stock market to permit more promising companies on the
over-the-counter market to be listed in the Taiwan Stock Exchange
(TAIEX).</P>
      <P>At present, only around 470 companies enjoy TAIEX listing.</P>
      <P>Ding noted that the number of TAIEX-listed companies is far fewer
than the more-than 600 in the Hong Kong stock market and the some 700
in South Korea's stock market.</P>
      <P>After the FTSE International and Morgan Stanley Capital
International announced that they will gradually increase Taiwan's
weighting in its own indices, the enlargement of the scale of the
Taiwan stock market will help attract more foreign capital and
stabilize the market, Ding pointed out.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT WORRYING ABOUT CROSS-STRAIT CONFLICT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  April 16 (CNA)
(By David Wang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President-elect
Annette Lu has said she is worrying that Beijing leaders may take
irrational action against Taiwan if they are dissatisfied with ROC
President-elect Chen Shui-bian's May 20 inaugural speech.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks in an interview with Newsweek, which will
appear in the weekly's April 24 issue scheduled for distribution
on Monday.</P>
      <P>Lu, a dissident-turned-politician, said she is afraid that
Beijing's recent harsh criticism of her may signal that Beijing
leaders are losing rationality toward relations across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Lu, who will be the ROC's first female deputy head of state
after her May 20 inauguration, said she is particularly worrying what
will happen if Beijing leaders are not satisfied with Chen's
inaugural address. Beijing leaders have demanded that Chen make a
positive response to its so-called "one China" principle, which
downgrades the ROC to a local-level government.</P>
      <P>Lu, incumbent Taoyuan County magistrate, said both she and
President-elect Chen worry about the eruption of a conflict between
Taiwan and mainland China. And this is why they have remained very
cautious and prudent since they won the March 18 election, Lu
added.</P>
      <P>Chen's election victory marks the first transition of power from
the Kuomintang, Taiwan's ruling party of 55 years, to his Democratic
Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Asked whether she thinks that the United States is overly
leaning toward Beijing, Lu didn't make a direct reply. She instead
said that in the past, most world leaders and politicians and even
journalists consistently took as "truth" Beijing leaders remarks
concerning Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We have no intention of provoking them," Lu said, adding that
the people of Taiwan have consistently worked hard and have managed
to achieve good results.</P>
      <P>Lu said Taiwan has never created any trouble for the world. "We
have overcome all sorts of difficulties in a peaceful, optimistic
manner. We have never made any mistake. But we have been treated as
a troublemaker," she lamented.</P>
      <P>Asked about Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations, Lu said she
has devoted much energy to promote Taiwan's UN bid because without
Taiwan's participation, the United Nations can't be a perfect
organization. Noting that South Korea and mainland China had waited
for 50 years and 22 years, respectively, before they managed to
obtain UN seats, Lu said Taiwan will promote its bid patiently.</P>
      <P>Lu went on to say the most urgent task for the new ROC
government is to strengthen cross-strait cooperation. She stressed
that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait do not have any feud.
Stressing that the people on the two sides of the strait have
same ancestry and cultural backgrounds, Lu said the
soon-to-be-inaugurated DPP government has sincerity and
determination to terminate any cross-strait confrontation and boost
rapprochement.</P>
      <P>Lu expressed her hopes that the US government will consider
allowing senior ROC officials to visit the United States and
inviting leaders from both sides of the Taiwan strait to hold
talks at the White House in order to boost regional peace and
stability.</P>

      <P>Taiwan could be named again on the US
"special 301" watch-list this year, given Washington's
dissatisfaction with the island's protection of intellectual
property, a Taiwan trade official said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Speaking upon his return from a visit to Washington, D.C. where
he talked with US trade officials on the island's bid for World Trade
Organization membership and the island's commercial ties with the
United States, Chen Ruey-long, director-general of the Board of
Foreign Trade, said that his US counterparts were far from satisfied
with Taiwan's implementation of intellectual property laws.</P>
      <P>As a result, he went on, Washington could name Taiwan on the
general watch list under the special 301 provisions of its 1989
Omnibus Trade Acts. Countries on the list are not in danger of
immediate trade sanctions, but could face a process leading to
sanctions if they fail to address alleged flaws in trade practices.</P>
      <P>The list will be disclosed by Washington by the end of April
when it finishes its annual review of the trade practices of its

    <HEADLINE>US ARMS SALES TO TAIWAN DOWN 62.4% IN FY1999</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 17 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States sold US$559 million
worth of weapons and military equipment to Taiwan in fiscal 1999,
marking a significant decline of 62.4 percent from the previous
fiscal year, according to a Pentagon report.</P>
      <P>The annual report, which was referred to Congress on Monday,
said Taiwan was the fifth largest buyer of US weaponry and military
equipment in the fiscal year from Oct. 1, 1998 to Sept. 30, 1999,
down from its third-place ranking in fiscal 1998.</P>
      <P>US arms sales reached a peak in the following year after the 1996
Taiwan Strait crisis when mainland China test-fired missiles and
conducted live-fire war games at Taiwan's doorstep in an apparent
attempt to influence the outcome of the island's first-ever direct
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Pentagon tallies show that Taiwan's US arms purchases totaled
US$852 million in 1996, US$5.7 billion in 1997, US$1.5 billion in
1998 and US$559 million in 1999.</P>
      <P>According to the annual Pentagon report, the United States
exported a total of US$12 billion worth weaponry and military
equipment in fiscal 1999, up 44 percent from the previous year.</P>
      <P>Israel was the top US arms buyer in 1999, purchasing US$2.3
billion worth of weapons and military equipment. It was followed
by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Taiwan, in that order.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the top three US arms clients in fiscal 1998 were
Saudi Arabia, Israel and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon predicted that US arms sales will continue rising

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several legislators on Tuesday appealed
for mainland China to respond positively to the goodwill gestures
made by President-elect Chen Shui-bian on cross-strait relations amid
reports that the United States has decided against the sale of
high-tech Aegis warships to Taiwan under pressure from the mainland.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hung Tu of the Kuomintang said that the reason behind
the cross-strait tensions lies in Beijing, adding that as the
mainland has targeted many missiles against Taiwan, Taiwan needs
anti-missile weaponry for its own protection.</P>
      <P>Hung expressed the hope that Beijing will show its goodwill by
taking substantial action, such as destroying its missiles and
disarming its submarines, so that Taiwan can reallocate money
from its national defense budget to domestic development.</P>
      <P>Another KMT Legislator Huang Mu-tien noted that Beijing has used
vitriolic verbal attacks and military intimidation against Taiwan,
saying that the mainland government has not realized many of the
people on Taiwan are originally from the mainland and it should show
its goodwill toward Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>He noted that the two Koreas have agreed to talk and the leaders
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait should do the same to try to
bridge their differences and promote the welfare of the peoples on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Tang Pi-er of the Democratic Progressive Party also said that
Beijing should respond positively to Chen's "soft and subtle"
approach toward cross-strait relations, adding that Beijing's big
brother mentality has caused tensions across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Beijing had implicitly warned Taiwan voters against choosing Chen
Shub-bian of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party prior
to the March 18 presidential election, but Chen has sounded
conciliatory notes toward the mainland since his election victory.</P>

      <P>According to W. C. Feng, representative of the Taipei Economic
and Cultural Office (TECO) in Houston, Brown sent a congratulatory
message and certificates to Chen and Lu via his office on April 12.
TECO then submitted the documents from Houston to the ROC Ministry of
Foreign Affairs in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Feng had reportedly paid a visit to Brown at the Houston city
government building following Chen's victory in the ROC's
presidential election on March 18. He also sent a letter to the
Houston's city councilors informing them of the election result.</P>
      <P>Brown said in his letter that he, on behalf of all Houston
citizens, wished to congratulate Chen for his victory in Taiwan's
March 18 presidential election. He also praised Chen for his capable
performance when serving as Taipei city mayor, and expressed his
belief that the welfare of the people of Taiwan will be further
improved under his leadership.</P>
      <P>Brown also said that Houston is deeply proud of its twin-city
ties with Taipei, which allow for increased cultural, educational and
commercial exchanges between the two cities.</P>
      <P>"Because of the efforts made by the Houston TECO office and
Taiwan immigrants, I believe that the special links between the two
cities should continue," he added.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Houston forged their sisterhood ties more than 30
years ago, in the first-ever twin-city agreement for both cities.</P>
      <P>In addition, Houston City Councilor Rob Todd, who maintains very
close ties with Taipei government figures, also sent a congratulatory
letter to TECO in Houston for Chen's election as "the ROC's tenth
president."</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the United States have shared a common history in
Asia-Pacific affairs, and the time now seems right to adjust
bilateral relations to better reflect the close trade and commercial
ties between the two countries, Todd pointed out.</P>

lunar calendar. Following is a list of important evens that have
occurred on this date in the past:

moral man he is free from anxiety; as a man of understanding he is
free from doubt; and as a man of courage he is free from fear."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>THIRTEEN US SENATORS EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR TSEA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  17 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thirteen United States senators have
voiced their support for the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act in a
letter to Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss) urging the Senate majority leader
"to take the necessary steps to ascertain support in the Senate for
the TSEA and call up this legislation at the earliest possible date,
before the Senate votes on matters relating to China."</P>
      <P>The senators said in the letter, initiated by Sen. Tim Hutchinson
(R-Ark.) and dated April 10, that they were writing to request
bringing before the Senate the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, which
the House passed by a vote of 341-70 on February 1, 2000. "We believe
that we must bring greater clarity to our relations with Taiwan and
China by passing this legislation in the Senate," said the senators.</P>
      <P>"We believe that China's threats (to use force) will only
increase as Taiwan progresses down the path of democracy. In
addition, a recent study by the Department of Defense indicates that
the Taiwanese military faces a multitude of problems stemming from
technological shortcomings, including an inability to adequately
defend against air attacks, ballistic missiles and cruise missiles.
These deficiencies can be attributed, at least in part, to the
military's isolation," they pointed out.</P>
      <P>The senators stressed that "the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act
will underscore US support for Taiwan by increasing military
exchanges with Taiwan, by establishing a direct military
communications link with Taiwan, and by reestablishing Congress as a
consultant in the annual arms sales process, as intended and required
by the Taiwan Relations Act. We believe that these provisions will
correct some of the inadequacies of the Taiwanese military and bring
greater security to the people of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The letter was co-signed by Senators Robert Torricelli (D-NJ),
Russ Feingold (D-Wis), Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska), Slade Gorton
(R-Wash), Mike DeWine (R-Ohio), Jeff Sessions (R-Ala), Jon Kyl
(R-Ariz), Susan Collins (R-Main), James Inhofe (R-Okla), Bob Smith
(R-NH), Rick Santorum (R-Pa), and John Ashcroft (R-Mo).</P>
      <P>The addition of another Democratic voice of support by Sen.
Feingold for the TSEA "is a quantum leap forward," said Chen Wen-yen,
president of the Formosan Association for Public Affairs, adding that
"hopefully this will open the door for other Democratic senators to
get behind this important legislation."</P>

    <HEADLINE>HELMS BLASTS ADMINISTRATION'S HANDLING OF TAIWAN'S DEFENSE REQUEST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 17 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Senate Foreign Relations Committee
Chairman Jesse Helms (R-NC) on Monday blasted the Clinton
administration's politicized handling of Taiwan's defense request,
stressing that this is "a clear demonstration of why the Taiwan
Security Enhancement Act is so urgently needed."</P>
      <P>In response to press reports that the Pentagon has recommended
putting off Taiwan's request to purchase Aegis destroyers, Helms said
"I am extremely disappointed to learn that the Pentagon has
apparently succumbed to pressure from the State Department and the
White House to sacrifice Taiwan's security in order to appease the
dictators in Beijing."</P>
      <P>Sen. Helms pointed out that for months "we in Congress were led
by Defense Department officials to believe that the Pentagon was
leading the fight to sell Aegis destroyers to Taiwan. Now we learn
that they are doing no such thing. Moreover, we are learning that the
Pentagon has apparently backed off its earlier commitment to provide
Taiwan with urgently-needed early warning radars, recommending a
delay until Taiwan can prove that it can integrate the radar into its
system."</P>
      <P>"This adds insult to injury. Any problems Taiwan's military would
face integrating these systems would stem from no fault of its own,
but rather from the 20 years of isolation that the United States has
imposed on Taiwan. This administration has sunk to a new low indeed
when they don't even have the courage to fulfill a commitment to sell
a civil defense item to Taiwan for fear of offending Communist
China," emphasized the senator.</P>
      <P>"There is, quite simply, no military justification to deny Taiwan
these critical defensive items. These denials are driven by a
knee-jerk appeasement on the part of the White House and the State
Department," noted Helms.</P>
      <P>He said that "if the Pentagon will not stand up for Taiwan, then
it is clear Congress will have to take action. If the administration
follows through on these recommendations and denies Taiwan these
critical defensive items, then the time will have come for the Senate
to join the House in passing the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act."</P>

      <P>The latest shake-out of technology
stocks is expected to change the information technology landscape
over the next two years and as many as three quarters of all

      <P>Deutsche Asset Management agreed, saying that "companies with
technology that makes a significant improvement in the way business
is conducted will still flourish."</P>
      <P>Experts from these and other companies believe the stock market
fluctuations will have the most impact on investors less familiar

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  18 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian casinos in major cities are
becoming popular playgrounds for rich students from Asian countries,
including Indonesia, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia
and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The casinos' attractiveness to young Asians came into the
spotlight this week when Burswood Casino in Perth attracted a media
report that a 17-year-old student from Asia lost A$200,000
(US$130,000) in one night.</P>
      <P>Under the current gambling laws, the minimum age for entering
casino venues is 18 years, gaming experts said.</P>
      <P>They said casinos in Australia not only attract domestic and
foreign tourists, but also Asian students who are studying in major
cities throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Student associations in Perth, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane
said many students from Indonesia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other
Southeast Asian countries are feeling bored in their studies and are
turning to gambling dens for excitement.</P>
      <P>"It is a common playground for these people who come from wealthy
families," Fernando Widjaja, the president of the Indonesian Student
Society in Perth, told the Australian on Monday.</P>
      <P>He said problem student gamblers usually come from rich families
in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.</P>
      <P>"Normally they are losing about A$400 to A$500 (US$250 to US$315)
a night, but the maximum I have heard is about US$2000 or US$2500,"
he said.</P>
      <P>He said many of the Asian students use their parents' credit
cards to engage in gambling.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted Jimmy Chu, president of the Association of
Malaysian Students, as saying that he knew of students who had
incurred big losses at casinos in Melbourne and Sydney.</P>
      <P>Other student associations said casinos along the Gold Coast and
in Brisbane are also common playgrounds for Asian students coming
from rich Asian families.</P>
      <P>As a result of the Burswood Casino newspaper report, gaming
officials and police are now conducting a series of investigation
into whether casinos in Perth and other Australian cities are
breaching age restriction laws.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to sign trade accords
with four Latin American countries to boost bilateral commerce and
investment relations, Board of Foreign Trade Director-general Chen
Rui-lung said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay are
considering agreements on investment guarantees and the avoidance of
double taxation with Taiwan. The move is seen as an attempt by the
Latin American nations to attract greater foreign investment.</P>
      <P>Chen, who returned to Taiwan on Sunday from a five-nation South
American tour which also took him to Paraguay, said that South
American economies are gradually improving and that Taiwan's trade
with those countries is expected to expand this year.</P>
      <P>Both Argentina and Chile have in recent years lodged anti-dumping
complaints against Taiwan-made textiles. In response to concerns
about these actions, Chen said that Taiwan has made it clear to the

    <HEADLINE>CHIAYI MAYOR AGREES TO JOIN NEW CABINET AS INTERIOR MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Chiayi,  southern Taiwan, April 18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chiayi Mayor Chang Po-ya
finally agreed on Tuesday to accept President-elect Chen Shui-bian's
sincere invitation to join his administration as interior minister.</P>
      <P>Chang, a former legislator and director-general of the
Cabinet-level Department of Health, will concurrently serve as
chairman of the Taiwan Provincial Government after Chen's
administration is inaugurated on May 20.</P>
      <P>With tears in her eyes, Chang told a news conference that it was
a difficult decision for her to accept the new job because she was
unwilling to part with Chiayi citizens whom she has regarded as her
brothers and sisters.</P>
      <P>"And I had found it was also very hard to turn down Chen's
offer because the president-elect had made his invitation with such
warm-heartedness," Chang explained.</P>
      <P>Chen personally visited Chang at her residence in the southern
Chiayi city on Sunday to persuade Chang to assume the top post at the
Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>"Chen had repeatedly asked me to put national interests about
any personal considerations and to take up the new challenge," said
Chang, a non-partisan doctor-turned-politician.</P>
      <P>Chang said Premier-designate Tang Fei had also sincerely invited
her to join his Cabinet as the interior minister before he checked
into Taipei's Veterans General Hospital last weekend to undergo an
operation to remove a chest tumor.</P>
      <P>Chang said Chen had assured her that his administration will
delegate more power to local-level governments. "After I assume the
ministerial post, I will faithfully reflect grassroots public
opinion and demand to the central government," she assured Chiayi
residents, adding she believes that her experience in local
government administration will be useful to her new work.</P>
      <P>Chang will be the first interior minister to concurrently serve
as chairman of the Taiwan Provincial Government, which has been
downsized in line with the government's plan to cut red tape and
improve administrative efficiency and national competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Chang promised to take good care of every provincial government
staff member in concluding the difficult provincial government
downsizing work.</P>
      <P>Chang, who has a master's degree in public health from US-based
Johns Hopkins University and a doctoral degree in medicine from
Japan's Kyorin University, came from a noted political family in
Chiayi. Chang stressed that her initial reluctance to accept the new
Cabinet post has nothing to do with her family interests.</P>
      <P>Chang had served two Chiayi mayoral terms before
becoming a legislator. After serving as a lawmaker for just about
six months, she was appointed director-general of the Department of
Health. During that period, her elder sister Chang Wen-ying was
twice elected Chiayi mayor. And Chang was again elected Chiayi mayor
in late 1997 for a four-year term.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPANESE EDITORIAL URGES GOODWILL &amp; SINCERITY ACROSS TAIWAN STRAIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo, April 18 (CNA)
(By Huang Kui-mei and Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Sankei Shimbun in its Tuesday editorial
urged Beijing authorities to demonstrate reciprocal goodwill and
sincerity to match to that recently shown by President-elect Chen
Shui-bian of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>In an editorial, the Japanese daily paid tribute to Chen's
remarks to its reporters made during an exclusive interview on
Sunday. In the interview, Chen reaffirmed his "three noes" policy,
and noted that his May 20 inaugural speech will be based on goodwill
and sincerity, and will be aimed at easing cross-strait tensions.</P>
      <P>Chen said that as long as Beijing does not use force against
Taiwan, the "three noes" policy can be maintained. This policy refers
to his pledge that he will not promote "special state-to-state
relations" between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, will not put
issues of Taiwan independence or unification with the mainland to a
plebiscite, and will not change the name of the "Republic of China."</P>
      <P>The editorial highly praised the President-elect's remarks that
"maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait is not only
the supreme goal but also a moral obligation" for him as president of
the country.</P>
      <P>Chen's "soft" approach in dealing with cross-strait ties was
construed as having some connection with the 39.3 percent of votes he
garnered in the March 18 presidential election. With over 60 percent
of voters not throwing their support behind him, he has to deliver a
peaceful message to the Chinese mainland, the editorial pointed out.</P>
      <P>The Beijing authorities have done their best to avoid criticizing
Chen to date. They have instead adopted a wait-and-see attitude
toward Chen's May 20 inaugural speech, which Chen has disclosed will
be based on "goodwill and sincerity." The editorial expressed the
hope that Beijing will respond with the same mentality.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that Taiwan's leader is directly elected by
the island's voters, Beijing should have a clearer understanding of
the matter, the editorial concluded. The editorial is referring to
Beijing's February 21 white paper on Taiwan, which was followed by
mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's warnings to the
pro-independence forces in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>He made the pledge during a visit to the Control Yuan, the

      <P>Chen noted that during his stint as Taipei mayor from 1994

me to do some soul-searching and to make the necessary improvements,"
Chen recalled.</P>
      <P>The lawyer-turned-politician urged all domestic political groups

so that the watchdog body can maintain its neutrality and fulfill its

      <P>Chen went on to say that in the new millennium, he will exhort
his administration to adopt a forward-thinking attitude, practice
constant self-reflection and self-improvement, and strengthen
communications with the general public to cope with changing social

      <P>Chen further said he feels that politicians' happiness lies in

    <HEADLINE>AEGIS CRITICAL TO TAIWAN'S DEFENSE: DEFENSE MINISTER-DESIGNATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Defense Minister-designate Wu Shih-wen
said on Tuesday that Aegis destroyers are critical to defend Taiwan's
security.</P>
      <P>Wu, incumbent vice defense minister, made the remarks while
attending a meeting at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Wu said he has not yet received any information concerning
whether the United States will sell Aegis warships to Taiwan this
year.</P>
      <P>Delegates from the Republic of China and the United States are
meeting in Washington, D.C. to review Taiwan's defense needs and its
weaponry and military equipment procurement plan.</P>
      <P>Press reports from Washington said the Clinton administration
has deferred a decision to sell four highly sophisticated Aegis
destroyers to Taiwan as part of its efforts to avoid a new
confrontation with mainland China.</P>
      <P>According to those reports, the Clinton administration has
instead agreed to sell some other weaponry systems and military
equipment to Taiwan, including advanced AIM-120 medium-range
air-to-air missiles and a long-range radar, known as PAVE PAWS, that
can peer deep into mainland China to detect missile launches.</P>
      <P>Wu declined to make any comment on those reports, saying he has
not yet received any information concerning ongoing arms purchase
talks between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Wu explained that the Aegis-equipped destroyers can serve as a
seaborne base for anti-ballistic missile defense systems. In view of
Beijing's mounting missile threat to Taiwan, Wu said, Aegis
destroyers are crucial to defend Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Taiwan has a strong desire to acquire Aegis
destroyers, Wu said the ROC military has many expectations
concerning acquisition of sophisticated defensive weapons. "Whether
we can realize our goal will depend on our effort," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT-ELECT MUST EXCHANGE VIEWS WITH US ON TSEA: US SENATOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  18 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Senator Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska) on
Tuesday called on Republic of China President-elect Chen Shui-bian to
exchange views on how to strengthen bilateral ties between Taiwan and
the United States.</P>
      <P>The visiting senator told Chen that he hopes that after his May
20 inauguration, he will formally and completely address the Taiwan
Security Enhancement Act (TSEA) issue now at a crucial juncture and
being deliberated by the US Senate.</P>
      <P>Murkowski said that cross-Taiwan Strait relations are stalemated
and noted that the Clinton Administration has postponed selling Aegis
destroyers to Taiwan but has agreed to sell the long-range radar
system known as PAVE PAWS to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that before he left for his ROC trip, he talked with his
colleagues in Congress about the proposed TSEA and American military
commitments to Taiwan's security, and added that the issue is
important to the security of Taiwan and should be closely monitored
by the Taiwan authorities.</P>
      <P>Chen for his part expressed the hope that Murkowski will support
the ROC's bid to enter the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the
World Health Organization (WHO). Taiwan is currently seeking observer
status in the WHO.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US AGREEES SALE OF ARMS BUT NO DESTROYERS TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   April   18  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US administration gave a
greenlight to the sale of a package of arms to Taiwan but has
deferred a decision on the controversial sale of four destroyers with
the Aegis combat management system, US officials said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>President Bill Clinton met with top administration officials on
Monday and agreed to postpone decisions on Taiwan's requests for the
Aegis destroyers, P-3 Orion anti-submarine aircraft and diesel
submarines, pending a comprehensive review of Taiwan's defense needs,
said the officials who requested anonymity.</P>
      <P>The Aegis destroyer, with a price tag of about US$1.1 billion, is
an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer equipped with an array of radar and
computer equipment which can monitor, track and engage up to 100
targets simultaneously at ranges of up to 461 km.</P>
      <P>However, the White House approved the sale of a long-distance
radar system known as PAVE PAWS, with the caveat that Taiwan should
demonstrate how it will integrate the radar with its existing air
defense system.</P>
      <P>PAVE PAWS radar can detect missile launches within a distance of
3,000 miles and can link up with anti-missile systems under
development by the United States.</P>
      <P>US officials hinted that the PAVE PAWS radar to be sold to Taiwan
will not be as powerful as the version used by the US armed forces,
but will greatly boost Taiwan's early warning capability.</P>
      <P>Also approved were the sales of advanced medium-range air-to-air
missiles (AMRAAM), and an upgraded version of the infrared-guided
Maverick anti-ship missiles.</P>
      <P>AMRAAM, which has not been sold to Asian states before, will be
kept on US soil, and Taiwan pilots will be trained to use it in the
United States. To avoid an arms race in the region, the missiles will
not be moved to Taiwan unless mainland China acquires equally
advanced Russian-made missiles, said the officials.</P>
      <P>In interviews with the New York Times and the Washington Post,
Undersecretary of Defense Walter B. Slocombe described the sales as a
robust package, and said the United States does not have to feel
sorry about the items left out of the package.</P>
      <P>The Washington Post said that pro-Taiwan members of the US
Congress could still press the administration to reinstate the Aegis
destroyers into the package, or replace them with something else as
compensation.</P>
      <P>US Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott, who favored selling the
Aegis destroyers (which would have been built in his home state of
Mississippi), said he will reserve his comments until the official
announcement of the decision.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile Republican Sen. Jesse Helms criticized the Pentagon,
saying it has no military justification in denying Taiwan "these
crucial defensive items."</P>
      <P>He criticized the Pentagon for bowing to pressure from the White
House and the State Department "to sacrifice Taiwan's security in
order to appease the dictators in Beijing."</P>
      <P>"The politicized handling of Taiwan's defense request is a clear
demonstration of why the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act is so
urgently needed," said Helms. He was referring to a bill sponsored by
Taiwan supporters in Congress in defiance of the White House's
opposition to strengthened US military ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee derided
the Pentagon's decision to sell Taiwan the PAVE PAWS radar system
only after the island has shown how it could be integrated into
Taiwan's air defense system, describing it as "adding insult to
injury."</P>

    <HEADLINE>14 MAINLAND CHINESE FISHING BOATS INTERCEPTED FOR POACHING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  April  18  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kinmen-based maritime patrol police on
Tuesday intercepted one trawler and 13 motorized sampans from
mainland China caught poaching in Republic of China territorial
waters.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Kinmen squadron of the Cabinet-level Coast
Guard Administration (CGA) said they believed that better weather and
calmer seas have encouraged mainland Chinese fishermen to cross the
tacit central demarcation line in the Taiwan Strait dividing Taiwan
and mainland China waters.</P>
      <P>According to the CGA Kinmen officials, seven motorized sampans,
with 14 fishermen aboard, were first discovered off the coast of
Kinmen's Liaoluo Bay at around 8:30 a.m. on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The sampans were told via loudspeaker to leave ROC waters, but
the warnings were apparently ignored, and the Kinmen maritime police
approached the cluster of vessels and ordered them to sail to the
nearest Kinmen fishing port.</P>
      <P>Soon after the interception, another seven mainland Chinese
vessels, including the trawler and six more motorized sampans, were
caught poaching in waters near Kukang, a harbor on Kinmen.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen maritime police confiscated the fishing gear and catch
aboard the 14 vessels and after interrogation, escorted the boats and
fishermen out of the 24-nautical-mile zone defining ROC territorial
waters at around noon.</P>
      <P>Kinmen maritime police said since the Kinmen CGA squadron was
established more than four months ago, it has intercepted more than
200 mainland Chinese fishing boats for poaching, including using
dynamite to bomb fish, and has brought in nearly 1,000 mainland
fishermen for questioning.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen maritime police said they have tightened surveillance
and increased arrests for poaching, as local fishermen are making
increasing complaints about their livelihoods being affected by
depleted fish stocks caused by their rivals from the mainland.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Assembly (NA) caucuses of the
four major political parties on Tuesday agreed not to abolish the
Council of Grand Justices.</P>
      <P>On Monday, the assembly had adopted a controversial bill to call
for the abolishment of the Council of Grand Justices.</P>

stress that passage of the bill would be harmful to the interests of

      <P>In order to quell the controversy, the NA caucuses of the four
major parties -- the Kuomintang, the Democratic Progressive Party,
the New Party and the People First Party -- met on Tuesday, and
reached an agreement to block the bill from its second reading,
because "the timing is not appropriate."</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT LAWMAKER JOINS PEOPLE FIRST PARTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 18 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Kuomintang lawmaker announced on Tuesday
that he is quitting the KMT and joining the People First Party (PFP)
of former Taiwan Provincial Governor and KMT stalwart James Soong.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wang Tein-ging of the Legislative Yuan's committee on
national defense made the announcement at a press conference held at
the PFP's office at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Wang said that he made the decision in light of the fact that the
party's outlook is similar to his own, and refuted allegations that
he decided to join the PFP to gain the military dependents' votes in
the next election, saying "such wording is beneath me."</P>
      <P>A majority of ballots from military dependents' villages around
the island were cast for Soong, who ran as an independent in the
March 18 presidential election. Soong lost to the Democratic
Progressive Party's Chen Shui-bian, and a group of his supporters
formed the PFP on March 31.</P>
      <P>Until the KMT's election debacle, military dependents' villages
had long been considered a "vote granary" for KMT-nominated
candidates. The KMT's Lien Chan suffered a humiliating defeat in the
election, coming in a distant third behind Chen and Soong and marking
an end to the party's 54-year rule on the island.</P>
      <P>Wang slammed high-ranking KMT officials for failing to meet a
call from grassroots KMT members for pushing a ticket of Lien and
Soong hard enough in the election. It is believed that had the KMT
nominated the Lien-Soong combination, it would have easily won the
election.</P>
      <P>He said another factor that caused him to decide to join the PFP
is that the KMT cadres have not conducted serious self-criticism in
the wake of defeat, but have instead blamed others for the party's
failure to hold on to power.</P>
      <P>Wang's wife has already joined the PFP, and has decided to race
in the upcoming National Assembly election, originally slated for May
6 but postponed indefinitely while arguments continue as to whether
the body should be abolished.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The setting up of direct postal, trade and
transportation links with mainland China this year is out of the
question, Taiwan's possible incoming mainland affairs head said on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ing-wen, a professor at National Chengchi University and an
adviser to the National Security Council, made the comment after a
meeting with President-elect Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Tsai has been earmarked as chairman of the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) under Chen's administration.</P>
      <P>Although Chen has declared his hope that the so-called "three
links" can be implemented, Tsai ruled out such a possibility this
year, even if Taiwan and mainland China can both be admitted this
year to the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Rather than direct trade and transportation links between Taiwan
and the mainland, said Tsai, WTO membership will be a better method
of enabling the two sides to conduct negotiations and build a
framework based on mutual trust.</P>
      <P>"WTO entry would be an opportunity for both sides to open
negotiations rather than an obligation to open each other's ports or
to trade directly with each other," said Tsai.</P>
      <P>Tsai said she has not yet decided whether she will accept Chen's
offer to head the MAC, although she is reported to be impressed with
Chen's keenness to have her as a member of his Cabinet.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan stock market declined on
Wednesday despite continued Wall Street rally.</P>
      <P>The benchmark Taiwan Stock Exchange (Taiex) weighted price index
lost 202.63 points to close at 9,104.4. The drop marked a 2.2 percent
fall from Tuesday's finish.</P>
      <P>Market analysts attributed the decline mainly to continued
sell-off by foreign institutional investors to meet overseas
redemption demands. Taiex tallies show that foreign financial
institutions have sold more stocks than made purchases over the past
seven consecutive trading sessions.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by a Wall Street rally, the Taiex opened strong and
surged 138 points in the first half hour of trading, but weakened
after 10 a.m. amid profit-taking. Heavy selling in the final session
drove the Taiex index to close at the day's low of 9,104.4.</P>
      <P>Market turnover totaled NT$183.83 billion (US$5.66
billion), down from Tuesday's trading volume of NT$193.22 billion.</P>
      <P>Gainers outnumbered losers 344 to 136, with 39 stocks remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>Some market analysts said the Taiex may drop further this week as
foreign financial institutions are not expected to actively buy local
stocks before the May 20 inauguration of Taiwan's new government.
Meanwhile, several other market experts said they believe that the
Taiex's future development will hinge on Wall Street performance and
foreign institutional investors' operational directions.</P>

practices in Hsinkang, Chiayi County, said on Wednesday that he will
try his best to be a bridge between the government and the people
after he assumes his new post as a minister without portfolio in the
new Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Chen, 48, who graduated from National Taiwan University's
prestigious medical school and has continued his medical practice for
19 years in the small town of Hsinkang, accepted an offer on Tuesday
to be a minister without portfolio charged with the task of taking up
function-oriented jobs in the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>A medical professional who is also concerned with upholding the
local culture and moral values, Chen helped establish the Hsinkang
(New Port) Cultural and Educational Foundation 13 years ago. The
foundation's goal is the moral regeneration of the port township
where values have apparently weakened with the appearance of such
things as lottery-style gambling and strip dancing troupes.</P>
      <P>Since being formed, the foundation has sponsored numerous events
giving local people more opportunities to interact socially in a more
wholesome setting. It has supported the renowned "Cloud Gate"
Ensemble financially, enabling it to survive and continue performing.
It has also promoted a "clean up the streets" drive during the annual
Matsu Traveling event where hundreds of thousands of Matsu
worshippers pass through Hsinkang during their town-to-town parade.</P>
      <P>Upon accepting the post of minister without portfolio, Chen said
he will use the opportunity of working in public office to convey the
desires and needs of the people to the government. Previously, he
said, people could only express their wishes through legislators or
city and county councilors, whom often were connected with either
special interest groups or organized crime rings.</P>
      <P>Chen is the first expert from the private sector to be recruited
into the new Cabinet as a minister without portfolio. At least three
or four more people are expected to be appointed to similar posts in
the following days prior to the inauguration of the new government
and president on May 20.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN URGED TO COOPERATE WITH US TO TAP ENERGY RESOURCES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 19 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan would be better off if it tried as
hard to secure energy resources from the United States as it does
striving to obtain more and higher-grade defensive weapons, said a US
senator in Taipei on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Senator Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska) said Taiwan should pay more
attention to preparing for an energy shortage, which is likely to
occur in the future, than to seeking to secure arms from the United
States, which seems to be more concerned about Beijing's attitude on
the issue.</P>
      <P>Addressing a general meeting of the Chinese National Association
of Industry &amp; Commerce, Murkowski urged Taiwan to cooperate with the
United States to jointly explore the rich natural gas resources in
his home state of Alaska.</P>
      <P>Murkowski, a long-standing friend of Taiwan who strongly supports
the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act (TSEA), said the TSEA, now at the
crucial juncture of being deliberated on by the US Senate, is
expected to win more support than expected before in the Senate this
spring.</P>
      <P>He added that the Clinton administration's refusal to sell Aegis
destroyers to Taiwan on Monday has outraged the pro-Taiwan US members
of Congress and has further raised the possibility that the Senate
will pass the TSEA.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing the importance of energy resources, Murkowski said 56
percent of America's annual energy needs depend on imports from OPEC
countries. For example, the US imports an average of 700,000 barrels
of crude oil from Iraq each day, at a cost of US$4.6 billion.
Ironically, the United States has kept bombing the Middle Eastern
country while continuing to import crude oil from it, he said.</P>
      <P>And some people believe that the collapse of share prices on Wall
Street last week was mainly triggered by heightened oil prices,
Murkowski noted.</P>
      <P>He quoting Alan Greenspan, chair of the US Federal Reserve, as
saying that for every 1 percent increase in the unit price of
imported crude oil, the United States' financial burden increases by
0.5 percent because of the volume of crude oil it imports.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy definitely will not be able to maintain
long-term development if it gets caught in an energy shortage,
particularly since its rival, mainland China, possesses large
quantities of natural energy resources and has maintained close ties
with OPEC governments for a long time, Murkowski noted.</P>
      <P>So he urged Taiwan to accelerate its moves to cash in on Alaska's
liquefied national gas (LNG) exploration project. By joining hands in
the exploration project, Taiwan and the US can work together to lower
the potential energy threat posed by the PRC and by OPEC and can help
secure long-lasting mutual economic development as well, he added.</P>
      <P>Murkowski, accompanied by his wife, arrived in Taipei on Monday
for a three-day visit. He has met with President Lee Teng-hui,
President-elect Chen Shui-bian, and other political figures and
opinion leaders in Taiwan during the stay.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN POSTS TRADE DEFICIT FOR 1ST-HALF OF APRIL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 19 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite double-digit growth in both export
and import trade, Taiwan in the first half of April posted a trade
deficit of US$312 million, officials from the Ministry of Finance
(MOF) reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In the first 15 days of the month, Taiwan exported US$5.438
billion-worth of products, up 16.2 percent over the year-earlier
level, while importing US$5.750 billion-worth of commodities, up a
whopping 37.9 percent, MOF officials said.</P>
      <P>According to MOF tallies, Taiwan sustained a slight trade deficit
of US$20 million in February, but by the end of March, the deficit
had shrunk and in fact became a surplus of US$440 million. It remains
to be seen whether two-way trade for the whole of April will turn out
to be a deficit or a surplus, and the officials said they are paying
close attention to the situation.</P>
      <P>Cumulatively, Taiwan's exports totaled US$37.978 billion between
Jan. 1 and April 15 this year, marking a remarkable increase of 20.1
percent over the same period of the previous year.</P>
      <P>During the same period, Taiwan's imports grew by 27.4 percent to
the tune of US$36.444 billion.</P>
      <P>As a result, Taiwan posted a surplus of US$1.534 billion in its
two-way trade in the Jan. 1-April 15 period, MOF officials said.</P>

      <P>Taipei-based U-Land Airlines said on
Wednesday that it did not supply Air Philippines with a passenger
plane which crashed earlier that same day.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of a cooperative accord clinched by the two

three MD-83 airplanes to Air Philippines, but a U-Land spokesman said
that one unit has already been recalled.</P>
      <P>Although U-Land controls a one-third stake of Air Philippines,
the spokesman said the Taipei-based aviation company does not
participate in Air Philippines' operations, and stressed that the
passenger plane which crashed near the southern Philippine city of
Davao early on Wednesday does not belong to U-Land.</P>
      <P>U-Land will therefore not be involved in any compensation issue
related to the crash, the spokesman noted, and added that his company
wishes to renew its cooperation talks with Air Philippines following
the tragedy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH CRITICIZES UN COMMISSION'S CHINA DECISION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, April 18 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Human Rights Watch on Tuesday strongly
condemned the United Nations Commission on Human Rights' decision not
to consider a US-sponsored resolution criticizing Communist China's
human rights record.</P>
      <P>"By turning a blind eye to China's worsening human rights record,
the delegations in Geneva have given the wrong signal to Beijing's
leaders," said a Human Rights Watch spokesperson.</P>
      <P>While saying the United States deserves credit for putting
forward the resolution, the New York-based human rights group
criticized the apparent lack of high-level White House involvement,
including President Bill Clinton himself, in lobbying for the
resolution.</P>
      <P>Although White House Deputy Press Secretary P.J. Crowley said the
United States is disappointed with the UN decision not to take
action, the State Department pointed out in a Tuesday statement that
the US had accomplished its goals, saying the trend of decreasing
support for the "no-action" motion means that "a growing number of
countries now recognize that China should not be permitted to escape
scrutiny of its human rights record and should not prevent the
Commission from fulfilling its mandate."</P>
      <P>The statement, issued by US Ambassador to the UN Commission on
Human Rights Nancy Rubin and Assistant Secretary of State for
Democracy, Human Rights and Labor Harold Hongju Koh, said the
intention of the United States was "to speak up for the Chinese
people and to focus international attention on the marked
deterioration in the human rights situation in China during the past
year."</P>
      <P>Human Rights Watch also criticized the European Union, Australia,
Canada and Japan, all of which had professed concern about the human
rights situation in mainland China, for declining to co-sponsor the
resolution or to actively lobby against the no-action motion.</P>
      <P>The procedural "no-action motion" was adopted Tuesday by a vote
of 22 for and 18 against, with 12 abstentions.</P>
      <P>"The credibility of the UN Commission has been seriously damaged
by its unwillingness to censure China, or even to discuss its human
rights performance," said the Human Rights Watch spokesperson,
asking: "What incentives will Beijing now have to go beyond dialogue
and legal exchanges to make serious improvements in its human rights
practices?"</P>
      <P>In 1999, a resolution condemning China's human rights record
sponsored by the US and Poland was also blocked by a no-action
motion. However, a similar resolution came up for debate in 1995 and
was only defeated by a single vote. That year, the EU and the US both
co-sponsored the measure and coordinated a high level campaign to
counter Beijing's worldwide lobbying effort to defeat it, noted the
spokesperson.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEN. HELMS BLASTS INADEQUATE US ARMS SALES TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  18 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Sen. Jesse Helms (R-NC), chairman
of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, on Tuesday again
blasted the Clinton administration's failure to consult with Congress
on arms sales to Taiwan, saying "it has once again flagrantly
violated the Taiwan Relations Act by giving Beijing a veto over
Taiwan's defense requests."</P>
      <P>Following Clinton's decision on Monday to put off accepting
Taiwan's request for four Aegis destroyers, Sen. Helms criticized the
politicized handling of Taiwan's defense request, adding that "this
is a clear demonstration of why the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act
is so urgently needed."</P>
      <P>The legislation is still pending in the Senate after the House of
Representatives passed it by an overwhelming 341-70 vote on Feb. 1.</P>
      <P>Sen. Helms pointed out that the administration's decision on
defense sales to Taiwan is totally inadequate, saying "they would
have us believe that they approved a robust package for Taiwan, but
in fact, only one of Taiwan's six major requests, the Maverick
missile, was approved."</P>
      <P>He added that "given the Orwellian spin the administration is
putting on the long-range early warning radars, in which repeating
last year's deal is being touted as a new agreement, why should the
American people be confident that the Maverick sale will ever take
place?"</P>
      <P>"Similar deja vu surrounds the AMRAAM announcement. The training
package announced yesterday was also announced in April 1999.
Moreover, the notion of selling the missiles to Taiwan, but not
letting them take possession of them, is an insult. What is Taiwan to
do, call FedEx for its AMRAAMs after China attacks?" asked the
senator.</P>
      <P>Helms added that "the American people's gullibility is likewise
assumed with the so-called maritime assessment. The air defense
assessment of 1999 argued for providing Aegis systems to Taiwan but
the Clinton administration has refused to provide them. Why should
the American people believe the maritime assessment's recommendations
won't also be sent to the circular file as well?"</P>

    <HEADLINE>US ARMS SALES PACKAGE TO TAIWAN PART OF ONGOING PROCESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  18  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US Defense Department stressed
Tuesday that the arms sales package recommended by the Pentagon and
adopted by both President Bill Clinton and his national security team
this year is another part of the ongoing process of helping Taiwan
meet its defensive needs.</P>
      <P>While declining to describe the package in detail, Pentagon
spokesman Kenneth Bacon told reporters that "I think the important
thing to stress is that it is part of a process, that over the years
the United States has authorized fairly extensive arms sales to
Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act, which commits us to helping
Taiwan meet its defensive needs."</P>
      <P>Bacon emphasized that the United States has sold approximately
US$18 billion worth of arms to Taiwan over an extended period of
time, including F-16s, Knox-class frigates, air defense missiles,
radars, tanks to defend against amphibious invasion, Patriot
missiles, among other types of military equipment.</P>
      <P>As to whether Pentagon officials have discussed the arms sale to
Taiwan with visiting People's Liberation Army Navy Commander Shih
Yunsheng, Bacon said "we do not consult with the People's Republic of
China about our responsibilities in helping Taiwan meet its defensive
needs."</P>
      <P>"Obviously, the Chinese have strong views about our relationship
with Taiwan. as do we. Our relationship with Taiwan is well-specified
in law and we have explained that law to the people from the mainland
many, many times, and I think they understand what the law requires
us to do," noted the spokesman.</P>
      <P>Bacon added that "we have made it very clear to the PRC that
because we, under the law, help Taiwan respond to defensive needs,
the greater the threat posed by China, the greater Taiwan's defensive
needs will be. And we have called on both sides to show restraint --
particularly on the Chinese -- to show restraint in their arms
developments and deployments and use of arms."</P>
      <P>On the topic of the PLA's missile deployments along the mainland
coast opposite Taiwan, Bacon said, "(Commander-in-Chief of the US
Pacific Command) Admiral Blair quantified it here in a briefing. He
said they're adding about 50 surface-to-surface missiles a year, and
nothing has changed that pace as far as I know."</P>
      <P>On the question of whether the US arms sale package to Taiwan
this year includes any weapons to counter the Chinese missile threat,
Bacon replied that "in the past we have sold Taiwan versions of the
Patriot missile, and it's no secret that last year we made a decision
to help Taiwan upgrade its early warning radars, and that process
will continue."</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that this arms sales package also includes
"several weapons that the US approved for the first time, some that
we have denied in the past and approved this time around."</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Senator Frank Murkowski (R, Alaska)
visited Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) President W.Y. Pan on Wednesday
in an effort to seek cooperation opportunities between Taiwan and
Alaska.</P>
      <P>Following the meeting, a ranking CPC official said the CPC will
further assess Murkowski's proposal that the two sides jointly
explore for natural gas in Alaska.</P>
      <P>However, according to the official, local demand-supply level for
natural gas is evenly balanced. As the state-run enterprise has
already inked three purchase agreements with other foreign companies,
it will be hard for the CPC to sign any new pact to buy natural gas
in the short term, he noted.</P>
      <P>Although the state-owned Taiwan Power Company is set to complete
construction of a power generation station in Tatan in northern
Taiwan which will require about 1.9 million tons of natural gas each
year, the CPC official said it remains unclear at present whether the
CPC or other local companies will undertake to supply natural gas to
the facility.</P>
      <P>It is understood that the Tuntex Group and the China Development
Corp. are also seeking to set up a natural gas power supply station
in northern Taiwan or to play the role of natural gas supplier to the
planned establishment.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the CPC official also pointed out that the chances
of CPC-Alaska cooperation will be greater if Murkowski's proposal
referred to joint exploration of Alaska's natural gas resources for
sale to other overseas markets.</P>
      <P>"In that case, the CPC will not pass up such a good profitable
investment opportunity," he added.</P>
      <P>Murkowski, a long-term supporter of the Republic of China, is
currently visiting Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>APPLICATIONS FOR ALTERNATIVE MILITARY SERVICE ACCEPTED FROM MAY 1</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Local-level governments will begin to
accept applications from men wishing to participate in alternative
military service from May 1, Interior Minister Huang Chu-wen
announced on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>This will be the first time that the Republic of China has
introduced alternative military service for conscripts. Huang said
the ROC is also the first non-European country to implement such a
system to ensure more efficient, fair and just use of its manpower
resources.</P>
      <P>Huang said all male ROC nationals who were born in 1980 or before
and have not yet completed mandatory military service can file
applications with village, township or city governments of their
legal abodes between May 1 and May 20.</P>
      <P>Some 1981-born males who have not received notice for regular
military service before May 1 can also apply for alternative military
service, Huang said.</P>
      <P>According to an initial estimate by the Ministry of the Interior,
about 100,000 male nationals will be eligible to apply for
alternative military service.</P>
      <P>"As only 5,000 alternative service vacancies are available this
year, applicants will have to draw lots to decide whether they can do
alternative service," Huang explained.</P>
      <P>The minister further said this year's alternative service will
include jobs such as firefighting, social services, environmental
protection and medical services.</P>
      <P>Under the alternative service regulations, those who have passed
special national examinations and have obtained professional licenses
will enjoy preferential opportunities to land alternative service
jobs, while other applicants will have to draw lots.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, those who are not suitable for normal military service
due to family factors or special religious beliefs can also apply to
do alternative service.</P>
      <P>The conscription period for alternative service will be two years
and two months, four months longer than regular military service, and
those who assume alternative service posts for religious reasons will
have to serve up to two years and nine months.</P>
      <P>Salaries and other fringe benefits for those who do alternative
service will be similar to those for military conscripts.</P>
      <P>Huang said the Interior Ministry will publish detailed
application procedures for alternative service in major local news
media and on its Internet website.</P>
      <P>Huang said it has taken two years of concerted effort by the
Interior Ministry's conscription department, the Ministry of National
Defense and other relevant government agencies and the Legislative
Yuan to put in place all the necessary legal provisions and
administrative preparations for implementing the alternative military
service.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the Interior Ministry set up an executive
panel on March 1 to handle the preparatory work. A central
government-level conscription administration will also be inaugurated
to take charge of all alternative service affairs after the
legislature completes screening of a draft bill on the
administration's organic structure.</P>

Industry &amp; Commerce (CNAIC) said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>CNAIC Chairman Jeffrey Koo was referring to reports that the
Beijing authorities plan to bully Taiwan businessmen in the mainland
with the aim of reducing the more-than US$20 billion trade surplus
enjoyed by Taiwan over the mainland.</P>
      <P>Speaking to reporters after presiding over a CNAIC meeting, Koo
described such a policy as a double-edged knife which would hurt both
Taiwan and mainland businessmen, and one which Beijing could
ill-afford.</P>
      <P>If mainland businessmen do not purchase products from Taiwan,
they will have to do business with the other countries, which will
"inevitably" result in increased operational costs, Koo claimed,
adding that this would have a negative impact on the mainland's
economic development in the long run.</P>
      <P>Gao Chi-shang, vice chairman of I-Mei Food Company, who attended
the meeting, told the reporters that although the story about
Beijing's intimidation measures against Taiwan businessmen has not
been confirmed, "all the foreign investors, including those from
Taiwan," would leave the mainland if the situation indeed develops in
this direction.</P>
      <P>The Beijing authorities would not be so foolish as to scare away
foreign capital, according to Gao.</P>
      <P>There have been reports that Beijing announced last week that it
will not permit Taiwan businessmen to pursue economic benefits in
mainland China while at the same time supporting the Taiwan
independence movement at home, as a number of Taiwan business tycoons
have been reported to have been doing.</P>
      <P>The Beijing-based Central Office for Taiwan Affairs has already
started retaliatory measures against several Taiwan plastics
manufacturers by suspending imports of their products, according to
recent reports.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SLOW PROGRESS IN FINANCIAL REFORM AFFECTS ROC'S COMPETITIVENESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior economics planner said on
Wednesday that he was not surprised by a drop in Taiwan's
international competitiveness rating because Taiwan has dragged foot
on financial reforms in the past couple of years.</P>
      <P>Chi Schive, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development, was responding to an annual
report released recently by the Swiss-based International Institute
for Management Development (IMD) which ranked Taiwan's national
competitiveness at 22nd place, down from its 1999 rating of 18th
place.</P>
      <P>"Our ranking decline on the IMD global national competitiveness
rating didn't come as a surprise to me," Schive said, adding
that Taiwan's failure to accelerate financial and banking reforms was
the main reason behind its decline in national competitiveness
rating.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Republic of China government's economic and
financial policy planning team, Schive said he feels regret over the
slow progress in the country's financial and banking reforms.</P>
      <P>Schive said if the incoming administration of President-elect
Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party really wants to
promote Taiwan's globalization, it must speed up financial and
banking reforms.</P>
      <P>"The new government should also listen more to opinions of
foreign experts and should not formulate relevant policies behind
closed doors," Schive said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan saw its ratings drop in all the eight major categories
measured by the IMD for compiling the annual report on overall
national competitiveness of 47 major countries and areas around the
world.</P>
      <P>The most serious drop were seen in the "globalization" category,
down from a 27th-place rating to 34th. The rating for "business
management" also slid from ninth to 18th, and the rating for
"financial and banking management" fell from 23rd to 26th. Taiwan's
2000 ratings in these three categories were the lowest since the IMD
began to compile a global national competitiveness rating from 1996.</P>
      <P>Schive said South Korea has taken bold steps to overhaul its
financial and banking structure after the 1997-1998 Asian financial
meltdown.</P>
      <P>"As a result, South Korea's IMD rating has surged 10 notches
this year, indicating that its sweeping financial reforms and
economic recovery have won international recognition," Schive said,
adding that Taiwan should draw inspiration from South Korea's
example.</P>
      <P>Schive pointed out that Taiwan's plunge in "business management"
was most alarming because many noted domestic large conglomerates
had exposed their drawbacks in internal management during the
1997-98 Asian financial crisis.</P>
      <P>The drop in the "globalization" rating was also noteworthy,
Schive said, adding that Taiwan need not overly worry about the
inflow of foreign capital for stock investment. "We should further
liberalize capital flow," he added.</P>
      <P>Schive further said Taiwan should also largely revise its
corporate law to offer much greater freedom for business
operations to sustain Taiwan's economic vitality and development.</P>
      <P>Taiwan ranked 18th in the IMD's 1996 global rating, 23rd in
1997, 16th in 1998 and 18th in 1999.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JUSTICE MINISTER-DESIGNATE SAYS HE'LL MAINTAIN STATUS QUO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Justice Minister-designate Chen Ding-nan
on Thursday categorically ruled out the possibility of a widespread
replacement of staff based on party affiliations at the Ministry of
Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) after he assumes office next
month.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen, a heavyweight in the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), which is replacing the Kuomintang as Taiwan's ruling
party after its candidate Chen Shui-bian was elected president, did
say he will see to it that MJIB agents and staff members will be
rejuvenated -- allowing younger men and women bigger opportunites to
help the MJIB operate more efficiently during his term.</P>
      <P>During a talk show interview Thursday morning, Chen made
reassurances that there won't be a major change in staff at the MJIB
after he takes office. He pointed out that he also did not make any
major staff changes 19 years ago when he won the city and county
chief elections to become magistrate of Ilan County, replacing the
ruling KMT in the eastern country for the first time.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed, however, that any staff members at the MJIB who
have undesirable disciplinary records might be transferred to other
units within the Ministry of Justice to perform different jobs.</P>
      <P>Since the MJIB has until now been supervised by both the Ministry
of Justice and the National Security Council because of its special
duties, Chen said he will not try to alter the MJIB's existing
functions and structure after he takes office. "Maintaining the
status quo is the best policy for a new government to begin with, at
least for the time being," Chen emphasized.</P>
      <P>In the future, the MJIB, which may be transformed into the
National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) shortly after the new
government is inaugurated on May 20, will continue to be charged with
duties which include anti-communist espionage and working against
official corruption, drug trafficking and money laundering, added
Chen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PAY RAISE UP TO NEW CABINET TO DECIDE SAYS PM SIEW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said on Thursday that
whether or not the plan for a pay raise for the country's public
functionaries is put into force in July is up to the new government
to decide.</P>
      <P>Siew said the outgoing Cabinet will leave the question of the pay
raise plan to the new government, to be led by Premier-designate Tang
Fei, on the grounds that the scheduled implementation of the pay
raise is July 1, at which time the new government will already be in
office.</P>
      <P>When deciding on the pay raise issue, the new government will
first take into consideration the government's balance sheets and the
current financial situation of the different levels of government,
said Central Personnel Administration Director-general Chang
Che-tsen.</P>
      <P>Chang said that as of mid-April, the central government revenues
are sufficient enough to implement a proposed 3 percent pay raise for
government employees, mainly because of increased revenues from stock
transaction taxes. However, he added that several city and county
governments may have difficulties in coping with the plan due to
long-standing financial strains, he noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NUMBER OF FOREIGN LABORERS EXCEEDS OFFICIAL LIMIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of legal foreign laborers has
exceeded the government sanctioned ceiling of 300,000, with the
number of Indonesian and Vietnamese workers increasing most
significantly, the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the latest CLA tallies, a total of 301,447 foreign
laborers had come to Taiwan legally for work as of the end of March
2000. The Cabinet-level council promised to keep the total number
of blue-collar foreign workers from exceeding 300,000 to avoid
affecting local people's job opportunities.</P>
      <P>CLA statistics show that Thailand remained the largest source of
foreign laborers in Taiwan, despite the fact that the number of Thai
workers had been declining steadily. A total of 140,133 Thai
nationals were working in Taiwan at the end of March.</P>
      <P>The number of Philippine workers has also been falling at a pace
of about 1,000 people per month since last September partly because
of the suspension of direct air links between the two countries.</P>
      <P>At the end of March, 112,859 Filipinos were working in Taiwan,
accounting for 37.44 percent of total foreign workers here and
making the Philippines the Republic of China' second largest source
of alien workers.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the number of legal workers from Indonesia
and Vietnam has been rising steadily. In March, 46,762 Indonesians
were working in here, up 1,767 persons from the February level.
During the same period, the number of Vietnamese workers increased
from 842 to 1,550. Taiwan began to allow imports of Vietnamese
workers early this year.</P>
      <P>In March, 143 Malaysian nationals were working in Taiwan, down
four persons from February.</P>
      <P>CLA officials said the number of Indonesian household helpers has
increased rapidly in recent months. There were 31,678 Indonesian
family helpers in Taiwan in March, accounting for 44.19 percent of
total foreign household helpers here.</P>
      <P>In the past, local families liked to hire Filipinas as household
helpers because most of Philippine nationals can speak English.
However, the trend has gradually changed. The ratio of Filipino
family helpers fell below 50 percent for the first time to 49.77
percent in March, with the number standing at 35,680.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REPORT EMPHASIZES AMERICA'S TOP NAT'L SEC'Y PRIORITIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  19 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A United States government chartered
study emphasized Wednesday that assisting the integration of China,
Russia and India into the mainstream of the emerging international
system must be one of America's top national security strategy
priorities in the new century, but the US should remain committed to
the peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue.</P>
      <P>The 14-member US Commission on National Security/21st Century
said in its phase two report "Seeking A National Strategy" that the
United States should engage China constructively and with a positive
attitude, politically and economically, adding that it must also
recognize that the potential for competition between the US and China
may increase as China grows stronger.</P>
      <P>China's increasing adherence to global economic, legal and
cultural institutions and norms will be a positive factor, and the US
should encourage and assist this process of integration, said the
report.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the report pointed out that "the US should
maintain its deterrence strength and its alliance system in the
Asia-Pacific region. It should remain committed to the peaceful
resolution of the Taiwan question, consistent with the terms of the
three Sino-American communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act."</P>
      <P>The panel, headed by former senators Warren Rudman and Gary Hart,
said that beyond its efforts to bring China, Russia and India into
the mainstream of a new cooperative international order, the United
States has a strong interest in limiting the further proliferation of
sophisticated conventional weapons around the world.</P>
      <P>The US should therefore seek support for a multilateral approach
to devising limitations on such proliferation first with its closest
allies and friends, and thereafter with Russia, China, India and
other significant arms producing countries.</P>
      <P>The Commission on National Security wrote in its phase one report
"New World Coming: American Security in The 21st Century" that of all
the potential problems that could throw East Asia for a proverbial
loop, none is as portentous or controversial as the future of China
because such a huge country is bound to affect East Asia's future.</P>
      <P>The report noted that if Chinese authoritarianism declines as per
capita income reaches around US$7,000, and the political system moves
toward bounded pluralism, even if not genuine democracy, optimism
about East Asia's future will receive a major boost. If Beijing
undergoes major political reform after the terminal, but essentially
peaceful, crisis of the Communist system leading to the creation of a
system no less democratic than Taiwan's, then so much the better.</P>
      <P>But the commission also pointed out that at least two other
possibilities exist concerning mainland China's future, and they are
far less positive from a US perspective.</P>
      <P>One scenario is that China will continue to get rich while
authoritarianism remains. What could happen is that the country
metastasizes from a Communist command economy into a looser
corporatist system, bound together by a network of interwoven
political, military and economic elites, and sustained at large by
appeals to nationalism, said the report.</P>
      <P>"Such a new nationalist China could become decidedly hostile to
the US, and that hostility could be reciprocated. Several triggers
for such hostility exist even today, and they will not go away soon,"
stressed the report. Among them is a possible crisis over Taiwan in
which the US strongly sides with Taipei, a crisis made much more
likely by Taiwan's renunciation of its `one China' policy in July
1999.</P>
      <P>Another possibility is that China collapses politically and
violence erupts. Elements of a political collapse include the loss of
ideological legitimacy on the part of the Communist Party, massive
corruption among the political and economic elites, the pressure of
separatism in Tibet and Xinjiang, a failure to reform the state-owned
enterprises that produces simultaneously a financial default and
massive unemployment, the continued rise of cults, and a series of
poor political judgments.</P>
      <P>The panel is convinced that a collapse could produce a return to
warlordism, economic disaster, humanitarian catastrophe, the
potential scattering of Communist China's weapons of mass
destruction, and terrorism.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan charity organization on Thursday
donated nearly 70 cartons of toys and stationery supplies to Senegal,
hoping that the donation will help Senegalese children lead happier
lives.</P>
      <P>The donation, raised by the non-profit Chinese Fund for Children
and Families, Taiwan, was received by Senegal Ambassador to the
Republic of China Ahmed Tijane Kane during a presentation ceremony
attended by ROC Foreign Affairs Minister Chen Chien-jen.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Chen lauded the compassion shown by the
Taiwanese public for Senegalese children through the donation. He
said Senegal is an important diplomatic ally of Taiwan. The average
number of children per Senegalese family is six, and only 60 percent
of all children in the West African country attend school, while up
to 22 percent of them are on the brink of starvation, he continued.</P>
      <P>Upon receiving the donation on behalf of his country, Ambassador
Kane said the Taiwanese donation is highly appreciated, particularly
after Taiwan itself was hit by a devastating earthquake last
September.</P>
      <P>The donation, which weighs a total of 1,635 kg, will be
transported to Senegal free of charge by the giant US express carrier
UPS, said Fund officials.</P>
      <P>Senegal's opposition leader Abdoulaye Wade defeated President
Abdou Diouf in an election on March 20, ending 40 years of
uninterrupted Socialist Party rule. The change of power in Dakar has
planted the seeds of uncertainty concerning the country's formal
diplomatic relations with the ROC, political observers said.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Chinese Fund for Children and Families,
Taiwan, said that in addition to the underprivileged children living
in Senegal, there are children in other areas of Africa who are also
in dire need of help.</P>
      <P>For example, they noted, there are currently about 15 million
people in Ethiopia suffering famine conditions as a result of a
severe drought in that country located in the horn of Africa. Fund
officials are urging the people of Taiwan to pitch in with efforts to
help the people of that country, preferably by sponsoring individual
Senegalese children through monthly cash donations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA'S POLICY TOWARD PRC, ROC, INDIA SAID OUTMODED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  20  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian government's policy of
pursuing engagement with mainland China while at the same time
disdaining both Taiwan and India was criticized by a veteran
Australian writer as "misguided and outmoded."</P>
      <P>In his recent article in the Australian Financial Review, Brian
Toohey said Asia as the coming dynamo of growth has been a tenet of
Australian policy for years, but this policy is misguided.</P>
      <P>He says the intellectual and entrepreneurial forces shaping the
information and bio-technology revolutions have come from the United
States and Europe and not Asia, which is only a potential market for
the end product of innovative ideas nurtured elsewhere.</P>
      <P>These revolutions are the products of free and democratic
societies in the US and Europe, and a similar process may be underway
in India and Taiwan, the two Asian democracies which "Australian
policy makers have treated with disdain," he noted.</P>
      <P>He cites a quip heard frequently in Silicon Valley on the west
coast of the US that refers to the "I" in IT as standing for Indian
and the letter "T" standing for Taiwanese because many of the recent
innovative breakthroughs appear to be the work of emigrants from
these two countries.</P>
      <P>"The great lesson of this revolution appears to be that
geographical proximity matters less and less and intellectual and
political freedom counts for more and more. In this context, it does
not make a lot of sense to try to pick regional winners, especially
where authoritarian institutions still predominate," he says.</P>
      <P>Toohey says John Vinocur, a senior correspondent of the
International Herald Tribune, who has been jailed in Singapore, is at
a loss to understand why Australian policy makers are not more
relaxed about their country's place in the world rather than being so
preoccupied with seeking the approval of authoritarian Asian regimes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MARITAL INFIDELITY TOPS 10 BIGGEST ONLINE 'CRIMES'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  20  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Marital infidelity is considered the
leading crime in the virtual online world, results of a recent survey
of Internet surfers in Taiwan showed.</P>
      <P>In the survey, Taiwan Internet surfers ranked online extramarital
affairs as the number one social problem in the virtual world. This
is due to the frequency and convenience of such trysts, said Seednet
President Cheng Chia-chun.</P>
      <P>Garbage mail, virtual trash that wastes time and occasionally
causes PCs to crash, was the second most serious problem on the
Internet, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>Online rumors, neo-gossip that only smart brains can resist, was
the third.</P>
      <P>Internet addiction was deemed the fourth most serious problem.
Victims of mild cases of this syndrome can simply exhibit
restlessness when offline. For hard-core addicts, symptoms include
uncontrollable trembling and excessive perspiration if they are kept
from a computer monitor for one single day.</P>
      <P>Online pornography was ranked the fifth worst problem. Moral
campaigners have suggested parents move fast to find and block
pornographic websites from their home computer.</P>
      <P>Physical complications from spending too much time online were
judged the sixth worst problem. This latest illness of the high-tech
age includes symptoms of degeneration of language ability, hand joint
deformities and other physical abnormalities.</P>
      <P>Online gambling came in seventh in the poll. The Internet has
created unprecedented convenience for cross-border or borderless
gambling.</P>
      <P>Compulsive online shopping was ranked eighth. The Internet
enables compulsive shoppers to bankrupt themselves by making
excessive purchases with a push of a keyboard button.</P>
      <P>Societal alienation was ranked the ninth worst problem. Long-term
surfers can become mentally isolated and can eventually become
completely alienated from family members and from real life, said the
poll organizers.</P>
      <P>Distortion of democracy won the 10th and final spot on the list.
Some surfers make irrational condemnations and verbal assaults
online, resulting in a distortion of the freedom of speech and having
an adverse effect on democracy, according to Cheng.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN STOCK MARKET REBOUNDS ON GOVERNMENT BUYING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan stock market closed slightly
higher on Thursday mainly because of buying of large blue-chip
stocks by four government-run funds in the final session.</P>
      <P>The benchmark Taiwan Stock Exchange (Taiex) weighted price index
edged up 4.65 points to close at 9,109.05.</P>
      <P>The market opened weak in a bearish mood due to a fall in the
technology-heavy Nasdaq index in the United States on Wednesday as
well as profit-taking by short-term investors.</P>
      <P>The Taiex index fell more than 100 points around mid-session, but
recovered all lost grounds in the last half hour of trading, with
large blue-chip stocks leading the rally.</P>
      <P>Market analysts said the steady rises in prices for such large
blue-chip stocks as Taiwan Semiconductor Corp. and United
Microelectronics Corp. indicate that the local bourse will gradually
stabilize following last week's drastic fall.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, some Intel Corp.-related stocks weakened on the
Taiex on reports that the US-based computer chip maker is being
troubled by a shortage of CPUs. It remains to be seen whether these
stocks can regain steam in the near future.</P>
      <P>Market turnover shrank further to NT$133.47 billion (US$4.38
billion) as many investors adopted a wait-and-see attitude.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  20  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Alexander Downer is
expected to reiterate Australia's "one-China" policy while calling on
Beijing to resume a dialogue with Taiwan in order to settle the
cross-strait issue peacefully when he visits Beijing on April 23-24.</P>
      <P>In a news release on Thursday, Downer said he will go to Beijing
to attend the Asia-Australia Institute's Asia Leader's Forum and the
2000 Asia-Australia Institute Council Meeting.</P>
      <P>Downer will meet his Chinese counterpart, Tang Jiaxuan, to
discuss matters of mutual interest and help maintain the positive
momentum in Australia's relations with mainland China, the statement
said.</P>
      <P>The Australian government switched diplomatic ties to China from
Taiwan in late 1972 and has since maintained its "one-China" policy,
but Canberra also wants both sides of the Taiwan Strait to settle
their disputes peacefully, according to a senior official at the
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), who requested
anonymity.</P>
      <P>The DFAT spokesman told CNA that any military confrontation
across the Taiwan Strait could possibly force the United States to
participate, and would be the last thing Australia wants to see.</P>
      <P>"If that happens, Australia is highly likely to be asked by
Washington to support America because both countries are traditional
allies," the official said.</P>
      <P>Prime Minister John Howard recently told Zheng Qinhong, a
personal secretary for President Jiang Zemin and a Politburo member,
that Australia would continue to maintain its "one China" policy but
at the same time, would continue to have commercial ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Howard also urged China to peacefully resolve differences with
Taiwan through negotiations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXPORT ORDERS HIT US$12.64 BILLION IN MARCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Export orders for March totaled US$12.64
billion, representing the highest level since last October and the
sixth consecutive month of double-digit growth, said the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) on Friday.</P>
      <P>Chang Yao-chung, director general of the MOEA's Accounting
Department, said that because of the rosy economic picture this year,
export order growth estimates could be adjusted to double digits from
the original eight percent.</P>
      <P>Chang said the continued dramatic growth in export orders could
be attributed to the continued economic turnaround in the United
States, Asia and Europe.</P>
      <P>Orders in March for information and telecommunications products
totaled US$2.42 billion, US$2.2 billion for electronics products, and
US$1.3 billion for textile products.</P>
      <P>Accumulated export orders from the United States totaled US$10.75
billion in the first quarter of this year, up 7.48 percent from the
same period last year.</P>
      <P>Accumulated export orders in the first quarter from Japan totaled
US$3.52 billion, up 24.86 percent, while orders from Hong Kong
totaled US$6.02 billion, up 25.45 percent. Export orders from Europe
totaled US$6.01 billion, up 14.38 percent.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that domestic economic prospects continue to look
good, with the only uncertain factor being cross-strait relations. He
added that when mainland China test-fired missiles in waters near the
Taiwan Strait prior to the island's 1996 presidential election,
Taiwan's exports suffered, but overall, the impact on the mainland's
economy was bigger.</P>
      <P>Chang said that with the continued economic boom, the MOEA is
worrying more about whether domestic manufacturers' production
capacity can meet the growing number of export orders.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GERMAN-ROC ECONOMIC COOPERATION SUCCESS STORIES ENCOURAGING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 21 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Successful German ventures in the Republic
of China and Taiwanese ventures in Germany have enhanced economic
cooperation between the two countries, said German Institute
Director-general Dr. Hilmar Kaht, emphasizing that these success
stories have been inspiring and encouraging.</P>
      <P>Dr. Kaht said that the economies of Germany and Taiwan, in terms
of structure, quality and export-orientation, are rather
complementary. "Especially remarkable is the high share of trade
exchanged both ways in identical or similar branches of production,
such as machinery, electronics, precision engineering and optics and
chemicals," he added.</P>
      <P>As German technologies are highly appreciated in Taiwan's
industrial circles, there have been numerous technology transfer
cooperation projects over the past years, the most recent case being
the 0.14 micron technology developed by Germany's Infineon and
applied by Taiwan's ProMOS Technologies Inc. to 12-inch integrated
circuit chip production.</P>
      <P>Dr. Kaht pointed out that Germany remains Taiwan's largest trade
partner in Europe. Taiwan's exports to Germany grew in 1999 by 3
percent to US$4.3 billion. Taiwan is the third largest market for
German exports in the Asian-Pacific region, with the island importing
US$5.3 billion worth of goods from Germany in 1999.</P>
      <P>There are more than 140 German companies with a presence in
Taiwan. Dr. Kaht said he expects even more will come as Taiwan
approaches its goal of becoming an Asia Pacific Regional Operations
Center and continues its process of economic liberalization.</P>
      <P>In his capacity as Germany's representative to Taiwan, Dr. Kaht
said that Germany is greatly in favor of Taiwan's access to the World
Trade Organization as he believes it will set the framework for
greater exchanges and cooperation between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Although economic exchanges seem to form the major part of the
relationship between Germany and Taiwan, Dr. Kaht stressed that
exchanges in the scientific, academic and cultural sectors have also
been booming in recent years.</P>
      <P>He said that Sino-German academic exchanges have a history of
more than one hundred years, and there are quite a few successful
examples of German-Taiwanese scientific cooperation. In 1999, for
instance, Cheng Kung University in Tainan and the University of
Rostock in northern Germany jointly organized a seminar on coastal
engineering and sustainable development in the coastal zone.</P>
      <P>These exchanges and activities are important elements in forming
a durable relationship, said the diplomat on leave.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN SAYS CONCEPT OF `CONFEDERATION' WARRANTS DISCUSSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  21  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President-elect Chen Shui-bian said on
Friday that the formation of a confederation between both sides of
the Taiwan Strait is one idea that can be discussed.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while calling on Sun Yun-suan, the former
premier and currently a senior advisor to President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the Republic of China has not changed despite
undergoing a transition of power after the March 18 presidential
election, adding that the only change may be that it has become more
democratic.</P>
      <P>He said that as the new leader of the nation, he will not just
pursue his own will in handling cross-strait relations, saying that
he will listen to views and opinions from all sides.</P>
      <P>Chen said the idea recently proposed by Sun of both sides forming
a confederation is a "new concept," and whether the concept is
"feasible" will depend on forging a consensus among the people,
adding that there is much room for discussion on the idea.</P>
      <P>Chen reiterated that if mainland China continues its strategy of
verbal attacks and military intimidation, it will only "delay an
improvement in cross-strait ties."</P>
      <P>He urged mainland China to adopt new thinking so that the people
of Taiwan will be more attracted to it, saying that "warm sunshine"
will help melt the ice, and it is useless to use a "spade and
shovel."</P>
      <P>He also lauded Sun as one of the most outstanding civil servants
in ROC history, adding that if he had not quit as premier for health
reasons in 1984, he would be the president today.</P>
      <P>Chen also invited Sun to continue serving as a senior advisor to
the president so as to help him handle cross-strait relations and
other administrative duties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT-ELECT SEEKS TO IMPROVE TIES WITH KOREA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Seoul,  April  21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC President-elect Chen Shui-bian told a
leading Korean newspaper that it is time for the Republic of China
and South Korea to demonstrate goodwill and sincerity so as to
improve their bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview with the Chosun Ilbo that appeared on
the Korean daily's front page on Friday, Chen said the people of
Taiwan and South Korea used to be close friends, leading similar
lives and sharing similar backgrounds and experiences.</P>
      <P>As both countries have witnessed successful power transfers from
decades-old ruling parties to opposition parties, and as the people
of both countries share long-standing friendship, there is no reason
why Taiwan and South Korea cannot improve relations, including the
resumption of direct air links, Chen told the Chosun Ilbo.</P>
      <P>Chen said that after its inauguration on May 20, the new ROC
government will actively seek to improve bilateral ties with the
South Korean government and to resume direct air links.</P>
      <P>The Korean newspaper with a circulation of 2.5 million copies
quoted Chen as saying that the ruling Kuomintang has faced
difficulties over the past several years in its efforts to improve
ties with Seoul as well as to resume direct air links because of the
issue of "face."</P>
      <P>Chen said his new government is not hindered by this "face" issue
and so he sees no barriers to addressing differences between the two
sides and to resuming talks based on goodwill and sincerity.</P>
      <P>On cross Taiwan Strait relations, Chen told the Korean daily that
the new government will retain parts of the KMT's policies, but will
at the same time create some new approaches toward the cross-strait
relations issue. A special committee headed by Academia Sinica
President Lee Yuan-tseh will serve as that creative arm charged with
working out measures to cope with the cross-strait relations issue,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>He added that while he makes it the responsibility of his new
government to seek to improve cross-strait relations, it should be
the common goal of both Taiwan and Beijing to strenuously pursue
permanent peace in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>When asked about the impact on Taiwan's security of Tuesday's
decision by the United States to postpone the sale of Aegis
destroyers to Taiwan, Chen said the US government has not killed the
Aegis destroyers sales plan but only postponed it. It is believed
that through further negotiations, the ROC Ministry of Defense will
eventually obtain the weapons that the ministry has asked for to help
defend the country.</P>
      <P>Chen added that Taiwan's present strategy to combat a potential
Communist Chinese air, sea, or guided missile attack is to use
defensive missiles.</P>
      <P>He, however, stressed most of all that peace in the Taiwan Strait
is not only in line with the interests of Taiwan, it is also vitally
important to Japan and other nations in the Asian-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>On the reasons behind his victory in the March 18 presidential
poll, Chen quipped that he is obliged to three persons who greatly
contributed to his campaign. He mentioned DPP Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung
for his capable leadership of the party's rank and file, and also his
election rival James Soong for running in defiance of the Kuomintang,
which caused a fatal split within the ruling party.</P>
      <P>Chen also said he is grateful to mainland Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji for his strong verbal blustering on the eve of the election,
which Chen said he believes outraged many Taiwanese voters who
previously weren't hostile towards Beijing and who were undecided on
their choice of candidate.</P>
      <P>When asked whether he will follow ROC founding father Dr. Sun
Yat-sen's "Three Principles of the People -- Nationalism, Democracy
and Livelihood--when leading the country, Chen said that the KMT did
not implement these ideals during its rule even though the party was
founded by Sun himself, just as the communist rulers on the mainland
have not properly implemented a communist system.</P>
      <P>Chen said he will follow the Third Way -- a new political
perspective -- in leading the Republic of China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US SAYS IT WELCOMES TALKS ON CHINA'S HUMAN RIGHTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, April 20 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Clinton administration on Thursday
stated that it welcomed the resumption of human rights dialogue with
Communist China at the earliest possible time.</P>
      <P>State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin told a press conference
that "we think the more we talk about human rights, the better it is
for the human rights of the people of China, whether its talking
about them with China bilaterally or in Geneva at the UN Human Rights
Commission."</P>
      <P>Asked about the decision to oppose permanent normal trade
relations with China announced Wednesday by House minority leader
Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-Mo), Rubin said that Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has had a lot of discussions, especially with
Democratic members of Congress, about their concerns on human rights
and how the US should express its concern about Chinese human rights
abuses.</P>
      <P>Albright's role in these discussions, in addition to arguing that
granting China permanent normal trade relations status is a win-win
proposition for American consumers and producers, has been to focus
on the national security argument.</P>
      <P>In the secretary of state's judgment, Rubin said, "to vote down
permanent normal trade relations would be a major setback to the
US-China relationship which would harm our national security"
regarding North Korea and non-proliferation issues.</P>
      <P>"If members of Congress care about questions like the danger of
North Korea developing nuclear missiles and the subject of the
transferring of missile technology, they should want to avoid a major
setback to the US-China relationship because China's role has been
helpful," Rubin added.</P>
      <P>"We think that cutting off our nose to spite our face by failing
to get the economic benefits of this agreement (on China's accession
to the World Trade Organization) and putting at risk the national
security benefits of our relations with China is the wrong decision
to make," Albright was quoted by Rubin as telling the members of
Congress.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VATICAN REFUSES BEIJING'S REQUEST TO CONDEMN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Apr.  21  (CNA)
(By Ken Su)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's efforts to pressure
president-elect Chen Shui-bian on the diplomatic front suffered a
setback when the Vatican refused to condemn Taiwan's `two states'
theory, the Hong Kong Standard reported today.</P>
      <P>The report quoted sources as saying that mainland authorities had
attempted to ask the Vatican, one of Taiwan's longtime diplomatic
allies, to denounce the theory, but the Holy See refused.</P>
      <P>The statehood claims were made last July by Taiwan's outgoing
President Lee Teng-hui during an interview with the German media.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Beijing has linked the theory to the
island's independence movement, which it has condemned as splittist.</P>
      <P>Aside from the Vatican, the mainland is also aiming to persuade
Panama, another one of Taiwan's diplomatic allies, to switch its
recognition to Beijing after Chen's inauguration on May 20.</P>
      <P>Negotiations between the Holy See and Beijing are still ongoing,
but so far there has been no breakthrough, the report quoted the
source close to the Vatican as saying.</P>
      <P>The Holy See said a public statement against Taiwan independence
is inappropriate as the island has never declared independence.</P>
      <P>It has always supported the `one-China policy' and sees no need
to interfere in Taiwan's domestic affairs, it said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S THREATS AGAINST TAIWAN HOLLOW SAYS ANALYST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  20  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although Communist China and Taiwan
could inflict a large amount of damage on each other in a military
conflict, it is difficult to imagine a scenario where a mainland
invasion of the island could facilitate Beijing's goal of eventual
reunification, said James H. Nolt, a senior fellow at the World
Policy Institute here.</P>
      <P>Nolt wrote in a recent analysis on US-PRC-Taiwan military
relations that although China has disputes with most of its
neighbors, it has not resorted to force to resolve them since its
border war with Vietnam in 1979, except for a brief clash with
Vietnam over the Parcel Islands in 1988. The most persistent
remaining problem is Beijing's threat to use force against Taiwan if
it declares independence.</P>
      <P>But "Beijing's threats against Taiwan are hollow, because China
lacks the military capability to inflict damage on Taiwan without
suffering immense damage to its own economy and coastal regions,"
said Nolt. For example, Taiwan's air force, though much smaller than
mainland China's, has been completely re-equiped with modern
aircraft, outnumbering Beijing's few modern Russian-built fighters by
more than six to one.</P>
      <P>Besides, mainland China is now more dependent on foreign trade
than it was during the Taiwan Straits crises of the 1950s and its
economy would consequently suffer much more in the event of an armed
conflict. Taiwan is also more powerful relative to mainland China
than it was in the 1950s. "The Taiwanese could defend themselves
adequately even without US intervention," added the senior fellow.</P>
      <P>Despite frequent alarms about the supposed China threat, it is
not an emerging superpower. Although it has experienced rapid
economic growth, China has been in relative decline militarily since
the 1970s, said Nolt.</P>
      <P>Its high economic growth rate is now slowing, and its pattern of
growth has actually undermined its ability to become an autonomous
military power able to manufacture its own weapons systems and
sustain a war effort without support from abroad. "China does not,
and will not in the foreseeable future, pose the kind of military
threat to the US that the Soviet Bloc did," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger also said in a
speech on Tuesday in Pasadena that China "is not in any position for
the next 30 years to be a mortal threat to the United States.....So
for the next 20 years we need to think, 'Do we want to put them
down?'"</P>
      <P>Many policymakers have voiced concern that an influx of US
dual-use technology into mainland China could facilitate its military
modernization. However, Nolt noted, in industries such as aerospace,
the trend has been for foreign involvement to relegate mainland
Chinese producers to merely subcontracting low-tech components rather
than manufacturing entire systems.</P>
      <P>Beijing's incapacity to design and manufacture the most modern
weapons has forced it to rely, like most developing countries, on
arms imports. Communist China's limited acquisition of modern foreign
weapons, mostly from Russian, is a tiny fraction of what would be
needed to replace its aging arsenal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW UMC WAFER FOUNDRY FACING SUSPENSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A new microchip wafer manufacturing plant
being built by United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) faces suspension
of operations as allegedly no environmental impact study was carried
out before trial production began.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)
on Friday officially informed the National Science Council (NSC) that
a permit for the establishment of UMC's 8F Foundry will be canceled
because the plant has begun production trials before passing a
government-authorized test designed to assess the plant's impact on
the environment.</P>
      <P>The NSC, meanwhile, demanded UMC authorities to present a
comprehensive environmental impact assessment report within a week in
order to avoid being deprived of a license for the new plant.</P>
      <P>NSC officials also said UMC must suspend the 8F Foundry's
production trials until it receives official approval regarding the
environmental impact assessment.</P>
      <P>UMC officials, outraged over the sudden demand for the new
plant's suspension, met the press on Friday at the Taiwan Stock
Exchange to explain the situation to individual and institutional
investors holding UMC stock, numbering between 400,000 and 500,000
people.</P>
      <P>The official said UMC obtained approval from the relevant
government agencies before beginning construction of the new wafer
plant, and added that the company, the second-largest microchip wafer
processor in Taiwan, will sue for "national-level" compensation if
plant operations are forcefully suspended and cause financial losses
to investors.</P>
      <P>Currently, the 8F Foundry -- the fifth of its kind owned by UMC
-- is at the stage of installation and testing of facilities and has
yet to begin commercial production. Consequently, its immediate fate
will not influence UMC's overall turnover or income, according to the
officials.</P>
      <P>It was previously expected that once the 8F Foundry begins
commercial production in June or July this year, its monthly output
of microchip wafers will reach 15,000 units by the end of the year,
with maximum capacity reaching 30,000 units per month.</P>
      <P>UMC has targeted an annual turnover of NT$88 billion (US$2.89
billion) for 2000, with a prospective annual output of 2.4 million
silicon wafers.</P>
      <P>The 8F Foundry, which uses sophisticated 0.18 micrometer design
rules, is expected to contribute some NT$8 billion (US$262 million)
to UMC per year once it begins commercial production, the UMC
officials added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Four US East Asian affairs experts from an
influential think tank -- the National Committee on American Foreign
Policy (NCAFP) -- are scheduled to arrive in Taipei on Saturday for a
four-day visit.</P>
      <P>Among the visitors will be Winston Lord, a former assistant
secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs and a former US
ambassador to mainland China.</P>
      <P>The three other visitors are Douglas Paal, who once served as
Asian affairs chief of the National Security Council under the Bush
administration; NCAFP President George D. Schwab; and professor
Donald S. Zagoria, head of the NCAFP's roundtable discussion program.</P>
      <P>The four-member mission will meet with Republic of China
government leaders, heads of major local political parties and
officials in charge of national security, diplomatic affairs and
relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Following its Taipei visit, the group will travel to mainland
China for a similar fact-finding visit with a view to gaining
first-hand information about the current political, military and
security situation on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The NCAFP was founded in 1974 with the purpose of offering
foreign policy counseling to the US government in order to boost
national interests. Its current honorary chairman is former US
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.</P>
      <P>The prestigious think tank has so far held five closed-door
roundtable meetings on US and mainland China policies and
cross-strait relations since the 1996 Taiwan Strait crisis when
Beijing lobbed missiles and conducted live-fire war games on Taiwan's
doorstep in an attempt to sway Taiwan voters in the run-up to the
island's first-ever direct presidential election.</P>
      <P>The NCAFP is expected to present foreign policy recommendations
based on the group's findings during its current visits to both sides
of the Taiwan Strait to be used as reference for hopefuls intending
to run in the US presidential election scheduled for November this
year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN'S TILT TOWARD KMT'S CROSS-STRAIT POLICY LINE WELCOMED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ranking official of the Kuomintang said
on Friday that he welcomes President-elect Chen Shui-bian tilting
toward the KMT's policy on cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, director-general of the KMT's Department of
Mainland Research, noted that Chen had in the past advocated the
abolishment of the National Unification Council, but as he won less
than 40 percent of the votes in the March 18 presidential election,
he has to adjust his course in cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>But Chang also said that although Chen has said that he has no
intention of abolishing the National Unification Council and the
National Unification Guidelines, it does not necessarily mean that he
won't.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, as the NUC charter states, the ROC president serves
as the NUC chairman and the ROC vice president as the NUC vice
chairman. Chang said that whether Chen and Vice President-elect
Annette Lu assume these positions will be worth watching.</P>
      <P>Chang also said that incumbent President Lee Teng-hui had cited
National Unification Guidelines to explain cross-strait relations to
foreign dignitaries when meeting with them, and whether Chen does the
same will also be worth watching.</P>
      <P>He said that the KMT's mainland policy is deemed by Beijing as
the safest, and this is the reason behind Chen's stating that he will
not abolish the National Unification Council and National Unification
Guidelines.</P>
      <P>But Chang added that Chen will have to come up with a
comprehensive policy toward the mainland soon, and if he doesn't, the
KMT's will be the most ideal point of reference.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that Beijing is presently forming its attitude toward
Chen by "listening to his words, and watching for his deeds," and if
Chen doesn't form a mainland policy soon, he will face mounting
pressure from Beijing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SECURITY ADVISER NAMED NEW MAC HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tsai Ying-wen, an adviser to the National
Security Council (NSC) and a professor at National Chengchi
University's International Trade Department, was confirmed on Friday
as chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).</P>
      <P>Tsai, who holds a master's degree in economics from Cornell
University and an LL.D. from the London School of Economics,
confirmed her acceptance of the post, saying she is grateful for the
wide support accorded to her but will not spell out her
administrative ideas and policies until she returns from a trip
abroad over the next week.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Lin Chong-pin expressed a hearty welcome to
Tsai's appointment. Lauding President-elect Chen Shui-bian and his
team for making a wise choice, Lin said Tsai will be a capable leader
of Taiwan's top agency in charge of formulating policies towards
mainland China due to her expertise in international affairs and
cross-strait issues and her personnel skills.</P>
      <P>Lin commended Tsai as a practical, poised and rational person who
maintains a low-profile style while demonstrating high-caliber
performance.</P>
      <P>Having chaired a number of international working group meetings
sponsored by the World Trade Organization (WTO), Tsai is also
believed to be Taiwan's foremost WTO expert.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, as a national security adviser to the president, Tsai
was one of 8-10 specialists, mostly academics, who comprised a group
responsible for authoring President Lee Teng-hui's redefinition of
cross-strait relations as "a special state-to-state" relationship
last year.</P>
      <P>An economics and law expert who also has an excellent command of
English, Tsai authored the English speech delivered by Taiwan's top
negotiator with the mainland, Chairman Koo Chen-fu of the
quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation, during an ice-breaking
meeting in Shanghai in 1998 with his mainland Chinese counterpart,
Wang Daohan, chairman of the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Despite her high-profile career, however, Tsai is described a
"shy lady" who still wears her hair in a "student style," prompting
local political observers to liken her to the fairy tale character
"little red riding hood," who eventually defeated the big bad wolf --
a less-than subtle depiction of the relationship between Taiwan and
mainland China.</P>

      <P>Results of a survey released on Friday
show that 68 percent of Taiwan households have two or more
televisions, higher than the 52 percent registered in both Shanghai
and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by ACNielsen (Taiwan) last year among
people in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Shanghai, also shows that 26 percent
of Taiwan households own three or even four televisions, and that
some children have their own televisions.</P>
      <P>However, in terms of Internet access, the percentage of online
households in Taiwan is 16 percent, trailing the 21 percent in Hong
Kong, but higher than the 7 percent in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>The survey also shows that 55 percent of Internet users in Taiwan
are young people aged between 15 and 24, with 39 percent of them
students, while 73 percent and 87 percent, respectively, of Hong Kong
and Shanghai surfers are working people.</P>
      <P>An ACNielsen official analyzed that the high percentage of
working people in Hong Kong surfing Internet indicates that Hong Kong
has the highest e-commerce potential in the Greater China Area, while
another official noted that mainland China's 3,000-plus TV channels
represents a promising market for media sector.</P>

    <HEADLINE>IF `ONE CHINA' MEANS PRC, TAIWAN PEOPLE ARE NOT CHINESE: LU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  21  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President-elect Annette Lu said on
Friday that if "one China" means the "People's Republic of China,"
then she does not think that the people of Taiwan can be described as
Chinese.</P>
      <P>Lu, a political dissident-turned-politician, made the remarks
during a meeting with visiting Canadian and American lawmakers who
had expressed concern about Taiwan's attitude toward "one China."</P>
      <P>The Beijing regime insists that there is but one China -- the
People's Republic of China -- of which Taiwan is inalienably a part.
This opposes the Republic of China view that agrees that there is
only one China, but that it is now ruled separately on either side of
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lu said Taiwan has shown a great deal of goodwill toward mainland
China, and added that the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait
are not involved in a feud and should not resort to war simply over
ideological issues.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan and mainland China need each other
economically, Lu said the two sides should co-exist peacefully.</P>
      <P>"Do we need to waste so much time arguing whether one China
should be a `precondition' or a `topic,' and even to go to war over
the issue?" Lu asked.</P>
      <P>Commenting on visiting mainland Chinese scholar Yu Keli's calls
for incoming President-elect Chen Shui-bian's administration to
uphold Beijing's so-called "one China" policy and for Chen to
identify himself as Chinese, Lu said the remarks were "old cliches."</P>
      <P>As for Chen's statement that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
can discuss the feasibility of forming a confederation, Lu said
Chen's suggestion mainly reflects his openness toward the issue.</P>
      <P>Lu said the two sides of the Taiwan Strait now need diversified,
innovative and constructive thinking, not destructive ideas. She
further said the two sides should shelve the highly sensitive
"unification or independence" issue for the moment and stop
meaningless verbal sparring in order to forge rapprochement.</P>
      <P>She also expressed worry that Beijing's leaders might be losing
patience and rationality toward the Taiwan Strait issue, and added
that she is afraid that mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
March 20 statement that Beijing will monitor Taiwan President-elect
Chen's "words and deeds" was just a smokescreen.</P>
      <P>"The reality is that mainland China is stepping up military
deployment along its southeastern coast opposite Taiwan," Lu said,
adding that senior Beijing leaders' increased overseas trips in
recent weeks have also been deliberately designed to suppress Taiwan
in the international community.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA CLARIFIES MAINLAND MEDIA'S FALSE REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  21  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) said on Friday that the United States has not changed the
cornerstone of its "one China" policy that demands mainland China use
strictly peaceful means to resolve issues across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The ministry was commenting on a Beijing-based China News
Service (CNS) report on March 30 that quoted US National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger as having told mainland Chinese Foreign Minister
Tang Jiaxuan that the United States recognizes that Beijing's "one
China" principle is the only basis for resolving the Taiwan Strait
issue.</P>
      <P>Liu Chih-kung, director of the MOFA's North American Affairs
Department, said the mainland media report was not true.</P>
      <P>Liu said the Republic of China government had asked the Clinton
administration whether the CNS report was correct. "Relevant US
authorities have clearly told us that the United States has not
changed its stance on the 'one China' principle," he noted.</P>
      <P>Liu pointed out that in May 1996, then US Secretary of State
Warren Christopher said in a speech in New York that Beijing using
peaceful means to resolve cross-strait issue is the basis of the US
"one China" policy.</P>
      <P>"Christopher's statement indicates that there is a wide gap
between the US stance on 'one China' and the CNS report on Berger's
remarks on the issue," Liu noted.</P>
      <P>"And the CNS claim that the United States has accepted Beijing's
stance that the "one China" principle is the basis and precondition
for peaceful unification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is
apparently a misleading distortion of Berger's remarks," Liu added.</P>
      <P>Under Beijing's "one China" principle, one China means "People's
Republic of China" and Taiwan is a breakaway province of the PRC.</P>

      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT) will continue to run

powerful opposition party, said KMT Vice Secretary-General Shao

      <P>Although the KMT lost the March 18 presidential election to the

    <HEADLINE>VISITING MAINLAND SCHOLARS MEET NEW PARTY LEADERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April   21   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A delegation of Taiwan affairs
researchers from Beijing's China Academy of Social Sciences met with
leaders of the Republic of China's right-wing opposition New Party on
Friday for wide-ranging talks.</P>
      <P>The six-member mainland Chinese delegation, led by Yu Keli,
deputy director of the Taiwan Research Institute under the China
Academy of Social Sciences, arrived in Taipei on Wednesday for a
fact-finding trip.</P>
      <P>It was the first mainland academic group to visit Taiwan after
Chen Shui-bian, a stalwart of the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party, won the ROC's March 18 presidential election in a
victory that marks an end to the Kuomintang's 55-year rule of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>New Party Legislator Hau Lung-pin, who concurrently serves as
convener of the New Party's National Campaign and Development
Committee, told a news conference after 40 minutes of closed-door
talks with the visiting mainland scholars that the two sides didn't
reach a consensus on the "one China" issue.</P>
      <P>"We have told the mainland researchers that its a consensus of
the people of Taiwan that each side of the Taiwan Strait should
be allowed to have its own definition of 'one China,'" Hau said.
"However, Yu told us that this 'one China, different definition'
stance is unacceptable to Beijing."</P>
      <P>Hau and his New Party colleagues also expressed their hope that
cross-strait interaction can be based on the ROC's National
Unification Guidelines which call for "phased" development of
relations and cooperation between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>"We also suggested that Beijing declares that 'one China'
doesn't refer to the People's Republic of China," Hau said, adding
that the mainland visitors frankly replied that the proposal is
unacceptable to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Touching on President-elect Chen's proposal that Taiwan and
mainland China discuss the feasibility of forming a confederation,
Hau quoted Yu as having said that Beijing cannot accept the
so-called confederation proposal because such a scheme cannot
resolve Tibet and Xinjiang issues.</P>
      <P>During their talks, Hau said he has advised the mainland
visitors to listen more to the mainstream public opinions here. "We
hope they can take advantage of their stay here to listen to the
views of various local social quarters and convey those opinions to
mainland leaders as reference for formulating mainland China's
future policy toward Taiwan," Hua said, adding that he hopes Yu's
mission can help boost cross-strait mutual understanding.</P>
      <P>Yu said the New Party, which supports Taiwan's
eventual unification with mainland China under freedom and
democracy, believes that bilateral dialogue and communication are
needed to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSMC DONATES FUNDS FOR RESTORATION OF FORMER US CONSULATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.
(TSMC) donated NT$60 million (US$1.97 million) to the Taipei City
Hall on Friday for restoring the former US consulate in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said at the donation ceremony that the
TSMC's move has set a model for industry-government cooperation in
preserving cultural heritage.</P>
      <P>The building, located on Taipei's tree-dotted Chungshan N. Road,
was built in 1901 during the imperial Ching dynasty. The US
government leased the building as its consulate in Taipei in 1926,
and closed its consular affairs in Taiwan in December 1941 when the
United States declared war with Japan. Taiwan was then still under
Japan's colonial rule.</P>
      <P>After World War II, Taiwan was returned to The Republic of
China's fold and the United States refurbished the building into the
official residence for its ambassador to the ROC. From 1953 through
1979, all US ambassadors lived in the building. When Richard Nixon
visited the ROC in his capacity as the US vice president in the
1950s, he also stayed in the building.</P>
      <P>The United States switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing in
1979 and sold the building back to the ROC's National Property
Bureau in 1982 for NT$250 million. In 1997, the Ministry of the
Interior designated the building as a third-class historical relic
and the Taipei City Hall took over the responsibility for restoring
the building last year.</P>
      <P>Lung Ying-tai, director of the Bureau of Cultural Affairs of the
Taipei City Hall, said the bureau will immediately begin planning
work and is scheduled to finalize all restoration projects by the
end of next year. If all goes smoothly, Lung said, the building will
be formally open to the public in early 2002 for cultural and
artistic activities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI CITY GOVERNMENT TO PROMOTE EDUCATION REFORM</HEADLINE>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei's city government will promote
pluralistic teaching, or the so-called "Taipei New Education," to
reduce high educational pressure on students, a city government
official said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Lee Hsi-chin, director of the Bureau of Education of the Taipei
city government, said he was very worried about the increasingly high
percentage of junior and senior high school students who have ever
been driven by stress to think of suicide.</P>
      <P>He said he will stimulate teachers and parents to change the way
that they evaluate children, so that students who perform well in
non-academic areas are also valued and praised.</P>
      <P>According to a survey of City Councilor Chen Hsueh-fen, 23
percent of third-grade students of junior and senior high schools
have thought of suicide because of educational pressure.
Frighteningly, 9.5 percent of those students admitted that they were
thinking of terminating their lives at the very time the survey was
conducted.</P>
      <P>More worrisome is the fact that 42.75 percent of the students
have ever thought of suicide for unknown reasons, said the city
councilor.</P>
      <P>Lee said his bureau will stimulate schools to organize more
activities like dance parties and athletic contests for children, so
that students who are interested and skilled in these areas can have
a chance to exhibit their skills, allowing them to enjoy life instead
of considering suicide.</P>
      <P>Lee added that teachers, parents, and society as a whole should
also change the way that they judge and value children. Children's
lives are about more than just appreciating only academic
performance, he said, adding that too much emphasis on academics
makes many children endure boring lives.</P>
      <P>He said his bureau is promoting actively "Taipei New Education"
and has invited teachers from more than 20 schools to participate in
a research camp on the new methodology.</P>

(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) is
closely watching the newly founded Chinese Communist psychological
warfare corps, a source with the MND said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Formed in response to President Lee Teng-hui's announcement last
July of his "special state-to-state" cross-Taiwan Strait relations
policy, the Communist psychological warfare corps is the first of its
kind in mainland China. It was formed last fall in Shenyang,
northeastern China, the source cited the mainland Chinese Liberation
Army Daily as saying.</P>
      <P>The report said that the corps is seen as experimental in its
initial stage, and is affiliated with the Shenyang Military Region.
It staged a live-fire exercise before Taiwan's March 18 presidential
election to test training effectiveness. Taiwan troops were used as
an imaginary enemy in the exercise.</P>
      <P>It was reported that Beijing authorities will establish another
psychological warfare corps in the Nanjing Military Region.</P>
      <P>The main task of the psychological warfare troops is to create
various propaganda materials and send them to enemy troops via
remote-control planes. The purpose is to deal a blow upon enemy
morale and incite defection among Taiwanese if war breaks out across
the Taiwan Strait, the report said.</P>
      <P>The source with the MND said the MND has kept abreast of new
developments of the Communist psychological warfare troops and will

    <HEADLINE>10 PERCENT OF TAIWAN PEOPLE THINK THEY ARE CHINESE: SEF SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hualien,  eastern  Taiwan,  April 21 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>According to long-term
research, the percentage of Taiwan people who think of themselves as
Chinese has dropped to a little more than 10 percent, said an
official in charge of cross-Taiwan Strait dealings on Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar held at the Hualien-based National Dong Hwa
University in which ten visiting academics from mainland China also
took part, Jan Jyh-horng, vice secretary-general of the semi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), said he is deeply worried about
the trend.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of a long-term SEF-commissioned poll on the
sensitive issue of the Taiwan public's ethnic identification, Jan
said the ratio among local residents who think they are both
Taiwanese and Chinese has fallen to just around 10 percent at present
from the 40 percent posted before 1994.</P>
      <P>According to Jan, the percentage has noticeably declined since
1994, when scores of tourists from Taiwan were burned to death on
board a sight-seeing boat in the Qiandao Lake of mainland China's
southeastern Zhejian province.</P>
      <P>The SEF has long postponed releasing the results of its
investigation for fear of stirring up controversy on the issue, Jan
noted.</P>
      <P>Turning to the danger of a potential military conflict between
Taiwan and mainland China, the SEF aide expressed his opinion that
war should be avoided because the people on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait wish to enjoy a better life and greater freedom.</P>
      <P>If either side unilaterally suspends the current boom in two-way
economic exchanges, it will damage the two sides at the same time, he
pointed out.</P>
      <P>As to the "one China" principle set by mainland China as the
precondition for rekindling cross-strait talks, Jan argued that the
"one China" framework must be further discussed now that Beijing
had claimed that the two sides can even talk about issues related to
the national flag and national designation.</P>
      <P>He asserted that Taiwan and mainland China should first put aside
their "one China" dispute and find ways to cooperate in order to
break the current impasse.</P>
      <P>As cross-strait financial flows have become so common, no
political party or leader on either side would risk cutting bilateral
relations, Jan stressed, claiming that there is no need to worry that
Taiwan and the mainland will become alienated from each other.</P>
      <P>Although negotiations between the SEF and its mainland Chinese
counterpart -- the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS) -- have been temporarily suspended, Jan said, the SEF is
fully prepared to reopen bilateral talks at any time, including
inviting ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Quoting SEF Chairman C.F. Koo, Jan said Koo is willing to visit
the mainland again should Wang not be able to travel to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Jan added that if the two sides cannot sit down and talk through
their problems, it is of no use for Beijing to put even more
preconditions forward.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  21 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's would-be-representative to Hong
Kong Chang Liang-jen might not get a visa or work permit from Hong
Kong's government after Taiwan refused to promise that Chang would
not act on behalf of the Taiwan government, said Lin Chong-pin, vice
chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council on Friday.</P>
      <P>Chang is slated to serve as the island's representative to Hong
Kong under the title of general manager of the Chung Hwa Travel
Service, Hong Kong. Hong Kong has requested Taipei to promise that he
would never directly or indirectly act as representative of Taiwan
government, said Lin.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong also wants Taiwan to guarantee that its representative
will not act in a manner or issue any statements whatsoever that
could be perceived by others as being made in the capacity of Taiwan
representative.</P>
      <P>Branding it the request as "very very" unreasonable, Lin said his
office has refused to follow Hong Kong's requirement, because it is
discriminatory and doesn't serve the interests of either side.</P>
      <P>But Hong Kong hasn't bulged in the dispute, said Lin.</P>
      <P>Chang was supposed to fill in the vacancy left by General Manager
of Chung Hwa Travel Service Cheng An-kuo, who returned to Taiwan late
last year after his work permit expired.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong government refused to renew Cheng's work permission
because he infuriated Beijing by defending Taiwan's demand for
statehood in an interview with a Hong Kong radio station.</P>
      <P>Lin said the Chung Hwa Travel Service began its operation before
Hong Kong was handed over to Beijing in 1997. He added that Cheng got
his work permit in 1995 after Taiwan promised that he would not act
in a manner incompatible to his status as general manager of Chung
Hwa Travel service, or do any harm to Hong Kong interests. Issuing
such a promise is normal diplomatic practice.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that the Hong Kong government under Beijing

British predecessor, said Lin.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-FINANCED SKOPJE EPZ COURTS INVESTORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Skopje,  April  21  (CNA)
(By Tony Fang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An export processing zone (EPZ) being
developed near the Macedonian capital of Skopje is courting
businesses from around the world to relocate their production lines
in the Eastern European country.</P>
      <P>The EPZ, located some 17 km from the capital, can serve as a
gateway to the huge Eastern European hinterland for manufacturers
whose overall costs will be 40 percent-60 percent lower if they set
up plants in Macedonia, said Lin Chi-wu, manager of the
Taiwanese-owned Skopje Development and Management Co.</P>
      <P>Under the development plan, the Skopje EPZ will be an industrial
complex covering 160 hectares. In the first of three development
stages, 25 slots, each occupying about 30 hectares of land, will be
developed to house small and medium-sized manufacturers, according to
Lin.</P>
      <P>Part of the infrastructure development of the EPZ, including a
500-meter long wall, has already been completed, and construction of
office buildings will soon kick off, Lin added.</P>
      <P>He recommended Macedonia as a good choice for investors from
Taiwan and other parts of the world, as general infrastructure and
social order are good, the people are warm, honest and hardworking,
and are generally skilled and well-educated, he noted.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lin admitted that some potential Taiwan investors
are still pondering factors that may keep them away from the Balkan
state. These factors include the geographic distance from Taiwan to
Macedonia which might contribute to a management "black hole," and
fact that the nearest seaport is located some 250 km away in Greece.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, some investors are also reluctant to move to
Macedonia because they lack an understanding of the complex religious
and ethnic situation in Macedonia, coupled with the fact that the
whole of Eastern Europe is a completely foreign area to them.</P>
      <P>Despite those factors, Lin stressed, Macedonia still is a good
choice for Taiwan and world investors, given that there are 100
million people living on the Balkan peninsula, and consumer goods
such as furniture and household electrical appliances are always in
high demand.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WINE MERCHANTS IN KAOHSIUNG TO CAMPAIGN AGAINST ALCOHOLISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  22  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of foreign wine merchants in
Kaohsiung City are forming a forum to raise public awareness about
alcoholism and preach moderate consumption of liquor, a forum
organizer said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>John McDonnell, a Briton who distributes alcohol in the southern
Taiwan city, said the non-profit Taiwan Beverage Alcohol Forum will
campaign for moderate alcohol consumption and combat the local binge
drinking culture which has become more of a problem in Taiwan with
the increased import of foreign alcohol.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the National Police Administration,
McDonnell said drunken driving has caused the deaths of more than
1,500 people in Taiwan since 1995, and more than 166,000 drivers were
ticketed by police for driving under the influence in 1999, compared
to 145,000 in the previous year.</P>
      <P>In Kaohsiung alone, McDonnell pointed out, 17,500 motorists were
stopped for drunken driving in 1999, and 991 of them were referred to
court for trial. The figures were 7,063 and 331, respectively, for
the first three months of this year.</P>
      <P>It might seem a paradox that alcohol distributors have to
convince their customers to drink less to sell more, but McDonnell
noted that moderate drinking is good for the health while heavy
drinking damages the body, gives alcohol a bad reputation and thus
hampers sales.</P>
      <P>Although alcoholism is not considered such a serious problem in
Taiwan as it is in the West, McDonnell said he is afraid it will soon
mushroom into a social problem in light of the local drinking culture
which encourages aggressive toasting and moronic drinking games
during social gatherings.</P>
      <P>McDonnell said his forum will cooperate with owners of local
restaurants and pubs to persuade their customers to practice
self-restraint in their drinking habits.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EUROPEANS IN TAIPEI MOST CONCERNED ABOUT TRAFFIC AND SIGNPOSTING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>European businesspeople residing in Taipei
feel the city needs to improve the cleanliness of its streets, the
enforcement of traffic laws and its road signs, according to a poll.</P>
      <P>The poll on quality of life in Taipei was conducted by the
European Council of Commerce &amp; Trade (ECCT), and targeted European
businesspeople currently residing in the city.</P>
      <P>The poll showed that up to 56 percent of the respondents believe
that road signs in several languages would have an immediate effect
on the quality of life in Taipei, showing that for those visitors who
cannot read Chinese, English translations for public facilities and
road signs need to be improved.</P>
      <P>The respondents also said that easier transportation (54 percent)
and leisure facilities (32 percent) would have most effect on the
quality of life in Taiwan's largest city.</P>
      <P>On measures that could best improve the quality of life in
Taipei, 88 percent of those polled said that tidier streets and
sidewalks is most important, followed by enforcement of traffic laws
(51 percent), and increased numbers of bilingual signs (32 percent).</P>
      <P>The poll seems to indicate that Europeans, who tend to enjoy a
high quality of life, are irritated by the untidy streets and the
haphazard parking of motorcycles on city sidewalks.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou and other Taipei City
Government officials, after listening to the suggestions of the ECCT
on Friday, vowed to improve the situation so that the quality of life
in Taipei can be put on a par with major world metropolises.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that the city government has responded to requests from
the foreign community about foreign broadcasting and now has BBC news
reports on Taipei Radio Station. He claimed that the city
government pays attention to the foreign voice, and said he hopes
that the ECCT will continue to offer its valuable suggestions.</P>
      <P>Chen Wei-jen, director of the Bureau of Urban Development, noted
that the 2.5 million square meters of the notorious red-tiled
pavement in Taipei have become an eyesore and cannot cope with the
use they receive. He said that the government is planning to
gradually revamp these areas by the end of 2002.</P>
      <P>The ECCT representatives also urged Ma to launch a traffic safety
campaign to curb drunken driving and other traffic violations rampant
in the city.</P>
      <P>They also pointed out that although the Taipei mass transit
system has clear English signs, the English translations for street
names are not uniform, which means that foreign visitors easily get
lost.</P>
      <P>Lin Cheng-hsiu, director of the Bureau of Civil Affairs, said
that a bilingual Taipei city map will be distributed prior to a
high-tech information congress in June, and added that the map will
be also accessible through the Internet.</P>
      <P>Ma instructed that all scheduled cultural and artistic activities
must be listed in a bilingual events brochure which must be subject
to regular revision and printed in English-language newspapers, so
that foreigners in Taipei can take part in the city's cultural
activities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GRAIN DEALERS PROTEST SKYROCKETING PRICE OF STICKY RICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  April  22  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Grain dealers in southern Taiwan
gathered in Kaohsiung City on Saturday to lodge a protest against the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) over the skyrocketing
price of sticky rice.</P>
      <P>The dealers accused the council of first failing to monitor the
supply-and-demand system for sticky rice islandwide and then failing
to come up with measures to cope with rising prices.</P>
      <P>The retail price for the local favorite used to make "tsungtzu"
rice dumplings has risen to NT$220 per dou (about 6.9 kg) since early
this year due to a shortage of domestic supply, and the price is
expected to skyrocket to some NT$500 per dou with the approach of
Dragon Boat Festival, the traditional time of year to eat the sticky
treats.</P>
      <P>The dealers' representatives said an even-larger scale
demonstration will be staged in Taipei on May 20 to vent their
indignation with the government. May 20 is also the date of
President-elect Chen Shui-bian's inauguration.</P>
      <P>They said the government failed to recognize the crisis of a
possible shortage of sticky rice four years ago when many farmers
stopped planting it because the wholesale price was too low to be
profitable. Since then. the drastic domestic shortfall has seen the
price surge to reflect the shortage, gradually increasing to NT$200
per dou.</P>
      <P>While failing to perceive the shortage, the government was caught
unprepared for the sudden price surge with the approach of the Dragon
Boat Festival.</P>
      <P>With prices skyrocketing, all the government has done is to order
the rice to be imported, which the dealers said is rubbing salt into
their wounds. They pointed out that the dealers and farmers are now
being forced to swallow the bitter fruit of poor government policy
and bad management.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLARS AGREE EXCHANGES NEEDED TO BREAK CROSS-STRAIT STALEMATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  22  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Scholars from both sides of the Taiwan
Strait agreed in a seminar on Saturday that cross-Taiwan Strait
exchanges will be a major step toward breaking the cross-strait
stalemate.</P>
      <P>The seminar, sponsored by a local foundation, was presided over
by Prof. Chao Chun-shan of National Chengchi University, with
foundation officials and professors participating. A six-member
mainland China delegation headed by Yu Keli, deputy director of the
Taiwan Research Institute under the China Academy of Social Sciences,
also took part.</P>
      <P>During the closed-door seminar, the Beijing scholars showed a
very keen interest in the lineup of the new Cabinet of
President-elect Chen Shui-bian, which has been largely filled one
month after the March 18 presidential election that saw an end to
more than five decades of Kuomintang rule of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Taipei scholars said that the disruption of high-ranking
cross-strait exchanges have resulted in the loss of a communication
channel for the leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, which
they said has interfered with the normal development of cross-strait
trade.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait exchanges were suspended by Beijing in retaliation
for President Lee Teng-hui's statement last July that cross-strait
ties are "a special state-to-state relationship."</P>
      <P>Yu said that whatever political situation develops, the promotion
of cross-strait trade, cultural, educational and agricultural
exchanges will continue.</P>
      <P>He also said that his delegation will not meet with
soon-to-be-ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) officials during
the trip, though media reports had leaked news of a proposed secret
meeting with Yen Wan-ching, director of the DPP's Department of
Chinese Affairs, leading to the cancellation of the meeting.</P>
      <P>Yu, who had advocated "one China" principle espoused by Beijing
since his arrival here on Wednesday, was criticized for forgetting
how to behave as a guest, to which Yu retorted somewhat angrily that
he was only exercising his freedom of speech.</P>
      <P>Yu has already visited officials from the newly formed People
First Party, the New Party, and the pro-Chinese unification group The
Association for the Promotion of Peaceful Unification between the two
Sides of the Taiwan Strait, but had kept his distance from the
pro-independence DPP.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO REMAIN ON US SPECIAL 301 WATCH LIST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  21 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China will remain on
this year's Special 301 watch list to be unveiled by the Clinton
administration on May 1, trade sources said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The decision was made during an inter-ministerial meeting held
earlier this week, the sources said, adding that the meeting was
attended by officials from the office of the US Trade Representative
(USTR), the Department of Commerce, the Customs Service, and the
Department of State.</P>
      <P>The USTR is scheduled to unveil the annual Special 301 list and
Super 301 list simultaneously on May 1. The Special 301 list targets
major US trade partners who allegedly fail to properly protect
intellectual property rights (IPR), while the Super 301 list targets
countries which have allegedly imposed unfair trade barriers against
US products.</P>
      <P>A Clinton administration official told CNA that as ROC Economics
Minister Wang Chih-kang has actively promoted IPR protection and
intensely carried out anti-counterfeiting crackdown, there is no
justifiable reason for putting Taiwan on the more serious "priority
watch list" this year as had been suggested by some US computer
companies.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the official said the Clinton administration cannot
accept the ROC's request that it be taken off the watch list, because
Taipei has yet to resolve some IPR protection problems.</P>
      <P>When USTR officials visited Taipei late last month, they asked
Taiwan to resolve some patent lawsuit-related disputes and to require
its microchip makers to identify wafer OEM foundries and CD-ROM disc
sources.</P>
      <P>The official said that although some American companies,
including DRAM maker Micron Technology Inc., have demanded that
Taiwan be included in this year's Super 301 watch list, the Clinton
administration has ruled out that possibility.</P>
      <P>"Since the two sides reached an agreement in 1998 on Taiwan's
market opening and trade barrier removal plans during their talks on
terms for Taiwan's entry to the World trade Organization, we see no
need to place Taiwan on the Super 301 list this year," the official
noted.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's tourism promoters are
running advertisements in Tokyo and other major Japanese cities in a
bid to attract older Japanese women tourists following a decline in
the number of Japanese tourists in 1998.</P>
      <P>The Australian Tourist Commission (ATC) reported that the number
of Japanese tourists, the biggest source of tourism for Australia,
plunged to just over 700,000 in 1999 from a record high of more than
800,000 in 1997.</P>
      <P>ATC officials said the major factor behind the decision to
attract older Japanese women is because women aged over 50 years old
tend to be active and younger at heart than their younger
counterparts. In addition, they are more sophisticated and more
experienced.</P>
      <P>Above all, these middle-aged women are more affluent, and their
husbands are at the age of retiring and can afford to travel
overseas, they said.</P>
      <P>Australia is now competing fiercely with Hawaii to lure tourists
from Japan, they added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is a model for intellectual
property rights (IPR) protection, a senior Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) official said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lu Wen-hsiang, deputy director of the MOEA's Intellectual
Property Rights Bureau, was responding to reports from Washington,
D.C. that the Clinton administration will continue placing Taiwan on
the US Special 301 watch list this year for alleged failure to
eliminate IPR infringement.</P>
      <P>Lu said the US decision is unfair to Taiwan because the Republic
of China government has spared no efforts to crack down on
commercial piracy and copyright infringement and has achieved
remarkable results.</P>
      <P>On Friday alone, Lu said law enforcement officers managed to
crack 26 copyright infringement cases and bring to justice 27 people
suspected of involvement in those cases. Moreover, NT$550 million
(US$18.03 million) worth counterfeit goods and pirated software
programs and video game discs were confiscated in those cases.</P>
      <P>Under the IPR bureau's anti-counterfeiting "K Plan", Lu said a
total of 277 suspects involved in 257 commercial piracy cases had
been broken and NT$1.85 billion worth of counterfeit goods seized as
of March 31 this year.</P>
      <P>Lu said the US delegates to the ROC-US IPR protection meeting
held in Taipei in late March had lauded Taiwan's achievements in
anti-counterfeiting operations and IPR protection.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Lu said he hopes that the Clinton
administration will delete Taiwan from the annual Special 301 watch
list this year.</P>
      <P>The office of the US Trade Representative is scheduled to unveil
the annual Special 301 list on May 1, which targets major US trade

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 22 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The newly founded People First Party (PFP)
called for a halt in revamping the Constitution by the National
Assembly (NA) on Saturday, branding the draft amendments
unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>In a press conference held by the PFP caucuses in the Legislative
Yuan and the National Assembly (NA), the party founded by former
Taiwan Provincial Governor James Soong called on the assemblymen to
stop tinkering with the Constitution in light of the fact that there
is less than one month to go before their tenures expire.</P>
      <P>Kao Pao-hua, a spokesman for the PFP caucus in the NA, dismissed
as undemocratic a proposal worked out by the two major parties -- the
Kuomintang and the Democratic Progressive Party -- to make the NA a
forum of delegates appointed by political parties under a system of
proportional representation.</P>
      <P>Noting that only one-tenth of the population has registered as a
member of any political party, Kao warned that the voices of the
other ninth-tenths of the people would be excluded from the NA if
such a system were to be adopted.</P>
      <P>Under the dominance of the KMT and the DPP, Kao said, the revamp
of the Constitution has degenerated into mere horse-trading between
the two parities. Between them, they have stymied any sensible debate
through procedural maneuvering, and have failed to solicit public
opinion on issues regarding the amendments.</P>
      <P>He criticized the two parties' plan to vote out the NA and
downgrade it to an ad hoc assembly as a political plot to prevent the
PFP from flexing its political muscle in a NA election.</P>
      <P>Kao said his party members will boycott the second reading of the
draft Constitutional amendments to protest the two parties'
"manipulation" of the constitutional reform process.</P>
      <P>The PFP will rejoin the session to support an amendment
guaranteeing the rights of military personnel and another calling for
a majority vote for the presidential election winners. Under the
current system, the election is decided on a first-past-the-post
system.</P>

      <P>President-elect Chen Shui-bian's
administration should not sacrifice the existing "no haste, be
patient" government policy on mainland China-bound investment, a
National Taiwan University economics professor said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on policy and strategy for the new century,
Prof. Chen Po-chih said the incoming government should not drop the
"no haste" or "go slow" mainland investment policy simply because of
token goodwill responses from Beijing.</P>
      <P>President-elect Chen said previously that if Beijing responds
with goodwill to Taiwan's calls for an end to saber-rattling and for
resumption of regular dialogue, his administration will review
Taiwan's "go slow" mainland investment policy.</P>
      <P>However, Prof. Chen said his call is based not on political

percent, the scholar pointed out that Taiwan's excess national
savings make up only 2 percent of the GDP.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Chen said that if local businessmen swarm
to invest in the mainland, domestic investment will certainly be
affected and might even be squeezed out.</P>
      <P>More important, Chen went on, both sides of the Taiwan Strait
will be admitted to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in the near
future, at which time Taiwan will have to compete with the mainland
on an unequal footing.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan's current economic strength, Chen said Taiwan is
finding it hard to meet the WTO's requirement for "zero tariff"
trade. In contrast, Chen said, mainland China, with its immense land
area, rich natural resources and cheap labor, is in a much stronger
position to conduct "zero tariff" trade.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Chen said, the new ROC government should still impose
some restrictions on local enterprises' investment activities in
mainland China, including limiting the lines of business they can
pursue and capping of amount of investment to be allowed for each
project.</P>
      <P>Some media reports have tipped the professor as the probable new
chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development in the new administration, but he dismissed the reports
as sheer speculation.</P>
      <P>Judging from the new Cabinet line-up confirmed on Friday, Chen
said he is worried that the new government lacks a strong team of
experts to resolve the many thorny economic and financial problems
Taiwan now faces.</P>
      <P>He suggested that after assuming office on May 20, the new
Cabinet ministers should reduce their speaking and social engagements
in order to devote more of their energies to inter-ministerial
coordination and communication to ensure smooth teamwork and upgraded
operational efficiency.</P>
      <P>Chen, an anti-nuclear activist, further suggested that as the
outgoing Kuomintang government has spent over NT$100 billion on the
controversial fourth nuclear power plant project, the new government
should not hastily suspend the construction project but should
instead conduct a comprehensive review before deciding whether to
kill or continue the construction project.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ENVIRONMENTAL MISERY INDEX RISES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's environmental misery index has
risen to 77.98 points over the past year, according to the results of
a Gallup opinion poll released on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The results of the survey commissioned by the private
Environmental Quality Protection Foundation (EQPF) were released to
coincide with the World Earth Day.</P>
      <P>This is the sixth consecutive year that the foundation has
conducted the annual environmental misery index survey with a view to
understanding local people's feelings about their living environment.</P>
      <P>The survey results show that this year's misery index is the
second highest, behind only 1995's 78.72-point index.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 80 percent of the respondents felt that
vehicle exhaust, river pollution and rampant overuse of plastic
containers are the most serious or intolerable environmental issues.</P>
      <P>EQPF Secretary-General Liu Ming-lung said the rise in this year's
misery index is mainly because local people have become more worried
about pollution caused by household waste water, waste plastic
containers, poor water and soil conservation, noise pollution and bad
smells.</P>
      <P>Of the 20 categories of environmental issues measured in the
survey, only wildlife protection shows significant progress, with
more respondents feeling that the killing of endangered species in
Taiwan has declined.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey of 1,003 adult residents was conducted
between April 15 and April 20.</P>
      <P>The poll found that most respondents believe that reform-minded
Chen Shui-bian's election as the Republic of China's next president
will contribute positively to Taiwan's future environmental
protection work.</P>
      <P>However, the poll results also show that Chen's campaign promises
to cancel the controversial fourth nuclear power plant project and
oppose the proposed construction of a dam in Kaohsiung County's
Meinung township have not received majority support.</P>
      <P>Since more than half of those surveyed do not support Chen's
proposals to suspend construction of the fourth nuclear power plant
and the Meinung dam, Liu said Chen should not deliver on his campaign
promises on the two issues after he assumes office.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-BORN JAPANESE IMPERIAL ARMY VETERAN FINDS FAME AFTER 50 YRS (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  April 23 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chien Mao-sung, 75, is a native Taiwanese
who served in former Japanese imperial army during World War Two, and
he is now living in Japan with special permanent resident status.</P>
      <P>Chien drove a taxi for 30 years in Tokyo, but has recently found
fame through a book about his life, entitled "I was a Japanese
Soldier," which is now selling well in Japan.</P>
      <P>Chien was born in the township of Tucheng, in northern Taiwan's
Taipei County. When he was 17 years old, he was recruited into a
special unit of the Japanese imperial army. He was sent to Borneo
where he served as a guard in a prisoner of war (POW) detainment camp
at Kuching.</P>
      <P>Later, he formally joined the Japanese imperial army as a
private. But when Japan was defeated by allied forces led by the
United States, Chien found himself sentenced to a five-year prison
term in Australia.</P>
      <P>He served the complete sentence, only to be forcefully
expatraited from Australia on March 3, 1951. Considering himself to
be a Japanese citizen, he decided to go to Japan. He says that he can
never forget the day he entered Japan, because an immigration officer
told him that he was no longer a Japanese citizen. The official asked
why he had not returned to Taiwan, and then issued him a temporary
visitor's visa.</P>
      <P>Chien was shocked by the immigration official's action. The
realization of the sudden abandonment of his "motherland" left him
feeling hopeless and helpless.</P>
      <P>Being stripped of his Japanese citizenship had grave consequences
for him. Despite his years of military service, he would not be able
to receive his military pension, back-pay still owed to him. He was
even denied access to his military post deposits. At the time, he
didn't have enough money to return to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>After this event, he decided to abandon his Japanese surname --
"Takenaka" -- and restored his original Chinese surname. He swore
that he would not leave Japan and would not naturalize until the
Japanese government apologized to him and paid him the money they
owed him.</P>
      <P>Chien said he was carrying a letter written by Gen. Hitoshi
Imamura who served in prison with Chien in Australia. Gen. Imamura
had promised to him that the Japanese government would treat him as a
Japanese citizen.</P>
      <P>In Gen. Imamura's letter, which was published by the Japanese
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in June 1998, the general reminded the
Japanese government to give the same treatment to Taiwan-born former
Japanese imperial army soldiers as that given to ethnic Japanese
veterans.</P>
      <P>Chien ran away from the reception center that the immigration
officials had ordered him to inhabit. He became a drifter, and
wandered from place to place seeking employment. For the next 50
years, he worked as a tailor or taxi driver.</P>
      <P>Asked why he did not return to Taiwan, as he now still holds a
passport of the Republic of China, he replied that he was afraid of
Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang (KMT), which oppressed ethnic Taiwanese
after the so-called "Feb. 28 Incident" occurred in 1947. Relatives in
Taiwan also dissuaded him from returning there, he said. (more)</P>

      <P>However, an forgettable thing occurred in 1972, when was at the
age of 37. He and some 30 Taiwan-born Imperial Army veterans in Japan
wrote a letter to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in 1972, asking the
President to help them seek compensation from the Japanese
government, and described the unfair treatment they had recieved in
Japan.</P>
      <P>He was surprised when President Chiang responnded by summoning
him along with two other letter writters to come to Chungshan Hall at
Yangminshan in surburban Taipei, he recalled.</P>
      <P>Chiang also explained why he implemented a policy of benevolence
toward Japan after World War Two.</P>
      <P>He and his two colleagues has high priase for the late
president's benevolence policy, and described him as a far-sighted
stateman. Chien believes that Japan could never have risen from the
rubble of war to become a major world economic power if it were not
for Chiang Kai-shek's benovolence policy</P>
      <P>Four year ago, the god of good luck finally knocked on his door.
Hiroichi Hamazaki, a Yomiuri Shimbun reporter, flagged down his taxi
for a ride. After hearing Chien's story, the journalist decided to
write a book about the unfiar treatment Chien had received in Japan.
The book titled "I was a Japanese soldier," was releasd in March.
Chien has since become a minor celebrity in Japan.</P>
      <P>The Japanese ruling Liberal Democratic Party is now planning to
draft legislation to pay up to four million Japanese yen to families
of deceased soldiers. But this law will exclude Chien abd many of his
fellow countrymen.</P>
      <P>He says that he has recently begun to wonder wether he will
ever receive compensation from the Japanese government, as he will
turn 76 soon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EARLY MOVE TO UNIFICATION TALKS NOT IN TAIWAN'S INTERESTS: KMT OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Kuomintang (KMT) official said on Sunday
that if the two sides of the Taiwan Strait move too quickly to begin
negotiations on reunification, it will not be in the interests of the
people or conform to their aspirations.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, director-general of the KMT Department of
Mainland Affairs Research, was responding to President-elect Chen
Shui-bian's recent remarks about the possible direction of
cross-strait relations, including federation, confederation or even
commonwealth.</P>
      <P>Chang said that as national leader, Chen should forego advocating
Taiwan independence, and thus avoid a war with the mainland. But he
also said that starting cross-strait talks on unification too early
would not be beneficial.</P>
      <P>Chang said that a federation can have only one central government
and one constitution, and the sovereign status of the Republic of
China would surely disappear under such a model.</P>
      <P>Chen has not considered the wishes of Taiwan's public in this
regard, Chang said.</P>
      <P>As for confederation, a structure formed by two or more political
entities that remain as separate sovereign states, Chang said
Beijing's current policy would not allow for such a model. He added
that Beijing would certainly not allow a commonwealth arrangement, as
it would be an even looser formation.</P>
      <P>But Chang said that the most important point is not which
reunification model Beijing deems acceptable, but rather whether
Chen's administration can forge a national consensus, uphold Taiwan
interests, and win international recognition.</P>
      <P>He noted that after Chen's victory in the March 18 presidential
election, his handling of cross-strait relations has been "too rash".
Chang urged Chen to follow President Lee Teng-hui's example of
tenacity and resilience in handling cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>In addition to moderating what he sees as Chen's rash mentality,
Chang said that Chen should also avoid taking the naive approach of
playing his cards -- such as the "three direct links" card -- too
quickly. He said that Chen should maintain a strong stance in dealing
with cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>He noted that Chen has refrained from talking about "special
state-to-state relations" since winning the election. He said that
this may lead Beijing to think that it could pressure Chen to bend to
its will.</P>
      <P>Chen has also said that establishing the "three direct links"
with mainland China will be a major goal of his administration, but
Chang said Beijing may very well turn a deaf ear to Chen's call.
Though Chen could blame Beijing for such an attitude, it would also
show that Chen lacks a full understanding of cross-strait relations,
Chang added.</P>
      <P>Chen said on Friday that there is room for discussion in forming
a "confederation" between the two sides of the Taiwan strait to take
the place of "special state-to-state relations."</P>
      <P>High-ranking cross-strait exchanges were disrupted after mainland
China reacted angrily to President Lee Teng-hui's statement defining
"special state-to-state" relations across the Taiwan Strait in July
1999.</P>
      <P>Chen also said on Saturday that as long as the "one China"
principle is not set as precondition of cross-strait talks, then
there is ample room for discussion on ties, including confederation,
federation, or commonwealth, but that the final decision would be
made by the 23 million people in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has deep-rooted misgivings about Chen because of
his membership in the Democratic Progressive Party, which has in the
past advocated Taiwan independence. Nevertheless, Beijing has toned
down its verbal attack against Chen and adopted a "wait and see"
attitude in the wake of the election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER US OFFICIAL VISITS PFP CHAIRMAN JAMES SOONG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  23  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former US Assistant Secretary for East
Asian and Pacific Affairs Winston Lord on Sunday visited People First
Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong to exchange opinions on the
situation across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lord declined to comment following the hour-long meeting, while
Soong told reporters that the major purpose of Lord's visit to the
PFP was to gain a better understanding of party views on relations
between Taiwan and mainland China in the wake of Taiwan's March 18
presidential election.</P>
      <P>As the former US official is very concerned about the future of
Taiwan-mainland China ties, Soong said they had swapped opinions on
issues related to the "one China" principle and the Guidelines for
National Unification.</P>
      <P>Although Soong was reluctant to quote what Lord had said during
their meeting, he pointed out that Taiwan's viewpoint on the present
cross-strait situation differs from that of the United States and
other countries.</P>
      <P>The PFP chairman said that the international community thinks
that the relationship between Taiwan and mainland China has come to a
very critical juncture, and that Lord had suggested that the two
sides should hammer out an appropriate solution to ease current
tensions.</P>
      <P>According to Soong, he told Lord that he is very much aware of
the escalating tensions across the Taiwan Strait and that the new
government to be led by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) must
take effective measures to ease the situation.</P>
      <P>The people of Taiwan are not willing to succumb to Beijing's
rule, nor do they wish to engage in war with mainland China, Soong
explained. He stressed that any move which might affect Taiwan's
future must be decided by the island's 21 million people. This goes
along with "the mainstream opinion among the people of Taiwan," he
emphasized.</P>
      <P>Turning to Lord's questions about the direction that
President-elect Chen Shui-bian might set in his inaugural speech on
May 20, Soong asserted that the DPP must first learn how to act as a
responsible ruling party by avoiding making irresponsible statements
and mudslinging against members of other political camps.</P>
      <P>"Maybe each political party has different points of view from
others, but we should join forces to fight for the country's common
interests to fall in line with the public's expectations," he told
Lord.</P>
      <P>As Lord will proceed to mainland China after concluding his visit
here, Soong also called on the Beijing leadership not to
underestimate the determination of the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Lord is heading a four-member delegation that also includes
Douglas Paal, a former member of the US National Security Council
(NSC) and current head of the Asia Pacific Policy Center; George
Schwab, president of a the National Committee on American Foreign
Policy (NCAFP); and Professor Donald Zagoria, a senior NCAFP member
and also a former member of the NSC.</P>
      <P>The delegation arrived in Taipei late Saturday for a three-day
fact-finding visit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOUTHERN MAINLAND CHINA UNDERSTANDS TAIWAN BETTER: DPP OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator of the Democratic Progressive
Party said on Sunday that southern region of mainland China has a
deeper understanding of Taiwan due to long-established trade
relations.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsu Jung-shu said that because of this understanding,
people in the southern region of China do not interpret the March 18
election of the DPP's Chen Shui-bian as a bid for Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>Hsu had just returned from a e-commerce forum in Guangzhou,
Guangdong Province, in the southeastern part of the mainland. She was
the first legislator from the DPP to travel to the mainland since
Taiwan's presidential election which saw the end of Kuomintang's
rule of the island for more than five decades.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that during her stay she learned that people in southern
China do not interpret Chen's victory as a bid by the Taiwan public
to push for independence from mainland China. This is despite the
fact that Beijing has consistently maintained that the "one China"
principle be a pre-condition for renewed cross-strait talks in the
wake of the election.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that the economy in northern China is behind that of the
southern part, especially in the northwestern region where living
conditions are poor and trade relations with Taiwan minimal. Without
such links to provide a basis for understanding, she said that people
there are more likely to see Chen's election as a bid for
independence, adding fuel to the hawkish rhetoric from the mainland.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that the mainland's southerners know that Taiwan is a
place where people enjoy freedom of speech, and that if there is a
call for independence or for unification, it will only be possible
after a national consensus is forged.</P>
      <P>She also said that though Chen's new administration has yet to
confer with DPP members on cross-strait exchanges, she believes that
Taiwan could increase trade and cultural exchanges with the mainland,
saying that this is the best way for both sides to develop
long-standing relations.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who said her group was well received during the recent
visit, will again visit the mainland in September when she will
attend an international conference in Beijing.</P>

      <P>A Kaohsiung medical group has lodged a
complaint against the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) in
Argentina. The group claims that TECO did not protect its member

      <P>A spokesman for the group told local press that they attempted to

immigration officials denied them entrance into Argentina.</P>
      <P>TECO in Buenos Aires, which represents the Republic of China in

      <P>The government has distributed a total of
NT$78.57 billion in subsidies to 618,000 elderly farmers and
fishermen as of the end of March this year, the Cabinet-level Council
of Agriculture (COA) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The COA said that in order to strengthen the work of caring for
elderly farmers and fishermen, it plans to establish extensive
information centers and recreational facilities for them.</P>
      <P>The COA began accepting applications for subsidies from elderly
farmers and fishermen in August 1995.</P>
      <P>At present, there are 481,200 farmers who are at or above the age
of 65, accounting for 12.9 percent of total agricultural workers on
the island, a sign that Taiwan's agriculture workforce as a whole is
gradually aging.</P>
      <P>The COA's future information centers for elderly farmers and
fishermen will provide them with health care and other welfare
measures, the agency said.</P>
      <P>The COA plans to select 50 sites for various recreation
facilities for elderly farmers and fishermen, it said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA URGED TO STOP SMUGGLING OF WEAPONS TECHNOLOGY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bangkok,  April 23 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China has become a major source
of illegal international arms and weapons technology and should take
more effective action against suspected arms smugglers, a leading
Bangkok-based English newspaper urged in its editorial on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chinese-made arms have been found in Iraq, Libya and Angola, all
of which are under UN arms sanctions, the Bangkok Post said. It added
that arms-related money laundering threatens to corrupt and weaken
mainland China, and illegal arms dealing threatens the peace of the
world.</P>
      <P>The Post reminded China's leaders that in recent years arms
merchants and smuggling rings in China are now regularly making "the
biggest illegal arms deals" in the world.</P>
      <P>"They have established companies and offices deep within the
actual Chinese government," the paper said. It added that many of the
big-time arms smugglers operate with the intentional or unwitting
help of the central and regional governments of mainland China.

    <HEADLINE>INTERNET SURFERS HAIL CHEN'S CAPACITY TO HANDLE CIVILIAN ISSUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  23 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Most Taiwan's Internet surfers give high
ratings to President-elect Chen Shui-bian's ability to handle
civilian issues, while they are somewhat reserved about his dealings
of cross-strait ties, a recent survey has found.</P>
      <P>According to the results released on Sunday by Gallop's 24th poll
of Internet users, 84.5 percent of the respondents think that Chen
will be able to upgrade the government's efficiency, while 65.1
percent are confident of Chen's ability to maintain political
stability in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At the same time, 64.1 percent said they believe that Taiwan's
booming economy will continue to prosper under Chen's leadership, and
63.3 percent said they are supportive of point-to-point direct
shipping links between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>However, only 51.5 percent of the public think that Chen will be
able to reform Taiwan's money-dominated political culture, as opposed
to 42.4 percent who expect that he will be able to bring about
reform, the survey indicated.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmaker Shen Fu-hsiung and
Gallop executive T. Y. Ting attributed the surfing public's lower
rating of Chen's ability to end money politics in Taiwan to a lack of
faith in the government's capability to get rid of the deep-rooted
problem overnight.</P>
      <P>The DPP is to take the helm of the central government on May 20.</P>
      <P>On the question of military conflicts with mainland China, 47.3
percent of the Internet users said that they expect he will
definitely be able to maintain peace across the Taiwan Strait, while
42.7 percent said that he will not be able to avoid military
conflict, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>In contrast, 72.3 percent of those website surfers predicted that
it is very likely that Chen will be able to maintain peace in the
strait, much higher than 19.7 percent who said they do not believe it
is likely.</P>
      <P>UFO radio station chairman and political analyst S. K. Chao said
that the results of the former question reflect the degree of the
public's confidence in Chen's ability to deal with cross-strait
problems, while those of the latter question indicate the public's
thoughts on the possibility of war between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that Chen is determined to duly address
cross-strait disputes, Chao explained that the overall environment
between the two sides is beyond Chen's control.</P>
      <P>Judging from Chen's cautious attitude toward cross-strait
relations following his election on March 18 as Taiwan's new
president, Chao predicted that the president-elect will continue to
adopt a low-profile approach and that two-way Taiwan-mainland links
will continue to be "cold" over the short term.</P>
      <P>Chao said that it is hard to predict long-term developments at
present, although he feels there will be no military conflict between
Taiwan and mainland China in the short term.</P>

      <P>All 73 passengers and six crew members
aboard a Far Eastern Air Transport Corp. plane were reported safe
after the MD82 plane skidded off the runway at an airport in southern
Taiwan on Monday morning.</P>
      <P>A Far Eastern spokesperson said flight No.28011 took off from
Taipei in northern Taiwan at 6:40 a.m. When landing at Chiayi Airport
at 7:30 a.m. amid heavy rain, the plane skidded a few meters off the
runway before coming to a full stop.</P>
      <P>Far Eastern officials believe the downpour which made the runway
very slippery at the time was the main reason for the accident.</P>
      <P>Because of the incident, Chiayi Airport was temporarily shut
down, and passengers were either transferred to the nearby Tainan
airport or were forced to use rail transportation instead.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Aviation Safety Council under the Executive Yuan
has sent investigators to Chiayi to investigate the incident and will
return with the black boxes -- flight data recorder and cockpit voice
recorder -- for analysis on Monday night.</P>
      <P>Council Managing Director Kay Jong said that although the plane
landed during heavy rains, it had a visibility of one kilometer at
the time, adding that determining whether the accident was caused by
mechanical failure or by human error will have to wait until the
two black boxes are analyzed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING MILITARY THREAT MOUNTING: DEFENSE MINISTER-DESIGNATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  24  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Defense Minister-designate Wu Shih-wen
said on Monday that Taiwan's defensive situation has become
increasingly trying amid the mounting military threat from mainland
China and the continued restrictions on Taiwan's weapon purchases.</P>
      <P>Wu, incumbent vice defense minister, said Taiwan's military is
facing escalating pressure as China keeps increasing its purchases of
advanced weaponry while the island is seeing no improvements in its
ability to acquire more advanced defensive weapons.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while fielding questions at the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>Wu was recently appointed by Premier-designate Tang Fei to
replace him as defense minister. Wu's promotion is believed to be due
to the fact that his views on the new defense laws are almost
identical to Tang's.</P>
      <P>Both Wu and Tang support the implementation of the
recently-passed twin laws on defense -- the combat preparedness law
and the Ministry of National Defense organization law.</P>
      <P>Premier-designated Tang has said that one of the reasons he
accepted President-elect Chen Shui-bian's offer to become premier was
that he, a keen supporter of the twin laws, wanted to see to it that
the newly-approved laws, which face considerable obstacles in the
military's rank and file, are carried out smoothly.</P>
      <P>Under the new laws, the combat system will be put under the
jurisdiction of the Ministry of National Defense (MND). The chief of
the General Staff, who previously made direct reports to the
president, will report instead to the defense minister.</P>
      <P>The general headquarters of each of the three branches of the
armed forces will also be downgraded to headquarters of command under
the jurisdiction of the MND.</P>
      <P>Under the new laws, all military personnel, including the chief
of General Staff, will make reports to the defense minister, who
alone will report directly to the premier and the president.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu noted that the MND has recently established an
exclusive recruitment center in order to attract more young people to
join the military.</P>
      <P>Wu shunned questions on whether the ROC Air Force was presently
facing severe jet fighter pilot and co-pilot shortages of as much as
35 percent.</P>
      <P>Wu also played dumb when asked to comment on reports that the
French business conglomerate Matra Group is reportedly cooperating
with the ROC on establishing a missile maintenance hub in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu said all he knows on the subject is what he has read in
newspaper reports, adding that he personally would welcome plans for
such a cooperation, which he said would greatly reduce transportation
costs to Taiwan for its missile maintenance.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'ONE CHINA, DIFFERENT DEFINITION' NOT A PRINCIPLE: KMT OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  24  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The "one China, different definition"
concept is not a principle for negotiation across the Taiwan Strait,
a senior official of the Kuomintang, which will soon end its 55-year
rule of Taiwan, said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, director of the KMT's Mainland Affairs Research
Department, made the remarks after meeting with Yu Keli, deputy
director of the Institute of Taiwan Studies under the Beijing-based
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS).</P>
      <P>Chang said the "one China" concept is the core of
cross-strait issue, adding he has learned from his hour-long talks
with Yu that mainland China is unlikely to compromise on its
so-called "one China" principle which sees one China as the "People's
Republic of China" and Taiwan is a province of the PRC.</P>
      <P>Chang said the KMT government has responded to Beijing's
"one China" principle with a "one China, different definition"
concept, which allows each side of the Taiwan Strait to have its own
definition of "one China."</P>
      <P>The KMT government supports the concept that there is only one
China, but it insists that China is now separately ruled by two
equal governments -- the Republic of China government on Taiwan and
the PRC government on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chang further pointed out that the KMT's "one China, different
definition" concept emphasizes its content. "The KMT does not deem
the concept as a principle for cross-strait engagement as Beijing
has insisted," he noted.</P>
      <P>Chang claimed that this "one China, different definition"
concept has allowed the KMT government to maintain the ROC's
sovereign status while developing relations with mainland China in
the past decade.</P>
      <P>Chang said Beijing authorities have recently tightened its "one
China" principle and hardly left any flexibility on its stance.
Chang said Beijing's hardline attitude toward the issue is a crucial
problem the incoming government of the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) must face and tackle.</P>
      <P>Chang said he doesn't know whether Beijing's hardening
of its stance on "one China" principle results from its
"no confidence" in the incoming DPP government. The DPP used to
support Taiwan independence, but has now softened this aspect of its
party platform.</P>
      <P>Chang suggested that the DPP government adopt the KMT's "one
China, different definition" concept which he said mainland China
may not fully agree, but will help forge domestic consensus and win
recognition in the international community.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Yu's hardline rhetoric concerning the "one China"
principle during his stay here, Chang said Yu is an academic and
that his remarks cannot be interpreted as Beijing's official stance.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chang said he believes his meeting with Yu will
contribute to the promotion of cross-strait mutual understanding.</P>
      <P>Yu arrived in Taipei last Wednesday at head of a delegation of
researchers from the CASS's Institute of Taiwan Studies for a
fact-finding visit.</P>
      <P>While Yu said his mission is mainly aimed at promoting exchanges
with major Taiwan political parties and groups, he has declined to
meet with officials of the DPP, the ROC's would-be ruling party.</P>
      <P>In the past few days, Yu have met with officials of the People
First Party, the New Party and the KMT, as well as with
executives of certain pro-unification groups here. The mainland
delegation traveled to Kaohsiung on Monday afternoon to continue its
Taiwan visit.</P>

    <DATELINE>Johannesburg,  April  23  (CNA)
(By J.S. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The arrival of Communist Chinese
President Jiang Zemin on a state visit Monday again highlights the
contradiction between South Africa's professed human rights foreign
policy and its pursuit of national interests, pointed out two South
African scholars in an article published in the weekly Sunday
Independent.</P>
      <P>Director of Studies of the South African Institute of
International Affairs Elizabeth Sidiropoulos and Taiwan Asia-Pacific
Researcher of the institute Monika Glinzler said that given South
Africa's human rights emphasis, there has always been an expectation
that Pretoria would be more vocal on this issue.</P>
      <P>They said that the tide is turning in international relations
towards recognizing the supremacy of basic human rights over
sovereignty where a state undermines such rights.</P>
      <P>South African President Thabo Mbeki's African renaissance places
great importance on human rights and good governance, the two
scholars said.</P>
      <P>As part of the developing world and with a ruling party that has
had historical links with China, it is in a better position than the
US to impress on China the need for reform to avoid long-term social
upheaval, the article pointed out.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan, they noted that the consolidation of democracy there
has made the one-China policy impractical. They added that it is
inconceivable that the island should be absorbed into an undemocratic
mainland state.</P>
      <P>"Beijing's belligerence, insistence on reunification and refusal
to accept Taiwan's statehood as a condition for negotiation virtually
close off all avenues for discussion," they stated.</P>

    <DATELINE>Hualien,  eastern  Taiwan,  April  24  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A sudden downpour on
Monday morning causing landslides has stranded a research team from
National Dong Hwa University in the mountains of eastern Taiwan,
according to sources from Dong Hwa University.</P>
      <P>The Dong Hwa team, comprised of three professors and 11 graduate
students from the university's Institute of Tourism and Recreation
Management, was reported missing earlier in the day after none of the
team members showed up as scheduled on Sunday evening after a two-day
and two-night research expedition into the mountains.</P>
      <P>Believing the team to be stranded because of monsoon rains
pouring down in the mountainous areas of eastern Taiwan since the
small hours of Monday morning, causing river levels to rise rapidly,
19 rescue police officers and aboriginal youths were mobilized and
sent to areas where the team might be located.</P>
      <P>By noon, the rescuers had made contact with the team members and
were told that they were safe but awaiting help, the university
sources said.</P>
      <P>If the rains continue to subside in the afternoon, according to
the rescuers, the entire research team will be safely escorted back
to Hualien in the evening.</P>
      <P>The team departed on Saturday morning and was scheduled to return
from the mountains on Sunday afternoon before heading for Hualien
City.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, monsoon rains have been reported across all of central
and northern Taiwan as of noon on Monday.</P>
      <P>In central Taiwan's Nantou County, roads were blocked as a result
of mud-slides and landslides triggered by heavy rains over the past
several days.</P>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau on Monday continued to issue warnings
that the heavy rains Taiwan has been experiencing over the last two
days may trigger devastating floods and landslides in central Taiwan,
particularly in mountainous areas.</P>
      <P>Weathermen said monsoon rains may also threaten areas in northern
Taiwan beginning Monday.</P>
      <P>In the capital city of Taipei in northern Taiwan, traffic jams
were reported on major roads Monday morning because of the rains.</P>
      <P>Meteorologists said the weather is expected to remain unstable
throughout the week.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MARCH FIGURES SHOW TAIWAN JOBLESS RATE DOWN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  24  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate dropped
slightly to 2.83 percent in March, 0.04 percent lower than that of
February, thanks to the recovering domestic economy and seasonal
factors, the government reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>Due to the continued economic upswing and an increased number of
people returning to work after having found new jobs after the
Chinese Lunar New Year, which usually falls in February, the number
of unemployed people in Taiwan totaled 274,000 in March,
representing an unemployment rate of 2.83 percent, officials from
the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS)
said.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials forecast that if the economy suffers no major
setbacks this year, the average annual jobless rate in Taiwan should
be kept a comfortable low of 2.8 percent in 2000.</P>
      <P>According to DGBAS tallies, Taiwan's workforce totaled 9.43
million people at the end of March, up 155,000 over the year-earlier
level, and 24,000 more than were recorded in February.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the number of jobless people in Taiwan dropped by
8,000 to 274,000 in March from February's 282,000.</P>
      <P>The number of workers in the service industry increased by 16,000
in the first three months of this year, compared with 1,000 people in
the industrial sector and 6,000 in the agriculture sector, the DGBAS
statistics showed.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, according to the DGBAS tallies, the average labor
participation rate was 57.43 percent in March, the lowest March level
since 1983. The labor participation rate is the ratio of the working
population to the population aged 15 and over.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT   LEE  DECLINES  INVITATION  TO  GIVE  FAREWELL  SPEECH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  24  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui declined an
invitation to give a farewell speech to Taiwan's legislature when he
met with Kuomintang (KMT) legislators on Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee, who had concurrently served as KMT Chairman before stepping
down from his party position to take responsibility for the KMT's
defeat in the March 18 presidential election, continued his rounds to
meet with KMT legislators over party reforms.</P>
      <P>The KMT legislators extended the invitation to the president to
give a farewell speech prior to stepping down from office next month.
Lee responded that time would not allow for a speech, and that
arrangements for the oration would be difficult.</P>
      <P>The president added that he had declined similar invitations from
President-elect Chen Shui-bian and the National Assembly.</P>
      <P>For most of the meeting, Lee listened to the nine legislators.
But on party reforms, he said that the personnel and organization of
the party all have to be streamlined, adding that the KMT has to rid
itself of the impression that it is connected to "black gold" --
illegal money and organized crime.</P>
      <P>The legislators' said that the KMT has become demoralized, and
expressed the hope that Lee could step in to help. The president's
response was that he has already stepped down from the party
chairmanship, though he still cares about party reform.</P>
      <P>Since he is no longer the KMT party chairman, Lee said that he
will now concentrate on the working for the good of the nation.</P>
      <P>He also told the legislators that they need to make more of an
effort to campaign on their own in future elections, saying that
party affiliation may no longer play as vital a role in elections as
it has in the past.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEATHS DUE TO OCCUPATIONAL INJURIES TOTALED 650 IN 1999</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  24  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 650 people in Taiwan died of
occupational injuries in 1999, an average of 1.78 people per day, the
cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>Last year, a combined 33,709 workers became injured, disabled or
were killed while on the job, an average of 92.1 people per day,
according to CLA Chairman Chan Hou-sheng.</P>
      <P>Chan said Taiwan's occupational injury rate hit its highest level
in 1966, with four out of every 1,000 workers dying as a result of
injuries in the workplace. The rate dropped to 5.92 out of every
1,000 workers in 1987, with it continuing to fall to 4.41 per 1,000
in 1988. Even that rate was higher than levels posted in other
advanced countries, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan registered a rate of 0.076 deaths for every thousand
workers in 1999. This contrasts with Britain's rate of 0.014 and
Japan's rate of 0.024, the CLA head noted while speaking at a seminar
held by a legislative committee.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Chien Hsi-kai of the Democratic Progressive Party
further pointed out that Taiwan's occupational injury rate is five
times that of Britain, three times that of Japan, and eight times
that of the United States.</P>
      <P>As hi-tech industries are increasingly playing a vital role in
worldwide development, Chien expressed his opinion that the
government should levy heavier punishments on business owners as an
effective way to reduce Taiwan's occupational injury rate.</P>
      <P>Chan admitted that the CLA has encountered many difficulties in
promoting labor safety. A lack of manpower for government
inspections, a lack of adequate facilities to protect workers'
safety, and a lack of labor safety awareness on the part of corporate
management all contribute to the problem, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>`ONE CHINA' PRINCIPLE CANNOT BE PRINCIPLE FOR TALKS: CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President-elect Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed
that he cannot accept demands by mainland China that the "one China"
principle be the prerequisite for renewed cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks when he met with a four-member delegation
from the United States on Monday.</P>
      <P>The delegation, led by former US Assistant Secretary for East
Asian and Pacific Affairs Winston Lord, arrived here on Saturday
night for a three-day fact-finding trip as part of efforts to ease
tensions between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. The delegation
will visit mainland China after Taiwan.</P>
      <P>With both sides of the Taiwan Strait locking horns over the "one
China" issue, Chen asked the US delegation "How can we accept that
Taiwan is a part of the People's Republic of China after the people
of Taiwan elected me as the 10th president of the Republic of China
in the March 18 presidential election?"</P>
      <P>Explaining why he cannot accept the "one China" principle as a
prerequisite for renewed talks, Chen noted that in 1993 mainland
China unveiled a white paper on the Taiwan issue and the unification
of China in which it touched on Beijing's interpretation of the "one
China" principle -- that there is one China, the PRC is the only
legitimate government, and Taiwan is a part of the PRC.</P>
      <P>Chen asked "how can we accept such a line of thinking?" and
pointed out that this is a "serious question."</P>
      <P>He also said that the lack of mutual trust is the biggest hurdle
for improving cross-strait ties, but the dearth of trust is mainly
the fault of mainland China, which has reneged on its words in the
past.</P>
      <P>Chen said cross-strait relations may be tense now, but he
believes that as long as there is goodwill and sincerity on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait, "we have absolute confidence in improving
cross-strait relations."</P>
      <P>He also stressed that he will support anything that will help
improve cross-strait relations, even "track II" or "track III"
negotiations.</P>
      <P>"Track I" negotiations refers to the talks between Taiwan's
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and its mainland China counterpart,
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>The consultation channel of "track I" has largely stalled after
Beijing reacted angrily to President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the
United States in 1995 and his statement on "special state-to-state"
cross-strait relations last year.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan is positive that both sides of the Taiwan Strait
had reached an agreement in 1992 where the two sides are allowed to
interpret the meaning of "one China." But Beijing does not recognize
that such an agreement was reached.</P>
      <P>Chen said he called on SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu to learn about
the situation surrounding the agreement last week.</P>
      <P>Other members of the US delegation are Douglas Paal, former
member of the US National Security Council and now head of the Asia
Pacific Policy Center; George Schwab, who heads the National
Committee on American Foreign Policy (NCAFP); and Professor Donald
Zagoria, senior NCAFP member.</P>
      <P>Chiou I-jen, Democratic Progressive Party Representative to the
US; and Hiao Bi-khim and Liu Shih-chung, Director and Vice Director
of the DPP's International Affairs Department, also attended the
one-hour meeting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INDEPENDENCE PARTY CRITICIZES VISITING MAINLAND SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  24  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Independence Party (TAIP) on
Monday blasted Yu Keli, deputy director of the Institute of Taiwan
Studies of Beijing's Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, for his
hardline rhetoric concerning relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>TAIP Chairman Cheng Pang-chen said Yu, who is currently on a
fact-finding trip in Taiwan, has not behaved as a guest or as a
scholar during his stay here.</P>
      <P>"Yu has instead acted like a 'high-ranking official making an
inspection tour of Taiwan," Cheng claimed, adding that Yu's behavior
has hurt Taiwan's dignity.</P>
      <P>Yu stressed Beijing's "one China" principle upon his arrival in
Taipei and demanded that Taiwan's President-elect Chen Shui-bian
identify himself as a Chinese in his May 20 inaugural speech.</P>
      <P>Beijing's "one China" principle downgrades the Republic of China
to a local-level government under the jurisdiction of the "People's
Republic of China."</P>
      <P>Cheng said Yu's moves were impolite and less-than-subtle,
reminding Yu that he has been invited here as an academic to
attend seminars on the development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Yu's argument that his was just exercising his
freedom of speech while making his "one China" remarks, Cheng said
Yu apparently has abused his freedom of speech. "I think Yu had
better returned to (mainland) China to advocate freedom of speech,"
he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cheng reiterated the TAIP's insistence on pursuing
Taiwan independence, saying the party opposes President-elect Chen's
proposal that Taiwan and mainland China can discuss the feasibility
of forming an either federal, confederation or commonwealth
relationship to resolve their sovereign disputes.</P>
      <P>"We insist on pursuing Taiwan independence and oppose forging any
form of ties with (mainland) China," Cheng stressed at a news
conference.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, National Taiwan University
professor Cheng Chin-jen said Beijing's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) once said in a message to its
Taiwan counterpart, the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), in
1992 that each side of the Taiwan Strait can orally expressed its own
definition of the "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>"Beijing, however, has denied this agreement since the end of the
first meeting between SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu and ARATS President
Wang Daohan in 1993," Prof. Cheng said, adding Yu Keli's recent
statement that Beijing cannot accept the "one China, different
definition" concept has again proved Beijing's unwillingness to
honor its 1992 agreement with Taiwan concerning the "one China"
issue.</P>

      <P>The average salary for industrial and
service sector employees in Taiwan came to NT$33,475 in February,
some 3.68 percent higher than the same month last year, according to
government figures.</P>
      <P>The figures released on Monday by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) show that economic
prospects on the island have made a turn for the better, resulting in
higher salaries for workers.</P>
      <P>After taking the rate of increase in consumer commodity prices
into account, the average salary registered a year-on-year increase
of 2.94 percent, the statistics show.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS statistics on salaries and worker productivity indicate
that the average non-governmental employee logged 159.3 hours of
work-time in February, 33.1 hours less than the previous month. This
due to the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays, which fell in February
this year.</P>
      <P>In addition, the government figures also show that the average
production volume of the manufacturing sector during January and
February this year registered an annual increase of 14.13 percent,

    <TEXT>
      <P>A recent survey by a local institution
indicates that most mainland Chinese visitors to Hong Kong have a
good impression of the territory, which was returned to the mainland
from the United Kingdom in 1997.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the Democratic Hong Kong Development
Alliance, queried 1,085 mainland visitors last month. Fifty percent
of the correspondents said they would visit Hong Kong again if they
have the opportunity.</P>
      <P>However, about 40 percent of the visitors said prices in Hong
Kong are expensive, scenic places are few and air pollution is
serious.</P>
      <P>Ten percent complained of the complicated procedures for
obtaining travel permits, especially those from such inland provinces
as Hunan and Jiangsi.</P>
      <P>The alliance said that the average mainland visitor spent about
HK$600 in Hong Kong per day, and it suggested that Hong Kong
authorities should provide more information on buying commodities at
reasonable prices so as to maintain Hong Kong's image as a "paradise
for shoppers."</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese visitors accounted for the largest number of
tourists to Hong Kong, reaching 2 million last year, or 20 percent of
the total. That figure is expected to rise to 5 million tourists in
the next four years.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A noted mainland Chinese academic urged
Beijing on Sunday to consider Taiwan President-elect Chen Shui-bian's
peace overture as a way to break the current impasse between the two
sides.</P>
      <P>Wu Jiaxiang, a close consultant of China's Communist Party former

willingness to accept opinions from all walks of life since his
victory in Taiwan's presidential election on March 18. Wu's comments
were made in an article on a New York-based website.</P>
      <P>In the face of fierce pressure from mainland China for Taiwan to
start unification talks, Chen suggested last week that the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait consider forming a confederation.</P>
      <P>Wu, currently a visiting professor at Harvard University, called
on Beijing to seriously take the peace overture into account, or
follow the example of the European Union in achieving unification

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) will
hold an extraordinary meeting on Tuesday to discuss how to block the
National Assembly (NA) election, as the assembly may pass an
amendment to convert itself into a task-oriented body. If the
assembly fails to pass the amendment, the CEC will discuss procedures
related to the election.</P>
      <P>Deputies of the NA met on Monday to complete the second and third
readings of a constitutional amendment to reduce the body's powers.</P>
      <P>However, local election committees on Monday were conducting a
drawing for candidates who wish to run in the election. A spokesman
of the CEC said that although the drawing was held, the its results
will not be published until the constitutional amendment has been
completed.</P>
      <P>The CEC at its meeting on April 19 completed screening procedures
that analyzed individual candidates' qualifications. At the same
meeting, it also decided to postpone some election procedures. The
CEC asked local election committees to conduct the drawing procedures
on Tuesday after considering that the NA would not pass the
constitutional amendment bill by April 25.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the CEC would not set any preconditions for
the results of the constitutional amendment. The CEC must either make
preparations for the upcoming election or suspend it, whether the
constitutional amendment is passed or not, he stressed.</P>
      <P>The agenda of Tuesday's CEC meeting will be open, he said. If the
constitutional amendment bill is passed, the CEC meeting will discuss
how to stop the upcoming election.</P>
      <P>If the bill is not passed, the CEC will meet to discuss
procedures on the scheduling of the election and the publishing of
serial numbers drawn by candidates on April 24. The campaign period
will begin from April 26 to May 5. The voting will be held on May 6,

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 24 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's average hotel occupancy rate was
60.65 percent last year, a decrease of 1.53 percent compared with the
1998 figure, according to statistics released on Monday by the
Tourism Bureau.</P>
      <P>Officials of the bureau under the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC), said the decrease could be attributed mainly
to the devastating earthquake that hit Taiwan last September.</P>
      <P>The biggest reduction in inbound tourists came from Japan, the
officials added.</P>
      <P>However, hotel occupancy in Taiwan's tourist spots bucked the
trend, increasing 2.36 percent over the year-earlier level,
especially in places famous for hot springs.</P>
      <P>The statistics show that the Grand Formosa Regent Taipei, the
Leofoo Hotel and the Hotel Royal Taipei were the top three Taipei
hotels in terms of occupancy, while in tourist spots, the Howard
Beach Resort Kenting, Caesar Park Hotel-Kenting, and the China Trust
Hotel at Sun Moon Lake had the top occupancy rates.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI, BEIJING SHOULD NOT FOCUS ONLY ON MILITARY: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait should
not devote too much energy to political and military affairs which
could spell disaster to the Chinese people and lead to regional
conflict, a noted Chinese-American scholar urged on Monday.</P>
      <P>Tien Chang-ling, former chancellor of the University of
California at Berkeley, made the call in a speech delivered at the
opening ceremony of the second world youth summit.</P>
      <P>Tien said Taiwan and mainland China should instead focus on
economic development, stressing that only a robust economy can
protect a country from invasion by foreign forces.</P>
      <P>Tien also called on the leaders of all Third World countries not
to pay too much attention to "trivial political issues," but to spend
more time mulling economic agenda.</P>
      <P>In his speech, titled "New Century, New Opportunity, New Vision,"
Tien said the most important shaping force in the world in the past
50 years has been the development of democracy and technology which
he said has in turn led to economic globalization.</P>
      <P>Noting that globalization is an irresistible trend, Tien said
many developing and under-developed countries have tended to regard
globalization as a nightmare because they fear that their industries
will be merged or acquired by multinational giants.</P>
      <P>From the US viewpoint, Tien went on, globalization is mainly
aimed at stimulating Third World countries to accelerate
establishment of mechanisms for national modernization.</P>
      <P>Tien said globalization-resistant countries like Japan, as well
as developing countries like Taiwan and mainland China, need not
worry about globalization and should instead take bold steps to speed
up domestic reform and restructuring to enhance their competitiveness
in the global market. "Otherwise, they will be isolated in the
international community," he cautioned.</P>
      <P>Tien pointed out that the world is undergoing a "third wave
revolution" which has ushered in an era of new economies
characterized by information and globalization.</P>
      <P>He predicted that economic development in the next century will
not be confined to the Internet, software, fiber-optics and
telecommunications. "I believe that biotechnology, genetic
engineering and the pharmaceutical industry will also play very
important roles in economic development in all major countries around
the world in the new century," he added.</P>
      <P>Tien further said the world will become increasingly peaceful in
the years ahead. "There will no longer be massive-scale wars like
World War I and World War II. Nevertheless, there will still be
regional conflicts, and the number of such conflicts may even
increase," he noted, adding that potential flash points include the
Balkan states, Africa, North and South Korea, and the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Tien said he hopes the leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait
will be wise enough to avoid confrontation and devote more of their
energies to economic development for the well-being of all Chinese
people and for the peace of the entire Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>The four-day youth summit has brought together 220 youth leaders
from 52 countries, including the host Republic of China, to meet in
Taipei to discuss youth-related topics. In addition to panel
discussion, the delegates will also meet with outgoing ROC President
Lee Teng-hui and visit the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park,
the stronghold of Taiwan's high-tech industry.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DRAFT CONSTITUTION AMENDMENTS TO EVISCERATE NA CRUISE SECOND READING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  24 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Draft Constitutional amendments aimed at
cutting down the functions of the National Assembly (NA) easily
passed a second reading on Monday, and was set to go through a third
and final reading later that night.</P>
      <P>The NA decided through a vote of 291 to 8 to transform itself
into an ad hoc organization made up of 300 delegates appointed by
political parties according to the proportional representation
system.</P>
      <P>Under the draft amendments, the NA, empowered to ratify the
Legislative Yuan's initiatives on Constitutional amendments or
changes of territories, will be chosen in the new way within three
months after these initiatives are put forward and have been gazetted
for six months.</P>
      <P>Should the Legislative Yuan launch impeachment proceedings
against the nation's president or vice president, the NA should be
chosen within three months of the impeachment being officially
submitted.</P>
      <P>The new NA delegates should meet within ten days of being
appointed by their parties and their terms will run out when the NA
session, which should run for no more than one month at the most, is
ended.</P>
      <P>In addition, the terms of the current NA delegates should expire
on May 19 rather than in June, 2001 as had been called for in a
Constitutional amendment approved in September, 1999.</P>
      <P>That amendment, which flew in the face of public opinion, was
struck down as unconstitutional in a ruling by the Council of Grand
Justices in March, 2000.</P>
      <P>The NA also voted in the second reading to lift the lifetime
payment system for the grand justices, which was widely considered as
tit-for-tat retaliation against the Grand Justices Council's ruling.</P>
      <P>Assuming the amendment passes its final reading, grand justices,
unless they are already common judges, will be excluded from the
common judges' right to lifetime salary after their eight-year term
expires.</P>
      <P>In Monday's second reading, another bill obliging the president
to issue an annual state-of-the-nation message to the Legislature was
also passed.</P>
      <P>But yet another bill which would have required a majority vote
in a presidential election was voted down. The proposal initiated by
the tiny opposition New Party would have provided for a second round
run-off election between the first two winners in the event of no
clear majority by any candidate.</P>
      <P>The initiative was designed to broaden the mandate of the
president, but was denounced as an attempt to block the election of a
minority head of state such as President-elect Chen Shui-bian, who
won the March 18 election with 39.3 percent of the vote.</P>
      <P>Also killed at the second reading was a proposal to lower the
number of legislators required to send a draft Constitutional
amendment to the NA for ratification from 75 percent to 66 percent
of the legislature, and a proposal to increase the number of
legislators from 225 to 250.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui
met on Monday with visiting members of the National Committee on
American Foreign Policy (NCAFP) led by Winston Lord, former US
assistant state secretary for East Asian and Pacific affairs.</P>
      <P>Lee told his visitors that the transition of political power in
Taiwan following the March 18 presidential election has so far been
implemented smoothly.</P>
      <P>He said that he attaches great importance to the power transition
and has authorized Ding Mou-shih, secretary-general to the president,
to take charge of preparatory work for the transition to ensure it is
implemented peacefully and smoothly.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party's presidential
candidate Chen Shui-bian and his running mate, Annette Lu, won the
election, and an ad hoc committee for the transition of power led by
DPP Legislator Chang Chun-hsiung has met a number of times with Ding
to discuss the transition, Lee went on.</P>
      <P>This will be the first time in the Republic of China's history
that a political party has handed the reins of power to another
political party, Lee noted.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, the visitors expressed their deep concern
over the situation which might develop between the two sides of
Taiwan Strait after Chen's inauguration on May 20.</P>
      <P>Lee replied that "we always hope that the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait will conduct dialogue based on democracy and equality. How
Taiwan deals with future cross-strait issues will depend on Chen's
wisdom."</P>
      <P>The outgoing head of state said that he did not agree with the
so-called "Asian Values" concept because this concept could become an
excuse for totalitarian government. He pointed out that a free and
democratic political system has successfully been promoted in Taiwan,
and added that Asia should be able to enjoy the same freedom,
democracy and human rights as Western countries.</P>
      <P>The American visitors spoke highly of Lee's achievements in
promoting Taiwan's democratization, saying it sets an example for
mainland China and the Asia-Pacific area.</P>
      <P>The US delegation, which also included George Schwab, Donald
Zagoria and Douglas H. Paal, arrived in Taipei on Saturday for a
three-day fact-finding visit. They had already called on James Soong,
chairman of the newly established People First Party (PFP), Chen and
Lu.</P>
      <P>They will leave Taipei for Beijing to continue their fact-finding
mission on Tuesday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS NEED NEW FORMULA: US EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, April 24 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the election of Chen Shui-bian as
Taiwan's next president, future progress in cross-strait relations
will require a new formula that permits Beijing's "one China" policy
and Taipei's quest for negotiation equality to coexist, according to
an American expert in Asian affairs.</P>
      <P>Ralph A. Cossa, executive director of the Center for Strategic
and International Studies' Pacific Forum, wrote in the latest issue
of the Washington-based think tank's E-journal on East Asian
bilateral relations that the biggest challenge to Asia-Pacific
regional stability in the past few months has been Taiwan's March 18
presidential election.</P>
      <P>In the short term, he said, cross-strait relations seem to have
suffered most, especially in light of Beijing's heavy-handed but
unsuccessful attempt to influence the election outcome.</P>
      <P>The good news, Cossa pointed out, is that since the election,
Beijing has refrained from making matters worse. "We have no choice,
we must learn to deal with Chen Shui-bian" was a common refrain
during Cossa's post-election discussions with communist Chinese
officials and security analysts, who also acknowledge that "even Chen
Shui-bian is an improvement over (President) Lee Teng-hui." And Chen
is waving olive branches in Beijing's direction.</P>
      <P>However, he wrote, both sides have limited flexibility and
neither side seems quite sure how best to proceed. But "one thing is
clear: Future progress in cross-strait relations will require a new
formula.</P>
      <P>Leaders in Beijing are now being forced to confront the reality
that almost everyone in Taiwan has long recognized -- that "one
country, two systems," the formula used to incorporate Hong Kong and
Macau back into the mainland -- will never work for Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Cossa emphasized that "what is needed now is a new construct that
permits Beijing's `one China' policy and Taipei's quest for
negotiation equality or even `special state-to-state' relations to
coexist."</P>
      <P>Once again the United States is caught in the middle. Washington
is wisely calling on both sides to exercise restraint, advising
against any unilateral change in the status quo. "A less ambiguous
American statement of support to Taiwan might embolden the more
radical Democratic Progressive Party elements that Chen has thus far
held in check, and further undermine Sino-US relations," claimed
Cossa.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA SHOULD BE MORE DEMOCRATIC: US EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   April   24   (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The best hope for peaceful
cross-Taiwan Strait reunification "lies in China gradually becoming
like Taiwan -- that is, more democratic," according to an American
foreign policy expert.</P>
      <P>Richard Haass, vice president and director of foreign policy
studies at the Washington-based Brookings Institute, wrote in a
recent analysis that "Taiwan's recent presidential election
constitutes a historical divide. Nothing will ever be the same there.
The results could have repercussions equally dramatic for China. As a
result, the election makes it necessary to assess and adjust American
policy."</P>
      <P>He said successive American presidents have tried to ensure that
any cross-strait reunification would be peaceful through "strategic
ambiguity," but this approach is under mounting pressure.</P>
      <P>A Beijing white paper issued on Feb. 21 suggested that mainland
China might resort to force simply because Taiwan was dragging its
feet on talks designed to bring about a unified country. At the same
time, the fact that Taiwan just elected Chen Shui-bian, a man who for
years espoused independence, suggested that it could be a matter of
time before he or a successor actually takes that step, pointed out
the expert.</P>
      <P>Despite these developments, Haass noted, the United States could
stick with its current policy. There are, however, a number of
options. One is, as House Republican Whip Rep. Tom Delay (R-Tex.)
recently argued, that Washington should jettison its "one China"
policy and accept that "there are, in fact, two Chinese states."</P>
      <P>But adopting a "two China" policy could trigger the conflict over
Taiwan the United States seeks to avoid, he said. Even if it did not,
it would require extensive military undertakings and lead to a major
falling out with mainland China that would end PRC-US cooperation
regarding the Korean peninsula to prevent the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction and boost trade.</P>
      <P>Another approach would have Washington move from strategic
ambiguity to a posture of greater clarity. "We would, for example,
inform both China and Taiwan that only if Taiwan declared
independence would there be any question of American willingness to
come to its defense," wrote Haass.</P>
      <P>The problem with this idea is that it might prompt Taiwan to take
every step short of independence -- steps that still might provoke a
mainland Chinese attack that in turn would require a US response. But
Beijing would still have to calculate that almost any -- and possibly
all -- use of force on its part against Taiwan would be resisted with
American help, he emphasized.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, however, likely would be dissuaded from declaring
independence or otherwise acting recklessly. It still would be left
with some uncertainty as to the US response, and even if the United
States came to Taiwan's aid, Taiwan's leaders know their economy and
society would suffer profoundly in the conflict.</P>
      <P>On balance, Haass said, "moving in the direction of greater
clarity about what the United States is prepared to do appears more
likely to succeed in keeping the situation between China and Taiwan
calm than simply trying to sustain current levels of ambiguity. In
the end, the United States maintains a vital interest in not allowing
China to determine Taiwan's fate with force."</P>
      <P>Were Beijing to succeed, he pointed out, it would not only teach
its leaders a dangerous lesson but also would prompt countries in the
region to lose faith in the United States, leading some to
accommodate mainland China and others to develop nuclear weapons and
chart an increasingly independent course.</P>
      <P>The critical point not to be lost, Haass said, is that it is in
the interest of everyone to play for time, to encourage mainland
China to eschew any use of military force and to encourage Taiwan to
avoid taking symbolic independence steps. And the best hope for a
peaceful outcome lies in mainland China gradually becoming more like
Taiwan as a democracy.</P>
      <P>"As the difference between the two societies narrows, the chance
for voluntary unification grows. In this scenario, the China that
would emerge would be called China but would resemble Taiwan,"
concluded Haass.</P>

      <P>The Second International Conference of
Young Leaders opened in Taipei on Monday attended by 220
representatives from home and abroad.</P>
      <P>The conference organized by the Cabinet-level National Youth
Commission (NYC) has as its theme "Growth and Contributions of Young
Leaders - Creating the New Milestone of Global Cooperation."</P>
      <P>NYC Chairman Lee Jih-chu presided over the opening ceremony of
the four-day conference, and Premier Vincent Siew delivered a speech
in which he welcomed the youth representatives from around the world.
He said that mankind can make great strides in the new century only
through the globalization of democracy as well as the exchange and
cooperation of information technology among nations.</P>
      <P>Siew referred to the so-called "Taiwan miracle" to introduce the
Republic of China's economic achievements, and cited government
statistics to show the participants that the ROC, with its economy
steadily growing in the past three years, has achieved a GNP (gross
national product) of US$2.908 trillion and a per capita GNP of
US$13,248, ranking it 17th in the world. He also pointed out that the
nation's foreign exchange reserves are the third-largest in the
world.</P>
      <P>As to political developments, the outgoing premier said the ROC

presidential election in 1996 and its second in March 2000. Although
the Kuomintang lost in the most recent one and must now transfer

      <P>Siew said he hopes that the youth leaders from abroad can have a

"Prospects of Internet Development in the New Millennium." Another
forum titled "Economic Development and International Cooperation," is
scheduled to be held on Tuesday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY FADES INTO HISTORY AFTER PASSING AMENDMENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  24   (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Assembly is fading into
history after after downgrading itself into a virtual ceremonial
organization without much power by passing a series of constitutional
amendments in a third reading late on Monday.</P>
      <P>The NA in a second reading earlier in the day voted 291 to 8 to
transform itself into an ad hoc organization made up of 300 delegates
appointed by political parties according to the proportional
representation system.</P>
      <P>Under the amendments, the NA, empowered to ratify the Legislative
Yuan's initiatives on Constitutional amendments or changes of
territories, will be chosen in the new way within three months after
these initiatives are put forward and have been gazetted for six
months.</P>
      <P>Should the Legislative Yuan launch impeachment proceedings
against the nation's president or vice president, the NA should be
chosen within three months of the impeachment being officially
submitted.</P>
      <P>The new NA delegates should meet within ten days of being
appointed by their parties and their terms will run out when the NA
session, which should run for no more than one month at the most, is
ended.</P>
      <P>In addition, the terms of the current NA delegates should expire
on May 19 rather than in June, 2001 as had been called for in a
Constitutional amendment approved in September, 1999.</P>
      <P>That amendment, which flew in the face of public opinion, was
struck down as unconstitutional in a ruling by the Council of Grand
Justices in March, 2000.</P>
      <P>The NA also voted to lift the lifetime payment system for the
grand justices, which was widely considered as tit-for-tat
retaliation against the Grand Justices Council's ruling.</P>
      <P>Under the amendment, grand justices, unless they are already
common judges, will be excluded from the common judges' right to
lifetime salary after their eight-year term expires.</P>
      <P>Another bill obliging the president to issue an annual
state-of-the-nation message to the Legislature was also passed.</P>
      <P>But yet another bill which would have required a majority vote in
a presidential election was voted down in a second reading on Monday.
The proposal initiated by the tiny opposition New Party would have
provided for a second round run-off election between the first two
winners in the event of no clear majority by any candidate.</P>
      <P>The initiative was designed to broaden the mandate of the
president, but was denounced as an attempt to block the election of a
minority head of state such as President-elect Chen Shui-bian, who
won the March 18 election with 39.3 percent of the vote.</P>
      <P>Also killed at the second reading was a proposal to lower the
number of legislators required to send a draft Constitutional
amendment to the NA for ratification from 75 percent to 66 percent of
the legislature, and a proposal to increase the number of legislators
from 225 to 250.</P>
      <P>As a result of Monday's vote, the upcoming NA election initially
scheduled for May 6 but suspended pending the outcome of the NA
session, will be canceled.</P>
      <P>The NA, the supreme representative organization of the people
under the Constitution, has hardly assumed its full constitutional
powers since it came into existence in 1948, said local political
analysts.</P>
      <P>It powers were seriously limited in 1949 when the Nationalist
government relocated to Taiwan, declared martial law and adopted a
set of temporary constitutional provisions which reduced the NA to
nothing more than a presidential electoral college, the analysts
pointed out.</P>
      <P>Although the temporary constitutional provisions were lifted in
1991, the NA's constitutional role was not fully restored because a
constitutional amendment adopted in 1994 providing for the popular
election of the president and left the NA no job other than revising
the Constitution and approving the president's nominations of senior
government leaders.</P>
      <P>In addition, the NA's performance in constitutional revising in
the last decade has often seen the assemblymen acting on whims and
going against the public grain -- increasingly irritating the people
they are supposed to represent.</P>
      <P>Their vote to extend their own terms in September in 1999 was the
last straw that caused the public to make a concerted call for the
total abolition of the anachronistic bygone of a former era, and led
to the vote to finally eviscerate their own organization, said the
analysts.</P>

      <P>Australian Green Party Senator Bob Brown

      <P>The article mentions that the panda, who is native to Tibet, is
disappearing because "its territory has been overrun" because of

    <HEADLINE>LIEN SUGGESTS BOTH SIDES SHELVE `SOVEREIGNTY' DISPUTES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan said on Tuesday
that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should shelve their disputes
over the issue of sovereignty and concentrate on cooperation.</P>
      <P>Lien said that there is ample room for cooperation across the
Taiwan Strait, and there is no need to waste more time and resources
on the intractable dispute over sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Lien noted that during the first high-ranking cross-strait talks
in Singapore in 1993, the two sides reached an agreement that allowed
each to interpret the definition of "one China."</P>
      <P>As such, Lien said Beijing should not try to impose its
interpretation of the principle of "one China" on Taiwan, especially
since Taiwan long ago established its National Unification Guidelines
and the National Unification Council with President Lee Teng-hui as
the chairman, clearly indicating that national unification is the
ultimate goal of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Lien also said that although Chen Shui-bian of the
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party has sounded
conciliatory notes since his election victory, Beijing has so far not
reciprocated. He said this has given the people of Taiwan a sense of
uncertainty concerning cross-strait relations. Lien added that Chen
should continue making more efforts in this respect.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the ROC is willing to see the United States
develop closer relations with mainland China, as long as it is not at
the expense of the ROC.</P>
      <P>Lien also recalled that during the past decades, he has
contributed to enhancing US-ROC relations. He continued that although
the Kuomintang will soon become an opposition party, it retains a
majority in the legislature.</P>
      <P>He made his remarks while meeting with a four-member US
delegation led by Winston Lord, former US Assistant Secretary for
East Asian and Pacific Affairs and a former US ambassador to mainland
China.</P>
      <P>The US delegation also called on KMT spokesperson and former
Foreign Affairs Minister Jason Hu earlier on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hu said the delegation is concerned about what direction the
president-elect will take, and their assessment of his handling of
the cross-strait issue has been mixed.</P>
      <P>Some delegates said they have yet to see what direction Chen's
policy will take and what his goals will be, while others said the
public should not pin too high a hope on Chen since he has yet to be
inaugurated.</P>
      <P>The delegation, which arrived here on Saturday night for a
fact-finding trip as part of efforts to ease cross-strait tensions,
concluded its whirlwind trip in Taiwan and left for the mainland
later on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>During their stay in Taiwan, delegation members met with
President-elect Chen Shui-bian, President Lee Teng-hui, and James
Soong, chairman of the newly formed People First Party.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP WILLING TO GIVE BEIJING CHANCE TO DETAIL MERITS OF UNIFICATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The incoming Republic of China government
is willing to offer any possible opportunities for Beijing to explain
the benefits or merits of unification of the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait, the chairman of Taiwan's ruling party-to-be said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Although we disagree with Beijing's stance, we have no
intention of provoking Beijing leaders and are willing to provide
them with any possible opportunities to expound to the people of
Taiwan the merits of unification of the two sides," said Lin
Yi-hsiung, chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks after a closed-door meeting with a
four-member delegation from the National Committee on American
Foreign Policy (NCAFP), a Washington-based think tank.</P>
      <P>The NCAFP delegation, led by Winston Lord, a former US
ambassador to mainland China who also once served as assistant
secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, arrived in
Taipei on Saturday for a three-day visit aimed at gaining a better
understanding of the DPP's attitude toward Beijing after the
pro-independence party won the ROC's March 18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>During their 40 minutes talks, Lin said he had told his American
guests that the DPP regards Taiwan as an independent sovereign
country and insists that any change to the island's status quo must
pass a referendum vote.</P>
      <P>"It is a mainstream public opinion that any change to our
political status quo must win the consent of the majority of our
people through a plebiscite, and the DPP cannot violate the common
wish of our people," Lin stressed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's ruling party-to-be used to advocate Taiwan independence
but has softened this aspect of its party platform in recent years.
The DPP now thinks that only the people of Taiwan can decide the
island's future by holding a plebiscite .</P>
      <P>Lin said while Beijing disagrees with the DPP's stance at the
moment, the majority of Taiwan people also would not accept mainland
China's "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Lin said, the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait should conduct dialogue and exchanges through various channels
to enhance mutual understanding and trust. "With mutual trust, any
kinds of conflicting concepts and views can be discussed," he noted.</P>
      <P>Lin went on to say that although the DPP disagrees with
Beijing's stance, it will make every possible effort to avoid
creating any trouble. "We'll not take any impolite or provocative
action against either the Beijing government or its senior leaders,"
he added.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lin said, now that Taiwan is a democratic society, any
change to its status quo must be the expression of popular will.
"Therefore, we are willing to offer opportunities for Beijing to
expound to our people the advantages of unification of the two
sides," Lin said, adding that as such, he sees no reason for Beijing
to threaten Taiwan with the use of force. "Beijing should use
democratic and peaceful means to convince our people," he added.</P>
      <P>Also present at the Lin-Lord meeting were Douglas Paal, a former
chief of China and East Asian affairs of the US National Security
Council; NCAFP President George Schwab; and professor Donald
Zagoria, head of the NCAFP's roundtable discussion program.</P>
      <P>During the past couple of days, the delegation has met with
many influential politician here, including President-elect Chen
Shui-bian, outgoing President Lee Teng-hui, People First Party
Chairman James Soong, Kuomintang acting Chairman Lien Chan and
Foreign Minister-designate Tien Hung-mao.</P>
      <P>The delegation will give a pre-departure news conference before
leaving for Beijing for a visit as part of its efforts to help ease
cross-strait tension which has escalated following Chen's election
as the ROC's next president.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan manufacturers need to step up
efforts to tap the Russian market, as Taiwan recorded a US$1.16 
billion trade deficit with Russia last year, Chen Ruey-long, director
general of the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT), said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a seminar on trade and economics in
Russia. The meeting was co-sponsored by the semi-official China
External Trade Development Council and Euro-Asia Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>Victor Trifonov, representative of the Taipei Office of the
Moscow-Taipei Economic &amp; Cultural Coordination Commission, also
attended the seminar, along with hundreds of Taiwan businessmen.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that bilateral trade between Taiwan and Russia totaled
US$1.38 billion last year with Taiwan exporting US$110 million to
Russia, while importing US$1.27 billion from Russia. Taiwan thus
suffered US$1.16 billion trade deficit with Russia.</P>
      <P>Chen said 70 percent of Russian imports were raw materials such
as minerals, while major exports to Russia were information
technology and computer peripheral products.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Taiwan manufacturers would do well to promote
Russian sales of computer products, consumer electronics, stationery
and gifts, and automobile parts and components. He noted that Taiwan
suppliers have until now mainly focused on Moscow and St. Petersburg,
but should widen their marketing efforts to include other Russian
cities.</P>
      <P>Taiwan businesses could also seek out Russian partners to
cooperate in the textiles and machinery industries, Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HK INTERNET GURU WARNS FOREIGN INVESTORS TO BE WARY OF CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,   April   25   (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A leading Hong Kong Internet
entrepreneur has warned foreigners to be very careful when investing
in mainland China because it is an uncertain market that still lacks
the necessary network infrastructure, content and commerce
capability.</P>
      <P>In an interview with The Australian, Peter Yip, head of
Chinadotcom, said that foreign investors in China need patience and
understanding, because of stumbling blocks to making serious money in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>He said despite its huge population of 1.2 billion people, the
Chinese market is still immature in terms of infrastructure, content
and Internet connectivity.</P>
      <P>"North Asia represents the greatest potential Internet market.
But you have to be careful to differentiate the markets (of Japan,
Korea and China.) There are different opportunities at different
times," he said.</P>
      <P>"I need to caution co-investors to work closely with the
regulators in China," he added.</P>
      <P>He said the market in Japan is mature, and Korea is energetically
forging ahead. In China, state-owned enterprises are now trying to
transform themselves in to online businesses, he added.</P>
      <P>He said that it is up to foreign investors to educate and
encourage Chinese managers. The other prerequisite for investors in
China is a sense of reality, because it is easy to succumb to the
pull of a market of 1.2 billion people.</P>
      <P>"One has to be careful with China, that you are not overwhelmed
by the size. You have to look beyond the population to connectivity,"
he said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that even though China has already about 10
million Internet users -- and could have 200 million by 2005 if
mobile telephones deliver on their potential -- connectivity is still
far below the critical mass necessary for e-commerce to be viable.</P>
      <P>He said that outside urban centers such as Beijing, Shanghai and
Guangzhou, only 5 percent of the population now has a telephone. He
added that owners of computers in China are even fewer, because about
90 percent of China's PCs are to be found at work and not at home.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN'S ADJUSTMENT FALLS SHORT OF BEIJING HOPES: KMT AIDE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 25 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan President-elect Chen Shui-bian has
noticeably adjusted his attitude toward mainland China, but Beijing
still wants Chen to further clarify his position in this regard, a
Kuomintang (KMT) official said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Although Chen's remarks on cross-Taiwan Strait issues since his
election on March 18 as the island's next president have reflected
marked changes from his views in the past, they still fall short of
Beijing demands, said Chang Jong-kung, head of the KMT's Mainland
Research Department.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT aide, Chen has adopted a "negative list" to
express his stance on cross-strait issues. But what Beijing wants
from Chen is a "positive list," which should make all relevant issues
very clear, he noted.</P>
      <P>For instance, Chen has said that he will not change Taiwan's
official title, and that he will not declare independence from the
mainland, Chang cited.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that these statements are helpful in improving
Taiwan's ties with the mainland, the KMT China expert said that
Chen's words still fall short of Beijing's desires, and might make
the Beijing leadership think that a hard-line approach is the only
solution to the Taiwan issue.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan's new government continues to delay talks on
unification with the mainland, Beijing fears that the Chinese
Communist Party's image would be damaged, he said. That is the reason
why Premier-designate Tang Fei has asserted that Taiwan-mainland
relations have come to a critical turning point, he noted.</P>
      <P>The period following Chen's May 20 inauguration will be a time
for the two sides to review their bilateral relationship, Chang
contended. He further pointed out that Beijing might link
cross-strait ties to the respective entries of both Taiwan and the
mainland into the World Trade Organization in June or July.</P>
      <P>In light of fierce pressure from Beijing and the present deadlock
between the two sides, lawmakers suggested on the same day that the
policy-making legislature should play a more active role in two-way
negotiations.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Tsao Erh-chung suggested that legislators should
form a delegation to visit the mainland before May 20.</P>
      <P>Fan Yang-sheng, another KMT lawmaker, hailed Chen's changed
attitude toward mainland China, but pointed out that Chen now faces
less room to maneuver in bilateral talks, as Beijing has objected to
the "one China, separately interpreted" principle.</P>
      <P>Stressing that a so-called "one China" should comprise both the
Republic of China and the People's Republic of China, Fan stated that
the ROC is not a part of the PRC and that the two sides should
seriously consider the feasibility of setting up a confederation.</P>
      <P>Citing the increased deployments of mainland Chinese troops in
Fujian and Guangdong provinces opposite Taiwan, KMT lawmaker Lee
Chuan-chiao reminded Beijing that ethnic identification should be the
foundation for Taiwan's unification with mainland China.</P>
      <P>"If there is no such a base, unification between the two sides
will be out of the question," Lee claimed, calling on Beijing not to
place overly high expectations on Chen's May 20 inaugural speech.</P>
      <P>The recent confederation proposal is a better solution for Taiwan
and mainland China, he went on to say, adding that an incorrect
estimation of the situation by the mainland would only lead to a
breakup between the two sides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT-ELECT HOPES TAIPEI, BEIJING CAN JOIN WTO AROUND SEPTEMBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC President-elect Chen Shui-bian said on
Tuesday he hopes that both sides of the Taiwan Strait can be
either separately or simultaneously admitted to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) around September this year.</P>
      <P>Chen made the statement during an amicable meeting with Steve
Forbes, publisher of the US Forbes magazine, and several other senior
magazine executives.</P>
      <P>Chen first told Forbes that he was moved by the viewpoints of an
article carried in the latest issue of the Forbes magazine, which
criticized the Clinton administration for its refusal to sell highly
sophisticated Aegis destroyers to Taiwan. The article was written by
former US secretary of defense Caspar W. Weinberger.</P>
      <P>Chen said he appreciates Weinberger's concern about Taiwan's
security in the face of Beijing's intensified military build-up and
mounting saber-rattling against the island.</P>
      <P>The lawyer-turned-politician went on to say he believes that
peace in the Taiwan Strait and stability in the Asia-Pacific are in
the US national interests.</P>
      <P>For his part, Forbes echoed Chen's view that maintaining a
democratic, prosperous Taiwan is in the US interest. "The United
States is obligated to provide Taiwan with necessary defensive
weapons and this can help increase Chen's bargaining chips in future
negotiations with Beijing," the American publisher said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said he is concerned about the WTO accession
of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. "I hope both sides can join
the world trade regulatory body around September smoothly," he said,
adding he believes that a WTO-binding, democratizing mainland China
can be a great force to ensure peace and stability in the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen also mentioned the three foundations of Taiwan-US
relations -- support for the universal values of freedom and
democracy; expectations of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait
and the entire Asia-Pacific region; and joint efforts to promote
trade and economic cooperation.</P>
      <P>Chen said he believes that friendship and substantive relations
between the Republic of China and the United States will continue to
grow in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>Forbes said he also thinks that the United States must help
Taiwan cement its liberal, democratic system, adding that the US
insistence on peaceful solution to the Taiwan Strait issue will
contribute much not only to both sides of the strait but also to the
entire world.</P>
      <P>Stressing that helping maintain regional peace is one of US
national missions, Forbes said the United States had sometimes
overlooked the destructiveness of certain regional conflicts which
later developed into global conflicts.</P>
      <P>Forbes further said he has consistently espoused Taiwan's early
entry to the WTO. However, he said the Clinton administration has
not accepted his opinion.</P>
      <P>Forbes also suggested that Chen's administration take
bold steps to further liberalize and privatized Taiwan's
agricultural, information and power generation industries.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen said Taiwan will remove obstacles to free flow
of information, capital and personnel after its WTO entry. "We'll
phase out all unnecessary and outdated control and help our
traditional industries upgrade production and management, while
helping high-tech industries achieving further technological
breakthroughs and innovation," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RESEARCHERS PREDICT TAIWAN'S ECONOMY WILL CONTINUE TO BOOM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  25 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy is expected to continue
booming, with high economic growth and low commodity prices seen as
likely through out the year, local economic researchers said on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Economic growth will be supported by robust foreign trade, rosy
domestic consumption and increasing private investment, said
officials of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER). The
institute Tuesday revised the island's estimated economic growth for
this year to 6.49 percent from the previous 6.28 percent.</P>
      <P>However, the relentless plunge of the US stock markets will
likely have a negative impact on Taiwan's exports, said TIER
officials.</P>
      <P>The officials added that other possible adverse effects on the
Taiwan economy include uncertainty in cross-Taiwan Strait relations,
as well as the apparent failure of oil-rich nations to agree to
increase production, which is expected to keep oil prices higher than
was previously hoped.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth in the first, second, third and fourth
quarter of this year is estimated by TIER as 7.02 percent, 6.12
percent, 6.77 percent, and 6.08 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>TIER officials also anticipate a gradual appreciation of the New
Taiwan dollar quarterly this year, with an average exchange rate
against the greenback at NT$30.36.</P>
      <P>Dong Jei-bin, head of TIER's Sixth Department, pointed out that
Taiwan Stock Exchange is likely to break the bourse's previous
benchmark-weighted price index record, which registered over 12,000
points. He said that the index has recently entered into a "laundry"
phase, with sharp gains and losses over the past two weeks.</P>
      <P>All global stock markets are under the shadow of the volatile
swings of the US markets, and the island's bourse is certainly no
exception, remarked Dong.</P>
      <P>Dong is referring to the violent gyrations experienced by the
NASDAQ Composite Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average in
April's second week. The NASDAQ composite last week took its heaviest
fall ever in both percentage and points terms, dropping 25.3 percent
in five days. The Dow Jones joined in the dive by the end of the
week.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, with Taiwan's overall economic expansion
continuing, together with a sustained inflow of foreign capital and a
loose monetary supply environment, Taiwan's bourse has good prospects
for the next two years, Dong concluded.</P>

really outstanding only when they care about people, said a local
high-tech tycoon on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Tu Chun-yuan, chairman and CEO of Silicon Integrated Systems

political leaders is that business officials' words count for
something, while politicians always make promises that they don't
keep.</P>
      <P>Addressing the 2nd International Conference of Young Leaders,
which opened in Taipei on Monday, Tu called for Taiwan business
figures to make a greater contribution to the public, in addition to
paying attention to their businesses.</P>
      <P>Tu is a devout philanthropist has made donations worth NT$2.8
billion (US$91.8 million) to charity causes in Taiwan over the past
three years. He vowed to his audience Tuesday that he will donate all
of his fortune, worth approximately NT$28 billion (US$0.92 billion),
to Taiwan's society after he dies.</P>
      <P>Tu holds a science doctorate from a United States university, and

has not been confined to the boardroom, and is a life-time volunteer
with the Buddhist Tzu Chi Compassionate Relief Foundation. His
volunteer efforts include relief work at home and abroad, including
Cambodia and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Even today, Tu continues to sweep the streets in his neighborhood
every morning that it doesn't rain, a habit he took up about five
years ago after his doctor told him that he needed more physical
exercise. Tu chose to serve the community rather than working out in
a personal gym.</P>
      <P>Tu told the young leaders that the past several years, during
which he has devoted money as well as his heart and soul to society,
have been the happiest of his entire life.</P>
      <P>After having spent most of his life in business, Tu said that the
more successful he was as a business leader, the more aware he became
that a genuine leader is not just capable of making breakthroughs in
his working field -- he also must know how to delegate power.</P>
      <P>Tu stressed that only when a leader begins to care about people
and makes an actual contribution to society can he be a true leader.

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee will deliver his farewell
speech at the closing ceremony of the National Assembly (NA) on May
19, one day before he officially steps down from office.</P>
      <P>Deputies of the NA held a marathon meeting on Monday to reduce
the body's power after passing second and third readings of the
constitutional amendment bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lin Jung-teh (KMT) proposed that President Lee Teng-hui be
invited to deliver his outgoing speech at the closing ceremony of the
current National Assembly meeting on May 19. Lin's proposal followed
the NA's acceptance of the constitutional amendment bill by second
and third readings on Monday at midnight.</P>
      <P>Invitations will be also extended to the international media to
cover President Lee's speech and further publicize Taiwan's
democratization, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, all political parties -- with the exception of the
newly-established People First Party (PFP) -- hailed the National
Assembly's deputies for their achievement in reducing the body's
power.</P>
      <P>New Party Legislator Hau Lung-pin praised the deputies for
amending the constitution to convert the National Assembly into a
task-oriented organization.</P>
      <P>Hau also called on President-elect Chen Shui-bian to convoke a
non-partisan constitutional consultation forum as soon as possible to
discuss issues related to the government system and parliamentary
reform.</P>
      <P>Deputy Chen Chin-teh, convener of the DPP caucus in the NA, said
that the NA's acceptance on Monday of the constitutional amendment to
reduce its power has restored political power to the people of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary General Yu Hsi-kun cited the benefits of the
passage of the constitutional amendment bill. These include the
establishment of a unicameral parliament, as well as the
consolidation of power among the three main branches of the
government -- the legislative, judicial and executive branches, Yu
said.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tsai Cheng-yuan, convener of the KMT caucus in the NA,
said that the successful passage of the constitutional amendment
conformed with the expectations of the people.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Chairman of the Central Election Commission
Huang Hsih-cheng said that a CEC meeting on Tuesday will discuss how
to cancel the forthcoming NA election, in accordance with the results
of the NA constitutional amendment.</P>
      <P>The NT$200,000 deposited by each candidate as guarantee fee will

help computer users to get rid of the CIH virus.</P>
      <P>Chen suggested that users may also visit www.xlinux.com.tw and
download the ANTICIH.EXE program if they are really worried about
their computers, and said that as a last resort, users should not
start up their computers on April 26.</P>
      <P>Chen, who graduated from Taipei's Tatung College of Industrial
Technology, created the Chernobyl virus when he was still studying at
the college.</P>
      <P>The virus, which is believed to have first attacked computers in
Taiwan in June 1998, can erase data stored on hard drives and make it
impossible to restart the computer by damaging the computer's basic
startup program.</P>
      <P>The virus targets computers running Windows 95 and 98 and is
spread mainly via the Internet and through the use of pirated
software.</P>
      <P>It exists in at least three versions, the most destructive of
which is timed to hit every April 26, the anniversary of the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster.</P>

    <HEADLINE>M1B MONEY SUPPLY HITS FIVE-YEAR HIGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  25  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The domestic money supply continued to
grow in March, reflecting flourishing business and financial
activities in the country, the Central Bank of China (CBC) reported
on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The annual growth rates of the three indices used to measure the
domestic credit situation all rose throughout the month, CBC
officials said.</P>
      <P>According to CBC tallies, the narrowly defined M1A, which
comprises currency in circulation and checking and demand deposits,
rose 12.03 percent in March over the year-earlier level, and was up
2.73 percentage points over February's figure.</P>
      <P>The M1B -- the M1A plus passbook savings deposits -- grew at an
annual rate of 19.88 percent in March, a 67-month high. The figure
was an increase of 0.83 percentage points from February. The M1B is
considered by some economists as the most effective gauge of a
country's credit situation.</P>
      <P>The broadly defined M2, which comprises cash in circulation,
checking accounts, demand and savings deposits, and quasi-money
(including time deposits and treasury bills), grew at an annual rate
of 8.23 percent in March, 0.1 percentage points lower than the
February figure.</P>
      <P>CBC officials attributed the drastically increased M1A and M1B
annual growth rates in March to the bullish stock market during the
period and a relatively lower comparison basis in March 1999.</P>
      <P>They attributed the slightly lower M2 to the fact that the speed
of foreign capital influx subsided during the month.</P>
      <P>The officials said they have been closely monitoring the M1A and
M1B growths -- which have been faster in the first three months of
this year than those in the past several years -- out of fear that
faster money supply growth may trigger heavier inflationary pressure
on the domestic economy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE IN 2000 EXPECTED TO EXCEED 6%</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  25 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth rate in 2000 is
expected to exceed 6 percent, Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chiang made the forecast at a forum during the Second
International Conference of Young Leaders that opened on Monday and
is scheduled to close on Friday.</P>
      <P>Chiang estimated Taiwan's average annual economic growth rate
over the next 10 years at 5.5 percent. He also predicted that by
2004, Taiwan's per capita GNP (gross national product) will break the
US$20,000 mark and that the island's inflation rate will be less than
3 percent by then.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the privately run Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research (TIER) on Tuesday revised upward its estimated figure for
Taiwan's economic growth rate in 2000 to 6.49 percent from the
originally forecast 6.28 percent. TIER made the revision on the
grounds that Taiwan's exports have maintained a bullish trend since
the beginning of the year.</P>
      <P>However, TIER's figure is still lower than that forecast by the
Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics, which predicted 6.54-percent growth.</P>
      <P>Another private body, the Chung-Hua Institute for Economic
Research (CIER) last week also modified upward its estimated figure
for Taiwan's 2000 economic growth rate to 6.66 percent.</P>
      <P>Despite the differences among the economic forecasts, the upward
revisions indicate that Taiwan's economic situation for 2000 is rosy.</P>

      <P>The chairman of the Central Election
Commission (CEC) officially announced on Tuesday that the fourth
National Assembly (NA) election had been suspended.</P>
      <P>The announcement came after the CEC met to discuss the events

NA passed a constitutional amendment to reduce the NA's power.</P>
      <P>CEC officials decided to cancel the election, and also canceled
the announcement of candidates' serial numbers which had been

      <P>Asked whether the CEC will use national funds to compensate
candidates who have already passed the qualification screening, Huang
avoided the question, and said only that the decision to cancel the
election was in line with the constitutional amendment passed by the
assembly in a late-night session on Monday.</P>
      <P>Local election committees will refund the NT$200,000 guarantee

    <HEADLINE>BLUSTER WILL ONLY DRIVE TAIPEI, BEIJING FARTHER APART: PRESIDENT-ELECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC President-elect Chen Shui-bian offered
mainland China another olive branch on Tuesday when he said the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait should shelve sensitive political topics
and cooperate fully in economic and technological development.</P>
      <P>Chen made the appeal during a courtesy call on K.T. Li, an
incumbent senior adviser to the president who has been lauded as "the
father of Taiwan's technological development" for his contribution to
the establishment of the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park and
to Taiwan's economic take-off in the 1970s.</P>
      <P>After inviting Li to continue serving as a senior adviser to the
president after the May 20 presidential inauguration, Chen said that
both sides of the Taiwan Strait must learn from Chinese sage
Confucius' teaching that political leaders should govern in a
benevolent, magnanimous manner to win the hearts and minds of people
at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>Chen said goodwill and sincerity are needed to mend the gap
between the two sides and that Taiwan would ease its defensiveness if
Beijing were to become more pleasant to the island's 23 million
residents.</P>
      <P>"The two sides of the Taiwan Strait must rely on goodwill and
magnanimity to narrow the gap, as venomous words and saber-rattling
will only drive the two sides farther apart," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He also cited the fable -- concerning a competition between the
north wind and the sun to see which of them could make a man take off
his coat -- to advise Beijing to stop its military threats against
Taiwan. Chen pointed out that the warmth of the sun easily prompted
the man to take off his coat, while no matter how hard the cold wind
blew, it only prompted the man to pull his coat even closer about
him.</P>
      <P>Noting that there is ample room for the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait to cooperate in trade and technological development, Chen said
he earnestly hopes that Taiwan and mainland China set aside certain
thorny, sensitive political issues and cooperate with each other for
mutual benefits.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING STEPS UP MILITARY TRAINING TO INTIMIDATE TAIWAN: MND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  25  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
broke silence and warned on Tuesday that mainland China has
stepped up military training along its southeastern coast
opposite Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The ministry has detected that mainland China's air force is
intensifying combat training and its navy has also launched training
programs in waters off its southeastern province of Zhejiang and from
there to the disputed Tiaoyutai islands," MND spokesman Gen. Kung
Fan-ding told a routine press conference.</P>
      <P>Judging from those activities, Kung said, the MND does not rule
out the possibility of mainland China launching military exercises,
even live-fire war games, either before or after the inauguration of
the Republic of China's new president on May 20.</P>
      <P>Kung said many types of mainland warplanes, including H-6
bombers and attack planes, have joined specially designed
long-distance, trans-military regions training activities.</P>
      <P>Military sources said H-6 bombers are usually deployed in
mainland China's inland military regions. Their participation in
military training in its frontline Nanjing military region close to
Taiwan indicates that those training programs are very
likely aimed at threatening Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tension across the Taiwan Strait has been running high
since Chen Shui-bian of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive
Party won the March 18 presidential election. Beijing has been
pressuring Chen to embrace its "one China" policy which
downgrades the ROC to a province of the PRC. Chen has resisted
Beijing's demand, insisting that "one China" could be the agenda of
bilateral dialogue but not a premise.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN STRAIT ISSUE COULD AFFECT WORLD IF NOT RESOLVED PEACEFULLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  25  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Strait issue is not just a
problem for Taiwan and mainland China, it could have an adverse
impact on the entire world if it is not handled properly, the
publisher of US-based Forbes magazine said here on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Steve Forbes, who called in his own magazine for Senate passage
of the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act (TSEA) to help deter communist
Chinese military attacks on Taiwan, said that if the United States is
unable to stick to its stance that the Taiwan Strait impasse should
be resolved peacefully, it could lead to results that would exert an
immense adverse impact on the entire world, not just the
Asian-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Addressing the Taipei media over tea, Forbes noted that the
United States' consistent policy, set forth in the 1979 Taiwan
Relations Act, stipulates clearly that the Taiwan Strait issue should
never be resolved by force and that all other negative means,
including trade sanctions, embargo and use of force in the strait,
are unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Forbes noted that Taiwan's political leaders, including
President-elect Chen Shui-bian, have refrained from issuing
independence rhetoric in order to try their utmost not to provoke
Beijing, and said Beijing should not be discontented with the
situation. He added that the United States' responsibility is not to
support Taiwan independence, but neither should it support Beijing
imposing its will on Taiwan through force.</P>
      <P>Forbes, chairman and editor-in-chief of the largest business
magazine in the United States, wrote an editorial in the March 20
edition of the magazine calling for the Senate to pass the TSEA so as
to help deter mainland Chinese military attacks on Taiwan and
criticizing the Clinton Administration for condoning the mainland's
increasingly threatening intimidation of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He added that neither President Bill Clinton nor Vice President
Al Gore support the TSEA, but noted that the trend across the United
States is that most Americans perceive that the Taiwan Strait issue
cannot be resolved by force.</P>
      <P>Forbes has twice expressed his own presidential aspirations, in
the 1996 campaign and again in the 2000 campaign.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ACER CHAIRMAN MAKES LOW-PROFILE VISIT TO BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  April  25  (CNA)
(By Peng Si-chou and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Stan Shih, chairman of Taiwan's Acer
Group, made a low-profile visit to mainland China on Tuesday after it
was rumored that Beijing had accused him of supporting Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>Shih, a national affairs advisor of President-elect Chen
Shui-bian of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, was
to attend a seminar with his mainland trade partners in Beijing on
April 26 and participate in "various activities" organized by the
International Digital Group.</P>
      <P>However, Acer officials stationed in Beijing said Shih's agenda
in Beijing will be kept low-profile and secret.</P>
      <P>Mainland leaders recently blasted certain Taiwan businessmen for
supporting Taiwan independence while reaping the benefits of
investment in the mainland, and have warned these businessmen not to
support Taiwan independence if they want to continue investing there.</P>
      <P>Beijing officials have also canceled invitations to Shih to
participate in some seminars originally scheduled to take place in
Beijing in May.</P>
      <P>Acer officials have clarified to the Beijing authorities that the
group has always maintained a neutral political stance and did not
support any specific presidential candidate or political party during
the election. They added that any presidential candidate can ask Shih
to serve as an advisor.</P>
      <P>However, it is widely believed that Beijing would face
difficulties if it should try to limit Acer's investments in the
mainland, because such action would prompt other Taiwan businessmen,
many of whom are also major sources of investment for the mainland,
to pull out and take their money with them.</P>

    <HEADLINE>12 STATE AND GOV'T HEADS TO ATTEND PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  26  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite Beijing's blustering, political
and government leaders from among Taiwan's diplomatic allies are
still scheduled to come to Taipei to attend the presidential
inauguration ceremony next month, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>As of Wednesday, more than two dozen political and government
leaders, including a king, five presidents, four vice presidents, and
two prime ministers, have promised to attend the inauguration
ceremony of President-elect Chen Shui-bian slated for May 20, said
Liu Chih-kung, director of the MOFA's Department of North American
Affairs.</P>
      <P>Other leaders who are scheduled to attend the inauguration
include four governors, three parliamentarian speakers, and six
foreign affairs ministers, Liu noted.</P>
      <P>Liu said that ever since March 18 when Democratic Progressive
Party candidate Chen Shui-bian was elected as the next president of
the Republic of China, Beijing has attempted to discourage world
political and government leaders from organizing congratulatory
delegations to Taiwan, from making remarks congratulating Taiwan for
the election, and from inviting ROC officials to visit their
countries.</P>
      <P>In related news, Liu noted, Washington's attitude is of crucial
importance to cross Taiwan Strait relations, adding that the fact it
sent special envoys to both Beijing and Taipei after Chen's election
underlined that the US government has been paying close attention to
the cross-strait issue.</P>
      <P>Liu said the United States has so far viewed Chen's remarks
concerning the volatile issue cross-strait relations in a positive
way.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New Philippine Representative to the
Republic of China Rodolfo T. Reyes arrived in Taipei on Wednesday to
assume office.</P>
      <P>Reyes said upon his arrival at Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport that he hopes to forge good relations with all quarters of
Taiwan society.</P>
      <P>Noting that there are no direct airlinks between Taiwan and the
Philippines at the moment, Reyes said he will do his utmost to push
for an early resumption of direct flight services between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>Reyes, 62, said he will pay visits to the ROC's Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
to discuss the airlink issue with relevant ROC officials.</P>
      <P>Reyes promised to coordinate with the ROC officials to work out a
mutually acceptable solution to the aviation rights issue.
Nevertheless, Reyes said he cannot explain his country's stance on
the issue before meeting ROC officials.</P>
      <P>Reyes was appointed by Philippine President Joseph Estrada to his
new Taipei post. A seasoned journalist, Reyes was Estrada's press
secretary until early this month. He also served as former President
Fidel Ramos' press secretary from July 1, 1992 to May 10, 1993.</P>
      <P>Political observers said Reyes' new assignment indicates that the
Philippine government attaches great importance to its relations with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Philippines has official diplomatic relations with mainland
China, but maintains close economic ties with the ROC. However, the
two countries have been at odds over civil aviation issues since late
last year. At the request of Philippine Airlines, Manila civil
aviation authorities in mid-February prohibited Taiwan carriers from
offering Taipei-Manila flight services. In response, the ROC
suspended the Philippine carrier's right to operate flight services
between the two countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOW POSSIBILITY OF CROSS-STRAIT WAR: VICE DEFENSE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The possibility of war breaking out with
mainland China after Taiwan President-elect Chen Shui-bian takes
office on May 20 is low, Vice National Defense Minister T.Y. Sun told
reporters on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking after taking part in a public hearing at the Legislative
Yuan, Sun said that since Chen has demonstrated a high degree of
sincerity and goodwill toward mainland China following his election
as the Republic of China's new president on March 18, it is not very
possible that war will break out between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait under the current circumstances.</P>
      <P>According to Sun, Chen of the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) has sought to show great sincerity toward the
mainland by proclaiming that he will continue to follow the steps
promulgated in the Guidelines for National Unification, and that the
goal of Taiwan independence in the DPP's platform will not be
inserted into the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Citing the Korean peninsula as an example, Sun said that judging
from past experience, the chance of war will be "zero," even in a
dangerous situation, so long as the two parties involved act with
great caution.</P>
      <P>For instance, the two Koreas have been arch-rivals since the
beginning of the Korean War in 1953, but there has been no
large-scale conflict since the end of that war, and the two sides are
now even preparing to hold a historic summit this summer, he noted.</P>
      <P>The vice national defense minister analyzed, however, that war
could have raged at any time should either side have failed to
estimate the situation correctly.</P>
      <P>Turning to reports that US aircraft carriers are conducting
military exercises in waters off the island of Guam, Sun said he has
not received any information in this regard, and added that in any
case, it should be routine training for the US Seventh Fleet which
does not necessarily have anything to do with the situation in the
Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING CONTINUES TO INCREASE PRESSURE ON TAIWAN SAYS MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  26  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing has continued to increase its
pressure on Taiwan since Taiwan's presidential election on March 18,
sources from the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Analyzing Beijing's latest policies towards Taiwan since the
election, MAC officials said the Communist Chinese have evidently
played double-handed schemes. Beijing clearly upped the ante and kept
up a barrage against Taiwan in the run-up to the election in an
attempt to spook voters into not voting for candidates advocating
independence for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During that period, MAC officials said, Beijing publicized its
white paper on its one China policy and the Taiwan issue, threatening
to use force against Taiwan if the island continued to delay talks on
unification indefinitely.</P>
      <P>After Chen's victory, the officials added, Beijing demonstrated a
degree of moderation, probably due to the fact it had not yet clearly
thought out what to do in the wake of that development, saying it
would be "listening to their (Taiwan's new leaders) words and
watching their actions."</P>
      <P>MAC officials also noted that while Beijing suspended all
contacts at quasi-official levels, it seems to have resumed direct
contacts between its officials and Taiwan's.</P>
      <P>While the exchanges between Beijing's intermediary body, the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, and its Taipei
counterpart, the Straits Exchange Foundation, have remained at an
impasse since last July, Beijing has allowed officials from the
Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council to visit Taiwan one after
another, MAC officials said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the officials said, Li Bingcai, deputy director of
mainland China's Central Office for Taiwan Affairs (previously the
State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office), was quoted as having said on
April 8 that pro-independence Taiwanese business and trade leaders
who maintain operations on the mainland will not be allowed to
"harvest any fortune" in China. It, however, remains to be seen
whether Li's remarks reflect Beijing's policy, the officials added.</P>

(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada's Immigration Minister Elinor
Caplan on Tuesday described the growing trade in illegal immigrants
as "akin to human slavery."</P>
      <P>In a speech to the Canada China Business Council in Beijing,
Camplan stressed that neither Canada nor Mainland China can afford to
tolerate "these criminal practices."</P>
      <P>By cramming hundreds of illegal immigrants onto rickety cargo
ships, she said, smugglers "place countless lives in danger and
undermine public confidence in both our immigration and refugee
programs, and in the many close ties that our countries enjoy."</P>
      <P>As she spoke, police in the mainland Chinese coastal province of
Fujian staged a large crackdown on "snakeheads" -- or smugglers of
human beings -- who have been blamed for shipping boatloads of
illegals around the world, mostly to North America.</P>
      <P>She vowed that Canada would "adopt tough new measures to deal
with those who would abuse its immigration and refugee system."</P>
      <P>The minister said Canada was working with Chinese officials to
co-ordinate efforts and that she was visiting China to observe
first-hand the initiatives China's Public Security and Frontier
Defense officials are taking to halt the illegal traffic.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, she will travel to Fujian province, the jumping off
point for many of the refugees who attempt to illegally emigrate to
Canada, the United States and Australia.</P>
      <P>The minister said the debt taken on by individuals to pay for
illegal passage abroad -- running as high as US$60,000 -- typically
has to be repaid "over a short and cruel lifetime of illicit
activity, sexual exploitation and forced labor."</P>
      <P>Four ships with some 600 Mainland Chinese nationals landed off
the coast of British Columbia last year. About 100 of the migrants
have since been returned to China.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra, April 26 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Palestine has threatened to ask all Arab
countries to boycott the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney this September
to voice its anger over the erection of a memorial to murdered
Israeli athletes near the Olympic Stadium.</P>
      <P>The Australian quoted the Palestinian National Olympic Committee
(PNOC) as confirming on Tuesday night that it had "grave concerns
about the memorial" built last year by Olympic Games organizers to
commemorate 11 Israeli athletes and officials killed by terrorists at
the 1972 Munich Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>The PNOC regards the memorial as "humiliating" to all Arab
countries and has made the first threat of a political nature to the
Sydney Olympic Games organizers, the daily reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The Palestinian Authority is calling upon Arab states to
consider not showing up for the Olympics in Sydney, Australia, this
summer," the Australian quoted the official PNOC journal as saying.</P>
      <P>A PNOC spokesman said on Tuesday that "it's a dangerous thing for
the Palestinian people, this monument. The Israelis are executing
Palestinians every day in Lebanon and Bethlehem and there are no
memorials for us. This is humiliating," according to the Australian.</P>
      <P>The memorial on Olympic Boulevard in Sydney lists the names of
those who were killed and displays a short quote -- "they were
swifter than eagles and stronger than lions" -- from the Book of
Samuel.</P>
      <P>It is the first memorial of its kind built outside Munich and was
funded by organizers of the Sydney Games, along with leading Jews,
the daily reported.</P>
      <P>The Palestinian threat follows a recent International Olympic
Games announcement that a "full house" of IOC member countries would
compete in this year's sports event, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>The Palestinians' objection to the monument supersedes an earlier
concern over a plan to observe one minute of silence during the
opening ceremony for the Israeli athletes killed. That proposal was
rejected in February by organizers of the Sydney Games after
intensive lobbying, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>Palestine, which is yet to be sanctioned as a separate state,
sent two athletes to the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games and was planning
to send a larger contingent to Sydney this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>1ST BATCH OF 500 CONSCRIPTS TO JOIN `ALTERNATIVE SERVICE' THIS YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An initial batch of 500 conscripts will be
assigned to do social work this year as alternative to compulsory
military service, sources from the Ministry of the Interior (MOI)
reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>It will be the first time that the Republic of China has
introduced alternative military service for its conscripts.</P>
      <P>Of about 5,000 eligible conscripts this year, 500 will be allowed
to participate in alternative service, with applicants drawing lots
to decide whether they can enter the program, said Hsiao Yu-huang,
director of the MOI's Department of Social Affairs.</P>
      <P>The conscripts, who will be scheduled to report to their service
posts beginning early October, will serve as caretakers in public-run
nursing homes and institutions for the mentally or
physically-challenged, Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>The conscription period for the alternative social workers, all
male and aged around 20, will be two years and two months. Their
salaries and other fringe benefits will be similar to those for
military conscripts, Hsiao added.</P>
      <P>Before beginning their stints as social workers, the new recruits
will first receive five weeks of basic military training and attend a
three-week workshop for special job training.</P>
      <P>The ROC is the first non-European country to implement an
alternative military service system to ensure more efficient, fair
and just use of its manpower resources.</P>
      <P>In years to come, more young men will be allowed to serve through
alternative military service, and jobs available will include
firefighting, other social services, environmental protection and
medical services, Hsiao went on.</P>
      <P>Under the alternative service regulations, those who have passed
special national examinations and have obtained professional licenses
will enjoy preferential opportunities to land alternative service
jobs, while other applicants will have to draw lots.</P>
      <P>Those who are "unsuited" for normal military service, whether due
to family factors or special religious beliefs, can also apply to do
alternative service.</P>

    <DATELINE>Shenzhen,  Guangdong,  April 26 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A respected senior Hong Kong
journalist on Wednesday appealed to mainland China to be more
tolerant to help solve the cross-Taiwan Strait impasse regarding the
issue of "one China."</P>
      <P>Pok Shau-fu, publisher of the Hong Kong-based Newsdom Weekly,
suggested that mainland China could state that "one China" is both a
principle and also an issue for renewed cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait have locked horns on the issue
of "one China," with Beijing insisting that the "one China" principle
should be a precondition for renewed cross-strait talks, and Taipei
saying that the two sides can talk about anything so long as "one
China" is not a principle.</P>
      <P>Pok said that if mainland China were to stress that "one China" 
is not the People's Republic of China, nor the Republic of China, but
a unified new China forged by the people on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait, it would help assuage the misgivings of ROC President-elect
Chen Shui-bian and Vice President-elect Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>In this way, Pok said, both sides would be able to hold meetings
very soon to discuss peaceful unification.</P>
      <P>He also said that it is undeniable that a gap between the two
sides exists, and time is needed to make mutual adjustments and
reforms.</P>
      <P>The unification of the two sides would be "natural" when the
ideologies, living standards, social orientation, economic activities
and political systems have merged and fused on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait, he said.</P>
      <P>Pok made the remarks during an interview with CNA in
Shenzhen, Guangdong province where a two-day conference on
anti-Taiwan independence and the promotion of unification was held.</P>
      <P>More than 200 experts and scholars from the mainland, Taiwan and

    <HEADLINE>DGBAS WILL NOT REVISE UPWARD TAIWAN'S ANNUAL ECONOMIC GROWTH: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  26  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There is no reason strong enough to
convince the government to revise upward its estimate for Taiwan's
2000 economic growth rate, a government official said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wei Duan, director-general of the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting &amp; Statistics (DGBAS) under the Executive Yuan, noted that
although some domestic private economic research organizations have
adjusted upward their estimates for the island's annual economic
growth for 2000, the DGBAS is unlikely to follow suit.</P>
      <P>Wei was referring to adjustments made by the Chung-Hua Institute
for Economic Research and the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research,
which have revised their figures upward to 6.66 percent and 6.49
percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Economic growth will be supported by robust foreign trade, rosy
domestic consumption and increasing private investment, according to
officials of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research. The institute
on Tuesday revised the island's estimated economic growth for this
year from the previous 6.28 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, various investigations involving the manufacturing
sector also show robust prospects for the island's economic
performance.</P>
      <P>However, Wei said that although there is little possibility of
having to revise Taiwan's economic growth downward for this year, the
government still lacks a strong enough reason to adjust upward its
original estimate.</P>
      <P>The current situation regarding the island's exports is indeed
very good, but that is not to say that all the economic indicators
sound optimistic, remarked Wei.</P>
      <P>For instance, he continued, export growth has been high, but
import growth has been higher, and if the huge amount of imported
capital goods are not put into circulation immediately, the island's
economic growth this year will be adversely affected as a result of a
decrease in trade surplus.</P>
      <P>Wei said the government's estimate of 6.54 percent annual
economic growth for 2000 is a rather fair figure, and second only to
mainland China among the major countries of the world. Taiwan's
economic performance is therefore really a great success, he
concluded.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President-elect Chen
Shui-bian paid a visit to former Premier Hau Pei-tsun on Wednesday
for talks on a wide range of issues.</P>
      <P>Chen first offered his sincere apology to Hau for his impolite
words and deeds against Hau during Hau's stint as premier. At that
time, Chen was a legislator and joined his Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) colleagues in a campaign against the appointment of Hau,
a four-star general who had served as chief of the General Staff and
minister of national defense, as premier.</P>
      <P>The DPP's pro-independence stance also prompted Chen to confront
Hau, a strong anti-independence and pro-unification advocate, in many
question-and-answer sessions in the legislature after Hau assumed the
premiership.</P>
      <P>Chen apologized for his previous less-than-subtle rhetoric and
behavior, and added that he believes history will give fair and just
judgment to Hau's contribution to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that times are changing and that both he and the
DPP have also been adjusting their thinking and vision. "Nowadays, I
believe that the DPP and I share common views and consensus with Hau
on many issues, as we are all concerned about our national security."</P>
      <P>The lawyer-turned-politician further said after his 50-minute
closed-door meeting with Hau that as the ROC's new leader and armed
forces chief, he will consistently put national interest above all
and will never force the military to accept his personal ideology.</P>
      <P>Chen said he solicited Hau's views concerning military build-up
and combat preparedness, as well as cross-Taiwan Strait issues.</P>
      <P>"Hau told me that the highest goal of combat preparedness is to
avoid war, and that national security cannot simply rely on weaponry
procurement and an arms build-up," Chen said, adding he agreed with
Hau's views that wisdom is the most important factor in resolving
cross-strait issues and that non-military strength is often critical
to ensuring national security.</P>
      <P>For his part, Hau said the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should
reconcile and use strictly peaceful means to resolve bilateral
disputes.</P>
      <P>Noting that maintaining Taiwan's political status quo is the
mainstream public opinion on the island, Hau said he hopes Chen's
administration will deal with cross-strait issues prudently and
wisely.</P>
      <P>Hau further said he generally agreed with Chen's post-election
words and deeds, particularly Chen's choice of incumbent Defense
Minister Tang Fei as premier. "It's a wise choice," he added.</P>
      <P>Hau said he will be more than willing to offer his counsel
concerning national affairs for as long as Chen requires it.
Nevertheless, he politely rejected an invitation from the
president-elect to serve as a senior adviser to the president in the
incoming government on the grounds that he is satisfied with his
retirement and has no intention of changing his current way of life.</P>

People's Political Consultative Conference, said the mainland
authorities have noticed the efforts made by Chen to ease
cross-Taiwan Strait tensions since his election as Taiwan's new

      <P>Zhang stressed, however, that the core issue between the two
sides is that Chen must accept the "one China" principle and "admit"
that Taiwan is an unalienable part of mainland China.</P>

claimed that the situation between Taiwan and mainland China has come
to a critical turning point. Taiwan's future, and Chen's ability to
maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait, have become a major focus of
international attention, he noted.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan moves toward independence, it will push the two sides
toward the brink of war, he warned.</P>
      <P>Wang Chin-ping, vice chairman of the Taiwan-based China
Unification Alliance, described the meeting as a "patriotic
gathering."</P>
      <P>Stressing that the theme of the meeting is to forge consensus on
ways to promote unification and dissolve pro-Taiwan independence
forces, Wang blasted "certain US arms dealers and opinion leaders,
and some Japanese figures," for seeking chances to split China by
pushing Taiwan to the edge of war.</P>
      <P>The meeting, attended by more than 200 academics and opinion
leaders from Taiwan, mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao, will run
through Thursday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S ECONOMY TO GROW AT 6.3% THIS YEAR:  ADB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  26  (CNA)
(By Belle Chou and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Asia will once again enjoy the fastest
economic growth in the world this year, with the economic growth in
Taiwan projected at 6.3 percent, according to a report released by
the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In its report "Asian Development Outlook 2000," the ADB said the
reconstruction work in Taiwan after the devastating Sept. 21
earthquake in 1999, coupled with bullish exports, have created a boom
for the country.</P>
      <P>The ADB's economic forecast of 6.3 percent for Taiwan is close to
this island's official forecast of 6.54 percent.</P>
      <P>However, the ADB analyzed that after Taiwan's entry to the World
Trade Organization, its manufacturing sector will reap great
benefits, but its agricultural sector will face greater competition.</P>
      <P>The report indicated that Asia has begun recovering fast, with
growth in gross domestic product projected at 6.2 percent this year,
an increase of 3.9 percent compared to last year's figure. The
report added that the industrial production of the region in general
has reached the levels recorded before the 1997 Asian financial
crisis.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the report suggested that in the Greater Chinese Area,
Hong Kong should improve its pollution or risk increased medical
costs and a reduction in productivity.</P>
      <P>The ADB also suggested that mainland China should make efforts to
reduce its unemployment rate, although it added that its
gross domestic product growth is projected at 6.5 percent this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INVADING TAIWAN WOULD COST MAINLAND CHINA DEARLY: MAC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If mainland China were to launch an attack
on Taiwan, the mainland economy might regress 20 years and its
leaders would face pressure to step down, a senior mainland affairs
official said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chon-pin, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC), made the remarks at a public hearing on the Taiwan
Strait situation in the wake of the Republic of China's March 18
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lin said President-elect Chen Shui-bian of the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has shown a great deal of goodwill
to mainland China since his election as the ROC's next leader,
adding: "Chen's olive branches to Beijing have almost reached
breaking point."</P>
      <P>Commenting on a Ministry of National Defense report that mainland
China's air force and navy have stepped up training drills along its
southeastern coast opposite Taiwan in a possible attempt to launch a
new round of saber-rattling against the island to coincide with
Chen's May 20 inauguration, Lin said there is still not enough
evidence to prove that the mainland will attack Taiwan in the near
future.</P>
      <P>Lin said mainland China's action toward Taiwan mainly hinges on
three factors -- mainland China's domestic situation, the United
States' attitude, and Taiwan's action, in descending order.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Beijing has toned down its bellicose rhetoric
against Taiwan since March 18. "This mainly reflects that mainland
China is conducting an internal review and adjustment as the island's
presidential result has made Beijing leaders aware that there is a
gap between their understanding of Taiwan and the reality on the
island."</P>
      <P>Lin went on to say that the United States is now more active and
definite in handling Taiwan Strait issues than it was between 1995
and 1996, the last time Beijing conducted large-scale and
live-fire war games designed to intimidate Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The US government now believes that it must spell out its
opposition to mainland China's use of force against Taiwan," Lin
said, adding that recent frequent visits to both sides of the Taiwan
Strait by incumbent and retired US officials have been mainly aimed
at discouraging Beijing from taking excessive action against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As for mainland China's domestic situation, Lin said the mainland
has been in the grip of an economic recession since October 1998 that
has aggravated social unrest and has led to factional strife among
mainland leaders.</P>
      <P>Lin said while some hawkish mainland leaders, mainly military
brass, favor using force to unify Taiwan, other officials prefer to
squeeze Taiwan's diplomatic frontiers and suppress its presence in
the world arena.</P>
      <P>At the moment, Lin said, several other factors would restrict
mainland China from launching a military attack on Taiwan, including
its inability to seize Taiwan rapidly, possible US intervention,
regression of its economic development by about 20 years, decline in
national tax revenues, sharp increase in unemployment and possible
downfall of the current mainland leadership.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Lin urged mainland leaders to stop their
bluster against Taiwan and make a positive response to Chen's olive
branches.</P>

      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC)
agreed on Tuesday to cancel the National Assembly (NA) election in
accordance with the law, CEC Chairman Huang Shih-cheng announced on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remark in response to complaints from candidates
who had already passed the qualification screening process for the
election, and have actively thrown themselves into the race.</P>
      <P>The NA election was originally scheduled for May 6, but was
formally canceled by the CEC on Tuesday in line with a constitutional
amendment passed by the assembly in a late-night session on the
previous day.</P>
      <P>The CEC released the election gazette on March 30 following the
Council of Grand Justices ruling that the extension of NA deputies'
four-year terms by another two years was null and void. The NA
delegates' decision to extend their own tenure had caused a public
furor.</P>
      <P>The NA passed an amendment on Monday that would virtually dismiss
the 339-member organization, the function of which has been to
approve constitutional changes.</P>
      <P>By passing the amendment, the NA will transfer most of its

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei Railway Station has become a
new resort for foreign laborers in the city, with a large number of
alien workers jamming the station's main hall on Sundays and
national holidays.</P>
      <P>In the past, foreign laborers mainly converged at a Catholic
church on Taipei's Chungshan N. Road, the Chungshan Stadium, the
Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall Complex and the Taipei City Zoo in
Mucha.</P>
      <P>But recently, the Taipei Railway Station has emerged as a new
favorite spot for foreign workers to meet friends on holidays
because the terminal is spacious and air-conditioned.</P>
      <P>On Sundays, large crowds of foreign laborers swarm to the
railway station in downtown Taipei. Many of them then sit down on the
ground of the main hall, eat snacks and chat loudly.</P>
      <P>According to a survey of 272 local passengers at the railway
station, aged between 20 and 45, on April 23, 76 percent of the
respondents said they felt either "bad" or "disgusting" at the
noise and chaos caused by the convergence of so many foreign laborers
at one of Taipei's main gateways.</P>
      <P>Twenty-eight percent of those interviewed said they felt untold
fears when they saw the convergence of a large number of foreign
workers at the station; 22 percent said they were afraid that the
foreigners would spoil the environment with litter and noise; 17
percent said they worried that the gathering of foreign laborers may
affect public order or cause criminal activities.</P>
      <P>While only 39 percent said the convergence of foreign laborers
has caused inconveniences at the station, 90 percent said they think
the phenomenon is a negative sub-culture.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 67 percent said they think the Taipei City Hall is
obligated to take effective measures to improve the situation.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by Taipei City Councilor Chin Li-fang
of the New Party. Chin said although the Taipei Railway Station is
under the jurisdiction of the Taiwan Provincial Government, the
Taipei City Hall should work out measures to tackle the problem
since the station is located in the city.</P>

      <P>A Republic of China investment promotion
group led by Lin Nen-chung, director of the Industrial Development

Taiwan on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>More than 100 Japanese investors attended the three-hour seminar
on Taiwan's investment climate, prospects and current economic
developments.</P>
      <P>Lin told the investors that Taiwan's economy will continue to
grow after the historic transition of power on May 20. The Taiwan
Stock Exchange Index has soared since the Democratic Progressive
Party's Chen Shui-bian won the presidential election on March 18. Lin
attributed the rising stock prices to investor confidence in the
president-elect.</P>
      <P>Chen's statements of good will toward the mainland in the past
month have won praises both at home and from foreign countries,
including the United States, Lin said.</P>

      <P>"The new government will promote cross strait relations under the
principles of good will and peaceful cooperation so as to secure a
steady development between the two sides of Taiwan Strait," Lin
quoted Chen as having said.</P>
      <P>Other economic and trade officials also spoke at the seminar. Lu

      <P>Several Asian Development Bank economists
said on Wednesday that they hope both sides of the Taiwan Strait will
be able to enter the World Trade Organization this year, pointing out
that the much-anticipated entry will be in the long-term benefit to
all of Asia.</P>
      <P>ADB Assistant Chief Economist M. Quibria, who is from Bangladesh,
said that after Taiwan joins the WTO, its labor-intensive industries
will be forced to move to other Asian countries. He added that
industries on both sides of the Taiwan Strait will benefit from the
introduction of new technologies from other WTO members.</P>
      <P>Lee Jung Soo, an ADB official from South Korea, said that
mainland China as a WTO member will face pressure to open
agricultural imports. But he added that in the long term, entry into
the WTO will be beneficial to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Shin Myong Ho, a South Korean national and vice president for the

trading organization, it will have to follow WTO rules. He added that
this development will be beneficial to the mainland as well as other

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN EXPEDITION TO RETRACE CONQUEST ROUTE OF GHENGHIS KHAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  26 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A six-member Taiwan expedition will head
for Ulan Bator, Mongolia, on Thursday for a trek retracing the route
of Ghenghis Khan.</P>
      <P>The expedition team, consisting of four men and two women, plans
to take one and a half years to finish the journey, which covers
17,000 kilometers and meanders through 12 nations.</P>
      <P>Starting from Ulan Bator, Mongolia, they will walk across the
Gobi Desert to China, and then to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan,
Turkmenistan, Iran, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Russia before
ending their trek at Simferopol, a Ukrainian city on the Black Sea.</P>
      <P>Their planned route is similar to the path taken by Ghengis Khan
when he conquered most of Asia some 800 years ago.</P>
      <P>Armed with laptop computers, mobile phones and digital cameras,
the team will keep in contact with their support group in Taiwan by
satellite communication. Lai Hsin-hong, leader of the team, said that
his group will post daily trek reports on a specially-created
expedition website (www.seetaiwan.com.tw).</P>
      <P>What worries the expedition team most is not the 30 kilometers
they are supposed to cover every day, but rather the extreme climates
along the route. Temperatures that they will have to endure vary from
40 degrees Celsius at noon in the Gobi to minus 20 degrees Celsius in
Georgia, where the team is expected to arrive in mid-winter next
year.</P>
      <P>They are also worried about their physical safety in Azerbaijan,
where fighting is now raging between rebels and government forces.</P>
      <P>The two female members raised concerns about their half-year
journey through Iran, where they will have to follow the local custom
of covering their faces with veils, said Wang Kwang-yu, one of the
two female members.</P>
      <P>The six members of the team were chosen from a pool of 324
applicants, said Lai Hsin-hong. The successful candidates were then
put through four months of training. They need their countrymen's
support -- both spiritually and materially -- becuase the expedition
will cost about NT$36 million (US$1.2 million).</P>
      <P>The expedition was organized by "PC Home", a local online
newspaper, which is trying to recruit one hundred 100,000 supporters
to chip in for the expedition costs, said Lai.</P>
      <P>If everything goes as planned, the expedition team is expected to
return to Taiwan in October next year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is poised to allow the
devaluation of its currency by widening the tight band within which
the renminbi is permitted to trade, skirting around Beijing's solemn
pledge not to devalue its currency.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Hong Kong, the Australian Financial Review on
Wednesday reported that the depreciation is expected before China
enters the World Trade Organization later this year in a bid to allow
Chinese exporters to compete in the global market.</P>
      <P>The daily reported China's central bank already signalled its
intention to adjust its currency controls for the first time in more
than two years by allowing the renminbi to trade outside the official
band of 8.2770 to 8.2800 to the US dollar earlier this month.</P>
      <P>Most Asian countries hit by the financial crisis in 1997 are now
quickly recovering following the depreciation of their currencies and
strongly emerging in the world market.</P>
      <P>China's exports did surge in March, increasing about 40 percent,

it consequently opens its market wider and further reduces its import

      <P>Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said
Australia is committed to engagement with Asia based on practical
outcomes rather than cultural bonds, the Australian reported on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In a speech to the Beijing Forum organized by the Asia-Australia

drew a distinction between Asian regionalism based upon cultural
factors and one based upon practical outcomes in an effort to refine
Australia's approach to changes in the region, the daily reported
from Beijing.</P>
      <P>"There are really two kinds of regionalism. One is what you might
call a cultural regionalism, which is built on common ties of history
and mutual cultural identity. One might more broadly describe them as
emotional links. That type of regionalism exists in many parts of the
world. Obviously, in terms of Australia's relationship with Asia,
Australia does not fit into that category." Downer told the forum.</P>
      <P>He described the second type of regionalism as practical
regionalism and said this was typified by regional institutions such
as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum and the ASEAN Regional
Forum on security.</P>
      <P>"For us, regionalism is always going to be practical, looking at
ways that we can work with our region to achieve our own economic and

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATURE EXPECTED TO PASS BILL ON SHORTENING WORK HOURS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan is expected to pass a
bill on Friday amending the existing Labor Standards Law to shorten
the maximum weekly work time from 48 hours to 44 hours.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chien Hsi-kun of the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), who initiated the amendment bill, said passage of the bill
will be a much-anticipated gift to all of Taiwan's workers in
celebration of this year's Labor Day on May 1.</P>
      <P>Shortening the work week was also one of President-elect Chen
Shui-bian's campaign promises.</P>
      <P>Chien said he will continue coordinating with the legislative
caucuses of the other major political parties to work out a timetable
for implementing a full-scale five-day work week system.</P>
      <P>"I hope the five-day work week scheme can be fully implemented by
July 1, 2002 to deliver on another of Chen's campaign promises to all
of Taiwan's salaried people," Chien said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the bi-weekly five-day work week system has
now been widely implemented in Taiwan. "As a result, the average
total weekly work time of local workers is now less than 46 hours.
Moreover, many private enterprises have even adopted a full-scale
five-day work week system. Therefore, the current Labor Standards Law
must be revised to match the actual situation concerning the maximum
legal work time," Chien explained.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chien said, since Taiwan's per capita national income
has reached US$14,000, Taiwan must shorten its work week to meet the
world trend, adding that many other countries with lower per capita
national income than Taiwan's, such as mainland China, have adopted a
five-day work week system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US URGED TO CONTINUE SUPPORTING DEMOCRATIC TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  26  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A renowned American China expert
Wednesday urged the United States to continue supporting democratic
Taiwan, saying "America has always supported democracy abroad and
must continue to do so at a time when this involves bigger dangers
and more difficulties."</P>
      <P>John F. Cooper, the Stanley J. Buckman professor of international
studies at Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee, told an audience of
some 200 at a World Affairs Council luncheon in Houston that the
importance of Taiwan's recent presidential election lies in the
consolidation of democracy, adding that it was also a crucial
election in terms of relations between Taiwan, Communist China and
the United States.</P>
      <P>The March 18 election represented the first time in 5,000 years
of Chinese history where political power was transferred peacefully
based on the electorate's direct choice. "It is not the norm in the
world. In fact, it is a rare thing outside Western democratic
countries," emphasized the author of more than 20 books on
contemporary China, Taiwan's political system, and cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>But Cooper pointed out that President-elect Chen Shui-bian will
have difficulties dealing with Communist China because he was seen in
Beijing as Taiwan's foremost advocate of independence from China.
Beijing cannot forgive him for putting such a provision in his
party's charter and for previously talking of a "Republic of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Chen, however, moderated his stance going into the election and
has made numerous conciliatory statements since winning the
presidency. But this may not be enough due to the pressure on
Communist Chinese leaders because of their loss of face with Chen's
election victory, according to the professor.</P>
      <P>He said Americans fail to realize the importance of face and most
of them don't know that there are different factions in the Communist
Chinese government. The military, which has gained in political
influence in recent years, does not like Taiwan. Cross-strait tension
also raises its stock and improves its prospects for bigger budgets.
The old timers, leftists, hard-line Maoists, and some others don't
like Taiwan as well.</P>
      <P>The regime in Beijing has been promoting Chinese nationalism for
the past two decades to fill the spiritual or ideological vacuum
created by the slow dismantling of the communist system. Stimulating
nationalist sentiments also increases the importance of so-called
"lost territory," which some in mainland China feel Taiwan is, noted
Cooper.</P>
      <P>The serious differences in views regarding Taiwan between the US
executive branch and Congress are certainly enough to confuse both
Beijing and the new government in Taipei, which has little experience
in dealing with either Beijing or Washington. "Thus, while Taiwan's
recent election was historic and was a watershed for bringing about a
peaceful transfer of power and thus consolidating Taiwan's `role
model' democracy, it has also created uncertainties and problems," he
said.</P>
      <P>But Cooper stressed that "the United States must recognize
Taiwan's accomplishments. Democracy is the wave of the future around
the world and America has always supported democracy abroad. That
means Americans must applaud Taiwan's accomplishments, but also see
that there are problems to be attended to.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Many athletes who will be competing at
the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games are planning to sleep in oxygen tents
to help boost their performance level and organizers appear
unable to ban the activity.</P>
      <P>The Australian Olympic Committee said there is nothing in the
doping control guidelines that prohibits the use of oxygen tents nor
forbids their presence within the Olympic athletes' village.</P>
      <P>Oxygen tents have become popular recently, especially among
endurance athletes such as triathletes, cyclists, and swimmers,
because they allow athletes to simulate high-altitude conditions.</P>
      <P>Australian scientists, however, said they are not sure whether
the tents are actually effective in enhancing performance.</P>

    <DATELINE>Shenzhen,  April  27  (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior mainland Chinese negotiator
with Taiwan said on Thursday that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
must negotiate unification on an equal footing under the "one China"
principle.</P>
      <P>Tang Shubei, vice president of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), made the remarks in
response to a press inquiry after attending an "anti-independence"
seminar in this southern mainland special economic zone.</P>
      <P>Tang said Beijing's "one China" principle implies that the
world has only one China, of which Taiwan is a part, and that even
though China is not unified now, its territorial integrity cannot be
divided.</P>
      <P>In Beijing's views, Tang said the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait are on an equal footing when they negotiate
under the "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>Under the "one China" principle, Tang explained that cross-strait
negotiation is not negotiation between central and local governments,
not between the PRC central government and local Taiwan authority.</P>
      <P>Tang urged Taiwan's leaders not to think that the "one China"
principle is an insult to Taiwan's dignity, and added that the
principle is not intended to downgrade Taiwan's status.</P>
      <P>Tang further said it is mainland China's prevailing consensus
that the so-called Taiwan issue should not be left unresolved
indefinitely.</P>
      <P>Quoting mainland Chinese leaders, Tang said, mainland people
will not hesitate to shed blood to protect China's territorial
integrity if Taiwan declares independence or enshrines the
"two states theory" into its constitution.</P>
      <P>Tang also said Beijing authorities have noticed that Taiwan's
new leader (President-elect Chen Shui-bian) has sounded conciliatory
note on cross-strait issues. Nevertheless, Tang warned that if Taiwan
is unwilling to accept the "one China" principle, "the consequence
will not be peace, but a disaster, not harmony, but a conflict, not
goodwill, but hostility."</P>

      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui
met on Thursday with several foreign scholars who were in Taipei to
attend an international seminar on culture in the new century.</P>
      <P>Lee warmly welcomed his guests, and then exchanged a wide range

      <P>Taiwan's head of state told his visitors that the main reason
people have moved to Taiwan from mainland China over the past 400
years has been to pursue a free and secure life here. As a result, a

      <P>In order to reconcile newcomers with earlier inhabitants, he
proposed the concept of "new Taiwan people", he told the scholars.</P>
      <P>Lee went on to say that culture develops very slowly and each

    <HEADLINE>US OPPOSED TO USE OF FORCE AGAINST TAIWAN: DEFENSE SECRETARY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  27  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Defense Secretary William Cohen
reiterated on Wednesday that the United States strongly opposes the
use of force in resolving the Taiwan Strait issue.</P>
      <P>"I think it would have grave consequences to all concerned should
China ever seek to achieve reconciliation with Taiwan through the use
of force -- economic, diplomatic and potentially even military,"
Cohen said at a question-and-answer session following a Senate
hearing.</P>
      <P>Cohen said the US government has sent that message to the Beijing
authorities, and that "hopefully, it will be persuasive."</P>
      <P>Cohen said he has consistently taken advantage of his contact
with mainland Chinese officials, including a meeting last week with
mainland navy commander Shi Yunsheng, to convey the message that the
United States recognizes the "one China" policy, but also has an
obligation under the Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>"...We expect that there will be reconciliation through peaceful
means and that is the only way that can come about; that they should
not seek in any way to take military action or threaten Taiwan -- to
taking military action," Cohen said.</P>
      <P>Cohen went on to say that he has advocated that the Taiwanese
reduce their rhetoric about independence and a movement toward

everybody back away from the abyss that has developed.</P>
      <P>"Hopefully, the calming influence of the election (Taiwan's March
18 presidential election), and the words that have been emanating

encourage the Chinese to think that they can take military action,"
he added.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Short-term military drills by mainland
Chinese troops across the Taiwan Strait will only have a temporary
effect on the local bourse, but long-term maneuvers would cause a
profound impact on the island's economy, said a government official
on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Judging from past experience, the local stock market will quickly
be able to regain its momentum if it is affected by short term
non-economic factors, such as the present military drills in the
mainland's southern coastal region and the Sept. 21 earthquake last
year. C. Y Hu, head of the Economic Research Department under the
Council for Economic Planning and Development, said.</P>
      <P>However, he added that investor sentiment in Taiwan will be
greatly dampened if current military exercises by mainland Chinese
troops in Fujian and Guangdong provinces opposite the island continue
over the long term.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, who also serves as the
head of the National Stabilization Fund, said the fund is closely
watching the performance of the domestic stock market, which plunged
385 points on Wednesday due to reported military exercises by
mainland Chinese troops.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, the fund, set up by the government early this
year to help stabilize the local bourse in case of a financial
disorder or military scare, will buy shares at an appropriate time if
a decision is made to do so.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Liu was reluctant to reveal what level stocks must
reach for the fund to begin buying, as he wished to avoid
speculation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President-elect Chen
Shui-bian said on Thursday that he will face mainland China's
military threat and saber-rattling with head, heart and will.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered at a meeting of Taiwan's Presbyterian
churches, Chen said that after he assumes office on May 20 he will
also lead the ROC with head, heart and will.</P>
      <P>"I'll carry out my duties with prudence and caution. I'll work to
the extreme of my potential to serve Taiwan -- our common homeland,"
Chen said emotionally.</P>
      <P>Chen said he has advocated that Taiwan should adopt a new
middle-of-the-road policy and that the government and the private
sector should form a partnership to jointly develop an advanced civic
society.</P>
      <P>As for the threat from mainland China, Chen said he will
consistently safeguard national sovereignty, dignity and security,
and put national interests above personal and partisan interests.</P>
      <P>He called on the people of Taiwan to stand united and work
together with him to pursue lasting peace, adding that he believes
maintaining peace is the highest goal of reason and moral obligation
of Taiwan's new leader.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Chen paid a courtesy call on Yulon Motor
Corp. Chairwoman Vivian Wu for wide-ranging talks. Chen expressed his
admiration for Wu's contribution to the development of Taiwan's
automobile industry.</P>
      <P>He also thanked Wu for her consenting to allow Lin Hsin-yi, vice
chairman of China Motor Corp., a Yulon Group affiliate, to join his
administration as economics minister. Chen said he believes Lin's
appointment will inject new vitality and thinking into his government
and thus help upgrade national competitiveness in the world market.</P>
      <P>Also that day, Chen hosted a luncheon in honor of key figures of
the major factions in his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The
president-elect exchanged views with the DPP heavyweights on ways to
boost internal party unity and ensure a constructive working
relationship between his administration and the legislature.</P>
      <P>Later in the afternoon, Chen also visited professor Peng
Ming-min, who represented the DPP in the ROC's first-ever direct
presidential election in 1996 and is also known as the godfather of
Taiwan's pro-democracy movement because of his work during the
martial law era. Chen invited Peng to serve as a senior adviser to

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Hong Kong government is likely to
block a visit by Taiwan lawmaker Chen Ding-nan, sources at the Taiwan
representative office in the former British colony said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen Ding-nan, who has been tapped as justice minister under the
administration of President-elect Chen Shui-bian, has expressed his
desire to visit Hong Kong to inspect the operations of the
Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC).</P>
      <P>The plan to visit was prompted by the incoming president's
intention to set up a anti-corruption organization under the
Department of Justice to stamp out graft in the government.</P>
      <P>Chen Ding-nan has asked Taiwan's representative office in Hong
Kong to arrange a trip before May 10 for him, with a visit to the
ICAC under the Hong Kong government as its centerpiece, said the
sources.</P>
      <P>However, the sources said they doubt the Hong Kong authorities
will agree to the visit, given the tense ties between the two sides
because of a dispute over a work permit for the Taiwan representative
in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong denied a visa to Taiwan's would-be-representative to
Hong Kong, Chang Liang-jen, because Taipei refused to guarantee that
Chang would not act directly or indirectly on behalf of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although Cheng Ding-nan has a valid visa issued by Hong Kong, he
might still be denied entry, as was Taiwan's representative to Macau,
William Li, according to the sources.</P>
      <P>Their views were supported by an anonymous Hong Kong government
official who said on Thursday that Taiwan officials should get
approval from the Immigration Department before arriving in Hong
Kong, even if they hold visas.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile an ICAC spokesman said on Wednesday that the
organization welcomes the chance to exchange anti-graft experience
with anyone, including Chen Ding-nan, so long as he can visit Hong

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials from member nations of the Asian
and Pacific Economic Council (APEC) met on Thursday in Taipei to
discuss the current state of merchandise distribution throughout the
world and prospects for the future.</P>
      <P>According to statistics provided by experts at the meeting, the
cost of merchandise distribution in Taiwan is higher than that of
Europe and the United States.</P>
      <P>The Merchandise Distribution Association of the Republic of China
(MDAROC) said the ROC government should plan a special merchandise
distribution area to help the industry cut down costs and upgrade
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The seminar was jointly sponsored by the Board of Foreign Trade
(BOFT) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Merchandise
Distribution Association of the ROC, and the China External Trade and
Development Council (CETRA).</P>
      <P>In addition to Taiwan, delegates from the United States,
Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, mainland China,
the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico,
Chile, Peru, Russia and Papua New Guinea attended the seminar.</P>
      <P>An APEC survey showed that the proportion between merchandise
distribution costs and the gross domestic products (GDP) of the
United States in 1998 was around 10.05 percent. The ratio in Asia
during the same period was 16 percent, indicating that both the cost
and efficiency of merchandise distribution in Asia lagged far behind
that of the United States.</P>
      <P>Chung Jung-chin, secretary general of the MDAROC, said that the
merchandise distribution industry in Asia was at the same
developmental level of that of the United States in 1982. Chung urged
the ROC government to set up a special merchandise distribution zone
to help cut down costs and upgrade competitiveness. A BOFT
representative called on merchandise distributors to cooperate with
their counterparts in other member nations of APEC in the face of
rapid global change.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COMPROMISE NEEDED TO HANDLE CROSS-STRAIT ISSUES: US EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  April  26  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Both Taiwan and mainland China
should compromise on the "one China" issue as a way of breaking the
current impasse between them, a senior US China expert commented on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Ramon Myers, a China hand at the Hoover Institute of Stanford
University, told CNA that recent remarks made by Taiwan
President-elect Chen Shui-bian toward mainland China show that he is
adopting a reserved and cautious attitude in his handling of
cross-Taiwan Strait relations. But he stressed that Chen cannot evade
the "one China" issue if he truly wishes to improve bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>According to Myers, Chen's concept of a "Greater Chinese
confederation" which would allow Taiwan and mainland China to share
equal sovereignty is apparently the best choice the president-elect
could have made. The incoming Taiwan president has said that he is
willing to discuss such a topic with mainland leaders as long as the
"one China" principle espoused by Beijing is not a precondition to
bilateral negotiations.</P>
      <P>Only under such a "Greater Chinese confederation" framework would
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait be able to start talks on issues
of major concern related to national defense, foreign policy and the
establishment of direct trade, traffic and postal links across the
strait, the China expert told CNA.</P>
      <P>According to Myers, he wrote a letter about 18 months ago in
which he made a similar suggestion to outgoing President Lee Teng-hui
as an option for mending the differences between Taiwan and the
mainland. However, he went on, Lee did not reply, and he abandoned
his efforts after Lee aired his "two-states" theory in July last
year.</P>
      <P>However, Myers acknowledged that the Chinese communists have so
far failed to respond to Chen's confederation proposal. If Taiwan
compromises on Beijing's "one China, two systems" unification
formula, mainland China in turn should also respond positively to
Taiwan's proposal, he contended.</P>
      <P>If this does not happen, Myers warned, the two sides may have to
settle their disputes through a military approach.</P>
      <P>Although there are probably different viewpoints in Taiwan
regarding the "confederation concept" raised by Chen, Myers opined
that the new Taiwan government should forge a general consensus on
the issue with an open mind and work out concrete measures to serve
as the foundation in negotiations with the mainland authorities.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and mainland China, through communication and talks,
should each be willing to compromise in an effort to build mutual
trust and find common ground between Taiwan's "confederation
proposal" and Beijing's "one China, two systems" scheme, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH ROC VP LU TO AIR IN WASHINGTON</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In an exclusive interview to be aired
here Sunday on the television program "Ask Congress," Republic of
China Vice President-elect Annette Lu calls upon the Clinton
administration to mediate the on-going dispute across the Taiwan
Straits in order to facilitate a peaceful resolution.</P>
      <P>Lu also expressed the hope that a more official relationship
could be developed with the United States, such as allowing herself
and government officials from both countries to participate in an
exchange of visits.</P>
      <P>During a wide-ranging interview with former US Congressman Lester
Wolff taped in Taipei after the March 18 presidential election, Lu
outlined the top policy priorities of the new government and its
position on US-Taiwan-mainland China relations, said the

      <P>Ms. Lu closed the interview with a sincere pledge to the Chinese
mainland to work toward putting their differences behind them,
avoiding a costly and needless confrontation, and working
cooperatively for the future development of both sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>The interview provides additional information on the DPP's views
concerning cross-strait relations, education, democracy, and US-ROC
relations, and comes as a direct response to the many critical
statements issued by Communist China about Mr. Lu, pointed out the
agency.</P>
      <P>"Ask Congress" is a 30-minute public affairs program hosted by

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT-ELECT REAFFIRMS DETERMINATION TO PURSUE CROSS-STRAIT PEACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President-elect Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed
on Friday that everlasting peace in the Taiwan Strait should be a
goal for both Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Speaking to Cardinal Paul Shan, Chen said: "War will beget more
wars, it will create injustice and trample on the people's dignity,"
and added that the "pursuit of an everlasting peace will be the
highest goal of rationality and the moral obligation of a national
leader."</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that both sides will seek detente and
cooperate with each other, and echoed Pope John Paul's appeal for
armistice and peace which he made in his "millennium message."</P>
      <P>Chen said he will learn from the humility of the pope, referring
to the pontiff's practice of kissing the ground when he arrives in a
new land.</P>
      <P>Chen also said he will make "listening to three voices" as his
principle -- meaning that he will heed the voice of the people, the
voice of nature and the voice of dissidents.</P>
      <P>As May 18 is the pope's 80th birthday, Chen also asked Shan to
convey a letter of congratulation to the pope on his behalf and to
ask the pope to pray for peace in the Taiwan Strait and the world.</P>
      <P>In return, Shan conveyed a message from the pope which contained
an appeal for the abrogation of the death penalty in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although the abrogation of the death penalty is a
world trend, he will leave the question to the legislature, out of
respect for the legislative branch of the government.</P>
      <P>But he also said that he would study whether the president has
the right to exercise the right of amnesty for death row convicts
such as the controversial case of the Hsichih trio, who were
convicted of murder of a couple in 1995 but are still awaiting
execution, in what is now widely regarded as having been a kangaroo
court.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW MINISTER PROMISES NEW LOOK MOTC (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  28  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Yeh Chu-lan, a soft-spoken, feminine
legislator, will soon become the Republic of China's first woman
minister of transportation and communications.</P>
      <P>Although some people have expressed doubts about her ability to
head a ministry whose jurisdiction covers a wide variety of
professional fields closely related to the public's everyday life,
Yeh said she has full confidence in her own ability to fulfill her
mission.</P>
      <P>Yeh, a four-term legislator, said in a recent interview with CNA
that "doing her utmost in her position" has been her top concern
throughout her career. "Since I entered politics more than 11 years
ago, I have carried out my duties as a popularly elected
representative with devotion and passion."</P>
      <P>When President-elect Chen Shui-bian and Premier-designate Tang
Fei offered her the transportation minister post, Yeh said she asked
herself whether she has the passion required to take up the
responsibilities of the new challenge.</P>
      <P>"Frankly speaking, I felt a bit hesitant at first, but later, a
strong sense of mission prompted me to accept the offer," Yeh said,
adding that she was touched by Chen's and Tang's sincere invitation
to join their team to write a new chapter in Taiwan's history.</P>
      <P>Yeh, 51, said her priority as head of the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) will be helping its staff
get rid of the heavy "old burdens" left over from the ousted
Kuomintang government.</P>
      <P>A stalwart of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), the
country's main opposition party until Chen's March 18 election
victory, Yeh said the MOTC has a lot of resources, commanding the
second-largest share of the annual central government budget after
the Ministry of National Defense.</P>
      <P>"However, the majority of local people are not satisfied with the
MOTC's performance, particularly with regard to the island's
often-crowded and chaotic traffic conditions. I believe that the root
cause lies in the old ruling party's inclination to put partisan
considerations above national interests," Yeh said, adding that the
practice has not only hurt MOTC staff morale, but has also hindered
the exercise of their professional expertise.</P>
      <P>Noting that the MOTC has large and varied professional teams, Yeh
said she believes that the ministry will be able to improve its
service and efficiency so long as its 100,000-plus staff members are
given fair opportunities to perform professionally.</P>
      <P>"I assure my future working partners at the MOTC that I will let
professionalism prevail while assuming all the pressures and
political responsibilities," Yeh said, adding: "I'm convinced that
without the burden of entangled `patronage politics,' the
productivity and work quality of the MOTC staff will be upgraded
significantly."</P>
      <P>Since the ultimate target of all MOTC services is the Taiwan
public, the would-be minister said she will do her utmost to bring a
humanist and delicate touch to MOTC work.</P>
      <P>"My observation is that the MOTC is basically a mammoth service
industry. All traffic construction projects, from railroads,
highways, airports and harbors to telecommunications, tourist and
meteorological facilities, are infrastructure constructions closely
bound up with people's daily lives. Therefore, I'll ask MOTC staff at
all levels to uphold a sense of mission, namely, to create the
greatest possible satisfaction and happiness for the people of this
country," Yeh explained.</P>
      <P>The advertising executive-turned-politician went on to say that
she hopes the MOTC will emerge with a new look within six months of
her taking office.</P>
      <P>"I hope all MOTC staff members will work even harder and take the
initiative to improve their services so that our people will feel a
bit different about the MOTC's performance in six months," Yeh said,
adding she personally alone cannot make a difference in the ministry,
and that she will need the assistance of all ministry employees.</P>
      <P>Because many MOTC construction projects involve complicated
business interests, Yeh said she will establish an open and
transparent mechanism under which all companies will have fair and
equal opportunities to compete and bid for construction contracts.

    <HEADLINE>NEW MINISTER PROMISES NEW LOOK MOTC (II)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  28  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"I'll set clear, unequivocal game rules for all contract bidders
and MOTC officials to follow, and fairness as well as transparency
will be my cardinal principle in handling MOTC relations with
business groups and industrial conglomerates," Yeh said, adding:
"With definite rules and standards in place, there will be no room
for corruption and other irregularities."</P>
      <P>During her 12-year stint as a legislator, Yeh said she has won
recognition for her capability and integrity. The minister-in-waiting
attributed her ability to "resist temptation" throughout her
political career partly to her late husband.</P>
      <P>Yeh's husband, Cheng Nan-jung, was a pro-democracy activist who
set himself afire in 1989 to protest the KMT's authoritarian rule and
suppression of freedom of speech. Yeh said she is fully aware that if
her political career is smeared, it would besmirch the name of her
late husband. "This conviction has kept me from temptation," she
said.</P>
      <P>Yeh further said her years in the legislature have allowed her a
deeper understanding of the expectations of the public. "Since the
MOTC commands billions of dollars of public funds, I plan to let the
public know where all the money goes, as well as reporting on the
progress of every ongoing construction project."</P>
      <P>To facilitate communication with the general public, Yeh said she
will make the MOTC the first "e-ministry" under the incoming DPP
government.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh's plan, the MOTC will unveil all data concerning
budget use and progress in each major infrastructure construction
project on the ministry's website.</P>
      <P>"Any member of the public is welcome to surf the MOTC website and
express their opinions or ideas concerning the ministry's work or
drawbacks and development plans," Yeh said, adding: "By so doing,
we'll be able to narrow the gap between our policy and public
demand."</P>
      <P>Turning to the MOTC's future development policies, Yeh said that
although the BOT (build-operate-transfer) scheme has caused some
controversy in the bidding processes for the high-speed railway
project between Taipei and Kaohsiung and the mass rapid transit
system between Chiang Kai-shek International Airport and metropolitan
Taipei, the ministry will continue encouraging private investment in
massive-scale infrastructure construction projects under the BOT
model.</P>
      <P>"The BOT scheme will allow the government to bring in not only
private capital but also vitality and efficiency to construction and
operation of public transportation and communication facilities," she
said.</P>
      <P>As for the long-planned privatization of various public transport
services, Yeh said privatization is a direction and a trend because
it will help enhance competitiveness and efficiency.</P>
      <P>"All privatization plans will continue to be carried out as
scheduled. Nevertheless, as transport services are closely related to
people's daily lives, we'll strengthen communication and coordination
with employees of transport services facing privatization in the next
couple of years," Yeh promised.</P>
      <P>She also committed herself to continuing the existing policy of
liberalizing telecommunication services, saying she believes in the
private sector's vitality and ingenuity. "My belief is that what the
private sector can do, the government need not do, and what the local
government can do, the central government need not do."</P>
      <P>Asked about her view on President-elect Chen's campaign promise
to push for direct trade, mail and transportation links across the
Taiwan Strait, Yeh said she does not have any personal bias
concerning the issue.</P>
      <P>"It is a critical issue. The new government must tackle the issue
with the safety of the 23 million residents of this island as its top
concern. As far as the `three links' are concerned, the MOTC is just
an executive body, not a policy-making unit. Therefore, our task will
be to prepare some enforcement plans or rules," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Touching on her expectations of her new role, Yeh said that as a
political appointee, she will devote most of her energy to
coordination and communication to ensure the MOTC runs smoothly. "My
motto will be: `Insist on what I know I should,'" she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>UNIFICATION TIMETABLE NOT HELPFUL: MAC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official in charge of Taiwan's mainland
China policy said on Friday that the setting of a timetable for the
unification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will not help, but
hinder the unification process.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), said that if a timetable is needed, then it
should be a timetable for the full democratization of the mainland,
which he said is more urgent, and more important than the unification
timetable.</P>
      <P>Lin stressed that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should seek
agreement on a basis of equal footing, and not one that allows one
side to impose its will on the other.</P>
      <P>He also appealed for the mainland to move toward the path of
peace and a winning situation for all sides in the new millennium,
instead of using the intimidation approach, saying that the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait should "speak more nice words and do more nice
things" to each other.</P>
      <P>Referring to remarks on Thursday by Tang Shubei, one of the
mainland's top negotiators with Taiwan, that "cross-strait talks are
not talks between the central government and a local government, not
talks between the government of the People's Republic of China and
the Taiwan local authorities, but equal talks under the one China
principle," Lin said that he will monitor developments closely.</P>
      <P>But he cautioned that the nation needs to pay attention to
whether Beijing is saying one thing to Taiwan and another to the
international community.</P>
      <P>Lin said the MAC noted long ago that there is a gap between
Beijing's statement on the interpretation of "one China" in the
United States and its statement to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin claimed the calls for Taiwan independence are actually
prompted by the mainland, saying that a long-term MAC survey shows
that the rhetoric for Taiwan independence invariably heated up after
the Tiananmen massacre, the Thousand Island tragedy, and the death of
Taiwan councilwoman Lin Ti-chuan in the mainland.</P>
      <P>The MAC, which has conducted the survey since 1997, has found
that the ratio of those who say they are both Taiwanese and Chinese
to those who say they are Taiwanese were roughly the same until after
Lin's death and mainland China's military intimidation, when the
number of those who say they are Taiwanese outstripped the number of
those who say they consider themselves both Taiwanese and Chinese.</P>
      <P>Lin also said the March 18 presidential election was a watershed
in cross-strait relations, noting that although Beijing toned down
its rhetoric against President-elect Chen Shui-bian of the
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, cross-strait relations
still have not gone back on track.</P>
      <P>On former US Defense Secretary William Perry's words that the
mainland had stepped up deployment of missiles aimed at Taiwan and
that US reconnaissance planes have been intercepted by mainland
planes over the East China Sea, Lin said Taiwan will pay attention to
the information, and make an overall assessment of the situation.</P>
      <P>He said that Beijing will continue to use all possible channels
to apply pressure on Taiwan, and that Taiwan will continue to pay
close attention.</P>
      <P>But Lin also stressed that Taiwan will not only focus on military
information, but will also monitor the political and economic
situation in the mainland, as well as the attitude of the United
States, Europe and Japan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TIER HEAD NOT TO ATTEND APEC MEETING IN PROTEST OVER BEIJING</HEADLINE>

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wu Jung-yi, director of the Taiwan
Institute of Economic Research (TIER), said on Friday that he might
not attend a preparatory meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum to be held in Shanghai in May.</P>
      <P>Wu said he is considering boycotting the meeting in protest
against Beijing's attempt to lower Taiwan's status at the meeting.</P>
      <P>Mainland China will sponsor an APEC meeting next year, and will
hold the preparatory meeting from May 8-10. However, the invitation
omitted the word "Taiwan" from the official TIER title -- the first
time this has happened, according to Wu.</P>
      <P>In past years, the representatives of Taiwan and mainland China
have exchanged fire many times at APEC meetings. Last year at an APEC
meeting in New Zealand, the Beijing delegation pressured the ROC
delegation led by P.K. Chiang, chairman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development. Chiang and Wu both publicly refuted
Beijing's pressure.</P>

      <P>Washington is watching Taipei-Beijing

Secretary of State for Political Affairs Thomas R. Pickering said on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Pickering told a group of Taiwan journalists posted in Washington

      <P>He made the statement one day after the Taiwan stock market
nose-dived to the year's low over jitters about Beijing's military
drills.</P>
      <P>But he refused to answer questions on whether Beijing is to stage
a military exercise on the eve of the May 20 inauguration of
President-elect Chen Shui-bian or whether there are unusual movements
of the People's Liberation Army, telling the reporters: "You're
treading into an area where I don't make comments."</P>
      <P>Pickering said he has no specific expectations for Chen's

      <P>He also steered clear of the dispute between Taiwan and mainland
China over Beijing's insistence on the "one China" principle as a

with respect to "one China" is well known, and that Washington hopes
Taipei and Beijing will find a way to talk.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ISSUE OF FOREIGN LABORERS INCLUDED IN BASIC WAGE PROTECTION DEBATED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  28  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The minimum wage guarantee for foreign
laborers was the focus of debate in a public hearing on Friday.</P>
      <P>The public hearing was called by legislators Yang Chiu-hsing and
LiI Ching-lin of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Yang
strongly urged that foreign laborers be excluded from the basic wage
protection to help curb the mass inflow of foreign workers so as to
protect the rights of domestic laborers.</P>
      <P>Yang noted that domestic foreign laborers in Taiwan have
approached nearly 300,000, saying the large number can be attributed
to the fact that they have enjoyed the basic wage of the ROC
nationals of NT$15,840 (US$490) per month, or the highest monthly pay
among Asian countries.</P>
      <P>This has squeezed the job market in Taiwan, Yang said, adding
that unemployment is at nearly 3 percent, with a total of 280,000
jobless workers. Unemployment among aborigines is even higher, at
7.75 percent.</P>
      <P>But some labor officials and organizations opposed Yang's views,
saying that scrapping the basic wage for foreign laborers will not
help raise employment among domestic workers. Elimination of the
minimum wage would only force foreign laborers to work extra hours,
they said. They added that foreign workers usually have to pay a
substantial brokerage fee.</P>
      <P>Hung Juei-ching, a Council of Labor Affairs official, said that
the implementation of a minimum wage has no effect on real wages for
domestic workers, because real wages depend on the demand for labor.
In Taiwan's booming economy, the average wage for all industries is
about 2.2 times higher than the basic wage.</P>
      <P>He stressed that other nations have adopted standard labor laws
for workers of all nationalities, and Taiwan should follow the
international norm if it wishes to be considered a member of the
world community.</P>
      <P>He said that if Taiwan's law treats foreign laborers differently
from domestic workers, efforts to enter the World Trade Organization
will be impeded and Taiwan's national image will be damaged.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC OFFERS PROPOSAL TO END CROSS-STRAIT STALEMATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  28 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The current stalemate between Taipei and
Beijing over "one China" could be resolved by President-elect Chen
Shui-bian in his May 20 inauguration speech, according to the head of
Taiwan's cross-strait policy-making body.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Su Chi said Chen could
suggest that both sides should adhere to the "1992 consensus."</P>
      <P>Su made the suggestion in a speech he delivered on Friday at a
seminar jointly sponsored by the Chinese Europe-Asia Educational
Foundation and National Sun Yat-Sen University titled "The
Development of Taiwan and Cross-Strait Relations in the 21st
Century."</P>
      <P>During his address, Su urged both Chen's new administration and
the Beijing authorities to be "ambiguous" in handling the "One China"
issue.</P>
      <P>Su said that currently there are four interpretations of what
constitutes "One China."</P>
      <P>They are: Beijing's version that there is only one China, of
which Taiwan is a part; the Kuomintang's version that one China is a
historical, cultural and geographic concept which is currently
divided, but will be reunified in the future; Chen's version that one
China is a topic for discussion, not a prerequisite for talks; and
Washington's version of one China.</P>
      <P>The "One China, with each side free to express their
interpretation" formula was once the best way in dealing with the
"One China" issue, said Su. It was agreed between Taipei's Strait
Exchange Foundation and Beijing's Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Strait in 1992's groundbreaking cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>However, he also noted, that the formula has now been denied and
dismissed by Beijing as simply Taipei's interpretation of the
consensus, not Beijing's understanding of it.</P>
      <P>Su went a step further, pointing out that in the face of this
dilemma, the best thing the incoming president could do is try to be
ambiguous on the sensitive issue by deliberately trying not to give
any precise definition to the consensus.</P>
      <P>This, he concluded, would be tantamount to "one consensus, free
interpretations," which may be beneficial to a cross-strait
breakthrough.</P>

the two sides resolve their differences and increase mutual

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SNUBS BEIJING'S CLAIMS OF TALKS ON EQUAL-FOOTING WITH TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  28  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Beijing official's advocacy of talks
with Taiwan on equal footing under the principle of "one China" drew
fire from Taiwan on Friday.</P>
      <P>Tang Shubei, vice chairman of Beijing's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits, told a symposium staged in Shenzhen for
the purpose of promoting reunification and preventing Taiwan
independence that Beijing would not characterize the dialogue between
Beijing and Taipei as one between a central and a local government.</P>
      <P>Instead, Taiwan and mainland China would be "equal" in the talks,
which would be held under the principle that there is only "one
China", said Tang.</P>
      <P>Su Chi, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, dismissed
Tang's remarks as self-contradictory, because the "one China" policy
demanded by Beijing as a prerequisite to dialogue with Taiwan is
"unequal in nature".</P>
      <P>"Mainland China has often gone the extra mile, both at the
negotiating table and on the international stage, to leave a false
perception of inequality between the two sides," complained Su.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang Jung-kong, director-general of the Mainland
Affairs Research Department under the Kuomintang , played down Tang's
statement as "nothing new."</P>
      <P>"It is an old trick to downgrade Taiwan into an unequal position
through a false form of equality," said the KMT ideology guru.</P>
      <P>"Given Beijing's formula of 'one country, two systems' for
national reunification, the final goal it pursues is to annex Taiwan
as one of its provinces. That is unequal in our point of view."</P>
      <P>Having not past over the chance for a dig at the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), Chang criticized the former opposition party
for fumbling in vain for a cross-strait strategy after being swept
into power in the March 18 election.</P>
      <P>After lambasting the National Reunification Guidelines, which had
been crafted by the KMT for so many years, the DPP has nothing but
the same guidelines to ward off Beijing's pressure for political
talks, said Chang.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT IMPROVEMENTS NOT LIKELY IN SHORT TERM: KMT OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  April  28  (CNA)
(By Mark Ou and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official of the Republic of China's
outgoing Kuomintang government said here that although ROC
President-elect Chen Shui-bian is keen on improving cross-Taiwan
Strait relations, he did not see this happening in the near future.</P>
      <P>Jason Hu, director of the KMT's Department of Cultural Affairs,
made the remarks on Friday while speaking at an annual meeting of
Taiwanese businesspeople in Europe on the topic of Taiwan's situation
in the wake of March 18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Hu noted that the impasse in cross-strait dialogue and mainland
China's mistrust of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive
Party's Chen won't change in one day, saying that he did not see how
cross-strait tensions could be reversed all at once.</P>
      <P>In his first public speech since the KMT lost the presidential
election, Hu said a breakthrough in the current impasse won't occur 
between Chen's inauguration in May and the month of August, and
probably not even before December.</P>
      <P>The conciliatory gestures by Chen after his election victory
will not have an instant effect, Hu said, adding that mainland China
will also have to make some adjustments. Although there is a chance
for this in the long term, the short term prospects aren't so bright,
he said.</P>
      <P>Hu said that the 22 million people living on Taiwan will not
accept Beijing's claim that "one China" means the People's Republic
of China, adding that Taiwan-independence rhetoric on the island will
tone down as its democracy matures.</P>
      <P>Chen's government will also not promote Taiwan's independence,
and the mainland should not use Chen's past stance and rhetoric as a
basis for acting against the 22 million people on Taiwan, Hu said.</P>
      <P>Hu reiterated that the KMT hopes for the resumption of
cross-strait talks and eventual peace, saying this would be a win-win
situation for both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Jao Eng-chi, vice president of the ROC's Legislative Yuan, also
said that the KMT will support Chen on cross-strait relations in the
KMT-dominated legislature.</P>
      <P>The two KMT heavyweights stressed that the KMT will play the
role of a real opposition party in the legislature by monitoring the
new government's performance and will wait for a comeback in the next
election.</P>

      <P>The new Cabinet put together by
President-elect Chen Shui-bian and Premier-designate Tang Fei has
received the approval of 67 percent of the people, according to a
survey released on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by Gallop Taiwan for New Party Legislator
Chen Lung-shui, gave Tang Fei the highest approval rating among all
the members of the new Cabinet at 82.7 percent. He was followed by
the interior minister-to-be, Chang Po-ya, at 76.9 percent; the
justice minister-to-be, Chen Ding-nan, at 70.1 percent; and the
chairwoman of the Council of Labor Affairs, Chen Chu, at 66.8
percent.</P>
      <P>President-elect Chen Shui-bian's performance since the March 18
election received the approval of 81.2 percent of the respondents,
although he is still 20 days away from being inaugurated as the new
president.</P>
      <P>Vice President-elect Annette Lu's popularity among those surveyed
lagged far behind, with only 36.8 percent favoring her performance.
Moreover, 48.2 percent said they are worried that Lu might turn out
to be a political liability rather than an asset for Chen during his
presidency.</P>
      <P>The survey, carried out between April 24-27 among 1,110 adults
islandwide, has a margin of error of 3 percent, according to its

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A large number of Olympic athletes are
expected to use banned performance enhancing drugs during the 2000
Olympic Games in Sydney this September, according to a report by
Olympic security officers.</P>
      <P>The report, revealed by the Australian on Friday, has remained
confidential since being drafted last June. It warned that the drug
controversies would damage the reputation of the Sydney Organizing
Committee for Olympic Games, while severely diminishing social,
economic and political returns and disillusioning athletes.</P>
      <P>The report rated the impact of "doping hazards" in the high-risk
category, saying they would "probably occur during each day of the
Olympic Games."</P>
      <P>More than 10,000 athletes from over 100 countries are expected to
compete from the middle of September. The report recommends that
pre-Games, out of competition testing, be made on competing athletes
in order to reduce the number of athletes competing using banned
substances.</P>
      <P>But the Australian Olympic Committee's secretary general, Craig
McLatchey, admitted that one key recommendation -- that a reliable
blood test for human growth hormone (hGH) be established -- was
unlikely to be met, the daily reported.</P>

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Eight mainland Chinese nationals made
their first appearances in the British Columbia Supreme Court
Thursday on charges of smuggling people into Canada.</P>
      <P>The charges relate to the arrival on the West Coast last August
of two of the four ships intercepted by Canadian authorities carrying
illegal migrants from Fujian province in China.</P>
      <P>Canadian police said the eight men were enforcers or organizers
aboard the ships. One of the alleged organizers, or "snakeheads,"
appeared in person before the court while the other seven took in the
proceedings via electronic link-up from a jail in Prince George, B.C.</P>
      <P>All eight are also involved in immigration procedures and a bail
hearing is set for May 12 in Vancouver.</P>
      <P>About 600 Chinese migrants arrived off the B.C. coast in four
ships last summer. Most were seeking refugee status in Canada, but
some have disappeared after being freed to await their hearings.</P>
      <P>The others are being held in custody while their claims are
processed. Some were ordered deported after their applications were
rejected, but only a few have gone home because China has been slow
in providing needed travel documents, officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC CHIEF URGES RETURN TO `ONE CHINA' AGREEMENT OF 1992</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's top negotiator with
mainland China, on Saturday urged both sides of the Taiwan Strait to
return to the agreement reached in 1992 where each side is allowed
to interpret the definition of "one China."</P>
      <P>Koo, the chairman of the semi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation, made the remarks on the seventh anniversary of the first
high-level cross-strait talks held between himself and his mainland
counterpart Wang Daohan, chairman of the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), in Singapore in 1993.</P>
      <P>Koo recalled that the SEF and ARATS, authorized to represent
their respective governments, held the ground-breaking talks after
nearly five decades of no high-level meetings between the two sides
and reached several agreements on institutionalized contacts,
establishing a framework for future exchanges and dialogue.</P>
      <P>He said the 1993 talks were possible because negotiators from
both sides had reached an agreement the previous year allowing for
different interpretations of what "one China" meant.</P>
      <P>Koo said the current cross-strait tensions requires a renewal of
direct communication between the two sides on an equal footing and
without prerequisites.</P>
      <P>He said both sides should shelve their dispute over the
definition of "one China" and try to solve the problems resulting
from cross-strait exchanges in a pragmatic manner.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that only if each side is allowed to interpret the
definition of "one China" can the present impasse be broken.</P>
      <P>Noting that the 1993 talks opened a new era of hope in the
peaceful development of cross-strait relations, Koo said he regrets
the fact that the long-awaited second round of talks between himself
and Wang still have not taken place.</P>
      <P>Koo also lamented the fact that the agreements reached in 1993 in
his talks with Wang have still not been carried out, resulting in
missed opportunities for the two sides to establish mutual trust and
a delay in solving the problems related to people living on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He said a renewal of talks between himself and Wang would be an
opportunity to solve cross-strait differences, adding that he hopes a
meeting can take place soon, no matter what the location or time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN SHOULD NOT APPEASE BEIJING IN INAUGURATION SPEECH: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President-elect Chen Shui-bian should not
try to ingratiate himself with mainland China by identifying with
Beijing's interpretation of "one China" in his inauguration speech on
May 20, according to a poll released on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by Gallop Taiwan at the commission of
Legislator Cheng Lung-shui of the New Party, found that 39.5 percent
of the respondents do not feel Chen should identify with Beijing's
interpretation in order to stave off pressure from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Some 33.2 percent said they think Chen should do so, while 27.2
percent of those polled had no definite answer to the question.</P>
      <P>Beijing insists that there is only one China and that Taiwan is a
part of it, while Taipei maintains that one China is a historical,
cultural and geographic concept, and that it is presently divided,
but will be reunified in the future.</P>
      <P>On whether the mainland China will accept with goodwill Chen as
the president of the Republic of China over the next four years, some
43.2 percent of those surveyed said it is "possible," while 24.7
percent said it is "impossible," and 32.1 percent said they had no
answer to the question.</P>
      <P>Mainland China sternly warned Taiwanese citizens against electing
Chen of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party prior to
the election and has only recently toned down its verbal attacks on
him after his election victory.</P>
      <P>Some 44.1 percent of those polled also said that Chen will
continue President Lee Teng-hui's line on "special state-to-state"
cross-strait relations, while 27.1 percent said he won't, and 28.7
percent said that it is "hard to say."</P>
      <P>President Lee voiced the two states theory on the cross-strait
situation in July 1999, resulting in angry responses from the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Of those surveyed, up to 60.1 percent said that Chen is unlikely
to promote Taiwan's independence during his four year term, while
only 17 percent said it is possible, and 22.9 percent said they
aren't sure.</P>
      <P>Some 56.8 percent of the respondents said they feel that
cross-strait tensions could ease over the next four years, 13.9
percent said that there could be conflicts, and 29.3 percent said
that the question is hard to answer.</P>
      <P>The survey, carried out between April 24-27 among 1,110 adults
islandwide, has a margin of error of 3 percent.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  29  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President-elect Chen Shui-bian promised
not to add tension to the already strained ties between Taiwan and
mainland China in his inauguration speech on May 20.</P>
      <P>He tried, however, to lower the expectation that he would solve,
once and for all, the problems between Taiwan and mainland in his
speech, saying it is unrealistic to expect him to solve a problem
which dates back five decades and has lingered through the rules of
his four predecessors.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a forum staged by National Taiwan University on the
expectations for the upcoming administration, Chen said improvements
in ties between Taipei and Beijing depend on the efforts of both
sides to reach out to each other.</P>
      <P>Although he has suggested that he would not embrace Beijing's
version of the "one China" principle, namely that there is only one
China and Taiwan is a part of it, Chen promised to display a
willingness to work toward improving ties with the mainland in good
faith and to seek reconciliation, cooperation, and peace with
mainland China in his inauguration speech.</P>
      <P>Beijing suspended all contacts with Taiwan after President Lee
Teng-hui in July, 1999 characterized Taiwan's ties with mainland
China as a special state-to-state relationship.</P>
      <P>Blaming Lee for the alleged deviation from the "one China"
consensus upon which bilateral ties were based, Beijing has insisted
on Taiwan's reconfirmation of its commitment to this principle as a
condition for further talks on bettering ties and has made it known
that it expects Chen to declare this in his inauguration speech.</P>
      <P>As an advocate of Taiwanese independence, Chen bridled at
Beijing's suggestion despite his keen desire to foster friendship
with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Public opinion seems to be divided on the issue, with some elder
statesmen such as Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Straits Exchange
Foundation, and Hsu Li-lung, a leader of the New Party, strongly
urging the new leader to once again pick up the "one China" policy
based on Tawian's interpretation, while about 40 percent of the
public said in a recent poll that Chen should not bow to Beijing's
pressure.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE PREMIER-DESIGNATE TALKS ABOUT `ONE CHINA' PRINCIPLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 29 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The "One China" principle being advocated
by the Beijing authorities must have the consent of the people of
Taiwan in order to work and cannot be imposed by any single political
party or leader from above, said an official of the incoming Republic
of China government on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun, the vice premier-designate of the new administration
under President-elect Chen Shui-bian, made the remark while making an
address at a seminar sponsored by the Taiwan Research Institute
titled "Taiwan Strait Security and Challenges to the New
Administration."</P>
      <P>Yu, who is also secretary-general of the Democratic Progressive
Party, said the new government will attach particular importance to
good relations with mainland China. From the geopolitical standpoint,
the proximity of Taiwan and mainland China to each other means
peaceful co-existence is be beneficial to each side's development,
while fighting a war would be disastrous, he noted.</P>
      <P>Beijing's insistence on sticking to the principle of "One China"
will hardly win the consensus of all the people on the island, the
vice premier-designate stressed.</P>
      <P>He said the sensitive political issue of cross-strait relations
should be handled in a serious and cautious manner, adding that if
the differences between them and are too difficult to resolve by this
generation, we should believe that our children will be wiser and
more capable of resolving them once and for all. By this he was
urging both sides to be patient about the process.</P>
      <P>Peace has been listed as the top priority of the new
administration, Yu pointed out, saying that the Chen administration
will promote cross-strait relations in a rational manner based on the
principles of "reconciliation through goodwill; active cooperation;
and perseverance in the pursuit of peace," as the president-elect has
advocated.</P>
      <P>In response to Beijing's "pinning hope on the people of Taiwan to
resolve the Taiwan issue," the new ROC administration will base its
rule on the consent of the people concerning how it deals with issues
like cross-strait relations, foreign relations, and national
security, Yu concluded.</P>

mainland Chinese dissident living in the United States, said here
Thursday that the US should neither grant permanent normal trade
relations (PNTR) status to China nor support it's bid to join the
World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>He said China is not ready to accept the free market system. The
interests of American people would be hurt and the jobless rate in
the US would rise, if China were granted PNTR status and admitted to
the WTO too soon, he added.</P>
      <P>Wei, who had been imprisoned for 18 years in China before being
released on a medical parole in Nov. 1997, said Beijing's trade and
human rights violation records should be reviewed by members of the

that would give Beijing PNTR status.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT OF CHAROEN POKPHAND SPEAKS ON INT'L COMPETITIVENESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  May  1  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Aiming to become Asia's leading animal
protein supplier, Charoen Pokphand Group (Taiwan Area) has managed to
achieve annual growth of 10 to 15 percent over the past few years.</P>
      <P>The company currently targets yearly sales of NT$55 billion by
2005. In order to achieve this goal, company president Yu Ru-chien
stressed that Charoen Pokphand needs to improve its international
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Following are excerpts of an interview with Yu by CNA reporter
Tina Han:</P>
      <P>Q: How does Charoen Pokphand plan to improve its international
competitiveness in light of Taiwan's anticipated entry into the
World Trade Organization?</P>
      <P>A: We are gearing up to accelerate the streamlining of our
regional operations, and are reinforcing the integration of our key
operations. Over the past four years, our company has invested NT$1.2
billion in research and development, setting up new outlets,
improving production facilities, and modernizing the administrative
system. We plan to back up that investment with another NT$2 billion.</P>
      <P>Q: Charoen Pokphand has chosen to specialize in biological
technology application. What are some of the issues in the field.</P>
      <P>A: Successful use of biological technology in industrial
production depends on the effectiveness of research, applications, as
well as marketing. We focus our efforts on applications and
marketing.</P>
      <P>Biological research and development involves tremendous capital
investment. Our company has participated in research projects
alongside international research institutes, rather than initiating
research projects ourselves. We have the Asian rights to the products
of any projects with which we are involved.</P>
      <P>Q: What are some of the applications for biological technology in
your production and marketing?</P>
      <P>A: In terms of meat processing, we have applied genetic
engineering technology in chicken and pork production. The market
reaction for genetically modified chicken is positive, and good
prospects are seen for pork in three years.</P>
      <P>Q: Charoen Pokphand has facilitated itself with commodity flow
capability. Will the company orient towards e-commerce?</P>
      <P>A: Our company produces 8,000 tons of frozen and deep frozen
processed food products a month, and we expect our monthly volume
will increase to 10,000 tons later this year. We have built a
distribution network with 500 cargo vehicles.</P>
      <P>We are still considering the possibility of applying e-commerce
in our operations. In addition to replacing conventional practices of
commodity flow, e-commerce should provide more value-added services.</P>
      <P>However, for various reasons, agricultural products and processed
foodstuffs are different from other products in terms of distribution
and consumer purchasing habits. These special characteristics may
make this sector less sensitive to e-commerce.</P>
      <P>Our company has planned for e-commerce, but it is unlikely to
replace conventional sales and distribution channels. At the moment,
our priorities are to improve our product quality and to build the
company's image.</P>
      <P>Q: Will Charoen Pokphand adjust its investment strategies in
mainland China under the new central government?</P>
      <P>A: Basically, I believe that Taiwan's democracy is mature enough
to sustain any administrative transition. As long as cross-Taiwan
tensions are minimized, our company will increase its investments in
mainland China. We plan to add another NT$500 million in meat
processing and marketing investments there. Other investment projects
involve improving the commodity flow system there.</P>
      <P>Q: What are some of the issues of the commodity flow system in
mainland China?</P>
      <P>A: Commodity flow is a problem there due to the distance between
cities and rural regions. In a market with 1.3 billion people, it is
vital to facilitate the commodity flow system.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has the advantages of a large market, abundant
resources and a huge supply of manpower. If political tensions are
reduced, our company will increase our investments there.</P>
      <P>Q: How successful are Charoen Pokphand's reinvestment projects
overseas?</P>
      <P>A: We have had an annual investment return of between NT$20
million and NT$30 million from our investments in mainland China over
the past three years. Although a return on our US$90 million
investment in the U.S. state of Alabama has been comparatively slow
in coming, we remain optimistic.</P>
      <P>Q: What are your expectations of the new administration?</P>
      <P>A: A stabilized economy, a harmonious society, transparency in
policy making, and wiping out corruption are all important to the
development of the private sector.

    <HEADLINE>REALTEK AIMS TO BECOME THE WORLD'S NO.1 100M LAN CARD CHIP SUPPLIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  30  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Holding over 40 percent of the world
market for 100 M ethernet LAN card chips, Realtek Semiconductor Co.
aims to become the world's No. 1 supplier of LAN card chips.</P>
      <P>Realtek's icon is a crab, a symbol of ambition for Chinese
people. The Taiwanese company has lived up to the image, trying to
grab as much of the world's market share as it can. Since early this
year, Realtek has filled almost of the demand from Taiwanese LAN card
manufacturers, who used to have to go to 3COM or Intel for LAN card
chips.</P>
      <P>Realtek concentrates on three production lines -- ICs for
networks, ICs for consumer goods, and ICs for computer peripherals.
With the fast-growing market for network ICs and shrinking demand for
computer peripheral ICs, Realtek is very often identified as a
network ICs designer.</P>
      <P>Following are excerpts from an interview with Realtek's vice
president Jesse Chen by CNA reporter Daphne Wu:</P>
      <P>Q: Realtek attained a record monthly high of NT$488 million in
revenues for March. First quarter revenues grew by 102 percent, and
reached NT$1.13 billion. How is it possible for the company to
achieve such good performance during a supposedly sluggish season?</P>
      <P>A: Realtek revenues are up because we have been taking orders of
100M LAN card chips from firms that used to go to 3COM and Intel. Now
Realtek supplies 90 percent of demand from Taiwanese LAN card
manufacturers, and over 40 percent of the world market.</P>
      <P>We expect to become the world's number 1 100M lan card chips
supplier later this year. We are grateful that Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co. and United Microelectronics Corp. have supported us
in facilitating our production capability.</P>
      <P>Q: What is Realtek's current production structure?</P>
      <P>A: Of our targeted NT$4 billion in revenues for this year, 75
percent will come from LAN card chips, 20 percent from consumer
electronics chips, and 5 percent from chips for computer peripherals.
Revenues from LAN card chips already account for 75 percent of first
quarter company revenues.</P>
      <P>As demand for 100M Ethernet LAN card chips continues to increase,
Realtek estimates that this year we will deliver between 25 million
and 26 million 100M lan card chips, almost doubling the output of
1999. On the other hand, production of 10M LAN card chips will fall
to between 10 million and 12 million units, as compared with our
output of 13 million units last year.</P>
      <P>Q: Is Realtek cutting down on its production of consumer
electronics chips and computer peripherals for the purpose of company
transition?</P>
      <P>A: Realtek's revenues from chips for consumer electronics are
expected to fall because of insufficient production capability and
the loss of a key customer, Lucky Goldstar in South Korea. As to
computer peripherals chips production, the demand for many items is
shrinking and new products have not yet been accepted by the market.</P>
      <P>Q: Realtek has a comparatively high share price, reflecting
investors' confidence in your company. What are the prospects for the
second half of this year?</P>
      <P>A: We have targeted revenues for this year at NT$4 billion, which
is considered very conservative. We made the estimate based on our
LAN card chips market.</P>
      <P>If Realtek can get orders from mainboard manufacturers such as
Asustek Computer Inc., Gigabyte Technology and Micro-Star
International, it will further expand our market and boost revenues.</P>
      <P>Q: Is Realtek facing severe competition in this field? What is
the life span of the 100M LAN card chip market?</P>
      <P>A: Realtek has built the company image by supplying 90 percent of
the Taiwan market for LAN card chips. LAN cards with Realtek chips
are called "crab cards" here. It will not be easy for other
manufacturers to catch up, because it normally takes half a year to
progress from the research and development stage to mass production.</P>
      <P>As a Taiwanese manufacturer, Realtek has the advantage of being
closer to the market. Many Taiwanese LAN card manufacturers have
shifted their orders from 3COM and Intel to us.</P>
      <P>We estimate that the market for 100M LAN card chips will continue
to boom for the next four years, before mass production of 1GB lan
card chips takes off in 2002.</P>
      <P>Q: What new products will Realtek unleash this year?</P>
      <P>A: We began mass production of hub controller in February, and a
new version of 100M lan card chips in March. A newly-developed 4-port
high speed Ethernet receiver will be added to our production lines in
May.

    <HEADLINE>NEW ADMINISTRATION FACES 'STARK' CROSS-STRAIT SITUATION: KMT OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  30  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official of the outgoing Kuomintang
said on Sunday that the new administration will face a "more
difficult" situation in cross-strait relations than that faced by the
KMT government.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, director-general of the KMT's Department of
Mainland Affairs Research, said that cross-strait relations are
"stark" and "potentially risky," as the mainland feels more urgency
to tackle the Taiwan issue.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has demanded that President-elect Chen Shui-bian
accept the "one China" principle as a prerequisite for renewed
cross-strait talks. Chen has responded by saying that any issue could
be raised in the talks, but there should not be any prerequisites.</P>
      <P>Beijing maintains that there is only "one China," with the
People's Republic of China being the sole legitimate government and
Taiwan being a part of China.</P>
      <P>Taipei accepts the "one China" concept, but has defined it as an
abstract, historical and future concept, with China being currently
divided.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks one day after Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's top
negotiator with the mainland, made an appeal to Beijing on the
seventh anniversary of an historic meeting between himself and his
mainland counterpart, Wang Daohan.</P>
      <P>Koo, in an effort to break the current cross-strait stalemate,
appealed to Beijing on Saturday to shelve the row over the definition
of "one China" and return to the consensus reached by both sides in
1992, in which each side of the Taiwan Strait is allowed its own
interpretation of "one China."</P>
      <P>Chang said that Koo's appeal had been "carefully thought out." He
added that Koo had aimed to convince the mainland to relax current
pressure on the "one China" issue, and at the same time express his
hope that the new administration will continue the policy set by its
predecessor.</P>
      <P>Chang noted President-elect Chen has said that he would continue
to rely on Koo's experience in handling cross-strait relations, but
Chen has yet to state clearly his stance on the different
interpretations of "one China."</P>
      <P>But Chang also pointed out that the mainland has denied that the
two sides ever reached such an agreement, and that even if the new
government adopts the policy, it will not necessarily lead to renewed
cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>Chang said the policy is supported by the majority of local
people, as well of the support of international community, especially
the United States. Therefore, it should be adopted, he said.</P>

(DPP) on the recent adjustment of the Cabinet's personnel, Siew
emphasized that the outgoing government's move was justified and
totally legal. He urged the DPP stop its criticism on the matter and
expressed hope that both the DPP and the Kuomintang (KMT) can show
mutual respect while establishing a system for the transfer of power.</P>

presidential election ended its 55-year rule on the island. The DPP
