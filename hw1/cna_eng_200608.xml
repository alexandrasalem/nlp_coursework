    <HEADLINE>CEPD TO EARMARK NT$450 MILLION TO HELP YACHT-BUILDING INDUSTRY(repeat)</HEADLINE>

(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) decided Monday to earmark NT$450 million (US$13.74
million) to improve facilities at two docks in Kaohsiung Harbor to
help Taiwan's yacht-building industry enhance its competitiveness in
the world market.</P>
      <P>Taiwan now ranks fifth in the world in terms of yacht-building --
next to Italy, the United States, the Netherlands and the United
Kingdom.</P>
      <P>According to the CEPD, Taiwan's yacht-building industry had its
heyday in 1985 when it captured 94.1 percent of the market in the
Americas. After that, the number of yachts built each year dropped
from 700 to 228 in 1994.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials said they believe improved dock facilities would
encourage yacht-building companies to make an additional investment
of more than NT$3 billion, which in turn is expected to increase the
industry's production value from NT$7 billion in 2005 to NT$10
billion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DISTRICT COURT UPHOLDS BAIL RULING ON INSIDER TRADING SUSPECTS(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, July 31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei District Court upheld its second
ruling Monday on allowing three indicted suspects in a high-porfile
insider trading scandal involving President Chen Shui-bian's
son-in-law Chao Chien-ming to remain free.</P>
      <P>It was the third time the district court has allowed Chao and the
two accomplices in the Taiwan Development Corp. (TDC) stock insider
trading scandal to stay free on bail.</P>
      <P>In its latest ruling, the court didn't change the bail amount for
any of the three suspects; namely, Chao's NT$17 million bail,
businessman You Shih-yi's NT$10 million bail and former TDC Chairman
Su Teh-chien's NT$5 million bail.</P>
      <P>The district court made the third ruling on the case at the
instructions of the Taiwan High Court, which rescinded the lower
court's July 20 ruling last Friday after the Taipei Prosecutor's
Office re-appealed the case July 26 to try to have the trio detained
once again.</P>
      <P>In its Monday ruling, the district court said it sees no need for
continued detention of the trio because previous records show that
few suspects continued insider trading once their illegal dealings
were exposed. Moreover, the court said proseuctors have completed
questioning of the trio and finalized investigations of their
allegedly illegal dealings. Against this backdrop, the ruling said
prosecutors' claim that the trio may collude among themselves or with
witnesses in making false confession seems to be implausible.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors formally indicted the three suspects July 10 on
charges of using insider information to profit from TDC stock
dealings. In the indictment, prosecutors recommended that Chao and Su
be sentenced to eight years behind bars, with 10 years for You.</P>
      <P>In the evening of that same day, Chao and You were freed on NT$10
million bail and Su on NT$5 million bail.</P>
      <P>The prosecutor's office appealed to the high court July 14,
seeking to have the trio detained once again. In response to the
first appeal, the high court ruled July 17 that the lower court had
to review the case again because its previous decision was flawed.</P>
      <P>In its second ruling issued July 20, the district court stuck to
its decision on allowing the trio to remain free, but raised bail for
Chao to NT$17 million from the original NT$10 million, while
maintaining that bail for the other two suspects should remain the
same at NT$10 million and NT$5 million, respectively.</P>
      <P>While granting bail, the district court banned the trio from
leaving the country or changing residence without due notice.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT MEETS VISITING SOLOMON ISLANDS MINISTER(repeat)</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday a
soon-to-be-signed volunteer exchange agreement and a cooperative
framework agreement between Taiwan and the Solomon Islands are
expected to further expand bilateral cooperation.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with Solomon Islands Minister
of Foreign Affairs John Patteson Oti and several parliamentarians
from the South Pacific island country, who are currently visiting
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that relations between Taiwan and the Solomon Islands have
been cordial since the two countries forged diplomatic ties in 1983,
Chen said none of Taiwan's diplomatic mission staff in the Solomon
Islands left its capital even when the country was troubled by
serious ethnic conflicts in 2000.</P>
      <P>Chen made an official visit to the Solomon Islands in January
2005, making him the first Republic of China head of state ever to
visit the South Pacific island country.</P>
      <P>Praising Oti for sparing no efforts to promoting Taiwan-Solomon
Islands ties, Chen said Oti's current visit is yet another concrete
action of his support for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For his part, Oti said the Solomon Islands will continue to speak
for Taiwan's cause on international occasions and work in concert
with Taiwan in further upgrading bilateral cooperation and exchanges
in various fields, including fighting poverty, medical service,
health care and narrowing the gap in digitization.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT DENIES MISUSE OF STATE FUNDS(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, July 31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian denied Monday that
he has ever "lined his pockets" with state funds set aside for
discretionary state affairs expenses.</P>
      <P>Chen was quoted as having made the denial while meeting with a
group of legislators from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks came after the Ministry of Audit under the Control
Yuan -- the nation's supreme watchdog body -- said last week that
documents related to the Presidential Office's reimbursement of
expenditures from a "discretionary state affairs expense allowance"
fund last year contained irregularitries and had been referred to the
prosecutor's office for investigations.</P>
      <P>Chen told DPP lawmakers that he had to use the discretionary fund
to finance many confidential diplomatic operations. As the operations
involved many state secrets, Chen said he couldn't give a clear
account in public, which has resulted in a lot of misunderstanding.</P>
      <P>In reality, Chen said, the use of the "discretionary state
affairs expense allowance" fund has strictly followed the system and
regulations adopted during the previous Kuomintang rule. Chen was
quoted as having said society, opposition parties in particularly,
should not employ different standards to scrutinize the use of the
fund.</P>
      <P>If investigators pledge not to disclose any confidential
diplomatic operations for overall national interests, Chen said he is
willing to brief prosecution authorities on the use of the "special
state affairs expense" fund in detail and show them all relevant data
and documents.</P>
      <P>Chen assured DPP lawmakers that he has not feather his nest with
the special state funds.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP lawmakers said Chen is scheduled to meet with
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng Tuesday, but none of them
would reveal the topics to be addressed during the planned Chen-Wang
meeting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN CAREGIVERS TO BE SUBJECT TO STRICTER JOB ASSIGNMENT RULES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug.1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign caregivers will be subject to
stricter job assignment rules from August, and violators will be
slapped with fines ranging between NT$30,000 and NT$150,000, the
Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Starting Aug. 1, employers are prohibited from dispatching
foreign caregivers they hire to stay with care recipients at
long-term care centers or hospital wards for patients with chronic
diseases, CLA officials said.</P>
      <P>According to the CLA's job assignment rules, foreign or migrant
workers are grouped into four categories -- housemaids, manufacturing
workers, construction workers and family caregivers.</P>
      <P>In the past, foreign caregivers were eligible to stay with care
recipients at professional care centers so long as their employers
reported their job assignment plans to the CLA in advance.</P>
      <P>As CLA officials found that these foreign caregivers were often
asked to do extra work, the CLA decided to ban such job assignments
from Aug. 1.</P>
      <P>Foreign caregivers will also be prohibited from staying with
their patients at hospital wards for those with chronic diseases.
They now can only stay with their care recipients at emergency rooms
or general hospital wards.</P>
      <P>Employers who violate these new job assignment rules will face
fines of up to NT$150,000.</P>
      <P>The stricter job dispatch rules for foreign caregivers are seen
as part of the CLA's efforts to rein in the hiring of foreign
caregivers whose numbers have increased significantly since a new
hiring system came into effect early this year.</P>
      <P>According to CLA tallies, the number of foreign caregivers has
increased by more than 23,400 since the new hiring system was
implemented in January this year.</P>
      <P>Of the 336,000-plus foreigners currently working in Taiwan, about
130,000 are caregivers, with the number of foreign nationals working
in the manufacturing and construction sectors hovering between
160,000 and 170,000.</P>
      <P>CLA officials said that since the foreign caregiver hiring system
was changed, city and county governments have actively helped promote
the employment of local caregivers. However, due to a combination of
factors, including insufficient incentives offered by the government
as well as the much higher wages needed in hiring local caregivers,
the number of applications for foreign caregivers has remained high,
the official said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. REMAINS CONCERNED WHETHER TAIWAN DETERMINED TO BOOST DEFENSES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York, July 31 (CNA)
(By Timothy Huang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington remains concerned over whether
Taiwan is determined to boost its overall defense capabilities,
visiting Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Shen Fa-hui
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Shen, who along with another ruling DPP legislator, Lee Kun-tse,
visited Washington, D.C. before arriving in New York Sunday, said
U.S. officials expressed "grave concern" during a talk with them last
week over whether Taiwan can "effectively" raise its overall defense
and combat capabilities as rival China continues its rapid military
build-up.</P>
      <P>As to the much-talked-about procurement of three major weapon
systems from the U.S., Shen said, the U.S. officials did not name any
particular item this time around, but they did mention that the
designing and building of the eight diesel-fueled submarines that the
U.S. has promised to sell to Taiwan could be discussed separately.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Shen said he and Lee were told by Department of
Commerce officials that the signing of a bilateral free trade
agreement (FTA) between Taiwan and the United States is not seen as
happening any time soon and that current efforts will continue to
focus on ensuing talks under the Taiwan-U.S. Trade and Investment
Framework Agreement (TIFA).</P>
      <P>Shen, nevertheless, noted that the U.S. officials also told them
that Taiwan need not worry that the window is closing fast for
substantive consideration of an FTA under the Bush administration's
Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), which will expire on July 1, 2007.
"There probably will be a unique opportunity sometime in the near
future for the two sides to embark on new rounds of FTA talks," Shen
quoted a U.S. official as saying to him.</P>
      <P>The TPA is a fast-track arrangement that allows the Bush
administration to negotiate trade deals and present them to Congress
for a simple yes-or-no vote.</P>
      <P>Shen and Lee visited Jimmy K. Meng, the first American Chinese
member of the New York State House of Representatives, Monday at his
office, where they wished Meng's daughter Grace success in running in
the New York State Democratic primary in September.</P>
      <P>The two DPP legislators will head to Detroit after their New York
visit. They are also scheduled to visit New Orleans and Hawaii before
returning to Taiwan in about two weeks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HIKING HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS UNFAIR: CONSUMERS FOUNDATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Commenting on reports that health insurance
premiums will be hiked in October, the Consumers' Foundation said
Tuesday that a premium hike before key problems that have plagued the
system are tackled would be unfair.</P>
      <P>Consumers' Foundation Secretary-General Huang Yi-teng said that
until the Department of Health (DOH) comes up with measures to adjust
and balance the finances of the entire national health insurance
system and deal with the "black hole" of pharmaceutical prices -- the
core reasons why the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) is
running huge deficits -- a premium hike would be unacceptable to the
people.</P>
      <P>"The DOH should not treat the people as its automatic teller
machines," he said.</P>
      <P>In order to solve its spiraling financial crisis, Huang said, the
BNHI should first strive to cut costs and the squandering of valuable
medical resources, instead of asking for extra premiums.</P>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation spokesman said the BNHI should
particularly work to retrieve unpaid health insurance premiums owed
by the municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung to the program, which
exceeds NT$42 billion (US$1.28 billion).</P>
      <P>The DOH authorities said earlier this year that the shortage of
funds for the National Health Insurance program must be solved by
October as the government's last subsidies to the program will run
out in June.</P>
      <P>Since the BNHI is expected to face a financial shortfall of NT$23
billion next year, the bureau is planning to raise health insurance
premiums for two categories of insured groups, including farmers,
fishermen and laborers, DOH authorities have said.</P>

      <P>Although as high as 95.9 percent of families
in Taiwan have received child health handbooks for newborns, 40.26
percent of parents have no idea the handbook provides nine free
health examinations for children under seven years old, according to
the results of a survey released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Among the parents who are aware of the service, 32.2 percent did
not use it over the past year, with 45 percent of the parents saying
they did not use the service because their children were in good
health.</P>
      <P>While 25.82 percent of the parents do not know that they are
supposed to keep the handbooks permanently, 19.58 percent did not
bring the handbooks when they brought their children to hospitals for
medical visits or vaccination, the survey indicates.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted in 2005 by the Bureau of Health
Promotion on 1,966 parents with children under seven years old.</P>
      <P>Officials from the bureau said that the results show that many
parents are confusing preventive healthcare with other medical care.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the nine free health examinations
cover growth and development assessment, physical checkups,
vaccination, and health counseling, which are aimed at allowing
parents to have a comprehensive understanding of their children's
growth and development.</P>
      <P>The free health examinations include four provided before the
children reach one year of age, two provided when the children are
between one and two years old, and one each when the children are
between two and three years old, between three and four years old,
and between four and seven years old, they noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has shown receipts
for a controversial state affairs fund to the speaker of the
Legislative Yuan, Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wang declined to comment further on what he had seen during the
morning meeting with the president, stressing that meeting Chen does
not mean endorsing what the president has done with the funds that
were designed for his discretionary use.</P>
      <P>Chen invited Wang to the Presidential Office to show him the
receipts for the president's NT$35 million budget to purchase gifts,
reward the armed forces, visit political and economic establishments
and hold social events.</P>
      <P>The prosecution, which is investigating whether any
irregularities have occurred, claimed it is neither a "special" nor a
"secret" fund for the president to use in whatever fashion he
chooses, and that receipts or invoices must be provided to auditing
authorities.</P>
      <P>Wang said since the controversy is currently under investigation,
the president will explain to judicial authorities how he has made
use of the funds and will likely explain "to an appropriate degree"
to the public as well.</P>
      <P>Wang said Chen explained to him how previous presidents -- Chiang
Kai-shek, Chiang Ching-kuo and Lee Teng-hui -- had used the fund and
how they had used "secret" and "special" funds that were also
budgeted for the president's discretionary use in carrying out
"secret diplomacy" and other presidential duties.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, Chen spoke about how the nation's diplomacy
functions in the context of using such discretionary funds.</P>
      <P>"The president showed me receipts used for various purposes. But

    <HEADLINE>HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS WILL NOT BE HIKED FOR NOW: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Department of Health (DOH) official denied
Tuesday that health insurance premiums will be hiked in the near
future as a means to help cut deficits run up by the cash-strapped
Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI).</P>
      <P>DOH Deputy Minister Chen Shih-chung assured opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) legislators that he is "sure" that health insurance premiums
will not be raised, at least temporarily.</P>
      <P>A group of KMT legislators hosted a discussion at the Legislative
Yuan Tuesday on the possible repercussions of implementing the
proposed second-generation national health insurance program, which
is bound to require most people to pay higher premiums.</P>
      <P>Chen reiterated that the National Health Insurance Committee of
Supervisors has yet to make a decision on any premium hike plans.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan referred a draft package of amendments to the
National Health Insurance Law to the Legislative Yuan May 3 to pave
the way toward an overhaul of the nation's health insurance system.</P>
      <P>Premiums under the new program would be adjusted according to
total household income rather than an individual's salary, as is the
case under the existing system -- meaning that it is poised to affect
some 70 percent of salary-earning Taiwanese who are medium- and
low-income earners.</P>
      <P>KMT legislators said it would be unlawful if the DOH pushed for
the implementation of the second-generation national health insurance
program before the proposal was passed into law.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmakers also lambasted the proposal, saying it would
increase the health insurance premiums of about 70 percent of
Taiwan's salaried population, while leaving the high-income bracket
unaffected.</P>
      <P>They warned that until health authorities address what they
termed "ubiquitous health insurance fraud" and the "black hole" of
pharmaceutical prices -- which they claimed as core reasons behind
the BNHI's huge deficits -- there would be no chance for the DOH to
see the second-generation national health insurance proposal pass
into law.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT HASN'T POCKETED A CENT OF STATE AFFAIRS FUND: DPP LAWMAKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 1 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling party lawmakers and spokesman who met
with President Chen Shui-bian quoted Chen on Tuesday as claiming he
has "not pocketed a single cent" of the state affairs fund and they
accused the National Audit Office (NAO) of using different standards
in reviewing the Presidential Office's accounting reports.</P>
      <P>Chen met with Democratic Progressive Party legislators Wang
Shih-chien, Hsu Kuo-yung, Wu Ping-jui, Chuang Shuo-han, Lee Wen-
chung and Huang Wei-che and DPP spokesman Tsai Huang-lang Monday.</P>
      <P>The president showed them documents and stressed that he has used
the fund "completely according to precedent and in accordance with
the law," they said.</P>
      <P>Wang said that after hearing the president's explanation, he was
convinced of the "importance, necessity and secretive nature" of the
fund and believes Chen has never wasted or pocketed a single cent of
it, and that Chen felt he was being "above board" about the
situation.</P>
      <P>Wang blamed Auditor General Su Chen-ping for using "a double
standard" in requiring the Presidential Office to produce receipts or
invoices for the use of every single cent of the fund, causing an
uproar over the matter.</P>
      <P>"It's extremely unfair," he claimed.</P>
      <P>Half of the fund can be claimed with receipts and the other half
with invoices, and the president has followed exactly that rule, Wang
said.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan's National Audit Office (NAO), also known as the
Ministry of Audit, has never found any problems with the Presidential
Office's accounting reports for fiscal year 2004 or earlier, Wang
said.</P>
      <P>"So why has the FY 2005 report become a problem, when it was done
the same way as previous reports?" he asked.</P>
      <P>He accused "people with ulterior motives" -- in particular
opposition politicians -- of "political maneuvering over the matter,
exaggerating the issue and using smear tactics against the head of
state."</P>
      <P>He said quite a few DPP legislators have suggested that Chen
publish all evidence to prove his innocence, but the president said,
"when you chop the wood [for building a fire], you cannot chop the
chopping board."</P>
      <P>Huang said that in the past, half of the funds could be accounted
for without receipts or invoices, but the NAO is now unilaterally
interpreting the law and demanding that every cent spent from the
fund must be proven with a receipt or invoice, an enormous hassle for
the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Huang claimed he has heard a "clear and logical" explanation from
the president about the use of the state affairs fund, but he did not
see any documents or hear any explanations about the reported
"Southern Line" secret diplomacy project.</P>
      <P>Lee said some work in defense, foreign affairs and cross-strait
relations is confidential -- activities that cannot be proven with
receipts.</P>
      <P>"It's the same in all countries of the world, and in Taiwan, it
began long before 2000, the year of the peaceful transfer of power, "
he added.</P>
      <P>Lee said the Presidential Office had been forced to "collect
irrelevant invoices" to fulfil the accounting requirements as
demanded by the National Audit Office after 2000.</P>
      <P>"What should be examined is why the NAO has come up with new
regulations for the DPP government, " Lee said, noting that he
"totally accepts the president's explanation."</P>
      <P>DPP Spokesman Tsai Huang-lang said that during a meeting with
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, the president expressed
interest in inviting leaders of opposition parties' legislative
caucuses to the Presidential Office for a briefing on the use of the
state affairs fund.</P>
      <P>The president wants to assure them that he has never pocketed or
embezzled a cent of the fund, Tsai added.</P>
      <P>He said the president showed him and DPP lawmakers files,
documents and data about "secret diplomacy, " indicating that only
"acknowledgements of receipt" were available to prove that some
individuals had received some money to execute the president's
instructions.</P>
      <P>"The president told us that the legislature has cut his state
affairs fund to NT$35 million, far from being enough to carry out
'secret diplomacy, ' while the NAO, starting in 2003, demanded that
half of the fund must be accounted for with receipts," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>He urged the opposition to stop criticizing the president over
his use of the fund for the sake of Taiwan "saving face" in the
international community.</P>
      <P>"If the secret data were made public, an international row could
erupt, damaging Taiwan's relations with other countries," he warned.</P>

medals, 17 golds, 12 silvers and 10 honorable mentions.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) will try to verify reports that China is considering buying
into TVB, a Hong Kong-based television group that owns TVB Super
Channel (TVBS) in Taiwan, MAC Chairman Joseph Wu said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks when asked to comment on news reports that
China Central Television (CCTV) -- a government agency under China's
State Administration of Radio, Television and Film -- is planning to
acquire shares in TVB.</P>
      <P>Wu pointed out that the Statute Governing the Relations Between
the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area does not permit
Chinese capital in any Taiwanese media.</P>
      <P>He added that if the reports are true, the MAC will strictly
enforce the law because with CCTV succeeding in acquiring shares in
Hong Kong's TVB, it would turn Taiwan's TVBS into a subsidiary of
China's major TV network.</P>
      <P>In its 2005 report, TVBS claimed that 47 percent of its shares
were held by TVB, with the remaining 53 percent held by Taiwan's
Countless Entertainment (Taiwan) Co.</P>
      <P>Because TVB is based in Hong Kong, a self-administered Chinese
territory, the group is considered a foreign company.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese law sets a 50 percent limit on foreign ownership of TV
stations, but media ownership by Chinese is out of the question.</P>

series of resolutions, including one on easing cross-strait personnel
exchanges.</P>
      <P>Wu said cross-strait communications on opening Taiwan to Chinese
tourists have been going on smoothly, and he expected to see results
by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Wu said in a gathering June 1 with a group of Taiwanese
businesspeople operating in China, that cross-strait negotiation on
the matter should be completed in four or five months.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently allows 1,000 Chinese tourists into Taiwan every
day, and cross-strait talks should focus on verifying the identity of
Chinese tourists, travel disputes and handling emergency situations,
he said.</P>
      <P>Wu also said current limitations on each group of Chinese
businesspeople under 30 members has not met the demand, and that
the government will be more open when multinational enterprises --
which have a lot of Chinese workers -- come to Taiwan for a meeting.</P>
      <P>Noting that Microsoft is applying to hold a regional
meeting in Taiwan, Wu said the government will be open to handling
the 200 or 300 Chinese Microsoft employees coming for the event.</P>
      <P>He also said the limited opening in exchanges of Chinese currency,
the yuan, on two outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu on a trial
basis last year, has achieved good results.</P>
      <P>He asked the central bank, Central Bank of China, to think about
related measures on yuan exchange operations in anticipation of an
influx in Chinese tourists.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN DEMANDS TRUTH ABOUT STATE AFFAIRS SPENDING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 1 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou demanded Tuesday that President Chen Shui-bian make a clean
breast of a controversy arising from the state affairs spending
claimed by the Presidential Office on Chen's behalf.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while answering questions from reporters
after presiding over a municipal meeting at Taipei City Hall.</P>
      <P>Ma's comments came after local media reported that Chen met
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng over the issue earlier in the
day at the Presidential Office and showed him some receipts and files
while explaining how the money was reimbursed.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that he has not embezzled from the state affairs
expenses and told Wang that he might invite the legislative caucus
whips of the various opposition parties to a meeting to explain his
side of the story to them.</P>
      <P>The president also claimed that he is willing to answer questions
to clear his name at the State Public Prosecutor General's Office if
required.</P>
      <P>"No matter who Chen talks to about whatever issues, the key point
is that Chen must provide a clear explanation to the public as to how
the money has been spent, " Ma said, adding that "the president is
responsible for verifying any confidential case that he claims formed
part of the spending."</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Chiu Yi brought the controversy to light in late
June when he accused the Presidential Office of claiming special
state affairs spending on behalf of Chen with false invoices provided
by friends of the first family.</P>
      <P>An investigation by the Ministry of Audit has found that
suspicious invoices worth some NT$20 million were used by the
Presidential Office to claim state affairs spending reimbursement
between 2003 and 2005, drawing intense flak.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the KMT will support a proposal raised by the
People First Party (PFP) to launch an impeachment motion in the
Legislative Yuan against Chen, Ma said that the KMT has set up a task
force to study means of ousting Chen, which also include toppling the
Cabinet or recalling him.</P>
      <P>In line with the law, the president is entitled to claim as much
as NT$50 million per year in state affairs expenses at his discretion
to carry out various special tasks, such as providing cash rewards
for military personnel and hosting banquets for foreign dignitaries,
but not "confidential" or "secret" missions.</P>
      <P>The special funds must be screened by the Legislative Yuan and
must be claimed with invoices or receipts, according to an
anti-corruption task force at the State Public Prosecutor General's
Office.</P>
      <P>In response to Chen's proposed invitation, KMT legislative caucus
whip Tsai Chin-lung said that it would be better for Chen to elaborate
on the issue to the State Public Prosecutor General's Office in
compliance with the law, rather to the caucus whips.</P>
      <P>PFP legislative caucus whip Lu Shueh-chang told Chen to stop
playing "closed door" politics and to come forward and make a report
to the public.</P>
      <P>As the Presidential Office's state affairs spending is not to be
used for paying for the nation's "confidential" missions, Chen's
claims that he used the money to conduct secret diplomacy are against
the accounting law, Tsai noted.</P>
      <P>"The PFP will not endorse the issue for Chen and will not hear a
report by Chen at the Presidential Office," he said.</P>
      <P>However, opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) legislative
caucus whip David Huang said that he would be willing to hear a
report by the president at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>In addition to elaborating on how the reimbursement was claimed
with invoices or receipts, Huang said that Chen had better produce
documents to attest to his claims that he was just following
precedents set in place by his predecessors.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
said Tuesday that it is studying the feasibility of commissioning
private sector companies to run air terminals.</P>
      <P>CAA officials made the remarks as the Ministry of Audit reported
that 15 of the 18 terminals under the jurisdiction of the CAA have
lost a total of NT$900 million (US$29.69 million).</P>
      <P>The officials said Chiang Kai-shek (CKS) and Kaohsiung
International Airports have shown steady growth, but other air
terminals in Taiwan have seen their traffic reduced because of
increasingly convenient road and rail networks and rising air ticket
prices because of soaring fuel prices. After the inauguration of the
high speed railway, the domestic air travel industry will face a
further blow.</P>
      <P>They said terminals in outlying and remote areas will continue to
lose money because they are for the traffic needs of the residents of
remote areas and must shoulder the public transportation policy
mission as well as emergency medical transportation costs.</P>
      <P>On its strategy in planning for future air terminals, the
officials said the international airport will chiefly be CKS. In
terms of domestic airports, the CAA will adopt a conservative
attitude in planning for airports in eastern Taiwan while on the
outlying islands, the primary concerns will be flight safety and
services to local residents.</P>

As Israel poured soldiers and artillery shells into southern

air campaign. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said "There is no
cease-fire, and there will not be any cease-fire in the coming days."

Wall STreet Journal: Crude Aid, As Global Oil Demand Tightens, A
Big Producer Has Own Agenda

Nothing is more central to Venezuela President Hugo Chavez's
political fortunes than the oil company PDVSA. The oil giant is the
source of the money his government lavishes on the poor and, in many
ways, his 60 percent approval ratings. Under Chavez, the priorities
of PDVSA, which has funded half of government spending for decades,
have changed dramatically. The company still hands over a portion of
its profits to the government, but it also gets directly involved in
poverty alleviation and economic development. The company's
diminished production has cut world output by more than one percent.
That may not sound like a lot, but in a global oil market stretched
tight by growing demand, political volatility and hard-to-expand
supply, the company's production shortfall has contributed to the
run-up in oil prices during the past few years, and is likely to
continue to do so.</TEXT>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) has
presented a five-year plan aimed at improving
elementary school education amid the current trend of families having
fewer children, a MOE official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>As couples in Taiwan tend to have fewer children -- meaning less
classes and teachers are needed in schools -- the situation has
affected the livelihood of would-be teachers and made the competition
for the employment of new teachers fiercer, the official
said.</P>
      <P>For example, only 0.78 percent of the new applicants for teaching
jobs at elementary schools this year will succeed, the
official added.</P>
      <P>Worse still, there may be no need for new elementary school
teachers next year, or some teachers currently employed may
face a layoff, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Pan Wen-chung, director of the MOE's Department of
Elementary Education, there will be some 290,000 new students
entering elementary schools this academic year, starting from September.</P>
      <P>However, that number will shrink to 270,000 next year, to 240,000
in 2008, and to 206,000 in 2008, Pan added.</P>
      <P>Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng said the project, which will
start in 2007, has been presented to the Executive Yuan for
approval and the ministry will announce the details of the plan
after the Cabinet approves of it.</P>
      <P>Tu stressed that the new project aims to improve elementary
school education by reducing the number of students in each class,
with educational resources being used more efficiently. He promised
that none of the current teachers will be laid off, and that some new
teachers would be needed to create a healthy balance.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With 32 indigenous cases of dengue fever
having been reported in Taiwan this summer, the Center for Disease
Control (CDC) warned Tuesday that a major outbreak is likely to occur
unless the situation is brought under control by November.</P>
      <P>According to CDC tallies, there have been 79 confirmed cases of
dengue fever this year, with 45 contracted overseas and 34 indigenous
cases, including 32 which have been reported since the start of
summer.</P>
      <P>This is different from last year when the first indigenous case
in the summer was not reported until mid-August, CDC officials said.</P>
      <P>All of the indigenous cases have been centered in the Kaohsiung
and Pingtung areas of southern Taiwan, with as many as 30 cases in
Kaohsiung City alone.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director-General Lin Ting said this year's situation
is similar to that of 2004, when a total of 336 indigenous cases were
reported.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that most of those cases occurred during a
large-scale outbreak in September and October of that year, Lin
predicted that a major outbreak could occur this year if the epidemic
is allowed to continue into the winter.</P>
      <P>Lin said that although the increase in the number of dengue fever
cases has slowed over the past two weeks, the next two weeks will be
an important observation period, given that the incubation period of
the disease lasts three to 14 days.</P>
      <P>If the number of cases continues to rise and they are centered
around a single county or city, the CDC will investigate to make sure
local governments have done their jobs such as eliminating mosquitoes
and tracing the contacts of the victims, Lin said.</P>
      <P>In light of the fact that as many as 5,336 cases were reported in
2002, the government will set up a cross-ministerial epidemic command
center as soon as the number of indigenous cases exceeds 300 this
year, he said.</P>

      <P>Reacting to complaints from dissatisfied

a plan to start charging transaction fees for its online auctions.</P>
      <P>Users have been complaining about an abrupt change in the past
week following the announcement by Yahoo! Taiwan -- Taiwan's largest
portal and operator of online auctions -- stating that it will start
charging a 3 percent transaction fee on most auction items.</P>
      <P>Yahoo also charges users for listing and various other functions.</P>
      <P>Yahoo! Taiwan is not the first auction Web site to charge
transaction fees and its rates are lower than those in Japan and the
United States, according to Charlene Hung, Yahoo! Taiwan's vice
president of e-commerce.</P>
      <P>To reassure its users, Yahoo! Taiwan will conduct seminars
throughout the country and improve its services, such as the
mechanism of buying and selling and promotion of its auction service,
Hung said.</P>
      <P>It will also award each seller with five free item listings per
month and raise the maximum compensation fee from NT$7,000 to
NT$10,000.</P>
      <P>Hung refused to speculate on the potential loss of users after
the new plan is implemented. Taiwanese users of Yahoo's auction
services have established a union and plan to negotiate with the
company, while other users plan to simply use other free auction
services.</P>
      <P>The auction service of Yahoo! Taiwan was launched in 2001 and
boasts 3.7 million listed items. According to market research group
ACNielsen Corp., Yahoo captured 57.4 percent of all Taiwanese auction
users, compared to 4.9 percent for eBay, which ranks in second place.</P>

      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) refused
to comment Tuesday on reports that China's chief of Taiwan affairs,
Chen Yunlin, will visit Taiwan in October.</P>
      <P>A senior MAC official passed over journalists' questions about
whether the MAC will approve Chen's trip or demand official
negotiations with China before giving it a greenlight, saying that the
council has not received an application from Chen to come to Taiwan,
and that it would not answer hypothetical questions.</P>
      <P>Chen, the director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under China's
State Council, has been invited by the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) to
attend an agricultural forum in Taipei Oct. 13-18 as part of
exchanges between the KMT and the Communist Party of China.</P>
      <P>The KMT also invited Chen to Taipei last October for another
forum, but his application was rejected by the MAC on the grounds
that it required official negotiations between Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Beijing has refused to have any contact with the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) administration in Taiwan because of the DPP's
refusal to accept China's "one China" policy.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A cable television engineer who was
assaulted and injured by a group of bailiffs in front of the Taipei
District Court Monday filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the officers
and a separate suit seeking NT$1 million in state compensation.</P>
      <P>Chu Wen-cheng, an engineer for Sanlih E-Television (SET), was
with other TV journalists covering the departure from court of
President Chen Shui-bian's son-in law, Chao Chien-ming, who is
involved in an insider trading scandal.</P>
      <P>A fracas between the bailiffs and some of the journalists
developed into a free-for-all, with at least five of the bailiffs
pulling Chu's hair and choking him in an attempt to overpower and
arrest him.</P>
      <P>The bailiffs carried Chu into a room of the courthouse where one
of them punched and kicked him, Chu said, insisting that he was
innocent and never touched any of the bailiffs as they claimed.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Public Prosecutors' Office has charged Chu with
interfering in the officers' official duties.</P>
      <P>Doctors at National Taiwan University Hospital certified that Chu
received multiple injuries to his head, neck, right arm and hip, and
that he also showed signs of concussion.</P>
      <P>Chu's lawyer said his client is suing the bailiffs for
malfeasance in office, interference in his personal freedom and
causing physical injury to him.</P>
      <P>Earlier Tuesday, the Association of Taiwan Journalists (ATJ)
condemned the bailiffs for using violence against Chu and other
journalists and called for a judicial investigation to find those
responsible for the violence.</P>
      <P>The association also demanded that the Judicial Yuan apologize to
Chu and to Taiwan society for the brutality in front of the
courthouse.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP LAUNCHES DRIVE TO IMPEACH PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  2 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition
People First Party (PFP) initiated Wednesday a campaign to impeach
President Chen Shui-bian whom they alleged is corrupt and dishonest.</P>
      <P>In a statement, the caucus accused Chen of failing to disclose
his assets truthfully and using receipts received by others to claim
state affairs expenses, which the caucus said is a betrayal of his
oath made during his inauguration.</P>
      <P>The motion must be endorsed by more than 50 percent of the
legislators before it can be presented to the legislature for
consideration.</P>
      <P>Caucus convener Lu Hsueh-chang expressed optimism that the
campaign will succeed because unlike a presidential recall motion,
legislators vote on an impeachment motion by secret ballot.</P>
      <P>Also, the impeachment motion is simpler compared with a
no-confidence vote against the premier, which can lead to the
dissolution of the legislature and interrupt the offices of sitting
legislators, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsien-yao, director of the PFP's policy research center,
said he is confident that the motion, if put to a vote, will obtain
the support of more than two-thirds of the legislators as long as the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party does not interfere in the
decisions of its legislators.</P>
      <P>If more than two-thirds of the legislators vote for the
impeachment motion, it will be referred to the Council of Grand
Justices for review. The president will be removed from office if the
council finds the impeachment motion well-grounded.</P>
      <P>The PFP and its ally, the opposition Kuomintang, initiated a
motion to recall Chen in June, but the motion failed to get the
support of a two-thirds majority in the legislature.</P>
      <P>According to previous reports, the PFP was planning to make a
second attempt to recall Chen when the legislature begins its next
session in late September and was considering launching a
no-confidence vote against Premier Su Tseng-chang.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang reaffirmed Wednesday
that the current 40-percent ceiling on investment in China by local
enterprises remains in place.</P>
      <P>Premier Su made the remarks during a weekly meeting of the
Executive Yuan in which Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu
reported on management of cross-strait trade.</P>
      <P>Su said that as no consensus was forged on the issue in the
just-concluded national economic conference, which was intended to
seek ways to sustain Taiwan's economic development over the next 10
years, "the government has not changed the ceiling limit."</P>
      <P>Local enterprises had called for the raising of the limit in the
"global deployment and cross-strait economic and trade " session of
the conference for their viability, but the pro-independence Taiwan
Solidarity Union party was opposed to the proposal, which it said is
in line with President Chen Shui-bian's latest Chinese investment
policy of "active management and effective opening."</P>
      <P>The controversial proposal was later listed under "other options"
for reference and further deliberations by the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Su noted that if 70 percent of Taiwan's outbound investment were
to go to China, the ratio would be too high, adding that such a
figure would be to high regardless of what the destination country
were.</P>
      <P>The premier urged businesspeople not to put all their eggs in one
basket and instead diversify their investment and increase their
investment in Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang pledged Wednesday
that the government will help businesses reduce their investment
costs to achieve the goal of "investing in Taiwan first."</P>
      <P>Su instructed relevant Cabinet agencies to review existing
measures to facilitate land acqusition and financing of businesses,
as well as increasing tax incentives.</P>
      <P>The agencies should also seek to improve public infrastructure
and labor laws and regulations to create a favorable investment
environment, Su said.</P>
      <P>In addition, they should integrate government- and private-sector
resources to attract foreign investment and assist businesses to
remove various investment barriers, he said.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks during a weekly Cabinet meeting in
which he was briefed on the conclusions reached at a conference on
Taiwan's sustainable economic development held last week.</P>
      <P>Su noted that during the "Tahsi conference" held in August 2002,
President Chen Shui-bian first put forth the idea of "investment
first, economy first, Taiwan first, investing in Taiwan first" and
that the Council for Economic Planning and Development later also
worked out an "investing in Taiwan first" plan based on the
president's concept.</P>
      <P>While addressing the opening of last week's conference, Chen
reiterated that "investing in Taiwan first" should be the basic
framework of the government's investment policy, which shows that the
government is consistent in its policy, Su said.</P>
      <P>According to Su, all the issues discussed in the conference were
aimed at laying a sound foundation for the "investing in Taiwan
first" strategy that encourages Taiwan businesses to increase their
investment in Taiwan, making Taiwan their operational hub while
laying out their business network globally.</P>
      <P>The conference was also intended to continue to create a
favorable environment to attract more foreign investment to sustain
Taiwan's economic growth, create more employment opportunities and

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
legislators continued Wednesday to defend President Chen Shui-bian in
regard to a controversy over how he has used his special state
affairs fund.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yi-chin, secretary- general of the DPP legislative caucus,
said her caucus respects an opposition Kuomintang (KMT) caucus
decision to go over every page of the fiscal year 2005 final budget
accounts that include Presidential Office budgets.</P>
      <P>Like a group of DPP lawmakers who had seen some receipts shown by
the president, Yeh claimed that the president "will absolutely stand
the test" because he has not pocketed any of the special budget for
his discretionary use.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Hsieh Hsin-ni said that if the president has used
some state affairs funding to promote the country's foreign
relations, he would not be a "pioneer" in so doing, suggesting that
Chen's predecessors did the same.</P>
      <P>Apparently then admitting that the president has indeed done so,
she added: "Nor will he be the last president to do so, " adding that
Chen has done so for the sake of "national security."</P>
      <P>Huang Wei-che, another DPP lawmaker, said some secret diplomatic
tasks can only be conducted through a "one-way command channel" that
may not be made known to the foreign affairs and national security
authorities.</P>
      <P>As to criticism that Chen might be trying to "drag down former
President Lee Teng-hui along with him" when he showed the lawmakers
how Lee had used the funds, DPP lawmaker Wang Shih-chien denied that
this was what Chen was aiming at.</P>
      <P>Chen could not show any documents from the authoritarian era of
presidents Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo because "during that
time, all of the country belonged to the president, who did not need
to account for his budget," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that the president was not intending to imply that Lee
Teng-hui did a similar thing with regard to the use of the special
state affairs fund.</P>
      <P>"Even if files could be found about how both Chiangs used the
fund, it would only show that there were no rules at all," she added.</P>
      <P>Her KMT counterpart, Tsai Chin-lung, claimed that when it comes
to the legislature's turn to screen the 2005 final budget accounts,
his caucus would "keep a close watch" over how taxpayers' money had
been used.</P>
      <P>He urged the Presidential Office to cooperate with the National
Audit Office and the prosecution and "bare all receipts and invoices
used to claim the special state affairs expenses."</P>
      <P>Yeh said individual lawmakers can go to the Presidential Office
to see all relevant files and data but they must keep the contents of
"secret files" to themselves.</P>
      <P>If the KMT caucus demands the Presidential Office make public
even those "confidential files, " it must bear the consequences of
leaking state secrets, she warned.</P>

      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) will have
the final say on matters regarding a visit to Taiwan by China's chief
of Taiwan affairs, Chen Yunlin, Executive Yuan spokesman Cheng
Wen-tsang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Responding to reports that the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will
again invite Chen, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under
China's State Council, to visit Taiwan in October for an agricultural
forum, Cheng said it seems the KMT has not yet filed any application 
with the MAC for Chen's visit.</P>
      <P>The MAC will screen and handle the case in accordance with
relevant regulations after it receives an application for a permit
for the Beijing official's Taiwan visit, Cheng added.</P>
      <P>MAC officials refused to comment the day before on a possible
visit by Chen, saying that as the council had not received an
application from Chen, it would not answer hypothetical questions.</P>
      <P>News reports said Tuesday that Chen has been invited by the KMT
to attend an agricultural forum slated for Oct. 13-18 in Taipei as
part of exchanges between the KMT and the Communist Party of China
(CPC).</P>
      <P>The KMT invited Chen to visit Taipei last October for an economic
forum, but his application was rejected by the MAC on the grounds
that it required official negotiations between Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Consequently, the KMT organized a mission under the leadership of
KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chen that traveled to Shanghai last
October to take part in a KMT-CPC economic forum -- the first of its
kind in nearly six decades.</P>

      <P>Several civic groups condemned Wednesday the
bailiffs of the Taipei District Court as "too arbitrary" and too
emotional in their treatment of journalists, expressing fear that
Taiwan might become a "police state" should the situation continue.</P>
      <P>Chu Wen-cheng, a member of a Sanlih E-Television (SET) crew, was
brutally assaulted and detained by a group of bailiffs in front of
the Taipei District Court while covering the trial of whether three
indicted suspects in an insider trading scandal, including President
Chen Shui-bian's son-in-law Chao Chien-ming, should be detained
again.</P>
      <P>Without clear evidence, the bailiffs detained Chu for what they
claimed was his "interference in their public duties." However, the
televised scenes of the bailiffs behaving like thugs -- brutally
pulling Chu's hair and dragging him into the courthouse for a beating
-- has imprinted profoundly on public opinion.</P>
      <P>Several civic groups, including the Association of Taiwan

      <P>Ho also claimed that Taiwan's policemen behave hysterically.</P>
      <P>JRF executive Ma Tzai-chin claimed that the police today do not

    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
expressed strong opposition to a planned hike in water rates
Wednesday, insisting that the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
must not increase the rates without legislative approval.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whip Tsai Chin-lung made the remarks at a
news conference at the Legislative Yuan in response to news reports
that the MOEA is planning to implement the increase of about 30
percent early next year -- an issue that was agreed upon during a
national economic conference on sustainable growth that wrapped up
last week.</P>
      <P>The KMT is firmly opposed to the MOEA's plan because an
adjustment might whip up a chain reaction in consumer prices at a
time when workers' salaries are shrinking in real terms, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>The MOEA must first submit its pricing formula for discussion at
the Legislative Yuan, he insisted.</P>
      <P>Since Premier Su Tseng-chang assumed office early this year,
prices in oil products have been raised three times and electricity
rates once, while a hike for the national insurance program premiums
is also being mulled, in addition to the latest one in water rates,
Tsai said.</P>
      <P>"The price of everything is picking up, while salaries are not, "
Tsai argued, criticizing Su for having doing nothing to maintain
consumer prices stability and stimulate the economy.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics, Tsai noted that the salaries of Taiwan's 6
million workers averaged NT$34,490 per month last year, reflecting a
substantial shrinkage of 1.28 percent in salary after being adjusted

    <HEADLINE>OPENING OF HSUEHSHAN TUNNEL HAS LITTLE IMPACT ON YILAN AIR QUALITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 2 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opening of the Hsuehshan Tunnel has had
little impact on the air quality of Yilan, where the concentration of
air pollutants has remained similar before and after the tunnel's
opening, the Yilan county government's Bureau of Environmental
Protection said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>To track the impact of the tunnel on air quality, the bureau has
installed monitors at the tunnel's exit to survey pollutants such as
carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, benzene and
methyl benzene around the clock.</P>
      <P>The results of a month-long survey conducted between June 17 and
July 28 show that the concentration of carbon monoxide averaged 0.24
ppm per hour, which is much lower than the maximum acceptable level
of 35 ppm, bureau officials said.</P>
      <P>While the concentration of carbon monoxide was higher during busy
periods, the concentrations of other pollutants show no significant
differences before and after the opening of the tunnel, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>The Hsuehshan Tunnel, which was inaugurated June 16, is the
centerpiece of the 55-km Peiyi Freeway linking Taipei to the
northeastern county of Yilan. The 13-km tunnel is the fifth-longest
of its kind in the world and Southeast Asia's longest.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP HEAD HAS GRAND PLANS FOR TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 2 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei should be "managed as a capital city,
" and what it needs most is a new round of land reforms that will
allow more people to share its resources, opposition People First
Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Soong briefed the media of his plans for the city after he
visited all 449 of the city's boroughs, but remained tight-lipped as
to whether he will run for mayor later this year.</P>
      <P>He criticized the city government led by Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who
is also chairman of the nation's largest opposition party, the
Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>The city government has a problem of "not taking the initiative,
not coordinating, not being responsible, not attaching importance to
the grassroots and not having an overall plan for leading the city, "
Soong claimed.</P>
      <P>Because earlier KMT governments were interested only in
"recovering the mainland" it lost to the communists, city planning
and legislation for Taipei were quite sloppy, he said.</P>
      <P>"Taipei is by no means a local government, " he claimed, vowing
to lead it as "the capital city and an international city, " for
which a second round of land reforms would be needed.</P>
      <P>In a capital city, it would be unreasonable for the military and
the central government to use too large a portion of its land and
even more unreasonable for Taipei County to own 880 pieces of land,
Soong claimed.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, Taipei should claim back all of the land that
is rightfully its and pursue land reform to allow city residents to
share its resources.</P>
      <P>"If we continue to allow big enterprises to enjoy priority in
developing the city's land resources, it will never make progress,
" he claimed.</P>
      <P>Soong said that because he has "thought through" a lot of issues
facing Taipei, he has decided not to follow in the footsteps of the
KMT and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , both of which have
taken turns being in charge of the city government.</P>
      <P>Instead, he told the media, "I'd like to lead the city's citizens
to run toward the whole world."</P>
      <P>Opinion polls show that Soong is trailing behind the KMT's
mayoral nominee Hau Lung-bin and the DPP's Frank Hsieh and is ahead
only of the Taiwan Solidarity Union's Chou Yu-kou.</P>
      <P>His candidacy would only serve to boost Hsieh's chances of
election, as it would split the "pan-blue alliance" vote, according
to most observers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT URGES EFFORTS TO CHANGE U.S. 'ONE CHINA' POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday that
as long as there is a will, there is a way to change the U.S.
"one China" policy toward Taiwan. </P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks when he received a group of Taiwan goodwill 
ambassadors selected by the U.S.-based Formosa Foundation to visit
the United States to seek support for Taiwan's cause. </P>
      <P>Chen said the ultimate goal of the foundation, founded in 2001 by
Wu Li-pei, one of his former senior advisers, is aimed at swaying
U.S. policy toward Taiwan so as to change it from "one China" to "one
China, one Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Whether this will succeed or not will "depend on the efforts of
the people, " he claimed.</P>
      <P>Although there is still a long way to go to reaching this goal,
"as long as one does not give up and follow the right path, there
will be a day of success," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed his appreciation for the work done by the Formosa
Foundation.</P>
      <P>He noted that the foundation invites 10 young men from Taiwan
each year to the United States. This year, the young men visited 40
U.S. states, adding that they met with 159 congressmen and aides to
elaborate on Taiwan's separate identity and its efforts to defend
peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, as well as the difficulties
it faces, in particular Taiwan's bid to join the World Health
Organization and its efforts to sign a free trade agreement with the
United States.</P>

after undergoing surgery for intestinal bleeding,

      <P>Officials of Tainan County's Bureau of

decided to suspend mango exports to Japan for the rest of the year as
it is not the fruit's peak season.</P>
      <P>The officials were responding to media reports the Japanese
government decided to suspend mango imports from Taiwan after its

the decision of local traders.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the Council of Agriculture

      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP) Chairman
James Soong urged the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Wednesday to
support an impeachment motion that it has launched at the Legislative
Yuan to oust President Chen Shui-bian amid a spate of corruption
allegations surrounding his family members and close aides.</P>
      <P>Soong issued the call during a lunch meeting with reporters after
PFP lawmakers began collecting endorsements at the Legislative Yuan
for an impeachment bid that it launched earlier the same day.</P>
      <P>According to Soong, the opposition parties must not continue
turning a deaf ear to the public's strong discontent with Chen's
allegedly corrupt government. The many corruption allegation
surrounding members of Chen's family and his trusted followers have
seriously tainted Taiwan's democratic image, he claimed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, PFP legislative caucus whip Lu Shueh-chang criticized
Chen's intention to make a report to the public regarding his role in
a controversy arising from the questionable reimbursement of state
affairs spending by the Presidential Office on Chen's behalf as a
scheme to divert public attention away from the corruption
allegations.</P>
      <P>Chen is being pushed by strong public pressure to do so rather
than being driven by his own remorse, Lu claimed, arguing that this
"does not deserve public respect."</P>
      <P>Lu urged the investigation and accounting authorities to start an
immediate investigation into where the special state affairs expenses
have gone now that an initial investigation by the Ministry of Audit
has already discovered that the reimbursement of over NT$20 million
in the funds from 2003 to 2005 claimed by the Presidential Office was
suspicious.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  2 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Uneven scores and little fanfare couldn't
stop their love for baseball as seven international teams battle this
week in the second Women's Baseball World Cup, which runs from July
31 - Aug. 6 in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Host team Taiwan, Australia, Japan, Canada, Hong Kong, Cuba and
the U.S. make up the field as the U.S. seeks to defend its crown in
the single round-robin tournament that was inaugurated in Edmonton,
Canada in 2004.</P>
      <P>Compared to their male counterparts, who are often called "boys
of summer, " these "girls of summer" haven't seen the popularity or
skills of men's baseball, however.</P>
      <P>Attendance in Tienmu Baseball Stadium has numbered less than 100
in the first three days of the competition. The fact that Japan
pounded Hong Kong in a shutout by an unbelievable score of 43-0
doesn't convince anyone that this is a genuine world cup event,
either.</P>
      <P>But it shows the game of baseball is still in a promotional stage
in the women's world. Cuba, which has been long known as a men's
baseball powerhouse, didn't start developing its women's baseball
program until two years ago, said Cuba head coach Jesus Escudero
Rodriguez.</P>
      <P>Home team Taiwan didn't have a women's national team before
recruiting softball players for the tournament. Hong Kong, which
dropped 86 runs in the first three games while only scoring three
times, didn't even have a regular baseball field before last year,
said Lee Yat-keung, Hong Kong's head coach.</P>
      <P>On the other side of the spectrum, Japanese women's baseball
ranks among the world's best, along with the U.S. and Canada. Japan
has been developing women's baseball for 10 years and has a women's
league of more than 20 teams.</P>
      <P>One thing in common is they all love to play the game.</P>
      <P>"I love the excitement of baseball compared to softball, " said
33-year-old Liu Tsu-hsin, a former softball player and one of the
most senior players on the Taiwanese squad.</P>
      <P>"I truly love this game. And we'll get better with more
development of women's baseball in Hong Kong," echoed Hong Kong's Lau
Tsu-chin, who is only 14 years old but has baseball experience from
playing on Hong Kong boys' little league team.</P>
      <P>Rodriguez is also optimistic about the game's future, saying that
Cuban women's baseball, given time, will one day be as good as men's
baseball.</P>
      <P>The rules of women's baseball are almost the same as for men,
with the same field dimensions and type of hardball. However, women
are allowed to use aluminum bats and the regulation play is seven
innings instead of nine.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN RAILWAY MAY ABOLISH PRACTICE OF 'WOMEN ONLY' CARRIAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug.  2 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) is
considering whether to abolish its two-month-old practice of keeping
a 'women only' carriage in every train after becoming the target of
criticism.</P>
      <P>The TRA followed Japan's example and launched the special coach
service for women June 1 after an increasing number of women
passengers complained about groping in crowded trains.</P>
      <P>Although the TRA has designated the last coach of every train for
female commuters only, many male passengers have refused to honor the
practice on grounds that all passengers deserve the same treatment.</P>
      <P>Some male passengers criticized the TRA for "depicting all males
as sexual maniacs," while others claimed the practice might be
"unconstitutional."</P>
      <P>Women passengers did not seem to be enthusiastic from the onset,
either. Women's rights groups criticized the practice as "reinforcing
the stereotype that women need protection."</P>
      <P>When told by CNA that TRA will conduct a review next week to
decide whether the practice should continue, a few female passengers
seemed indifferent.</P>
      <P>"It's difficult to find the women only carriage, and when you do
find it and get in, you still see men sitting in there. So it doesn't
make much difference," one female passenger said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has not yet decided on
whether to increase next year's salaries for government employees,
military personnel and public schoolteachers, Cabinet spokesman Cheng
Wen-tsang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Cheng was responding to media reports that the government's pay
scale screening committee reached a consensus Tuesday on recommending
the Executive Yuan not adjust salaries for civil servants, military
personnel and public schoolteachers next year in consideration of the
government's financial straits and salaries in the private sector.</P>
      <P>Since many factors have to be weighed before adjusting the
government's pay scale -- such as the domestic inflation rate,
economic growth rate and the government's financial status -- the
relevant government agencies haven't yet considered any pay scale
adjustment issue, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Customarily, Cheng said, the Central Personnel Administration and
the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics would
not address the issue until after all public agencies have drafted
budgets for next year by the end of August.</P>
      <P>"Up until now, the two agencies have not yet discussed whether to
adjust the government pay scale for the coming year," Cheng said.</P>

      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Wednesday the
government will address issues regarding commercial and tourist
exchanges across the Taiwan Strait in a pragmatic manner.</P>
      <P>Su was quoted as having made the remarks during a meeting of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) Central Standing
Committee, in which Vice President Annette Lu asked Su how the
Executive Yuan would deal with a planned Taiwan visit by some 500
Chinese employees of U.S.-based software giant Microsoft Corp. later
this month.</P>
      <P>Su said the government will take active steps to promote
cross-strait commercial and tourist exchanges as long as such
engagements do not have any adverse impacts on Taiwan's national
security and sovereign status.</P>
      <P>The Investment Commission under the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) said earlier the same day that it has approved an application
by Microsoft Taiwan Corp. for 421 Microsoft China Corp. staff members
to visit Taipei late this month, to attend an annual conference of

-- Taiwan, China and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The commission said it has approved the application on grounds
the event is purely a commercial activity on the part of a

      <P>Under current regulations, the number of members of any visiting

the government has approved visits by large Chinese delegations under
certain special circumstances, such as attending Rotary

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said Tuesday

    <TEXT>
      <P>No irregularities have been found in Taipei
Mayor Ma Ying-jeou's 2005 special allowance expenditure report, the
Ministry of Audit (MOA) under the watchdog Control Yuan said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The government watchdog made the remarks in a letter to
Legislator Hsieh Hsin-ni of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
who asked the MOA last week to look into Ma's annual special expense
accounts amid allegations that half of the mayor's special allowance
funds have been remitted into his personal bank account.</P>
      <P>After scrutinizing Ma's special expense accounting report, the
MOA said the Taipei City government appropriated NT$340,000
(US$10,330) as Ma's special allowance per month in 2005, or NT$4.08
million for the whole year, to finance official function
expenditures, including hospitality, gifts and certain public
services.</P>
      <P>Quoting a 1998 Executive Yuan letter to the Control Yuan, the MOA
said half of the special allowance funds for the head of a government
agency can be reimbursed with his or her signature guarantee and the
remaining half should be reimbursed with invoices or receipts.</P>
      <P>According to the Taipei City government's payment regulations,
the MOA said, half of the mayor's special allowance fund, or NT$2.04
million for the year, was remitted into Ma's personal bank account.</P>
      <P>Another NT$2,039,587 was spent on entertainment, feasts and gifts
for official functions, the MOA said, adding that all those spendings
were reimbursed with invoices or receipts. The MOA said it didn't

    <HEADLINE>MINISTRY OF INTERIOR URGED TO REGULATE POLITICAL PARTY ASSETS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 3 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A civic group called on the Ministry of the
Interior Thursday to set rules that would force political parties to
manage their assets in a transparent way.</P>
      <P>The National League for Monitoring the Reform of Party Assets
made the call for the sake of reforming the nation's party politics
so that integrity will not be a mere slogan, but a reality.</P>
      <P>Yang Wei-che, convener of the league, said the ministry should
set the rules in accordance with the civic groups law and then
enforce them, since the "political parties law" has not been passed
by the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Before the political parties law can be enacted, the ministry
should set clear rules on party assets in accordance with Article 66
of the civic groups law, he added.</P>
      <P>Chang Ching-yuan, a lawyer who attended the league's press
conference urging the government to set the rules on party assets,
said it's not strange that companies are set up for the purpose of
making profits according to the corporate law.</P>
      <P>"It would be terrifying for political parties to own political
power and then use that power to make profits," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he added, the Ministry of the Interior should
"administer according to the law" and demand that political parties
regularly publicize their asset management and financial reports as a
means to stop illegal profit making practices.</P>
      <P>Kao Chien-chih, a lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party, said it is completely reasonable to demand transparency for
political parties in regard to their management of party assets.</P>
      <P>"The law is applicable to all political parties and is not aimed
at any specific party," Kao said.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , which had been Taiwan's ruling
party for over five decades until 2000, is accused of owning a large
number of "ill-gotten" assets that the other parties are demanding
should be returned to the state.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HAS NO PLAN TO ADJUST 'MINI THREE LINKS' POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has no plan to adjust its
policy on the "mini three links, " which should operate according to
Taiwan's laws, Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman (MAC) Liu
Te-hsun said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Liu was responding to a provisional measure announced Wednesday
by the government of China's Fujian Province that the direct shipping
links between Fujian and Taiwan's offshore islands of Kinmen, Matsu
and Penghu will be subject to the regulations governing the
transportation industry.</P>
      <P>Also, the ships sailing the routes will only fly the flags of
their companies and will not raise the flags of the destination ports
while entering and leaving the ports, according to the measure.</P>
      <P>Liu said that the "mini three links" are operating in accordance
with existing regulations and that it is impossible to implement any
unilateral measures by China.</P>
      <P>While there are regular ferry services between Kinmen and Matsu
and Fujian, the shipping links between Penghu and Fujian are being
conducted under a "special trial" program, with shipping companies
required to obtain the Cabinet's approval before operating the route,
Liu noted.</P>
      <P>Liu said according to the law governing relations between Taiwan
and China, Chinese vessels are not allowed to enter the waters of
Kinmen, Matsu or Penghu unless they have obtained the approval of
Taiwan's government.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Thursday that former President Lee Teng-hui used to list names, codes
and amounts in his accounts of the special state affairs fund while
President Chen Shui-bian "has his own way" of making his accounts.</P>
      <P>Wang declined to comment on which of the two presidents was
following the accounting principles and regulations more "strictly"
except to point out that Lee's accounts contained "concrete"
information about how the money had been spent.</P>
      <P>The speaker was shown classified files concerning the use of the
special state affairs fund budgeted for the president's discretionary
use when President Chen Shui-bian invited him to the Presidential
Office Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen showed Wang receipts and other documents indicating how Lee
used the special fund from 1994 to 2000 during his time in office,
according to Wang.</P>
      <P>"What I saw were major state secrets, " Wang said, noting that it
is quite common in a democracy that the speaker of the legislature
gets the chance to have a look at the most important national

    <TEXT>
      <P>Tainan Science-based Industrial Park's total
production value has shown stunning growth over the last few
years, and it is expected to reach NT$500 billion
(US$15.38 billion) for this year, the deputy director general of the
park's administration said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wu Meng-fen made the remarks at a forum to solicit manufacturers
to set up shop in the park while reporting on the situation of the
park, which registered a production value of NT$352.8 billion for
last year and a growth in production of 50.68 percent for the first
six months of this year.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that the 1,000-hectare Tainan Science-based Industrial
Park is the largest among all of Taiwan's science parks in terms of
a single land area. He added that sitting right next to the park is
3,299 hectares of land dedicated to the production of LCD TVs.</P>
      <P>"The park and adjacent land are large enough to form a new
community," he said.</P>
      <P>He also noted that the central and local government have worked
very closely in developing the park, adding that the park is the
largest optoelectronic industrial park in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Magistrate Su Huan-dji of Tainan County, where the park is
located, also lauded the excellent investment environment of the park
which he said has ample supply of water, electricity and land as well
as a large pool of workers.</P>
      <P>There are also 12 colleges and universities and 15 research
institutions nearby and a convenient traffic network that links the

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian told a group of

receipts on the use of a special fund because "the outside world was
accusing me as if I were a suspect of embezzlement, " one of the

four others met with the president Wednesday. The others were Chen's
former senior advisers Koo Kuan-min, Huang Chao-tang and Kang

    <HEADLINE>STANCE ON RISK MANAGEMENT IN CROSS-STRAIT TRADE UNCHANGED: CABINET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan's stance on risk
management in cross-strait trade remains unchanged, Cabinet
spokesman Cheng Wen-tsan reaffirmed Thursday.</P>
      <P>Cheng's remarks came amid reports that several heavyweights of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party questioned Premier Su
Tseng-chang's cross-strait policy in a DPP Central Standing Committee
meeting Wednesday, believing it might run counter to President Chen
Shui-bian's "active management and effective opening" policy on
investment in China.</P>
      <P>The premier had previously called for more open cross-strait
exchanges and put the controversial 40-percent ceiling cap on
investment in China by local enterprises on the agenda of the just
concluded economic conference, which was intended to seek ways to
achieve sustainable economic development over the next 10 years.</P>
      <P>Cheng said "some media have reported as if the cap had been
eased, although that is not the case, and the Executive Yuan's stance
on risk management of cross-strait trade has remained unchanged."</P>
      <P>He said that no consensus was reached on the easing of the
investment ceiling at the July 27-28 economic conference despite
strong urging by local businesses out of concern for their viability,
but it was later listed under "other options" for reference and
further deliberations by the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Premier Su also said openly Wednesday that the ceiling will
remain in place as no consensus was reached at the conference.</P>
      <P>Cheng noted that consensus was reached on 516 policy initiatives,
and the Cabinet will map out a time schedule to push for the
implementation of the initiatives.</P>
      <P>On the issue of hundreds of Chinese staff of Microsoft coming to
Taiwan for a regional meeting later this month, Cheng said the
American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei and the European Chamber of
Commerce Taipei have long suggested that the government allow
multinational cooperation to convene meetings in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Now that a consensus has been reached on the matter, it will be
left for the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Mainland Affairs
Council to screen applications before deciding whether to give the

    <TEXT>
      <P>The environment at most hypermarkets in the
city and county of Taipei pose fire hazards, with the most serious
problems being found at RT-Mart's Chunho store and Carrefour's
Tucheng store, according to the results of a survey released Thursday
by the Consumers' Foundation.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted from July 28-31 on 12 hypermarkets,
including the Chungho, Keelung and Tucheng stores of RT-Mart; the
Panchiao, Yungho and Chunghsiao stores of Geant; the Panchiao,
Chungho, Tunghsing and Tucheng stores of Carrefour; and the Sanchung
and Keelung stores of Megaful.</P>
      <P>While RT-Mart's Chungho store and Carrefour's Tucheng store
received failing grades in six of 20 safety categories, Megaful's
Sanchung store and Geant's Chunghsiao store got failing grades in
five categories, and RT-Mart's Keelung store and Geant's Panchiao
failed in four categories, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Failing grades included those for fire hydrants being obstructed
by other objects, passageways being too narrow, the pressure on fire
extinguishers not being set properly, emergency exits being blocked,
emergency escape facilities not being installed properly, and safety
signs not being set up at escalators.</P>
      <P>Officials from the foundation said that as the fire hydrants at
some stores were covered by large piles of goods, it would be
difficult for consumers to locate the fire hydrants in the event of a
fire.</P>
      <P>Some stores even turned the fire hydrants into part of the
decorations, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They urged the government to inspect the hypermarkets regularly

      <P>Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei
ordered on Thursday that the sheep on a ranch in Bali Village in the
suburbs of Taipei City be slaughtered due to excessive dioxin residue

      <P>Chou gave the order after two tests confirming that the meat and

      <P>Taipei County government has excluded the possibility that feed

contamination, and it will continue checking the land and the
livestock and poultry raised on the ranches in nearby Linkou.</P>
      <P>Chen Chang-yu, director of Taipei County government's Bureau of

the sheep milk from entering the market.</P>
      <P>Teng Chia-chi, director of Taipei County government's

    <HEADLINE>TSU TO WATCH WHETHER PREMIER STICKS TO PLEDGE ON CHINA INVESTMENT CAP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
will monitor whether Premier Su Tseng-chang sticks to his pledge on
not easing the ceiling on the amount local enterprises can invest in
China, the legislative caucus whip of the pro-independence party said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>David Huang was responding to the premier's open pledge the
previous day that the 40-percent investment ceiling will remain in
place.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that President Chen Shui-bian's latest "active
management, effective opening" policy on investment in China is
identical to that of former President Lee Teng-hui, the spiritual
leader of the TSU.</P>
      <P>"Su's pledge Wednesday is only echoing the basic stance of the
TSU," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that under the current system, for those companies
whose paid-in capital is under NT$5 billion (US$153.84 million), the
cap on investment in China is 40 percent, while for those companies
whose paid-in capital is between NT$5 billion and NT$10 billion, the
ceiling is 30 percent, and for those companies with paid-in capital
of over NT$10 billion, the cap is 20 percent.</P>
      <P>He said that what worries his party is that the premier might
scrap the "ladder" ceiling structure and set the cap at 40 percent
for those companies whose paid-in capital is over NT$5 billion.</P>
      <P>"The TSU will not allow such an alternative way of opening, "
Huang said.</P>
      <P>The party will continue to monitor the Executive Yuan's stance on
cross-strait trade and whether the premier will stick to his pledge
that the current cap system will remain unchanged, he added.</P>
      <P>Huang's remarks came amid reports that several heavyweights of

      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu acted as a spokesman
Friday for an anti-smoking campaign launched jointly by Taichung
city's health bureau and Chunghwa Telecom Co., Ltd.</P>
      <P>Hu accepted the offer in a ceremony that was also presided over
by Hsieh Chun-ming, deputy general manager of Chunghwa Telecom's
central branch.</P>
      <P>Stating his ambition to turn Taichung into a "smoke-free happy
city," Hu urged citizens to kick the habit and get rid of second-hand
cigarette smoke, which can be extremely hazardous to expectant
mothers and children.</P>
      <P>This is the first time that Taichung city and Chunghwa Telecom
have cooperated to raise public awareness by spreading an
anti-smoking message throughout the city's main streets and in prime
commercial districts.</P>
      <P>The municipal health bureau will post 110 public notice boards in
government agencies, medical institutions, markets and other public
spaces to raise awareness about the dangers of smoking.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, bureau officials said, radio stations, bus ads,
cable TV stations and print media are also channels that will be used
to promote the anti-smoking message.</P>
      <P>In line with the campaign, Chunghwa Telecom is also sponsoring a
contest to create mobile phone melodies. Eleven of 56 contenders have
qualified to enter the final competition, vying for cash prizes.
Mobile phone rings created by the 11 winners will be available as a

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 3 (CNA)
(by Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Researchers at Academia Sinica have begun a
12-month observation and evaluation project on horseshoe crab
habitats on the outlying island of Kinmen, according to a press
release issued Thursday by Taiwan's top research institution.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica's Research Center for Biodiversity was
commissioned by the Council of Agriculture to study the efficacy of a
1999 conservation drive to protect the species and the possible
impact on the crustacean's habitats by the construction of Shui-tou
Wharf.</P>
      <P>A research fellow at the Biodiversity Center said horseshoe crabs
have existed on Earth for more than 400 million years and have
remained in their present form for 200 million years; therefore,
researchers and Kinmen residents sometimes describe them as "living
fossils."</P>
      <P>However, he noted, due to over-exploitation by humans, the local
genus of horseshoe crab, Tachypleus tridentatus, has become rare in
Taiwan and Penghu, while Kinmen is the only remaining
major habitat of the horseshoe crab.</P>
      <P>He said the Kinmen County Government set aside some 800 hectares
of land as a horseshoe crab reserve near Kuningtou beach in 1999, and
the size of the horde in that reserve has became an important index
of the performance of conservation efforts.</P>
      <P>He added that the building of Shui-tou Wharf may also
influence the reserve's ecology, so the Biodiversity Center's team
was also asked to run an environmental assessment of the construction
plan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT'S CAMPAIGNING RULE NOT AIMED AT SPECIFIC CANDIDATE: LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 3 (CNA)
(By Ada Tsai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A rule approved by the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) forbidding party members from stumping for non-party candidates
in the year-end mayoral elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung is not
aimed at any specific individual, a KMT lawmaker said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsai Chin-lung, the clerk of the KMT's legislative
caucus, said the rule will apply equally to all party members.</P>
      <P>Noting that in the past many non-KMT candidates have often
claimed that a KMT leader has endorsed their candidacy in hopes of
riding to victory on the coattails of their high-profile patrons,
Tsai said this has occurred because the KMT didn't forbid its members
to campaign outside party boundaries.</P>
      <P>Citing himself as example, Tsai said he was often listed as a
campaign worker of non-KMT candidates entirely without his
knowledge.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the new rule will help party members ward off
non-KMT candidates' requests to stump for them.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in response to a report carried in
the Liberty Times that claimed the rule was crafted to
preempt KMT Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng from campaigning
for People First Party Chairman James Soong, who is widely expected
to run for Taipei mayor.</P>
      <P>However, the paper said the rule does not forbid the party's
mayoral candidates in the two cities from campaigning for candidates
of other parties who support their bid for City Hall.</P>
      <P>This means Hau Lung-bin and Huang Chun-ying -- KMT candidates
for the mayorships of Taipei and Kaohsiung, respectively -- can
stump for PFP councilors in the two special municipalities in order to
gain their support.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmaker Ho Tsai-feng, who did not attend Wednesday's KMT
meeting in which the rule was approved, said the limitation is sure
to offend PFP candidates and is thereby not in the party's best
interests.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the KMT and PFP -- which share the same support
base -- had agreed to limit the number of candidates with a quota
that was agreed upon by both sides, Ho said forbidding cross-party
campaigning will cost the KMT the support of its PFP followers.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 3 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang denied Thursday that
he said he will relax the 40 percent ceiling on investment in China
by Taiwanese businesses.</P>
      <P>Su told reporters that his attitude has been consistent all along
and he made clear that the consensus reached at a conference on
sustainable economic development for Taiwan at the end of July should
be implemented, while further communication should continue on those
issues where the participants failed to agree.</P>
      <P>He noted that relaxation of the existing cap on China-bound
investment was one of the issues on which the participants at the
conference did not reach consensus.</P>
      <P>"I never said I wanted to relax the restriction or to simplify
the issue as a matter of either/or," Su said.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks after media reports said that his
stance on the issue had been assailed by heavyweight figures at a
meeting of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's Central Standing
Committee, including Vice President Annette Lu, DPP Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun and acting Kaohsiung Mayor Yeh Chu-lan.</P>
      <P>The premier had previously called for more open cross-strait
exchanges and a majority of local businessmen also expected him to
further liberalize cross-Taiwan Strait economic ties by increasing
charter flights and relaxing investment restrictions.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-held conference July 28-29 was intended to seek ways
to achieve sustainable economic development over the next 10 years.</P>
      <P>However, delegates of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union and
other independence advocates were strongly opposed to lifting the 40
percent investment investment ceiling and on setting up regular
direct air links across the Taiwan Strait because they fear Taiwan's
national security and sovereignty might be undermined.</P>

harvesting this year's first crop and production is 2 percent below
the previous year's level, prompting a rise in price, the Agriculture

by July, with 950,000 metric tons produced, down by 25,000 metric

200 Missiles Hit Israel as Battle Rages in 
Lebanon 

Hezbollah guerrillas fired the largest
number of rockets yet into Israel -- more than
200 -- on Wednesday as thousands of Israeli
troops faced fierce fighting in Lebanon, and
sought to establish a buffer zone under their
control. Battles raged in a half-dozen pockets, 
and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said Israel would
fight until an international force moved into 
southern Lebanon.

Wall Street Journal: Party of God, Why
Hezbollah Is Proving So Tough On the
Battlefield

A look at how Hezbollah has developed as a 
military and political force shows why Israel has
been having a more difficult time than it 
expected in driving the group out of southern 
Lebanon. And it also shows how tough the road 
will be to permanently disarming Hezbollah and 
promoting long-term stability in Lebanon.
As the group's popularity has swelled in
Lebanon's Shiite Muslim community and beyond,
so has the sophistication of its weaponry and
the lock-step discipline of its core fighting
force aimed at Israel. By wedding that sophistic
ation to its ideology of martyrdom for the
cause, Hezbollah's relatively tiny army --
believed to number several thousand -- has
become one of the most effective military forces
in the region.</TEXT>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Supreme Administrative Court ruled
Thursday that the Far Eastern Electronic Toll Collecting Co. (FETC)
no longer enjoys "priority status" in the procurement process to run
a toll system on the nation's freeways.</P>
      <P>It said the FETC must vie with the other two bidders on an equal
footing because the prior bidding process had violated the principles
of equality and the public interest.</P>
      <P>The ruling on the Ministry of Transportation and Communications's
appeal dealt a serious blow to the ministry's "build, operate and
transfer" (BOT) project to facilitate highway traffic and will cause
far-reaching effects on motorists.</P>
      <P>The FETC has invested more than NT$3 billion in building an
infrastructure and installing on-board units in hundreds of thousands
of vehicles in order to run the ETC system.</P>
      <P>Now that the company's contract with the MOTC must be canceled, a
host of problems concerning compensation, bidder rivalry and consumer
rights are expected to dog the MOTC.</P>
      <P>In February 2006, the Taipei High Administrative Court ruled on
the same premise that FETC's "priority bidder" status should be
stripped, a ruling that MOTC's National Expressway Bureau appealed to
the Supreme Administrative Court. Thursday's ruling was the result of
that appeal.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>To go commercial or stay underground?
Mainstream or independent? Is working with the government a good
thing? One thing is certain: Taiwan's rock festivals are at
a crossroads, a seminar concluded Thursday.</P>
      <P>The participants in the seminar titled "Retrospect on the
Independent Spirit in Indie Music" came from every field related to
rock festivals, including a musician, a pair of music critics, an
event organizer, a music producer and a couple of government
officials.</P>
      <P>They showed common concern about the commercialization and
environmental damage created by rock festivals, which with the help
from the government have become one of the most popular summer
activities for Taiwanese youngsters in recent years.</P>
      <P>There has been controversy and problems with the "big three" rock
festivals -- Spring Scream, Formoz Festival and the Hohaiyan Gongliau
Rock Festival -- such as political interference, fighting for the
same event name by government and independent organizers, drug use at
the events and over-commercialization.</P>
      <P>"The essence of a rock festival is that it is a showcase for the
music industry, but the government looks at it from the tourism
perspective, which leads rock festival in different directions, "
according to Freddy Lin, lead singer of the band Chthonic and the man
responsible for starting Formoz.</P>
      <P>There is a fine line between adherence to the indie rock spirit
and the help from government or companies, said music critic Chang
Tieh-chih, with respect from sponsors for the professionalism of the
artists key.</P>
      <P>Vanya Chung of Trees Music and Art offered a different view,
pointing out that it is not only "big" rock festivals that can have
an impact.</P>
      <P>"Bigger is not always better, said Chung, who has organized many
of the more interesting festivals Taiwan has to offer. Sometimes
smaller music festivals provide better local attachment and cultural
impact. We need to stop being caught up in the numbers game of
thinking that more participants make a more successful event, "she

Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under China's
State Council, to visit Taiwan in October for an agricultural forum.</P>
      <P>The premier said, "China is a big power, while Taiwan is a small
county, so there is no need for Taiwan to provoke China," adding that
bilateral exchanges between the two should be based on "mutual
respect, dialogue, consultation, peace and goodwill."</P>
      <P>Su said Taiwan welcomed Chen as a visitor, but "if he's
coming here for 'united front' purposes, then he shouldn't bother
coming."</P>
      <P>In addition, if Joseph Wu, chairman of Taiwan's Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) and the top China policy planner, is
barred from even setting foot on Hong Kong soil, Su said he
sees no need for Chen to make a high-profile visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is open to guests of good will, but if visitors come with
malevolent intent, "then we have to be on guard," he added.</P>
      <P>Su reaffirmed the government's stance on separate identity and
its independent decision on policies, adding that the public should
have confidence in Taiwan's democracy, freedom and openness and that
it will welcome Chinese tourists so they can witness for themselves
Taiwan's example of freedom and democracy.</P>
      <P>Restrictions on Chinese coming to Taiwan for business,
performances or film-making purposes should also be eased, but if
they come for "united front" purposes, then "we'll kick them out
at once."</P>
      <P>News reports said Chen has been invited by the KMT to attend an
agricultural forum slated for Oct. 13-18 in Taipei as part of
exchanges between the KMT and the Communist Party of China (CPC).</P>
      <P>The KMT invited Chen to visit Taipei last October for an economic
forum, but his application was rejected by the MAC on grounds
that it required official negotiations between Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Consequently, the KMT organized a mission under the leadership of
the KMT's Honorary Chairman Lien Chen, who traveled to Shanghai to
last October to take part in a KMT-CPC economic forum.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT ASKS FOR RELAXATION OF CHINA-BOUND INVESTMENT CAP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 3 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) asked
Premier Su Tseng-chang Friday to show "more teeth" and relax
restrictions on China-bound investment to help give Taiwan's industry
a new lease on life.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whip Tsai Chin-lung issued the call after
Su denied earlier in the day that he would take steps to ease
ceilings on China-bound investments by Taiwan companies.</P>
      <P>According to Su, he has been clear and has not changed his
attitude regarding this issue.</P>
      <P>Since a recent national conference on economic growth did not
reach consensus on removing the existing 40 percent ceiling, the
Executive Yuan will not do so, Su explained.</P>
      <P>Tsai expressed deep disappointment with Su's comments and claimed
that "Su has clearly been held hostage by President Chen Shui-bian
and radical pro-independence activists."</P>
      <P>In the face of economic sluggishness in Taiwan, Su must be braver
to help Taiwan companies find a way to survive -- namely,
by eliminating the 40 percent limit to allow Taiwan businesses to
freely invest in China -- according to Tsai.</P>
      <P>Thanks to frequent and close economic activities between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan enjoyed a trade surplus of US$36.3
billion with China last year -- the prime reason behind Taiwan's
overall annual trade surplus of NT$15.7 billion for the whole of last
year, Tsai said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Everything in the households will be digital
pretty soon in the future, the latest products in the annual Taipei
Computer Applications Show, which is taking place from Aug. 3 - 7,
showed.</P>
      <P>In addition to the computer and communication devices buying and
selling, to which most companies and visitors pay attention, in the
distant future people will be selling and buying "digital homes".</P>
      <P>The theme exhibition entitled "U-Life" (Ubiquitous Life) fortold
a future that digital devices and applications are everywhere in an
ordinary household, including FFTH (fiber-to-the-home) internet
services, car multimedia system, "on-line" white goods (large
household appliances such as refrigerators, air conditioners, and
washing machines), home security system and even long distance care.</P>
      <P>All these mean you don't have to go to a hospital for a medical
checkup or a refrigerator to see for yourself when to do the next
shopping. Neither do you have to endure the "slow" ADSL internet

      <P>And a digital home will be affordable not only for the riches but
for middle class people as well, said Chao Teng-hsiung, president of

buyers place the factor of "how digital it is" over other factors
such as structures and interior design.</P>
      <P>But for now, most visitors are happy just buying discount
computers at the show, which is held at Exhibition Hall I of the
Taipei World Trade Center. There are more than 200 companies setting
up more over 1,400 booths in seven product display areas this year.</P>
      <P>The annual show, which began in 1990, has been averaging more

    <HEADLINE>CLA UNVEILS MEASURES TO IMPROVE TREATMENT OF MIGRANT WORKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) unveiled
an explanatory note Thursday explaining its determination, stance and
strategies to improve treatment of foreign contract workers.</P>
      <P>The note will be referred to the United States and major migrant
laborer-exporting countries via the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to
seek their understanding of Taiwan's efforts to rein in human
trafficking and improve management and care of foreign contract
workers.</P>
      <P>The explanatory paper is a response to a damning U.S. State
Department report issued in early June that placed Taiwan on a "Tier
2 Watch List" for allegedly not fully complying with the minimum
standards for the elimination of human trafficking and forced labor
and sexual exploitation of migrant workers.</P>
      <P>According to the CLA note, a government review system will be
installed to better protect migrant workers. Under the new system,
local governments will be authorized to verify the legality of early
annulment of contracts between employers and migrant workers
and to ensure the annulment is not disputed.</P>
      <P>The CLA's Bureau of Employment and Vocational Training said that
the proposed review system will be easy to implement and free of red
tape. Three days before the repatriation of the migrant worker after
the invalidation of his or her contract, city or county government
social workers will interview the migrant worker first by phone to
see if there is any labor-management dispute or whether the migrant
worker is being forced to return home. If there is any suspicion, the
social worker will visit the foreign worker in person. If any
labor-management dispute is found, the employer will not be allowed
to recruit a new migrant worker to fill the job vacancy.</P>
      <P>In its explanatory paper, the CLA also said it will revise the
law regarding manpower brokering fee collection standards and forge a
"reward" system to screen out bad or poorly managed manpower
agencies. Moreover, the CLA said it will step up random checks on the
management of foreign workers and their general living conditions.</P>

Chinese and foreign investment in Taiwan for 2006 is expected to

    <HEADLINE>MOTC REGRETS COURT RULING ON FREEWAY ETC ROW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  3  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) said Thursday it respects but regrets a Supreme
Administrative Court ruling that the Far Eastern Electronic Toll
Collecting Co. (FETC) no longer enjoys "priority status" in the
procurement process to run a toll system on the nation's freeways.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a late-night news conference, MOTC Deputy Minister
Tsai Duei said the ministry will announce in the shortest possible
period of time workable options to address the situation in the wake
of the ruling.</P>
      <P>Protecting the rights of motorists will be the ministry's top
concern in mapping out follow-up action plans, Tsai said, adding that
starting Friday, motorists can decide on their own whether to install
on-board units (OBUs) for the FETC electronic toll collection system.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the MOTC has asked FETC to maintain normal operations
until after the ministry works out response measures. He made the
assurances that the ministry will fully protect consumers' interest
no matter whether they have already installed the OBUs or they
install the device after the Supreme Administrative Court ruling. If
motorists choose to return the OBUs, they will receive a full refund
of the OBU cost.</P>
      <P>According to the ruling, the FETC must vie with the other two
bidders on an equal footing because the prior bidding process had
violated the principles of equality and the public interest.</P>
      <P>The ruling on the Ministry of Transportation and Communications's
appeal dealt a serious blow to the ministry's "build, operate and
transfer" (BOT) project to facilitate highway traffic and will cause
far-reaching effects on motorists.</P>
      <P>The FETC has invested more than NT$3 billion in building an
infrastructure and installing on-board units in some 220,000 vehicles
in order to run the ETC system.</P>
      <P>Now that the company's contract with the MOTC must be canceled, a
host of problems concerning compensation, bidder rivalry and consumer
rights are expected to dog the MOTC.</P>
      <P>As of Wednesday, some 220,000 motorists had installed OBUs on
their cars to run the FETC's toll collecting system. The FETC said it
will maintain normal operations to fulfill its contract duties and
will announce its response measures after the MOTC comes up with a
clear-cut policy initiative or option.</P>
      <P>In February 2006, the Taipei High Administrative Court ruled on
the same premise that FETC's "priority bidder" status should be
stripped, a ruling that MOTC's National Expressway Bureau appealed to
the Supreme Administrative Court. Thursday's ruling was the result of
that appeal.</P>
      <P>MOTC Minister Kuo Yao-chi said that with a 14 percent use rate,
the ETC system has had an initial result in improving freeway
traffic.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOTC SUPPORTS EXPANSION OF KINMEN PORT, AIRPORT FACILITIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Aug. 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Transportation and Communications Minister
Kuo Yao-chi said Thursday she fully supports proposals to expand port
and airport facilities on the outlying island of Kinmen to cope with
the increasing volume of "mini three links" passengers.</P>
      <P>Kuo made the remarks during an inspection tour of Shuitou wharf
in the company of Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng.</P>
      <P>Lee briefed Kuo on the Shuitou port capacity and operations of
direct shipping services between Kinmen and Xiamen in China's
southeastern Fujian province, commonly known as the "mini three
links" service.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, Shuitou was originally designed for a traffic
volume of 200,000 passengers per year. With the government
continually easing restrictions on Taiwan residents qualified for
traveling across the Taiwan Strait via the "mini three links" route,
Lee said, the passenger volume is expected to top 600,000 this year.</P>
      <P>On the other side of the strait, Lee said, China is building a
new Dongdu wharf at Xiamen port that will be able to process a
traffic volume of 1.5 million passengers annually. In contrast, he
said, the customs clearance facilities at Shuitou wharf have
gradually fallen short of demand.</P>
      <P>Lee said the government should start drafting an expansion plan
as soon as possible now that cross-strait civilian exchanges are
expected to grow even more significantly in the future. He also
suggested that Kinmen's Shangyi Airport be expanded as well to
facilitate "mini three links" passengers' transit flights.</P>
      <P>Echoing Lee's view, Kuo said the transportation ministry will
assist the Kinmen county government in completing expansion projects
at Shuitou wharf and Shangyi Airport.</P>
      <P>Kuo traveled to Kinmen, which lies closer to Fujian than to
Taiwan proper, to attend the opening of a stamp exhibition scheduled
for Friday. But she returned to Taiwan in the evening to handle
thorny issues regarding a freeway electronic toll collection system
row.</P>

(By Jorge Liu, Chiehyu Lin and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A U.S. official in charge of
Asia-Pacific affairs reiterated Thursday that Beijing should engage
in dialogue with Taiwan's popularly-elected leaders.</P>
      <P>Thomas Christensen, newly-appointed deputy assistant secretary of
state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said he thinks that a visit
to Taiwan by China's chief of Taiwan affairs, Chen Yunlin, would be a
"positive development" as far as cross Taiwan Strait relations are
concerned.</P>
      <P>Christensen, who resumed his post with responsibility for affairs
concerning China, Taiwan and Mongolia less than one month ago, made
the remarks after he attended a hearing sponsored by the U.S.-China
Economic and Security Review Commission.</P>
      <P>When asked about the probability of China's and Taiwan's leaders
meeting for dialogue, Christensen said he is unable to make such a
prediction as it is mainly up to Beijing's calculations. He added,
however, that Washington has not been particularly happy with
relevant developments.</P>
      <P>Christensen stressed that the United States will continue to push
for a meeting between the Beijing and Taiwan leaders as it is the
only primary means of cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>He said that he only learned from a newspaper report that
Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is again planning to invite Chen
Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under China's State
Council, to visit Taiwan for an agricultural forum slated for Oct.
13-18 in Taipei as part of exchanges between the KMT and the
Communist Party of China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Christensen noted, the time for the signing of a
bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) between Taiwan and the United
States has not matured yet.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan should try harder to improve its free trade
climate so as to create productive conditions for the signing of an
FTA in the future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER CALLS FOR PROTECTION OF MOTORISTS' RIGHTS AFTER ETC RULING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang instructed Friday
that the rights and interests of motorists who have installed
on-board units (OBUs) for an electronic toll collection (ETC) system
should be protected to the end amid rows over the running of the toll
system on Taiwan's freeways.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the possible repercussions of a ruling by the
Supreme Administrative Court Wednesday that the Far Eastern
Electronic Toll Collecting Co. (FETC) no longer enjoys "priority
status" in the procurement process to run the electronic toll
collection system on the nation's freeways, Su said the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) should thoroughly review the
entire development of the case so as to protect the OBU subscribers'
rights and reduce the negative impact on the government and consumers
to the lowest possible level.</P>
      <P>According to the court ruling, the bidding process in which the
FETC won the contract to operate the system violated the principles
of equality and the public interest. As a result, the company's
contract with the MOTC must be canceled, the court said.</P>
      <P>The court was upholding a ruling by the Taipei High
Administrative Court in February of this year which the National
Expressway Bureau appealed.</P>
      <P>The court ruling is expected to raise a host of problems for the
MOTC concerning compensation, bidder rivalry and consumer rights.</P>
      <P>The FETC has invested more than NT$3 billion in building the
infrastructure and on installing on-board units in some 216,000
vehicles in order to run the ETC system.</P>
      <P>The 216,000 vehicles installed with OBUs represent about 14
percent of all vehicles that use the island's freeways everyday, Su
said.</P>
      <P>MOTC Minister Kuo Yao-chi said that since the National Expressway
Bureau's appeal was rejected, there will unavoidably be a transition
period ahead of a new company or organization taking over control of
the ETC system.</P>
      <P>Kuo stressed that the rights and interests of motorists who have
installed OBUs for the FETC electronic toll collection system will be
fully protected. However, she called for members of the public who
have not yet installed OBUs to avoid doing so for the time being
until the situation is resolved.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that during the transition period, Chunghwa Telecom and
FETC will jointly run the ETC operations and that the ministry will
prepare itself for taking over the whole ETC operations in the worst
case scenario.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a party whip of the opposition Kuomintang legislative
caucus said the ETC system should be suspended immediately.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ching-lung said that a new open bid should be arranged and
that Kuo ought to step down to take responsibility for the ministry's
"wrong policy" concerning the ETC system.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has
set a goal of opening up new revenue and cutting expenditure of two
state-owned enterprises by NT$1.011 billion (US$30.82 million),
economic officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>The MOEA made the revision during a meeting with experts and
academics to discuss how to deal with the operational difficulties
faced by the Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) and the Chinese
Petroleum Corp. (CPC) in the wake of soaring international oil
prices.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that the price of West Texas Intermediate
crude has soared to US$75, up 80 percent per barrel in August, from
US$42 in early 2005.</P>
      <P>Although the CPC has raised the price of petroleum products three
times since the beginning of this year while Taipower has also raised
prices, the hikes have not fully reflected the rising costs of
purchasing crude oil, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They said the losses of Taipower and CPC were around NT$33.2
billion in the first half of the year.</P>
      <P>Participants in the meeting decided that the two state-run
enterprises have to increase revenues and upgrade efficiency while
maintaining the quality of their products and minimizing operational
risks resulting from reduced expenditure.</P>
      <P>The amount Taipower needs to increase revenues and cut
expenditure will be raised to NT$12.4 billion from the original
NT$11.5 billion, while the amount for the CPC will be hiked to
NT$10.695 billion from NT$10.584 billion, the officials said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan people still lack social morality and
environmental protection awareness in public spaces, according to the
results of a recent survey released Friday showing that most beaches
are covered in garbage left by visitors.</P>
      <P>According to the poll results made public by the Kuroshio Ocean

    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Audit Office (NAO) under the
Control Yuan claimed Friday that it has been "absolutely fair" in its
auditing of the president's special state affairs fund.</P>
      <P>Deputy Auditor- General Lin Ching-lung made the statement in
response to some ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
legislators' accusations that the NAO, also known as the Ministry of
Audit, has used double standards in auditing former President Lee
Teng-hui's and President Chen Shui-bian's uses of a special fund
budgeted for the president's discretionary use.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers Lee Chun-yi and Hsieh Hsin-ni, who had demanded the
NAO audit Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou's accounting report on how he has
used his special allowance budget, were dissatisfied with the answer
from the NAO that no irregularities were found in Ma's report.</P>
      <P>Lee and Hsieh visited the NAO Friday to complain that the NAO's
reply to the DPP quoted "the wrong law provisions" in auditing Ma's
account.</P>
      <P>The DPP lawmaker said Chen tried to show him receipts used to
claim relevant expenses but he refused to see them on the grounds
that "it might add pressure on the president."</P>
      <P>He quoted Chen as explaining that the state affairs fund is
divided into two portions, one for "confidential tasks" and the other
for "ordinary purposes."</P>
      <P>Expenses for "ordinary purposes" require receipts to be produced,
but if that portion of the allowance is not used up, the remainder
can be transferred to the "confidential tasks" portion, whose use
does not need to be backed up with receipts, Lee quoted Chen as
saying.</P>
      <P>He further quoted Chen as saying he has kept receipts from the
Lee Teng-hui era that must remain classified because "inadvertent
revealing of them" would pose a risk to "frontline secret diplomacy
workers."</P>
      <P>According to Lee, Chen has not pocketed any public money, nor has
he received private business favors, including Sogo department store
vouchers.</P>
      <P>Lee said that when Lee Teng-hui was president, NAO officials
never asked to review receipts for the use of the special fund, and
now that Chen Shui-bian has taken the initiative to let the auditors
examine his receipts, they claimed they "dared not see" them but then
told the press they suspected irregularities, including embezzlement,
in Chen's use of the special fund.</P>
      <P>"This is clearly double standards in auditing the special fund
accounts of the two presidents," according to Lee Chun-yi.</P>
      <P>In response to Lee's accusation, the NAO's Lin Ching-lung said
the NAO has always exercised its duties "fairly, objectively and
independently" and has "absolutely not adopted double standards."</P>

    <HEADLINE>SPECIAL RICE EXHIBITION OPENS WITH STORIES FROM THE OLD DAYS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  4 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei city government inaugurated a
special exhibition of rice at City Hall Friday, inviting senior
citizen Kao Ming-chie to narrate the history of japonica rice.</P>
      <P>Kao, a Taipei resident born in 1920, recalled how some local rice
traders and farmers imported small quantities of japonica rice from
Japan before 1929 for its good taste.</P>
      <P>In 1929, a strong typhoon almost destroyed Taiwan's entire rice
harvest. As Japanese troops stationed on the island were not used to
the taste of Taiwan's local rice, the Japanese government decided to
introduce japonica rice to be grown in Taiwan to feed its soldiers,
Kao said. Taiwan was under Japanese colonial rule until 1945.</P>
      <P>Kao, who has been living in Yangmingshan in the suburbs of Taipei
since childhood, said that he was assigned by Japanese troops to
cultivate the imported japonica rice.</P>
      <P>After being introduced to Taiwan, the japonica rice became very
popular with the local people, he said.</P>
      <P>However, after Japanese troops withdrew from Taiwan at the
conclusion of World War II, the cultivation of japonica rice became
less rigidly controlled, Kao said. Because of this, along with the
hot weather, the japonica rice grown now is not as tasty as that
was grown in the past, he said.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-cheng, director of the Taipei city government's
Department of Information, said that he would like to encourage local
people to eat more rice, regardless of what kind of rice, as it is a
healthy and nutritious food.</P>
      <P>On display at the exhibition, which will run through Sept. 24,
are many types of rice grown in Taiwan, including japonica rice,
indica rice and glutinous rice.</P>

    <HEADLINE>2ND ROUND CABINET RESHUFFLE TO BEGIN AFTER PREMIER'S CHAD VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A second round of partial Cabinet reshuffle
will kick off after Premier Su Tseng-chang returns to the country
after a scheduled visit to Chad next week, Executive Yuan officials
said Friday.</P>
      <P>The appointments for the first round of the partial reshuffle --
including that of minister of economic affairs -- were finalized
Friday ahead of Su's departure for Chad Sunday to attend Chadian
President Idriss Deby's second inauguration.</P>
      <P>The appointments for a new vice economic minister, new vice
finance minister, new vice chairman of the Financial Supervisory
Commission (FSC) and FSC commissioners, will be decided after next
week in the second round of the reshuffle, the officials said.</P>
      <P>As the first round of the reshuffle, Su announced Friday a new
personnel lineup in which Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Chen
Ruey-long will replace Hwang Ing-san as minister of economic affairs,
FSC Commissioner Shi Jun-ji was named FSC chairman, acting FSC
Chairman Lu Daung-yen was named chairman of the Over-the-Counter
Securities Exchange and Vice Minister of Finance Chen Shu was named
chairman of the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corp., replacing Wu Nai-jen who
tendered his resignation last week.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cabinet officials said that Shi Jun-ji will succeed
Kong Jaw-sheng as the new FSC chairman instead of being an acting
chairman.</P>
      <P>Kong is suspected of involvement in three counts of
irregularities that took place while he was chairman of the state-run
Taiwan Sugar Corp. The Executive Yuan dismissed Kong May 12 but he
resisted the executive order and public pressure to resign on the
grounds that his term of office -- until June 30, 2008 -- was
"guaranteed" according to law.</P>
      <P>Kong appealed his case in June and an administrative court is set
to review his appeal within three months.</P>
      <P>The officials said that should Kong win the appeal, he can be
reinstated as FSC chairman, while another possibility is that Kong is
willing to yield by himself, enabling Shi to replace him as the FSC
chairman.</P>
      <P>In Kong's case, the Cabinet can do nothing because there are</P>
      <P>no laws regulating the circumstances under which a senior
official of an independent institution must step down, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>At the same time, they argued, there are no laws stipulating that
a senior official of an independent institution, like Kong, cannot be
fired by the government.</P>

      <P>A Tainan district prosecutor said
Friday that even if a former lawmaker of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) indicted for embezzling from the Bureau of
National Health Insurance (BNHI) pleads guilty and returns the money,
he will still face prison.</P>
      <P>The prosecutor made the remarks one day after the Tainan District
Court began a trial on the health insurance fraud carried out by
former DPP legislator Chiu Yung-jen and Peter Lin, who is now an
independent lawmaker.</P>
      <P>Chiu confessed and agreed to a plea bargain and a donation of
NT$10 million (US$304,880), while Lin pleaded not guilty.</P>
      <P>The prosecutor said that Chiu's confession and donation
offer will get him a lenient sentence but will not absolve him. All
the money he has embezzled will have to be returned, they added.</P>
      <P>Lin and Chiu both run hospitals in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan.
Prosecutors completed an investigation into the two in March,
demanding five-year prison terms for each of them. Prosecutors charge
that they embezzled NT$190 million and NT$110 million, respectively,
out of the Bureau of National Health Insurance by making false
insurance claims.</P>
      <P>Both Lin and Chiu were stripped off their DPP memberships, but

    <TEXT>
      <P>National Taiwan University (NTU) Hospital
said Friday that the medical records of President Chen Shui-bian and
his family members, as well as the presidents of the five branches of
the government, have been kept confidential.</P>
      <P>The hospital made the remarks as it launched a "protect the
privacy of medical records" drive, the third year in a row it has
carried out such an activity, with local model Lin Chi-ling acting as
the program's spokeswoman. Lin was hospitalized there after falling
from a horse while filming a commercial in China last year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan hospitals are notorious for playing fast and loose with
what are supposed to be confidential medical records, frequently
making them available to the media.</P>
      <P>The official in charge of medical records said the records of
Chen, the first lady and the heads of the five yuans are locked in
the hospital superintendent' office.</P>
      <P>The official said that if medical records are to be made public,
the consent of the patient must be obtained beforehand and the
revelation must be based on the public interest, as well as on the
principle of minimum publicity.</P>
      <P>The official said the Presidential Office has not commissioned
the hospital to report on the health of first lady Wu Shu-jen.
</P>
      <P>Wu has been out of the public spotlight and is reportedly in poor
health since being named in a spate of alleged corruption scandals
implicating the president's close aides and family members.</P>
      <P>The officials said that around 10,000 medical records are in
circulation daily in the hospital, and a questionnaire among more
than 3,000 members of staff found that over 70 percent said patient
privacy is a matter that needs to be addressed.</P>

Israeli airplanes struck again at Hezbollah

Valley and in Nabatiye, while four Israeli 
soldiers were killed and four wounded in 
intermittently fierce fighting. The Israelis are
trying to create a new defensive line about four

security zone Israel intends to occupy until a
multinational force can take its place. The
zone is similar to that held by Israel in an
occupation that ended in 2000.

From the violence in the Mideast, new

of experts to interpret them. Shiite Muslims are
asserting themselves as never before. Followers
of this branch of Islam, generally backbenchers
in the region's power game, are central players
in Lebanon, Iran and Iraq -- often acting out
against traditional powers such as Israel, the
U.S., and Sunni Arab states. Vali Nasr, a

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu reiterated the government's stance Friday that advance
bilateral negotiations are necessary before a planned visit to Taiwan
by a senior Chinese official can take place.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks while answering questions from reporters
after Premier Su Tseng-chang made it clear a day earlier that the
issue must be discussed based on reciprocity and respect.</P>
      <P>There is no need for Taiwan and China to even discuss the issue if
Chen Yunlin, head of the Communist Party of China's (CPC) Central
Office for Taiwan Affairs, is to engage in "united front activities"
while in Taiwan, Su said.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the MAC will carefully assess Chen's application
to visit Taiwan based on the principle laid out by the premier.</P>
      <P>The semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and its
Chinese counterpart, the Beijing-based Association for Relations

    <TEXT>
      <P>Bathers can enjoy clean and safe water at
Taiwan's 10 main bathing sites, now that the latest monitoring
results indicate that water quality is suitable for swimming at all
the swimming beaches.</P>
      <P>Tests conducted by the Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) July 30-31 shows that the water quality at seven of the 10
bathing sites was rated as either "excellent" or "good, " with the
other three classified as "average."</P>
      <P>Fulong beach in Taipei County and two public bathing sites in
Kaohsiung City -- Chichin and Hsitzuwan beaches -- received an
"excellent" rating.</P>
      <P>Previous testing July 16-17 also rated Fulong beach as
"excellent," but five beaches in central and southern Taiwan failed
to meet the standards -- mainly because of heavy rain brought by a
tropical storm.</P>
      <P>The other beaches that received "good" and "average" ratings in
the latest tests are: Hsin Chinshan beach in Taipei County, Taan
beach in Taichung County, Chiting beach in Miaoli County, Masago
beach in Tainan County, Tunghsiao beach in Miaoli County, Kending
Tiaoshih Recreational Seashore in Pingtung County and Shanyuan beach
in Taitung County.</P>
      <P>The results of the water quality testing can be viewed online at
http://www.epa.gov.tw/beach.</P>
      <P>The EPA said it will keep monitoring bathing water quality
throughout the swimming season by conducting tests every two weeks in
order to protect bathers from health risks.</P>
      <P>Bathing water quality is rated as "excellent," "good," "average"
and "below average," based on the levels of escherichia coli, a
bacteria that leads to intestinal diseases, and enterococci bacteria
in the water.</P>
      <P>The EPA cautioned bathers to avoid going to the beach within
three days of a storm, because rain can wash pollutants into the sea,
rendering the water unsuitable for swimming and other water sports.</P>

(By Wang Shu-feng and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Acting Kaohsiung Mayor Yeh Chu-lan is
leading a delegation to Australia Friday to solicit investment in
Kaohsiung's major construction projects, including bidders for a
stadium for the 2009 World Games to be held in the southern port
city.</P>
      <P>Yeh's delegation visited the Australian Trade Commission (ATC)
Friday, where the commission's general manager Peter Obyrne made a
brief presentation on Australia's infrastructure and high-tech
projects.</P>
      <P>In addition to discussing key Australian development projects
such as airports, the high-speed railroad, telecommunications,
petroleum, natural gas, sewage system and housing, Obyrne also
focused on Sydney's stadium, which seated some 110,000 during the
2000 Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>Noting that Australia's railway entrepreneurs have participated
in testing work on Taiwan's high-speed rail system, Obyrne said they
were very familiar with Taiwan's high-speed rail and promised to
visit Kaohsiung City from Taipei via the new network.</P>
      <P>Yeh expressed hope that Australia's architectural firms would be
able to participate in the construction of a world-class stadium for
Kaohsiung's 2009 World Games as well as several of the city's other
major construction projects, including the subway, broadband services
and wharf renovation.</P>
      <P>Lin Chin-jung, director of the Kaohsiung city government's Bureau
of Public Works, noted that some 80 percent of the electricity used
in the main stadium for the 2009 World Games will be supplied by
solar energy, and that the city government welcomes interested
parties to bid for the construction project.</P>
      <P>Obyrne and other members of the ATC showed keen interest in
Kaohsiung construction projects, and promised to lead a delegation to
the city in the near future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR MEETS WITH DELEGATION OF U.S. STATE LEGISLATORS</HEADLINE>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou met with a
delegation of U.S. state legislators Friday to exchange views on ways
to boost bilateral exchanges.</P>
      <P>Ma greeted the three influential members from the 
California state legislature and five leading figures from the New
Mexico state legislature at Taipei City Hall. The delegation was led
by New Mexico Senator Ben Altamirano, who is serving as acting
speaker of New Mexico's state legislature.</P>
      <P>Ma is proud that Taipei was awarded in June for being the
world's most wired city in terms of using a broadband wireless
telecommunication network, telling the foreign dignitaries that the
Taipei city government is keen on encouraging citizens to "use
the Internet more" rather than "strolling around the streets."</P>
      <P>"Building Taipei into a world-class capital is one of my election
promises to Taipei citizens," Ma stated.</P>
      <P>According to the Taipei mayor, the city will have 4,100 access
points available for the public to surf the Internet through
their PDAs, computers and handphones by the end of this year,
representing a broadband wireless coverage rate of 90 percent.</P>
      <P>Ma also introduced the visitors to the city's Ease Card -- an
electronic smart card that allows travel on city buses and the mass
rapid train system, as well as parking in public lots.</P>
      <P>The Ease Card also serves as a student card for Taipei's grade
school children, allowing them to relay text messages to their
parents immediately after arriving at school, Ma said.</P>
      <P>The three state legislators from California also discussed with
Ma the possibility of establishing a state trade office in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While the legislators presented Ma with a bottle of California
red wine, the Taipei mayor gave each of them the gift of a guidebook,
"Insight City Guides: Taipei."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP CALL ON PREMIER TO FORGE 'THREE DIRECT LINKS' WITH CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 4 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two lawmakers of the opposition People First
Party (PFP) urged Premier Su Tseng-chang Friday to ignore opposition
by independence advocates and to boldly forge "direct links" with
China in postal, trade and transportation services.</P>
      <P>Commenting on reports that Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Chen
Ruey-long will replace Hwang Ing-san as economic minister, Legislator
Lee Hung-chun, a whip of the PFP's legislative caucus, said it would
be useless for the Democratic Progressive Party-led government to
keep replacing its economic minister while continuing to refuse
relaxing restrictions on cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>He acknowledged that by naming a new minister of economic
affairs, the premier has demonstrated a determination to improve
Taiwan's economy, but added that Taiwan's economic problems cannot be
solved by a partial Cabinet reshuffle.</P>
      <P>"All the government's efforts will be in vain if it does not
relax restrictions on trade and economic exchanges between Taiwan and
mainland China," he said.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung said the government should face
cross-strait affairs squarely becaus the issue has become a central
stumbling block in Taiwan's economic development.</P>
      <P>Liu urged the government to ignore opposition by independence
advocates and to forge the "three direct links" of mail, trade and
transport services with China.</P>
      <P>Hwang resigned after serving as economic minister for 168 days,
but he is not the shortest-serving economic minister in Taiwan's
history. Christine Tsung stepped down in March 2002 after serving in
the post for only 48 days.</P>
      <P>Chen is the sixth economics minister under the DPP government in
slightly more than six years.</P>

      <P>Acting Kaohsiung Mayor Yeh Chu-lan
criticized China as a bullying neighbor Friday in Australia, arguing
that Beijing's behavior has made Taiwan's political situation very
difficult.</P>
      <P>Yeh, who is leading a delegation of Kaohsiung city officials to
Australia to attract Australian investment in the southern Taiwan
port city, made the remarks while meeting with Taiwanese expatriates
and young students at the University of Sydney.</P>
      <P>Noting that China is targeting Taiwan with more then 800
missiles, Yeh said Beijing also has been transmitting the wrong
message to the world community -- that Taiwan is a part of China.</P>
      <P>"Beijing's efforts to squeeze Taiwan's development space in the
world community have seriously damaged the friendship between people
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait," Yeh added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is already an independent country, but China has no
courage to recognize that reality, Yeh stressed, urging the Taiwanese
people to bravely brace against Beijing's bullying by actively
participating in international activities.</P>
      <P>Yeh also introduced charms of Kaohsiung to the audience, saying
that the city has great development potential.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HUMAN RIGHTS SERIOUSLY ABUSED IN TAIWAN MEDIA: MEDIAWATCHERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 4 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Basic human rights, including privacy and
the right to refuse to be interviewed, have been seriously abused by
Taiwan's media, especially in television news, a media watchdog said
in a seminar Friday.</P>
      <P>Respect for human rights has been ignored for so long because of
agrowing competition in the media, and it's time to solve the problem
no matter how long it takes, said Connie Lin, CEO of the Broadcasting
Development Fund (BDF) , a non-profit media watch group which
organized the seminar "Human rights under the camera lens."</P>
      <P>One of several TV newsclips played before the seminar showed a
six-year-old girl refusing to be interviewed but ignored by the media
and the face of a mentally ill patient.</P>
      <P>The mother-in-law, first grandson and even butler of President
Chen Shui-bian were followed by media everywhere, with more than two
dozen reporters camped daily outside their residence in an attempt to
follow their every move, the video also showed.</P>
      <P>The current media chaos in Taiwan can be traced back to the
"media explosion" after the end of the martial law era, and the
situation has worsened in recent years, said Cheryl Lai, president of
Radio Taiwan International.</P>
      <P>Lai said that besides the "survival of the fittest" dynamic, the
media should shoulder most of the responsibility for the decline in
journalism's professionalism in recent years, because the media has
gotten caught up in the numbers game -- doing whatever it takes to
get higher ratings.</P>
      <P>Not only have viewers felt frustration toward the media but
reporters have as well -- which is why Chin Yu-chung became a print
media reporter after five years as a TV cameraman.</P>
      <P>With nine 24-hour news channels competing year-round, it's hard
to believe the current situation will see any dramatic improvements,
although a self-restraint and self-discipline agreement has been
signed by all news channels, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The media should start respecting basic human rights before it's
too late, Lai said. Otherwise, she added, the general public will one
day spurn the media because viewers have the ultimate power: turning
off the television.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TIME TO GET MEDIA BACK ON THE RIGHT TRACK: WATCHDOG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 4 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>News-gathering organizations and the general
public can both play a critical role in getting Taiwan's media back
on the right track to eliminate human rights abuses, a watchdog group
said in a seminar Friday.</P>
      <P>The seminar titled "Human rights under the camera lens" was
organized by Broadcasting Development Fund (BDF), a non-profit
media watch group, and focused on growing cases of human rights
abuse by Taiwan's media.</P>
      <P>Cases discussed in the seminar included ignoring privacy and
people's right as well as revealing the faces and names of patients
with various illnesses without their prior consent.</P>
      <P>"Most people nowadays are well aware of their own rights," said
Yu Ying-fu, an attorney. "But mostly all they do is complain when
they are offended by the media."</P>
      <P>As an attorney, Yu said, he probably shouldn't encourage people
to take legal action against the media.</P>
      <P>"But by doing this, maybe the media will learn the lesson and
finally understand the fine line between freedom of press and
individual privacy."</P>
      <P>"Reporters need a re-education in communication ethics, " said
Paul Tsai, deputy manager of Formosa Television's news gathering
center. "On the other hand, members of the public should also know
their rights."</P>
      <P>Tsai also mentioned several mechanisms that can help keep a tight
rein on electronic media, including tighter supervision of
the National Communication Commission (NCC) and regular human rights
reviews by print media, media watchdogs and human rights groups.</P>
      <P>"It is time to solve the [human rights abuse] problem, no matter
how long it takes," BDF's CEO Connie Lin said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>After China and Japan, Taiwan is still the
world's third largest holder of foreign exchange reserves, according
to figures released Friday by the Taipei-based Central Bank of China.</P>
      <P>The figures show that as of the end of July, Taiwan's foreign
currency reserves stood at US$260.37 billion -- a slight increase
over US$20 million in June.</P>
      <P>News reports in late July quoted Russia's central bank as saying
that thanks to oil exports, Russia's gold and foreign currency
reserves grew by $7.2 billion to US$262.9 billion as of July 21,
replacing Taiwan as the world's third largest holder of foreign
currency reserves.</P>
      <P>Lin Sun-yuan, director of the Central Bank of China's foreign
exchange department, explained that in terms of foreign currency
reserves Taiwan is still No. 3 in the world because the Russian
statistics included gold reserves.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan's gold reserves were added to its foreign currency
reserves, that figure would still amount to US$268.2 billion --
higher than Russia's US$262.9 billion, Lin said.</P>
      <P>At the end of June, China was the world's largest holder of
foreign currency reserves, with US$925 billion, followed by Japan's
US$842.8 billion.</P>

      <P>The Financial Supervisory Commission's (FSC)
chairman-designate said Friday he will do his utmost to regain public
confidence in the commission after assuming the post.</P>
      <P>Shi Jun-ji, an FSC commissioner who has been designated as the
next FSC chairman, made the remarks at his first news conference
since Premier Su Tseng-chang announced his new assignment earlier in
the day.</P>
      <P>Noting the commission's core work comprises buoying up the
financial services industry and maintaining a stable financial
environment, Shi said his top priority will be to ensure the FSC's
smooth and efficient operations.</P>
      <P>Shi further said that impartiality, integrity and circumspection
will be his modus operandi during his term at the FSC.</P>
      <P>Shi, who has a doctorate from National Taiwan University, said
although he is not an "insider of the securities and futures market,"
he is not a layman in the financial profession, either.</P>
      <P>One of his most urgent tasks after assuming the post is to draft
a concrete action plan to implement a number of "common opinions"
reached at a recent government-sponsored economic conference on
financial reforms, Shi said.</P>
      <P>The two-year-old FSC has traveled down a bumpy road since its
inauguration July 1, 2004. Several of the commission's key posts have
been vacant for some time.</P>
      <P>Shi will succeed Kong Jaw-sheng as new FSC chairman instead of
being an acting chairman. Kong was dismissed in May after being
suspected of involvement in three counts of irregularities that took
place during his tenure as chairman of the state-run Taiwan Sugar
Corp.</P>
      <P>Over the past couple of months, FSC Vice Chairman Lu Daung-yen
has served as FSC acting chairman. After Shi takes over the FSC
chairmanship, Lu will serve as chairman of the Over-the-Counter
Securities Exchange.</P>
      <P>As the FSC is responsible for many onerous assignments, Shi said
he will urge the premier to name a new vice chairman and replacements
to fill up other vacant posts in the commission as soon as possible
to ensure the FSC's smooth operation.</P>
      <P>The top post at the FSC's Examination Bureau has been left vacant
since the resignation of Lee Chin-cheng more than a year ago. Lee has

      <P>The central government's expenditure is

from this year's level, according to a draft budget plan referred to
the Presidential Office Friday.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan officials briefed President Chen Shui-bian on the
highlights of the 2007 central government budget plan during a
meeting at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>After listening to the briefing, Chen praised the Executive Yuan
for its efforts to realize two policy goals in its 2007 draft budget
plan -- appropriating an outlay equivalent to 3 percent of the
country's domestic gross product (GDP) as the total research and
development fund for the coming year and raising the ratio of defense
budget to 2.85 percent of GDP.</P>
      <P>"Given the government's financial straits, I know the executive
branch must have overcome many difficulties realizing these two
policy goals," Chen said during the meeting.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the president questioned whether the outlay set
aside for boosting domestic economic development in the draft budget
plan is sufficient enough to bolster the projected 4 percent to 5
percent GDP growth while keeping the unemployment rate below 4
percent and accomplishing a per capita GDP of US$30,000 by 2015.</P>
      <P>Stressing that promoting investment in Taiwan is the most urgent

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN STILL HOLDS THIRD MOST FOREX RESERVES IN WORLD(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 4 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>After China and Japan, Taiwan is still the
world's third largest holder of foreign exchange reserves, according
to figures released Friday by the Taipei-based Central Bank of China.</P>
      <P>The figures show that as of the end of July, Taiwan's foreign
currency reserves stood at US$260.37 billion -- a slight increase
over US$20 million in June.</P>
      <P>News reports in late July quoted Russia's central bank as saying
that thanks to oil exports, Russia's gold and foreign currency
reserves grew by $7.2 billion to US$262.9 billion as of July 21,
replacing Taiwan as the world's third largest holder of foreign
currency reserves.</P>
      <P>Lin Sun-yuan, director of the Central Bank of China's foreign
exchange department, explained that in terms of foreign currency
reserves Taiwan is still No. 3 in the world because the Russian
statistics included gold reserves.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan's gold reserves were added to its foreign currency
reserves, that figure would still amount to US$268.2 billion --
higher than Russia's US$262.9 billion, Lin said.</P>
      <P>At the end of June, China was the world's largest holder of
foreign currency reserves, with US$925 billion, followed by Japan's
US$842.8 billion.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 4 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>News-gathering organizations and the general
public can both play a critical role in getting Taiwan's media back
on the right track to eliminate human rights abuses, a watchdog group
said in a seminar Friday.</P>
      <P>The seminar titled "Human rights under the camera lens" was
organized by Broadcasting Development Fund (BDF), a non-profit
media watch group, and focused on growing cases of human rights
abuse by Taiwan's media.</P>
      <P>Cases discussed in the seminar included ignoring privacy and
people's right as well as revealing the faces and names of patients
with various illnesses without their prior consent.</P>
      <P>"Most people nowadays are well aware of their own rights," said
Yu Ying-fu, an attorney. "But mostly all they do is complain when
they are offended by the media."</P>
      <P>As an attorney, Yu said, he probably shouldn't encourage people
to take legal action against the media.</P>
      <P>"But by doing this, maybe the media will learn the lesson and
finally understand the fine line between freedom of press and
individual privacy."</P>
      <P>"Reporters need a re-education in communication ethics, " said
Paul Tsai, deputy manager of Formosa Television's news gathering
center. "On the other hand, members of the public should also know
their rights."</P>
      <P>Tsai also mentioned several mechanisms that can help keep a tight
rein on electronic media, including tighter supervision of
the National Communication Commission (NCC) and regular human rights
reviews by print media, media watchdogs and human rights groups.</P>
      <P>"It is time to solve the [human rights abuse] problem, no matter
how long it takes," BDF's CEO Connie Lin said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HUMAN RIGHTS SERIOUSLY ABUSED IN TAIWAN MEDIA: MEDIAWATCHERS(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 4 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Basic human rights, including privacy and
the right to refuse to be interviewed, have been seriously abused by
Taiwan's media, especially in television news, a media watchdog said
in a seminar Friday.</P>
      <P>Respect for human rights has been ignored for so long because of
agrowing competition in the media, and it's time to solve the problem
no matter how long it takes, said Connie Lin, CEO of the Broadcasting
Development Fund (BDF) , a non-profit media watch group which
organized the seminar "Human rights under the camera lens."</P>
      <P>One of several TV newsclips played before the seminar showed a
six-year-old girl refusing to be interviewed but ignored by the media
and the face of a mentally ill patient.</P>
      <P>The mother-in-law, first grandson and even butler of President
Chen Shui-bian were followed by media everywhere, with more than two
dozen reporters camped daily outside their residence in an attempt to
follow their every move, the video also showed.</P>
      <P>The current media chaos in Taiwan can be traced back to the
"media explosion" after the end of the martial law era, and the
situation has worsened in recent years, said Cheryl Lai, president of
Radio Taiwan International.</P>
      <P>Lai said that besides the "survival of the fittest" dynamic, the
media should shoulder most of the responsibility for the decline in
journalism's professionalism in recent years, because the media has
gotten caught up in the numbers game -- doing whatever it takes to
get higher ratings.</P>
      <P>Not only have viewers felt frustration toward the media but
reporters have as well -- which is why Chin Yu-chung became a print
media reporter after five years as a TV cameraman.</P>
      <P>With nine 24-hour news channels competing year-round, it's hard
to believe the current situation will see any dramatic improvements,
although a self-restraint and self-discipline agreement has been
signed by all news channels, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The media should start respecting basic human rights before it's
too late, Lai said. Otherwise, she added, the general public will one
day spurn the media because viewers have the ultimate power: turning
off the television.</P>

      <P>Yeh, who is leading a delegation of Kaohsiung city officials to

      <P>Wang, 26, has quickly become one of the Yankees' most reliable

    <TEXT>
      <P>A park commemorating pioneering Taiwan
democracy activist Chiang Wei-shui was inaugurated in Taipei City
Saturday, the 75th anniversary of Chiang's death.</P>
      <P>Presiding over the inauguration of the park, Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou said Chiang made a great contribution to Taiwan, dedicating
a large part of his life to promoting Taiwan's democratic movement.</P>
      <P>The Taipei city government has renamed the Chinhsi Park in the
city's Tatung district as the Chiang Wei-Shui Memorial Park. It is
located near a hospital formerly run by Chiang, a physician-turned
democracy activist.</P>
      <P>Born in 1891, Chiang was a mover in the forerunner of the
Taiwanese nationalist movement under Japanese colonial rule. From
1921, he fought against the Japanese colonial regime by uniting
students and social leaders under the banner of the Taiwan Cultural
Association, cultivating a sense of national awareness.</P>
      <P>He was jailed by the Japanese in 1923 and while in prison, he
wrote extensively on humanitarian issues and opposed Japanese
atrocities.</P>
      <P>In 1927, he established Taiwan's first political party, the
Taiwan People's Party, and later consolidated Taiwan's labor
movements by forming the Taiwan Labor Alliance.</P>
      <P>Chiang was incarcerated a dozen times during his lifetime and was
lauded as "the savior of the Taiwan people" when he died in 1931 at
the age of just 40.</P>
      <P>Also that day, a ceremony was held at Taipei's Ching Hsiu Girls'
High School -- the original site of the Taiwan Cultural Association
headquarters -- to commemorate Chiang.</P>
      <P>Former Control Yuan member Huang Huang-hsiung, who convened the
ceremony, said Chiang represents the Taiwan spirit and the
nationalist spirit and he urged the people, regardless of their
political affiliations, to keep in mind the contribution Chiang made
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Huang pointed out that this year's ceremony marks the first time
members of different political parties and ethnic groups have
participated together.</P>
      <P>Since a ceremony was held five years ago to remember the 70th
anniversary of Chiang's death, various sectors of society have used
different methods to express their gratitude for Chiang, Huang said.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, the Cabinet has decided to name the Peiyi
Freeway the Chiang Wei-shui Freeway, and a series of publications
concerning Chiang are soon to be published.</P>
      <P>The Yilan county government has also established a park to
commemorate Chiang, who came from the northeastern county, Huang
noted.</P>
      <P>Ma also participated in that ceremony, along with Vice President
Annette Lu and Premier Su Tseng-chang.</P>

      <P>A Presidential Office spokesman denied
Saturday an opposition legislator's allegation that President Chen
Shui-bian has a secret bank account, claiming that the account in
question is an open account used for political contributions ahead of
the 2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lee Nan-yang made the statement to rebut the accusation made by
Kuomintang Legislator Chiu Yi, who showed what he claimed is evidence
Friday that Chen has a secret account with the Taishin International
Bank that was opened in 2002 and was valued at NT$169 million (US$
5.15 million) shortly after the presidential election in March 2004.</P>
      <P>Chiu also claimed that Chen ordered a close aide to transfer the
money in the account abroad in May 2004 and claimed that Chen has
never declared this account to the Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>According to Chiu, the president, who feared he might lose the
election in 2004, ordered the transfer of the money into his personal
account for the preparation for its transfer abroad.</P>
      <P>However, Lee said the account was opened to receive donations
from Chen's supporters for the 2004 presidential election and closed
soon after the election.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lee went on, Chiu just listed the receipts into the
account and ignored the expenditure.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Presidential Office closed the account shortly
after the 2004 presidential election, Lee said the money in the
account was not transferred abroad and that as the account does not
belong to the personal assets of the president, it is therefore not
necessary for Chen to declare it to the Control Yuan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DIABETES DEATHS INCREASE IN 2005</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Over 10,000 people died from diabetes in
2005, averaging 1.2 deaths every hour, the Taiwanese Association of
Diabetes Educators (TADE) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>TADE President Hsu Huei-huan made the remarks in a seminar
marking the 10th anniversary of the association's founding.</P>
      <P>He noted that the mortality rate from diabetes is rising rapidly,
making it, along with suicide, two of the nation's top 10 causes of
death that have registered rapid increases.</P>
      <P>Hsu noted that the mortality rate from diabetes increased by 13.8
percent last year compared with 2004, a rate of increase that
surpassed those of malignant tumors, stroke and cardiovascular
disease, which were the top three causes of death in 2005.</P>
      <P>He cited statistics compiled by the Department of Health as
saying that 10,501 people died from diabetes in Taiwan in 2005,
averaging 28.7 deaths every day.
</P>
      <P>Up to 800,000 diabetes patients need medical treatment, with
medical expenses surpassing NT$30 billion (US$91.46 million) ,
accounting for over 10 percent of the health insurance reimbursement
payments.</P>
      <P>He said the figure is an understatement, noting that if the
figure were to be combined with deaths from complications from
diabetes, the number would be even bigger, especially because 30
percent of diabetes patients can expect to suffer from retinal,
neural and kidney problems within 10 years of diagnosis.
</P>
      <P>He cited kidney dialysis as an example, saying that out of 40,000
patients who need kidney dialysis at present, between 15,000 and
20,000 are diabetics.</P>
      <P>Although the prevalence of diabetes is still the greatest among
those over 40, accounting for between 11 percent and 13 percent, Hsu
said there are also many cases of younger people suffering from the
disease.</P>
      <P>Around three-quarters of diabetics have difficulty controlling
their disease, mainly because they do not follow a diet regimen.</P>
      <P>He advised diet control, regular exercise and medication as the
best ways to control the disease.</P>

      <P>Of Taiwan's Internet users, 18.37 percent,
or 3.57 million, have wireless broadband access and 9.53 percent, or
1.85 million users, access the Internet through mobile broadband
services, according to the results of a survey released Friday by the
Taiwan Network Information Center (TWNIC).</P>
      <P>A TWNIC official explained that compared with an 80.64 percent
penetration rate for ADSL broadband access, the ratios of wireless
and mobile access are significantly lower, indicating that efforts
are required to make them available to more users.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the TWNIC between May 17 and Aug. 4
among 3,192 Taiwan residents aged 12 or over. The survey, conducted
through computer assisted telephone interviews, had a margin of error
of 1.79 percent.</P>
      <P>A similar poll conducted in July 2003 showed that the penetration
rate of wireless access at that time was 1.51 percent. The estimated
ratio grew to 3.07 percent in July 2005 and 3.56 percent this year.</P>
      <P>This year's survey also shows that 47.56 percent of the wireless
users access the Internet at home and that 31.28 percent of the
respondents connect to the Internet at the office.</P>
      <P>As for mobile services, the polled ratio in July 2003 was 0.96
percent, while the ratio grew to 1.48 percent in July 2005 and 1.66
percent this year.</P>
      <P>According to this year's poll, 60.67 percent of mobile access
users choose GPRS service, 12.95 percent use PHS, 11.06 percent use
3G, and 9.47 percent use WAP.</P>
      <P>Of the mobile users, 39.80 percent said they use the service to
download ring-tones, 18.27 percent said they use it to surf and 12.91
percent said they use it to send or receive e-mails.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONTROL YUAN'S REACTION TO FIRST LADY'S JEWELRY REPORTS `WEAK': KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Control Yuan, the nation's highest
watchdog body, was "weak" in its response to a jewelry assets report
filed by President Chen Shui-bian and first lady Wu Shu-jen, a
lawmaker of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Tsai Ching-lung made the remarks one day after the
Presidential Office replied to the Control Yuan in a letter that
because the first lady borrowed some jewelry from relatives and
friends, she could not list it in the report "for privacy reasons."</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the Control Yuan should "voice strong
discontent" over this reply, instead of saying that the first couple
has not violated the law.</P>
      <P>The first couple sent a corrected version of jewelry assets to
the Control Yuan in early July, listing 15 pieces of jewelry and
watches that they own, with a value of NT$3.725 million (US$113,560).</P>
      <P>Legislators from the opposition KMT and People First Party then
showed photos of 31 pieces of jewelry worn by the first lady on
various occasions. The Control Yuan therefore asked for an
explanation from the first family within 15 days.</P>
      <P>The first couple, replied Friday -- the last day of the deadline
-- that they had acquiesced to the Control Yuan's request by filing
reports on their jewelry, but had not reported on jewelry borrowed
from relatives or friends because the relatives and friends were not
being audited and should have the privacy of their assets protected.</P>
      <P> Hsieh Yu-nan, a Control Yuan official in charge of asset
reports, reportedly said that the first family has not violated the
law in this regard.</P>
      <P>Noting that according to the Public Functionary Assets Disclosure
Law, any piece of jewelry, including watches, worth over NT$200,000
(US$6,100) must be listed with the Control Yuan, Tsai said that the
Control Yuan must demand that the public functionary give an
explanation if asked, or face repeated fines of between NT$20,000 and
NT$100,000 until an explanation is forthcoming.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the KMT caucus will lodge a strong protest with the
Control Yuan over its "weakness."</P>

    <HEADLINE>ORAL HEALTHCARE AWARENESS POOR AMONG TAIWAN UNDERGRADUATES: STUDY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  5 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Twenty percent of Taiwan undergraduates
under the age of 20 have had at least one of their molar teeth
extracted because of tooth decay, according to a study released
Saturday by the Taiwan Oral Health Society.</P>
      <P>The rate is 13 times higher than that of Japan, which shows that
oral healthcare awareness among Taiwanese is insufficient, the
society said.</P>
      <P>The study was conducted by the society in cooperation with 16
countries in July and August 2005. A total of 2,800 undergraduates
under 20 from Taiwan and Japan were surveyed, with the results set to
be collated later along with the findings of similar surveys
conducted in the other countries involved.</P>
      <P>According to Chang Chin-shun, president of the society, the study
found that the ratio of Taiwan undergraduates with gum inflammation
is also higher than that of Japan.</P>
      <P>Chang attributed the situation to failure by Taiwan
undergraduates to clean their teeth thoroughly, which causes dental
plaque that induces inflammation and bleeding.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said, diabetics should pay extra attention to
their oral healthcare, because their susceptibility to inflammation
can easily lead to periodontal disease.</P>
      <P>As shown in a survey conducted last year among 250 diabetics</P>
      <P>aged between 50 and 64 around Taiwan, 92.3 percent of those
surveyed suffered from moderate or severe periodontal disease, Chang
noted.</P>
      <P>While 63.8 percent of diabetics had moderate periodontal disease,
28.5 percent had severe periodontal disease, he said, adding that the
ratios compare with just 7 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively,
among healthy people.</P>
      <P>Also, each diabetic on average has had 14.37 teeth extracted
because of tooth decay, which means that each one has lost almost
half of his or her teeth, Chang said.</P>

Satellite TV Growth Is Losing Altitude

The two leading satellite companies in the

Communications Corp. are seeing a sharp slowdown
in the number of new subscribers. In the last
year, their gains have shrunk to half of what
they were during the industry's heyday early in
this decade, and they are projected to decline
further. Meanwhile, the cable-TV industry, after
years of seeing satellite steal market share and
customers by pitching better service and more

    <HEADLINE>CREATING FAVORABLE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT PRIORITY FOR NEW MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 5 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister-designate Chen Ruey-long
said Saturday that creating a business environment favorable to
investment will be his top priority job after he assumes his post.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks a day after Premier Su Tseng-chang
announced his Cabinet reshuffle. Chen, who has been vice minister of
economic affairs since 2002, will replace Hwang Ing-san.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the most important task for his ministry will be
to create a business environment in which entrepreneurs want to
invest, and help enterprises boost their competitiveness to ensure
Taiwan's stable economic growth.</P>
      <P>Noting that domestic investment has focused on flat panel
displays and semiconductors for the last few years, Chen said he will
encourage other industries to increase investment after he assumes
his new post.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said he will also consult with the
representatives of the country's six major trade organizations and
industrial leaders to better understand the problems facing the
business sector.</P>
      <P>In addition to helping foreign investors better understand
Taiwan's investment environment through an international investment
conference to be held in Taiwan in October, the ministry will try to
attract Taiwanese businessmen with operations abroad to invest at
home, taking advantage of preferential loans, Chen added.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) , the number of new investment projects launched by
Taiwan's private sector during the first seven months of this year
reached 795, with a value totaling NT$620.9 billion (US$18.9
million).</P>
      <P>These investments represent 69 percent of the MOEA's goal for
this year, or NT$903.2 billion.</P>
      <P>Among the various sectors, electronics and information accounted
for the bulk of new investment projects during the period.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the number of new investment projects made by foreign
and overseas Chinese investors totaled 666 during the first half of
this year, with a value of NT$6.94 billion.</P>
      <P>The value of the investment represented a growth of 530 percent
over the same period of last year, with foreign investments expected
to break NT$8 billion this year, a record high, according to the

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  5 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia plays an "important role" in
Taiwan Strait issues and should clearly oppose any change by force to
Taiwan's sovereign status because it is in Australia's best
interests, according to academics who attended an international
seminar in Taipei Saturday.</P>
      <P>"It would make Beijing understand that not only the U.S. and
Japan, but also Australia, will provide support, if needed, on Taiwan
Strait security, " said Bill Chang, a PhD student at the University
of New South Wales, in the seminar, titled "The Asian Pacific
Security Environment After the Enactment of the Anti-Secession Law."</P>
      <P>"It is inconceivable that Canberra would not become involved if a
war erupts in the strait with U.S. involvement. The Australian Armed
Forces has clearly been geared toward providing assistance in combat,
" according to You Ji, a professor at the University of New South
Wales.</P>
      <P>"Canberra's Taiwan policy is also clearly set on war prevention
through maintaining the status quo in the strait. This is totally in
line with Washington's position, " he added.</P>
      <P>Eight of Australia's top 10 trade partners and 65% of its foreign
trade come from the Asia-Pacific region, Chang pointed out. If
military conflict between Taiwan and China were to occur, it would
have a serious impact on Australia's interest in the region, he
added.</P>
      <P>The dilemma for Australia, You said, is that it strongly
disapproves of China's politico-social system but has a pragmatic need
to deepen export dependence on the Chinese market, which is why Prime
Minister John Howard quickly altered his initial 1996 China policy
from "balance-of-power based" to "cooperation based."</P>
      <P>"If the U.S. is in for dealing with Taiwan Strait conflict, it's
hard for Australia not to be in, " said Australian Adm. Chris Barrie.</P>
      <P>"On the other hand, it seems to be time for a proper debate in
Taiwan about future security and prospects," he added.</P>

(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Strategic partnerships in the Asia-Pacific
region, especially from U.S. allies' points of view, are a delicate
issue, academics at an international seminar said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The academics, from Australia, Japan and Taiwan, were attending
the seminar, titled "The Asia-Pacific Security Environment After the
Enactment of Anti-Secession Law, " organized by the Taiwan Foundation
for Democracy and the Cross-Strait Study Association.</P>
      <P>A ministerial-level conference of U.S. Secretary of State
Condoleeza Rice, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso and Australian
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer in March strengthened the strategic
partnership between three countries, said Bill Chang, a PhD student
at the University of New South Wales.</P>
      <P>The partnership is obvious and regarded as a balance of China's
growing impact in the region, as former U.S. Secretary of Defense
William Perry once described Australia and Japan as two "anchors" of
the U.S. Asia-Pacific strategy.</P>
      <P>However, South Korea, which once was seen as a U.S. ally, seems
to be drifting out of the equation, said Tomohide Murai, a professor
at Japan's National Defense Academy.</P>
      <P>"It seems to me that South Korea is no longer a reliable partner
for the U.S., as 40 percent of the respondents to a South Korean
public opinion poll said the U.S. is the biggest threat to South
Korea. Also, 60 percent of the respondents supported North Korea's
nuclear program, " Murai added.</P>
      <P>The anti-U.S. atmosphere was not only felt in South Korea but in
Japan as well, especially Okinawa Prefecture, he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan on the other hand has never been officially seen as a
strategic partner of the U.S. because of the cross-strait situation,
he said.</P>
      <P>The partnership will be even more complicated if trade relations
with China are factored into the equation, said You Ji, a professor
at the University of New South Wales.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 5  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Saturday that
although Minister of Transportation and Communications Kuo Yao-chi is
in charge of dealing with the shambles surrounding the controversial
electronic toll collection (ETC) system, she should not be
held responsible for the chaos.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks after the Supreme Administrative Court
decided Thursday to revoke the "priority bidder" status of the Far
Eastern Electronic Toll Corp. (FETC), which has been running the ETC
system on the nation's freeways since February, ruling that it was a
flawed screening process that enabled the FETC to obtain priority
status over two other bidders.</P>
      <P>The ruling put the ETC controversy back to square one, despite
the fact that around 220,000 on-board units (OBUs) have been
installed in cars using the FETC's system since February. The
opposition Kuomintang and the People First Party had demanded that
Kuo step down to take administrative responsibility for the mess.</P>
      <P>Su noted that the planning and the bidding process did not take
place during Kuo's tenure, as she only assumed the post early this
year and is only in charge of taking care of the aftermath.</P>
      <P>Su said the Ministry of Transportation and Communication
(MOTC) should "review seriously the earlier bidding process and find
out who should be held responsible."</P>
      <P>He said the most important thing is to protect the rights of the
220,000 OBU users and to keep the damage to the government and the
subscribers to a minimum.</P>
      <P>In February 2006, the Taipei High Administrative Court ruled on
the same premise that FETC should be stripped of its "priority
bidder" status, a ruling that the MOTC's National Expressway
Bureau appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court. Thursday's
ruling was the result of that appeal.</P>
      <P>The FETC, which has invested more than NT$3 billion in building
the infrastructure and installing the OBUs necessary to run the ETC
system, expressed the hope that the government will take over the
system, but promised to continue operations to ensure the rights of
users and to refund them fully.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW ALLIANCE FORMED TO PROMOTE HEALTHY CROSS-PARTY COMPETITION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu announced the
formation of a new alliance Saturday that she said will work for
clean politics and healthy competition among local political parties.</P>
      <P>Lu said she came up with the idea of forming a "blue sky, green
land, good Taiwan" alliance after the June 27 failure of an
opposition-initiated motion to recall President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>"The recall move caused turmoil in society and a constitutional
crisis. After fierce inter-party confrontation, a common value has
emerged in society. That is, political integrity and good governance.
From now on, the ruling and opposition parties should enter a new
stage of competition, with ethics, competence, rationality and
accountability as common values," Lu said.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is still in transition from authoritarian rule to
mature democracy, Lu said, occasional disturbances and chaos are
inevitable. "We need not feel despair over scandals and should
instead try to turn a crisis into an opportunity."</P>
      <P>With the support of several private social groups, the "good
Taiwan alliance" has been formed to work toward political stability,
social harmony and economic prosperity, Lu said.</P>
      <P>"We'll pool wisdom and resources to push for our country's
healthy development," Lu added.</P>
      <P>Touching on an ongoing anti-graft campaign, Lu said, the
undertaking should go all out and inclusive instead of being directed
only at specific targets.</P>
      <P>In this transitional period, Lu said, Taiwan must generate
effective transitional justice mechanisms to address past abuses and
reform society, including establishing clean politics.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's young democracy has yet to mature. We need to devote
more energy to developing viable and workable mechanisms to uphold
the rule of law," Lu said.</P>
      <P>As far as the anti-corruption campaign is concerned, Lu said, it
should be an across-the-board undertaking instead of being confined
to certain specific targets.</P>
      <P>She was referring to the spate of corruption allegations against
the first family that has gripped the nation for past several months.</P>
      <P>In her view, Lu said, the so-called "first family scandal" should
be treated according to the same standards as those applied to other
people. "We should follow due process in dealing with all corruption
cases, " she added.</P>
      <P>According to the Corruption Perception Index compiled by the
Transparency International, Taiwan ranked 28th among the 90 countries
studied in 2000 and the rating dropped to 30th in 2003. Amid the
recent overblown corruption allegations, Lu said she is worried that
Taiwan's rating would plunge further this year.</P>
      <P>Quoting the results of a public opinion poll, Lu said 38 percent
of people interviewed said none of Taiwan's major political parties
is clean.</P>
      <P>Six years after the launch of a campaign against political
corruption, Lu said law enforcement authorities have handled 3,241
corrupt cases, with 7,959 suspects indicted and 2,879 of them
convicted.</P>
      <P>Lu said the new alliance will address issues such as eliminating
corruption, improving law and order, re-establishing ethical
standards, life-long education and educational reform, the
enhancement of industrial development, Taiwan's investment
environment and globalization of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the nation's two major political camps -- the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" and the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party-led "pan-green camp" must reconcile for the sake of political
stability, Lu said the alliance has worked several key proposals to
that goal.</P>
      <P>While major political parties should seek to establish a
mechanism for rational consultation and healthy competition, Lu said,
the ruling party should reform itself to form a clean and efficient
administration.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lu said the Legislative Yuan should approve the
nominations for the Control Yuan and state public prosecutor-general
and pass a series of sunshine laws as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Moreover, she added, the judicial authorities should maintain
their independence and impartiality and uphold justice. Lu also urged
the mass media to fulfill its social responsibility and be truthful
in news reporting.</P>

(GDP) next year and to 3 percent of GDP in 2008, compared to this
year's 2.45 percent, a Ministry of National Defense (MND) official
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The whole of the extra budget will be used for military arsenal
procurement instead of financing personnel costs, said Lin
Chin-ching, director of the MND's strategic planning department.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks at an international seminar being held in
Taipei on the Asia-Pacific security environment after the enactment
of China's Anti-Secession Law.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, Taiwan's annual defense budget is about US$8
billion, half of which is appropriated for personnel costs. The
remaining US$4 billion is used for maintenance of weapons and R&amp;D
projects.</P>
      <P>After the defense budget ratio is increased next year, Lin said
the extra budget will all be used to finance arsenal procurement and
rennovation as well as development of new defense technology.</P>
      <P>Stressing that none of the extra budget will be spent on
personnel salary, Lin said the MND will continue its troops-reduction
project in line with its goal of establishing an elite deterrent
force in the face of China's military threat.</P>
      <P>Lin said the military will complete the integration of command,
control, communications and information system by the end of this
year to upgrade its early warning combat capabilities.</P>
      <P>Noting that China's announced defense budget reaches US$30
billion annually, Lin said the actual amount of China's annual
military spending is at least three times the announced amount. Given
the face that China doesn't have any real enemy in teh Asia-Pacific
region, Lin said it is baffling that China spends such a huge sum of
money on military buildup.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang has canceled his plan
to visit Chad as the government has decided to cut off diplomatic
ties with the Central African country, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) announced early Sunday.</P>
      <P>Su was originally scheduled to depart Taipei late Sunday for Chad
to attend Chadian President Idriss Deby's inauguration Aug. 8 for a
new term.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Michel Lu told a news conference around Saturday
midnight that the government decided to terminate diplomatic ties
with Chad and immediately cease all of the aid projects to the
country after learning that Chad is ready to switch its diplomatic
recognition to Beijing.</P>
      <P>"To safeguard national dignity, sovereignty and popular
well-being, the government of the Republic of China decided to cut
off diplomatic ties with Chad and immediately suspended all of the
aid projects to the country, " the foreign ministry said in a
statement issued at midnight.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of this year, Lu said, the ROC government has
kept vigilant that China's support for Chadian rebels might left
Taiwan-Chad relations in tatters.</P>
      <P>Over the past half year, Lu said the government has pulled out
all the stops to consolidate ties with Chad. But all those efforts
turned out to be futile and bootless. Chad was forced to give up its
ties with Taiwan in exchange for China's aid in resolving its
domestic rebellion and disputes with neighboring Sudan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CPC TO CONTINUE OIL EXPLORATION PROJECTS IN CHAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp.
(CPC) said Sunday it will continue its oil exploration projects in
Chad even though the two countries have severed diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>CPC President Chen Pao-lang said oil exploration is a commercial
activity that has nothing to do with politics. Noting that oil
producing countries tend to welcome foreign investment in oil
prospecting in their territories regardless of political or
diplomatic ties, Chen said CPC has a long history of joining oil
exploration investment projects in countries that do not maintain
diplomatic ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chad is one of the major oil producing countries in Africa and a
newly emerging oil exploration areas amid the current upward spiral
in international crude oil prices.</P>
      <P>CPC began to seek oil exploration deals in Chad in 2003. Taiwan
and Chad signed an initial agreement on cooperation in oil
exploration in 2004. In January this year, CPC signed formal oil
fields and joint operations contracts with Chad to secure its rights
to prospecting for crude oil in the Central African inland country.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, CPC has obtained rights to explore oil in
three Chadian oil fields and has sent a working mission to conduct
geological surveys there.</P>
      <P>Even after Taiwan cut off diplomatic ties with Chad, Chen said
CPC will continue carrying out its oil prospecting projects in that
country to protect its legitimate rights.</P>
      <P>Taiwan announced its decision to break off diplomatic relations
with Chad at Saturday midnight after its received information that
the African state is ready to switch diplomatic recognition from
Taipei to Beijing.</P>
      <P>China has intensified a diplomatic and trade offensive in Africa
to increase its influence there and squeeze Taiwan's diplomatic
frontiers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS REGRET RUPTURE OF TAIWAN-CHADIAN TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers from across the political spectrum
expressed regret Sunday over the rupture of diplomatic relations
between Taiwan and Chad, but they didn't see eye to eye on reasons
behind the diplomatic setback.</P>
      <P>While legislators from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) castigated China for forcing Chad to switch diplomatic
allegiance in its favor, their opposition colleagues said the DPP
administration is to blame for the embarrassing fiasco.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Hsiao Bi-khim said it's no news that China
pressures or lures Taiwan's diplomatic allies into its fold. The most
vicious was that China chose a special timing to deal a severe blow
to Premier Su Tseng-chang, a popular bigwig in the DPP
administration.</P>
      <P>Upon learning that Chad was ready to resume diplomatic ties with
China, Taiwan announced its decision to sever diplomatic ties with
Chad on the eve of Su's scheduled departure for the Chadian capital
of N'Djamena late Sunday to attend Chadian President Deby's
inauguration for a new term.</P>
      <P>"The timing gave me feeling of deja vu, " Hsiao said, adding that
the Pacific island nation of Nauru announced its decision to switch
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing July 22, 2002 -- the
day when President Chen Shui-bian concurrently took up the post of
DPP chairmanship.</P>
      <P>China obviously intended to embarrass Su by choosing this
special timing to force Chad to cut ties with Taiwan, Hsiao claimed.</P>
      <P>However, Legislator Tsai Chin-lung of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) said the DPP's incapacity to govern efficiently is
the root cause of the slew of diplomatic debacles.</P>
      <P>"The DPP has typically failed to pick the best persons to fill
key government posts," Tsai contended, adding that the DPP tends
to be arrogant with power while lacking in the capability to rev up
the economy or expand diplomatic frontiers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT deputy spokesman Huang Yu-chen said it's
"unimaginable" that the government announced termination of
diplomatic ties with a country where the premier was originally
scheduled to visit the following day.</P>
      <P>Huang said the DPP administration should review whether
diplomatic staff were guilty of malfeasance, incompetence or gross
negligence.</P>
      <P>Wu Kun-yu, deputy director of the opposition People First Party's
publicity department, echoed Huang's view, saying the government
should conduct a thorough review to determine which units or
individual staff members should be held responsible for the latest
diplomatic setback. </P>
      <P>"The event came so abruptly, indicating that our diplomatic and
national security systems have not functioned effectively. They have
obviously failed to grasp the situation well, " Wu argued, adding
that the government should make amends swiftly enough in order to
cement ties with all of the country's remaining diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>In recent decades Taiwan has been fighting an offensive by
Beijing -- often involving enormous infusions of developmental aid --
to squeeze its number of diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>Beijing is now focusing its pressure on Africa, using its
economic clout to offer lucrative aid, trade and investment deals in
exchange for oil, raw materials and diplomatic allegiance.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been one of Chad's major foreign allies, helping to
develop its infrastructure and offering to assist it in expanding its
oil industry. Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang met with
Chadian leaders in N'Djamena last month to try to shore up bilateral
relations, but to no avail.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW ALLIANCE FORMED TO PROMOTE HEALTHY CROSS-PARTY COMPETITION(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu announced the
formation of a new alliance Saturday that she said will work for
clean politics and healthy competition among local political parties.</P>
      <P>Lu said she came up with the idea of forming a "blue sky, green
land, good Taiwan" alliance after the June 27 failure of an
opposition-initiated motion to recall President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>"The recall move caused turmoil in society and a constitutional
crisis. After fierce inter-party confrontation, a common value has
emerged in society. That is, political integrity and good governance.
From now on, the ruling and opposition parties should enter a new
stage of competition, with ethics, competence, rationality and
accountability as common values," Lu said.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is still in transition from authoritarian rule to
mature democracy, Lu said, occasional disturbances and chaos are
inevitable. "We need not feel despair over scandals and should
instead try to turn a crisis into an opportunity."</P>
      <P>With the support of several private social groups, the "good
Taiwan alliance" has been formed to work toward political stability,
social harmony and economic prosperity, Lu said.</P>
      <P>"We'll pool wisdom and resources to push for our country's
healthy development," Lu added.</P>
      <P>Touching on an ongoing anti-graft campaign, Lu said, the
undertaking should go all out and inclusive instead of being directed
only at specific targets.</P>
      <P>In this transitional period, Lu said, Taiwan must generate
effective transitional justice mechanisms to address past abuses and
reform society, including establishing clean politics.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's young democracy has yet to mature. We need to devote
more energy to developing viable and workable mechanisms to uphold
the rule of law," Lu said.</P>
      <P>As far as the anti-corruption campaign is concerned, Lu said, it
should be an across-the-board undertaking instead of being confined
to certain specific targets.</P>
      <P>She was referring to the spate of corruption allegations against
the first family that has gripped the nation for past several months.</P>
      <P>In her view, Lu said, the so-called "first family scandal" should
be treated according to the same standards as those applied to other
people. "We should follow due process in dealing with all corruption
cases, " she added.</P>
      <P>According to the Corruption Perception Index compiled by the
Transparency International, Taiwan ranked 28th among the 90 countries
studied in 2000 and the rating dropped to 30th in 2003. Amid the
recent overblown corruption allegations, Lu said she is worried that
Taiwan's rating would plunge further this year.</P>
      <P>Quoting the results of a public opinion poll, Lu said 38 percent
of people interviewed said none of Taiwan's major political parties
is clean.</P>
      <P>Six years after the launch of a campaign against political
corruption, Lu said law enforcement authorities have handled 3,241
corrupt cases, with 7,959 suspects indicted and 2,879 of them
convicted.</P>
      <P>Lu said the new alliance will address issues such as eliminating
corruption, improving law and order, re-establishing ethical
standards, life-long education and educational reform, the
enhancement of industrial development, Taiwan's investment
environment and globalization of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the nation's two major political camps -- the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" and the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party-led "pan-green camp" must reconcile for the sake of political
stability, Lu said the alliance has worked several key proposals to
that goal.</P>
      <P>While major political parties should seek to establish a
mechanism for rational consultation and healthy competition, Lu said,
the ruling party should reform itself to form a clean and efficient
administration.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lu said the Legislative Yuan should approve the
nominations for the Control Yuan and state public prosecutor-general
and pass a series of sunshine laws as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Moreover, she added, the judicial authorities should maintain
their independence and impartiality and uphold justice. Lu also urged
the mass media to fulfill its social responsibility and be truthful
in news reporting.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Tan Sun Chen, secretary-general to President
Chen Shui-bian, said Sunday the Presidential Office has provided an
"initial explanation" in response to an opposition legislator's
allegation the president has a "secret bank account" at Taishin
International Bank that may have been used to launder slush funds.</P>
      <P>Director Lee Nan-yang of the office's department of public
affairs said Saturday that what Kuomintang (KMT) legislator Chiu Yi
claimed to be a "secret" account is actually an open account set up
during the 2004 presidential elections, and that Chiu has made the
"groundless" allegation as a way to smear the president.</P>
      <P>Tan Sun Chen said if there is need for further understanding of
the issue, the Presidential Office will provide a public explanation.</P>
      <P>Chiu said if the secret account were, as Lee had said, "used to
handle political contributions, " why had Chen's son Chen Chih-chung
and daughter Chen Hsing-yu deposited money into it?</P>
      <P>He claimed there were four records of the president's son and
daughter depositing money into the "secret account" at the bank's
Nanmen (South Gate) branch, including a "critical" deposit of NT$2
million made by Chen Hsing-yu on Feb. 6, 2004.</P>
      <P>He claimed "a great number of large-sum contributions" had been
deposited into that account. If these political donations were not so
shady that they must remain in the dark, "then President Chen should
tell people who had donated how much to him," Chiu added.</P>
      <P>He said he suspected these big donations were made as tradeoffs
in some unspeakable dealings that could serve as "key evidence" of
the president's suspected involvement in corruption.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN MINISTRY MUM ON NEW U.N. BID UNDER NAME OF 'TAIWAN'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman
kept mum Sunday on whether the Republic of China government would
adopt a new strategy this year to gain United Nations membership by
applying under the name "Taiwan" instead of the "ROC, " "Chinese
Taipei" or other titles.</P>
      <P>Michel Lu declined to comment on a cable television news report
Sunday that Taiwan will embark on a new U.N. bid under the name of
"Taiwan" and will submit the bid via Taiwanese authorities rather
than through representatives of Taiwan's diplomatic allies, as was the
case over the last 13 years.</P>
      <P>Lu only said that Minister of Foreign Affairs Huang Chih-fang
will tell the country next week how the foreign ministry is striving
to renew the U.N. bid by allowing the 23 million people of Taiwan to
be represented.</P>
      <P>John Chen, director-general of the foreign ministry's Department
of International Organizations, said several days ago that Taiwan
will basically follow the same strategies as last year. In its
failed 2005 bid, Taiwan called for the U.N. to help maintain peace in
the Taiwan Strait and for the international body to pay
attention to the representation of Taiwan's 23 million people at
the United Nations.</P>
      <P>This year, Chen said, Taiwan will call for the U.N. to play a
more active role in maintaining peace in the Asia-Pacific region and
again stress the imperative nature of Taiwan's representation in the
world body.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said July 15 that Taiwan deserves a seat
in the United Nations because it is a basic human right for
Taiwanese people to be able to join international organizations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been shut out of the United Nations since 1971, when
U.N. Resolution No. 2758 gave the China seat to Beijing at Taiwan's
expense.</P>
      <P>While Resolution No. 2758 resolved the issue regarding China's
U.N. representation, President Chen said it did not address the
representation of Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>"In terms of the principle of membership universality prescribed
in the U.N. charter, Taiwan deserves a U.N. seat, " the president
said, adding that Taiwan's bid for U.N. accession is part of its
efforts to maintain its population's basic human rights.</P>
      <P>"Our rights to participate in the United Nations and fulfill our
international duties should not be kept from us or denigrated," he
said.</P>
      <P>"We plan to expand our perspective by calling for U.N. attention
to the Asia-Pacific regional peace, which implies the need to
maintain cross-strait stability," the president added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU UNAWARE OF LEE'S CONDITIONS TO BACK VICE PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In response to a local media report that
former President Lee Teng-hui conditionally backs Vice President
Annette Lu as President Chen Shui-bian's successor, an official of
the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) said Sunday that they
had never heard of such a notion.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-ming, the TSU's secretary-general and a lawmaker, denied
Sunday's report in the China Times that Lee, the TSU's spiritual
leader, has laid out three conditions for Lu in the event the vice
president takes over the presidency from Chen, who has been dogged by
a spate of corruption allegations.</P>
      <P>According to the China Times report, Lee asked Lu to honor the
following conditions -- -- pardon Chen, not to run in the 2008
presidential election and to nominate Legislative Yuan speaker Wang
Jin-pyng as premier. Lee pledged that he would help oust Chen, should
Lu be willing to live up to these three promises, the report said.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the TSU has never heard of the three conditions
that Lee laid out for Lu in exchange for his assistance in Lu's
succession, Lo stressed that it is impossible that Lee, a figure
devoted to Taiwan's democratization, would get involved in such a
matter.</P>
      <P>According to Lo, however, the former president said he suggested
that Lu first seek the trust and understanding of the United States
to assuage the outside world's fear of her radical pro-Taiwan
independence stance.</P>
      <P>Lee's comments came at time when opposition parties -- such as
the "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First
Party -- are mulling the possibili ty of booting out Chen if there is
solid evidence to prove his role in several high-profile scandal
allegations.</P>
      <P>Main opposition KMT lawmaker Chiu Yi unveiled Chen's "secret"
account of nearly NT$170 million at a local bank Saturday -- the
newest corruption allegation related to Chen following questionable
reimbursements of state affairs funds claimed by the Presidential
Office on Chen's behalf -- which was also brought to light by Chiu in
late June.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA USED REBELS TO FORCE CHAD TO CUT TIES WITH TAIWAN: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  6 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China has long supported Chad's rebel
forces, which it has just used to force the Chadian government to cut
off diplomatic ties with the Republic of China, a senior official
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Three factors have contributed toward Chad's decision to sever
official ties with Taiwan, according to an analysis of the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).</P>
      <P>First, through Sudan, China has been supporting insurgent forces
opposing the Chadian government. If the Chadian government wants to
make peace with both China and the insurgents, it must work with
China, which demanded it cut ties to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The second factor is that Chad became an oil-exporting country in
2003, and China increased its purchase of Chadian crude in the first
half of this year by 50 percent over the same time last year.</P>
      <P>A third factor is that China has used huge sums of money to "buy
off" Chad in the form of aid programs and other measures, according
to the senior official who asked not to be identified.</P>
      <P>He noted that in a letter to President Chen Shui-bian, the
Chadian president said he was forced to make the decision "for the
sake of my country's survival."</P>
      <P>The Chadian leader also expressed hope his country would remain
"a friend of Taiwan" so that unofficial exchanges can continue in the
absence of formal diplomatic ties, according to the official.</P>
      <P>He added that Chinese Petroleum Corp.'s (CPC) oil exploitation
pact with Chad would continue because it was a commercial contract.
If Chad reneges on it, "the state-run enterprise could file a lawsuit
against the Chadian government," he added.</P>
      <P>MOFA announced a severance of official ties with Chad early
Sunday, bringing down the number of countries that keep official
relations with Taiwan to 24.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC HEAD LAMBASTES BEIJING OVER SEVERANCE OF TAIWAN-CHAD TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top official in charge of China
policy severely criticized Beijing Sunday over the rupture of
diplomatic relations between Taiwan and Chad.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said Beijing is
to blame for the severance of Taiwan-Chad formal ties -- which
occurred in Sunday's wee hours -- and that Beijing should bear all
responsibility for any adverse impacts on developments in
cross-Taiwan Strait relations as a result of Chad's diplomatic
about-face.</P>
      <P>Chad's switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing
occurred only hours prior to Premier Su Tseng-chang's scheduled
departure for Chad on an official visit, and was Beijing's conspiracy
to humiliate Taiwan's government and its people, Wu asserted.</P>
      <P>Wu said Beijing has always adopted a two-pronged strategy toward
Taiwan -- currying favor with Taiwanese people through a series of
overtures on one hand, while on the other relentlessly trying to
contain Taiwan in the international community.</P>
      <P>It's bitterly ironic that while suffocating Taiwan diplomatically
in the international community, Beijing has continued to make
overtures to Taiwan's people, including offering pandas as gifts,
helping Taiwan's farmers export their products to China, allowing
cross-strait exchanges between the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and
the Communist Party of China (CPC), as well as agreeing on a proposed
visit to Taiwan by Chen Yunlin, head of the CPC's Central Office for
Taiwan Affairs, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu called on all of Taiwan's sectors to no longer harbor
illusions about China and to instead begin discerning Beijing's "true
colors."</P>
      <P>He said all of Taiwan people should condemn China with the
strongest words possible over China's bullying of Taiwan and that
opposition parties should put aside political differences with the
Democratic Progressive Party administration to jointly defend
Taiwan's dignity and its interests on the diplomatic front.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MAC officials said the administration may consider
allowing Chen Yunlin, China's chief of Taiwan affairs, to visit
Taiwan later this year if he comes to Taiwan to apologize to Taiwan's
people for the country's latest diplomatic setback.</P>
      <P>"There's no chance of Chen coming if he does not offer an
apology," MAC officials said.</P>
      <P>MAC officials said that it marked the second time in three months
that Premier Su's scheduled overseas state visit was brought to a
halt, all because of Beijing's interference. Su planned to visit
Haiti in May but the trip was canceled as a result of Beijing's
intervention.</P>
      <P>Responding to MAC officials' remarks that Chen would not be
welcome if he does not apologize, Chang Jung-kung, deputy director of
the KMT's Policy Coordination Committee, said rejecting Chen's visit
is not conducive to broadening Taiwan's diplomatic horizons.</P>
      <P>Instead, Chang said, if Chen is allowed to visit Taiwan, it will
demonstrate Taiwan's magnanimity, which will in turn win the
international community's hearts and minds and consequently help
Taiwan break through Beijing's diplomatic suppression.
</P>
      <P>According to Chang, Chen has planned to file an application with
the MAC in mid-August to visit Taiwan in mid-October for a
KMT-sponsored agricultural forum.</P>
      <P>The KMT invited Chen to visit Taipei last October for an economic
forum, but his application was rejected by the MAC on the grounds
that it required official negotiations between Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Consequently, the KMT organized a mission under the leadership of
KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chen that traveled to Shanghai last
October to take part in a KMT-CPC economic forum -- the first of its
kind in nearly six decades.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OIL EXPLOITATION IN CHAD NOT TO BE AFFECTED: CPC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The suspension of diplomatic ties between
Taiwan and Chad is not expected to affect Taiwan's oil exploitation
in that central African country, state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp.
(CPC) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to a CPC spokesman, the oil exploitation contract
signed between Taiwan and Chad are purely a business arrangement that
should not be hindered by changes in diplomatic relations between the
two countries.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the CPC will continue closely watching follow-up
developments on the issue, although relevant work has proceeded in
line with the contract inked by the two countries, he said.</P>
      <P>Through the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) , the
CPC signed the contract in January this year with Chad to exclusively
explore and jointly manage three oil fields in Chad during a
four-year period. The combined size of the three fields totals some
26,000 square meters.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the contract, the CPC has set up an office in
Chad and is slated to funnel US$30 million into the oil project, the
spokesman pointed out, adding that the CPC has paid US$17 million to
sign the contract with Chad.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
called for engagement with China Sunday in order to allow a
breakthrough in Taiwan's current diplomatic dilemma, as Beijing has
increasingly contained Taiwan in the international community.</P>
      <P>Responding to Taiwan's severing of formal diplomatic ties earlier
Sunday with its African ally, Chad, Ma said in the eastern city of
Yilan -- where he was attending an international children's folklore
and folkgame festival -- that China has been Taiwan's greatest
nightmare on the diplomatic front.</P>
      <P>Ma said Taiwan faces tremendous pressures due to China's
rapid, continued rise in strategic and economic clout in the
international community, adding that the only way to break through
the current diplomatic impasse is to improve cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Ma called for the Democratic Progressive Party administration to
resume a pragmatic approach in diplomacy, saying that a zero-sum
approach, hatred or revenge "will get Taiwan nowhere."</P>
      <P>Apparently under Beijing's influence, Chad announced late
Saturday night that it had severed diplomatic relations with the
Republic of China, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediatedly
responded by declaring a rupture in formal ties with Chad.</P>
      <P>Chad's diplomatic about-face came only hours prior to Premier Su
Tseng-chang's scheduled departure for Chad on an official visit aimed
at bolstering bilateral ties with the African country.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the latest diplomatic setback, Ma said it was an
indication that the intelligence-gathering methods of relevant
agencies need to be improved.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The World Trade Organization's (WTO) Doha
Round negotiations, which collapsed in July, will not be suspended
indefinitely but may take at least five or six months to reopen, a
senior economic official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen Ruei-long, who has been appointed economic affairs minister,
said the Doha Round setback deals a big blow to multilateral trade
mechanism and Taiwan, which relies heavily on the export market for
its economic development.</P>
      <P>Chen has been involved in Taiwan's foreign trade negotiations. He
said the GATT, the predecessor of the WTO, had contributed a great
deal to global trade, from which Taiwan has also benefited.</P>
      <P>If multilateralism suffers as a result of the Doha Round setback,
it will affect the driving force of the trade and economic
liberalization agenda -- a result that will not only hurt
export-oriented Taiwan but other developing countries as well, he
added.</P>
      <P>Because of the severe consequences, Chen said he believes the
talks will not be delayed indefinitely, though his most upbeat
forecast is five to six months before talks will be reopened.</P>
      <P>Even if talks resume, said Huang Chih-peng, director of the
Bureau of Foreign Trade, it would be difficult to predict how much
can be achieved from the Doha Round of negotiations, which were
supposed to reach an agreement on the solution to the "triangular
issue" -- lowering tariffs on farm products, cutting farm subsidies
and decreasing tariffs on agricultural and fishery products.</P>

      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister Huang Chih-fang
expressed apologies to the people of Taiwan Sunday after the country
severed its official ties with the central African country of Chad.</P>
      <P>He told a press conference that his staff had launched a
mechanism to save the official ties but yet still failed to retain
diplomatic ties, for which he said he had already offered his
apologies to President Chen Shui-bian and Premier Su Tseng-chang.</P>
      <P>He denied some media reports the president had tried to rescue
the ties by visiting Chad, noting that a presidential visit could not
have been arranged in two or three days.</P>
      <P>The president did try to speak to Chadian President Idriss Deby
by telephone when bilateral ties went into high alert, Huang said,
adding that the effort produced no results.</P>
      <P>Huang disclosed that Chen last spoke with Deby July 27, when Deby
had warmly welcomed a scheduled visit by Premier Su Tseng-chang to
congratulate him over his inauguration. Su canceled his visit Sunday,
on the day he was to leave.</P>
      <P>Huang accused China of willfully humiliating not just Premier Su

right before Taiwan's premier was to depart on a "congratulatory"
visit to Chad.</P>

suppression, there will be resistance, Huang said, claiming that
China's suppression of Taiwan can prevail only for a time -- but
never succeed forever.</P>
      <P>"China will not be able to suppress the Taiwanese people's strong
will to fight for freedom and democracy and to maintain their

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) lawmakers Sunday proposed banning a planned visit by a
senior Beijing official to Taiwan, citing Chad's severing of
diplomatic ties with Taiwan as clear proof of Beijing's scheme to
squeeze Taiwan out of the international arena.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers Trong Tsai, Chuang He-tsu and Hsueh Ling said in a
statement that they will jointly put forward a proposal in the
Legislative Yuan demanding the government temporarily cease all
opening measures in cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges after Chad
announced the severance of diplomatic links with Taiwan early Sunday
morning.</P>
      <P>According to the DPP lawmakers, the matter was a result of
Beijing's relentless attempts to block Taiwan internationally.
Beijing's plot has provoked fresh resentment among Taiwanese people
against China, they claimed.</P>
      <P>Tsai said in the statement that the government must not approve
the application of Chen Yunlin -- the head of the Communist Party of
China's Central Office for Taiwan Affairs -- to visit unless Beijing
shows goodwill and respect for Taiwan and treats it as an independent
sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China must conduct exchanges on an equal footing, and
senior Chinese officials' plans to visit must be approved by Taiwan's
government through official channels, Tsai said in the statement,
adding that opposition parties are not entitled to arrange visits for
Beijing officials to Taiwan as a means of helping Beijing evade
government-to-government negotiations over their visits.</P>
      <P>China has increasingly intensified its "carrot-and-stick"
strategy toward Taiwan, using every cultural, economic, agricultural,
diplomatic and military means to suppress Taiwan, Tsai said, urging
Taiwan's people to be wary of Beijing's ambitions to swallow up
Taiwan, as evidenced in Beijing's enactment of an Anti-Secession Law
in March last year.</P>
      <P>According to the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), Chen is slated
to file an application with the Mainland Affair Council in mid-August
to visit Taiwan in mid-October, where he will take part in a

      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui, also former
chairman of Kuomintang (KMT) , offered financial assistance to the
financially strapped opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in
the 1990's, according to a new book titled "Ten Lessons Lee Teng-hui
Teaches Young People."</P>
      <P>The book's author, Tzou Ching-wen, has interviewed Lee many times
before completing the book which was published recently.</P>
      <P>According to the senior journalist's account, When Shih Ming-teh
became DPP chairman in 1993, Lee asked the KMT's chief financier Liu
Tai-ying to approach Shih, asking if he would be interested in a
NT$150 million offer from Lee -- on no conditions at all, not even
penning a receipt for accepting the money he could use at his
discretion.</P>
      <P>In response, Shih told Liu, "You've got the wrong guy (to take
the money), " according to the book. Shih, who was DPP chairman from
1993 to 1996, confirmed the story during a recent TV interview.</P>
      <P>His predecessor and successor, Hsu Hsin-liang (DPP chairman
1991-1993 and 1996-1998) was famous for an incident in which Taiwan's
media described as "Hsu visited the enemy camp after dark" for a
secret meeting with Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>During that meeting, Hsu suggested that if the ruling KMT could
pass a law on providing financial assistance to political parties, it
would help promote party politics in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In response, says the book, Lee said he would immediately told
his staff to complete the legislation, because the KMT needed DPP
help to amend the Constitution at the National Assembly.</P>
      <P>The book further pointed out that in 1996, the DPP went into
financial trouble again as it could not pay its office rent and
worker salaries.</P>
      <P>Again, Lee asked Liu Tai-ying to meet with Hsu, telling Hsu that
the KMT could make a loan to the DPP and help it find a new place for
use as office. The DPP declined that offer.</P>

should beware of in the three stages of his life. In youth, when the
constitution of his body is not yet formed, he should beware of lust.
In manhood, when his physical powers are in full vigor, he should
beware of strife. In old age, when the physical powers are in decay,
he should beware of greed."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>RAINY WEATHER FORECAST FOR WHOLE WEEK AS STORM SYSTEMS APPROACH: CWB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three tropical storm systems have been
lurking in the western Pacific in recent days, with two of them
poised to affect Taiwan later this week, the Central Weather Bureau
(CWB) reported Monday.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Saomai, the eighth typhoon reported in the Pacific area
this year, was located about 760 km northwest of Guam, moving
northwesterly toward Taiwan at a speed of 24 kph as of 10: 30 a.m.
Monday, CWB meteorologists said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, tropical storm Bopha was located about 420 kilometers
south-southeast of Okinawa, moving in a west-northwest direction
toward Taiwan at a speed of 13 kph, the meteorologists said.</P>
      <P>The weather bureau said it may issue a sea warning Tuesday at the
earliest for tropical storm Bopha if the system maintains its current
speed and direction.</P>
      <P>The forecasters urged those operating on seas near Okinawa or off
Taiwan's east coast to be on alert for changes in weather conditions.</P>
      <P>The weather bureau said it will have a better indication on
Thursday or Friday as to whether Bopha and Saomi will effect Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It is possible that the two storm systems may combine and double
their force to produce what is known as the Fujiwara Effect, the
meteorologists said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Typhoon Maria, the seventh typhoon in the Pacific area
this year, is not expected to affect Taiwan as it was located some
640 kilometers south-southeast of Japan's Osaka and sweeping toward
Osaka at a speed of 20 kph as of 10:30 a.m. Monday, according to the
meteorologists.</P>
      <P>The weather bureau added that Taiwan is expected to experience
mostly cloudy and rainy weather through next Saturday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER DUCKS QUESTIONS ABOUT SERVING ANOTHER TERM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
ducked Monday the issue of whether he would accept opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's invitation to be a KMT
legislator-at-large and continue to lead Taiwan's legislature.</P>
      <P>Wang, formerly a KMT vice chairman whose third consecutive term
as legislative speaker will end in 2007, would not confirm news
reports that Ma had met with him July 20 to invite him to be the
first candidate in a KMT legislator-at-large lineup for the 7th
legislature, which is scheduled to be elected December 2007 and sworn
in February 2008.</P>
      <P>Wang said he has a wide variety of plans for his life after
February 2008, adding that running for another legislative seat is
only one of the options.</P>
      <P>The next legislative elections will be held in December 2007,
unless the opposition topples the Cabinet in a no-confidence vote and
President Chen Shui-bian dissolves the legislature before that time.</P>
      <P>Following the failure of a presidential recall motion June 27 at
the Legislative Yuan, the opposition People First Party (PFP) has
been actively pushing for the initiation of a no-confidence proposal,
which would require the endorsement of at least one-third of the 221
lawmakers and a "yes" vote by half of the lawmakers,</P>
      <P>The KMT, an ally of the PFP, has not been as enthusiastic as the
PFP about initiating a no-confidence motion, saying that adequate
accompanying measures should first be worked out and that related
conditions must be ripe.</P>
      <P>According to the law, should a no-confidence vote pass the
Legislative Yuan, the premier would have to either resign in 10 days
or ask the president to dissolve the Legislative Yuan, paving the way
for new legislative elections. If the no-confidence vote failed to
clear the legislature, lawmakers would not be able to initiate
another no-confidence vote against the same premier within one year
of the previous one.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT POLICY REMAINS UNCHANGED: CABINET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  7 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Cabinet official dismissed as "mere
speculation" a media report suggesting that the government will
tighten up its cross-Taiwan Strait economic and trade policy in the
wake of the severance of ROC-Chad diplomatic relations owing to
China's sabotage.</P>
      <P>Cabinet spokesman Cheng Wen-tsan said the government's
cross-strait policy is aimed at protecting the country's interests
and sovereignty and maintaining cross-strait peace and stability,
adding that these objectives remain unchanged.</P>
      <P>Cheng denied there is any disagreement between President Chen
Shui-bian and Premier Su Tseng-chang on cross-strait policy.</P>
      <P>Cheng noted that Beijing has used every possible means to
suppress Taiwan and isolate Taiwan diplomatically, which he said has
been clearly demonstrated in the cases of Chad and Haiti.</P>
      <P>Early Sunday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that Su
had canceled his plan to visit Chad and that the government had
decided to cut off diplomatic ties with Chad, after learning that the
African nation was ready to switch diplomatic recognition to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, Chen's plan to appoint Su as his special envoy
to attend the inauguration of Haitian President-elect Rene Preval was
also obstructed because China had pressured the Caribbean nation
through U.N. channels not to invite Su for the event.</P>
      <P>Cheng stressed that the Chad case is not an isolated incident but
is the result of China's diplomatic containment policy against
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As to whether the severance of diplomatic ties with Chad will
affect Taiwan's oil supply, Cheng said the state-owned China
Petroleum Corp. has been looking for suitable cooperation partners
around the world and has not targeted any single region or country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP URGES PRESIDENT TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST OPPOSITION SMEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  7 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) urged President Chen Shui-bian Monday to take legal action
against what it called a smear by an opposition lawmaker regarding
what the lawmaker claimed is a secret bank account of Chen.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Tsai Huang-liang issued the call during a news
conference at the party's headquarters.</P>
      <P>Tsai advised Chen to seek legal means to clear his name and
blasted main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker Chiu Yi's
accusation. "The president must take legal action to stop such
foulness," he said.</P>
      <P>Chiu, who has blown the whistle on several high-profile
corruption scandals allegedly related to the first family and Chen
himself, claimed Saturday that Chen has a secret account containing
NT$170 million at the Nanmen branch of the Tsaishin Bank.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the bank account was set up by Chen Jan. 5,
2004 to receive political donations from the public prior to the
March 20 presidential election that same year. The bank account was
closed April 1, 2004, with only over NT$1.7 million left, he claimed.</P>
      <P>Denying that the bank account was secret, Tsai said that it was
scrutinized by the financial committee of the DPP's election campaign
headquarters at that time.</P>
      <P>Tsai also called on Chen to make public the relevant details as
soon as possible to put an end to what he called Chiu's
"unscrupulous" accusation.</P>
      <P>In response to Chiu's accusation that Chen failed to report the
bank account to the Control Yuan, either in line with the Political
Donations Law or the Public Functionary Assets Disclosure Law, he
pointed out that the Political Donations Law was promulgated March 30</P>
      <P>2004 -- later than the account's opening, while assets reporting
required at the end of each year.</P>
      <P>Tsai blasted Chiu for nitpicking over the fact that Chen did not
have to report the bank account to the Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>As to a claim by Chiu that Chen's Formosa Foundation also owns a
secret bank account, Tsai said that the account has existed for more
than 10 years, adding that Chiu should immediately stop smearing the
president and the DPP government.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A doctor of Chinese medicine said Monday
that high blood pressure and osteoporosis patients should exercise
caution when they use massage chairs.</P>
      <P>Tien An-jan made the remarks at a news conference sponsored by
the Consumers' Foundation to warn anyone thinking of buying massage
chairs as presents on Father's Day, which falls on Tuesday this year.</P>
      <P>Tien said that massage chairs work well for those who suffer from
sprains or tense muscles, but said that for people suffering from
high blood pressure, overuse could lead to strokes, while people with
osteoporosis risked bone fractures.</P>
      <P>Tien advised users to consult their doctors before using the
chairs and suggested that massage sessions should not exceed 15-30
minutes one or twice per week.</P>
      <P>Jason Lee, chairman of the Consumers' Foundation, said a lot of
massage chair manufacturers claim that their products can detect
acupuncture points on the body, but he said their claims have not
been substantiated by medical theory or clinical tests.</P>
      <P>He also said the chairs are often based on "foreigner sizes" and

    <HEADLINE>MOFA HAS `MINIMIZED DAMAGE' FROM CUTTING OF TAIWAN-CHAD TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 7 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Huang Chih-fang
will take responsibility for the severance of diplomatic relations
between Taiwan and Chad if necessary, although he believes the
ministry has managed to minimize the damage from the incident, a
ministry official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) had announced a day
earlier that Premier Su Tseng-chang had canceled a plan to visit Chad
and that the government had decided to cut off diplomatic ties with
Chad, after learning that the African nation was ready to switch
diplomatic recognition to Beijing.</P>
      <P>According to MOFA spokesman Michel Lu, Chad intended to inform
Taiwan of its decision in a letter dated Aug. 6 -- the same day that
Su was scheduled to depart for Chad to attend the second inauguration
of Chadian President Idriss Deby.</P>
      <P>"We have sufficient reason to believe that China was out to
embarrass Taiwan. Our announcement to sever diplomatic ties with Chad
early Aug. 6 has thwarted China's plan," Lu said.</P>
      <P>Lu said there were several reasons leading to the severance of
diplomatic relations between Taiwan and Chad.</P>
      <P>While China has put a lot pressure on the Chadian government by
providing support to rebel forces in Chad, it has also on the other
hand been trying to tempt Chad with offers to procure oil from the
African nation, which was dissatisfied with the financial aid
provided by Taiwan, Lu said.</P>
      <P>However, Lu said the ministry will need to conduct further
investigations to find out how much financial aid China has offered
Chad.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that it was impossible for Taiwan to satisfy every
request made by Chad, Lu said Su had originally planned to discuss

    <HEADLINE>MOST TAIWAN FATHERS DO NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES GOOD FATHERS: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Whether they are self-effacing or simply
lack self-confidence, most of Taiwan's fathers do not consider
themselves "good fathers, " according to the results of a recent
public opinion poll released Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan fathers aged between 16 and 45 gave themselves scores
averaging only 65.49 points (using 100 points as "perfect") in terms
of determining what makes a "good father, " with fathers in the 36-45
age group being the lowest scorers, with an only passable average of
63.59 points, according to the poll conducted by the online 1111 Job
Bank.</P>
      <P>The figure could also reflect that fathers in the 36-45 age group
have the highest ability to conduct self-examination among fathers of
all three age groups, the pollsters said.</P>
      <P>Fathers aged between 26 and 35 gave themselves an average score
of 67.06 points, while young fathers aged between 16 and 25 gave
themselves an average score of 71.79 points, according to the poll
conducted to mark Father's Day, which falls on Aug. 8.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to an estimate compiled by the Ministry of
the Interior, educating a child from birth to graduation from
graduate school costs between NT$4.5 million and NT$6.4 million in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The poll found that 75 percent of the fathers who responded to
the poll said their incomes were always behind the household costs,
including education costs, and 55 percent of the respondents blamed
inflation as the major culprit causing their financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that most of the fathers do not regret having
children, but some 44 percent said they would choose to have smaller
families if they were allowed to do it again.</P>
      <P>The respondents named Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, Kuo Tai-ming, a
high-technology industrial tycoon, and actor-turned-Taipei City
Councilor Ouyang Lung as the top three "model" fathers.</P>
      <P>The 1111 Job bank received 510 valid responses to the poll, which
was conducted via Internet between July 19 and Aug. 4.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC FULLY ASSESSING BEIJING OFFICIAL'S VISIT: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  7 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) will
carefully assess the question of whether to allow a senior Beijing
official to visit Taiwan, taking into account the political
situations both at home and abroad, Executive Yuan spokesman Cheng
Wen-tsan said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, the MAC will thoroughly assess the
possibility of Chen's visit to Taiwan at a time when Taiwan has just
suffered a diplomatic setback due to its severing of diplomatic ties
with Chad shortly before the Central African state set up diplomatic
relations with Beijing.</P>
      <P>China's continuous attempts to suppress Taiwan in the
international community will seriously affect the nation's
development, and the Taiwan people should loudly denounce China's
hostility, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>According to the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), Chen is slated
to file an application with the MAC in mid-August seeking permission
to take part in a KMT-sponsored agricultural seminar planned for
mid-October in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The purpose of Chen's visit is to find ways to step up bilateral
agricultural exchanges and help Taiwan farmers improve their
livelihoods, KMT legislative caucus whip Tsai Chin-lung claimed at a
news conference.</P>
      <P>The government's attempts to politicize Chen's visit is a
reflection of its ignorance of the importance of cross-Taiwan Strait
trade and economic interactions, according to Tsai.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Hsu Shao-ping contended that "banning Chen from
coming to Taiwan will not help Taiwan explore new diplomatic
horizons, but rather will intensify the political wrangling between
the two sides."</P>
      <P>"Sure, we have to denounce China's ambitions against Taiwan, but
it is inappropriate to slam the door on Chen," Hsu claimed.</P>
      <P>David Huang, a legislative caucus whip of the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) , said TSU lawmakers will join an endorsement
campaign initiated by ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
lawmakers demanding that the government ban Chen from visiting.</P>
      <P>"Chen is planning to engage in united front activities here and
to provoke confrontation in Taiwan, in cooperation with the KMT and
the People First Party," Huang speculated.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Trong Chai said a day earlier that he and other DPP
lawmakers will put forward a proposal at the Legislative Yuan
demanding that the government ban Chen's visit and temporarily cease
all opening measures in cross-strait activities after Chad's decision
to recognize China.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) Kuo Yao-chi tendered her resignation to Premier
Su Tseng-chang Monday to assume responsibility for a controversy
surrounding a freeway electronic toll collection (ETC) system.</P>
      <P>Noting that it is a matter of course for a political appointee to
take responsibility for a major policy flop, Kuo said she will begin
a leave of absence Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Kuo's resignation came after the Supreme Administrative Court
ruled last Thursday that the "priority bidder" status of the Far
Eastern Electronic Toll Corp. (FETC), which has been running the ETC
system on the nation's freeways since February, should be revoked
because it was a flawed screening process that enabled the FETC to
obtain priority status over two other bidders.</P>
      <P>The ruling put the ETC bidding back to square one, despite the
fact that around 220,000 on-board units (OBUs) have been installed in
cars using the FETC system since February.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang and the People First Party had demanded
that Kuo step down to take administrative responsibility for the
mess.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Su said Saturday that although Kuo is in charge of
dealing with the shambles surrounding the ETC controversy, she should
not be held responsible for the chaos as the controversy began long
before Kuo took the MOTC post early this year.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian should use the
NT$1.4 billion formerly spent on aid to Chad plus the NT$170 million
in his so-called "questionable" Taishin International Bank account
for a free-lunch program for more than 3 million school children, the
opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) legislative caucus said Monday.</P>
      <P>Hou Tsai-feng, deputy secretary-general of the caucus, said the
aid to Chad could feed 2.7 million school children and claimed that
the president's "secret" bank account had unreported political
donations enough to pay for lunches for 327,000 school children.</P>
      <P>"We urge the president to use those funds to save the people of
Taiwan who are living without hope, " she said.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chin-lung, the caucus secretary- general, accused Foreign
Affairs Minister Huang Chih-fang of having done a poor job with
regard to official ties with Chad.</P>
      <P>"The minister visited Chad just last month, unaware that it was
ready to recognize Beijing diplomatically. He even handed over a big
stash of cash to Chad's president and arranged for Premier Su
Tseng-chang to visit for the president's inauguration, "
according to Tsai.</P>
      <P>Now that Taiwan has severed ties with Chad, Huang can only shift
all of the responsibility to China, Tsai said, claiming that the

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two opposition parties denied Monday that
they will collaborate in proposing a no-confidence vote to topple the
Cabinet, while the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said
that if the opposition makes the proposal, the DPP will demand that
the president dissolve the legislature.</P>
      <P>The People First Party (PFP) and the Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) dismissed the reports by the mass-circulation China Times that
claimed they would propose the no-confidence vote when the new
legislative session opens next month.</P>
      <P>The reports also said that if the Cabinet is toppled, President
Chen Shui-bian will not dissolve the legislature out of concerns for
political stability. The election of the next legislature will have
to follow the new electoral "single-member constituency, two votes"
system, and the number of legislative seats will be cut in half to
113.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsien-yao, director of PFP's department in charge of policy
research, said the party's focus is to push for an impeachment of the
president.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, Chen must take political responsibility for
what the opposition claims is his "illicit use" of a state affairs
fund for his discretionary use.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that the PFP advocated a no-confidence vote on the
Cabinet one-and-a-half months ago, believing that Premier Su
Tseng-chang has endorsed a corrupt president and that his
administration should no longer enjoy legitimacy, but Chang noted
that the PFP's focus now is impeachment of the president.</P>
      <P>He said the PFP still has the option of toppling the Cabinet when
the new legislative session begins but has not contacted the TSU over
the matter.</P>
      <P>David Huang, a TSU caucus whip in the legislature, also said the
caucus has not received any information on toppling the Cabinet, and
dismissed the media reports as speculation.</P>
      <P>Huang said the TSU is opposed to Su's earlier advocacy of more
open cross-Taiwan Strait relations, while the PFP is supportive of
more opening.</P>
      <P>For this reason, it is imposible for the TSU to work with the PFP
on proposing a no-confidence vote, he added.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yi-jin, a DPP caucus whip in the legislature, said that if
the Cabinet is toppled, she will suggest that Chen dissolve the
legislature and hold another election.</P>
      <P>But she also urged the opposition parties to stop political
infighting and preserve the nation's stability.</P>
      <P>According to the Constitution, one-third of the legislators are
needed to make a valid no-confidence proposal, and the premier will
have to resign within 10 days should the proposal be approved by half
of the legislators.</P>
      <P>The president could name another premier or dissolve the
legislature, whose new members would have to be elected in 60 days.</P>

      <P>The Taipei Kuanyin Counseling Hotline Association, which was

with grievances against life to share their frustrations and
desperation with each other at the tearoom.</P>
      <P>Lee Yi-wei, president of the association, said the stereotype of
men is that they are supposed to be tough enough to bear the
frustration in daily life and should not reveal their feelings, as
this is considered a sign of weakness.</P>
      <P>As a result, Lee claimed, men are more fragile than women
psychologically and often resort to alcohol or gambling for stress
relief.</P>
      <P>Hsu Chung-kuang, the manager of the tearoom and a psychologist

    <TEXT>
      <P>Scientists in Taiwan have developed their
own version of an on-line system for non-destructive inspection of
fruit quality, which runs faster than similar foreign-made facilities
but costs only one-third as much.</P>
      <P>Using infrared and photometric imaging devices, the automatic
evaluation and sorting system can detect the sugar content and
acidity of fruit on an assembly line, as well as other data such as
weight, color and internal defects.</P>
      <P>Officials at the Agricultural and Food Agency under the Council
of Agriculture (COA) said that accurate information provided by the
equipment about fruit quality can help make fruit grading more
precise, thus giving Taiwan fruit a more competitive edge on the
international market.</P>
      <P>The officials said the system was developed by a group of
Taiwanese scientists with the help of a grant from the COA.</P>
      <P>The scientists were from National Taiwan University, National
Chung Hsing University, National Ping Tung University of Science and
Technology and National Yilan University.</P>
      <P>The system can process an average of 75 pieces of fruit per

      <P>He noted that prisons and detention centers generally trust
lawyers not to violate the law by bringing in drugs or controlled
substances to the cells.</P>
      <P>Currently, detention centers and prisons only record and videotape
meetings between lawyers and inmates being held incommunicado, Cheng
said.</P>
      <P>For inmates not being held under such circumstances, there is no
recording or videotaping, and the prison guards have to follow the
principle of "seeing, but not hearing anything," he added.</P>
      <P>On whether such meetings will be recorded in the future, Cheng
said the ministry will have to make an overall consideration in terms
of the facilities and personnel increase of the detention centers and
prisons, the views of the Bar Association, and whether such an
approach is legitimate.</P>
      <P>At present, the ministry will focus on reviewing the current work
force and the system, and will implement rigorous body searches after
inmates meet with their lawyers.</P>
      <P>Peng Huan-ming, an inmate of the Taipei detention center, died
unexpectedly in January and investigators found evidence of drugs
in his system. Prosecutors later found that lawyer Peng Yung-chang,
while meeting with his client who was Peng's cellmate, had sneaked in
drugs several times.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXPORTS IN JULY SET SINGLE-MONTH RECORD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) announced
Monday that July exports totaled US$19.58 billion, a record
single-month high.</P>
      <P>MOF officials said July exports represent an increase of 21.2
percent from the same month of last year, while July imports totaled
US$17.78 billion, up 17.5 percent year on year.</P>
      <P>The officials said that exports and imports in July were
brilliant, mainly because exports to Hong Kong, China, the United
States, six Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries
and South Korea increased by more than 18 percent, while imports from
Hong Kong, China, the United States, six ASEAN countries, the Middle
East and Africa increased by 13 percent.</P>
      <P>They noted that export orders in June also recorded the
second-highest level, showing that the momentum of exports has been
strong.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that because crude oil imports averaged
US$65.09 a barrel in July, resulting in rising oil cost and
slower economic growth in the United States, exports in the latter
part of the year will be affected.</P>
      <P>Taiwan still has a chance of reaching the goal of exporting
more than US$20 billion-worth of goods in a single month in the
latter part of the year and of maintaining double-digit export growth,
although the increase is not expected to be higher than 21.2 percent
in July, they added.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A visit to Panama planned for Minister of
Foreign Affairs Huang Chih-fang is a routine trip for which a
detailed schedule is still being worked out, a senior official said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Michel Lu was responding to
media reports that Huang will travel to Panama next week to preside
over a regional working meeting of Taiwan's diplomatic mission chiefs
in Latin America and the Caribbean.</P>
      <P>Following the breakdown of Taiwan-Chad diplomatic ties last
weekend, diplomatic work in Latin America and the Caribbean has
become even more important, as half of Taiwan's diplomatic allies are
located in the region.</P>
      <P>Media reports had speculated that Huang's trip to Panama at this
moment might be aimed at shoring up diplomatic ties with the country
as China has never ceased its attempts to sway Panama's diplomatic
support for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lu said he would not make any comments on speculative media
reports. He instead stressed that Huang's planned Latin America trip
is a routine and that his travel schedule will be announced when
details are fleshed out.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lu confirmed that Honduran President Manuel Zelaya has
again postponed his planned visit to Taiwan indefinitely because of
his busy schedule.</P>
      <P>Zelaya was originally scheduled to visit Taiwan in mid-July, but
he postponed his trip to Aug. 9. He then informed Taiwan's embassy in
Honduras last week that he had to postpone his visit again because of
a teachers strike.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FEMALE TEENS ACCOUNT FOR 40.8% OF MISSING YOUTHS IN TAIWAN: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 7 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Of all the missing children and juveniles in
Taiwan, more than 40 percent are females aged between 12 and 18,
which is considerably higher than the ratio among males and a cause
for concern, a child welfare organization said in a report released
Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the "Status Report on Missing Kids and Juveniles in
Taiwan" released on the eve of Fathers' Day, there were 509 females
aged between 12 to 18 among 1,246 missing children and juveniles
reported to the Child Welfare League Foundation (CWLF) during the
last 14 years, said CWLF Executive Director Wang Yu-min.</P>
      <P>Females also dominate most of the runaway juveniles that left
home to meet Internet friends, totaling 89 cases. These cases account
for 7.1 percent of all cases and have increased dramatically in
recent years, Wang said.</P>
      <P>An encouraging fact is that 872 of the 1,246 missing children --
a little over 70 percent -- were found after an average of 154 days.
However, less than 50 percent of missing children under 6 years of
age were found.</P>
      <P>The months that registered the most missing cases are March and
September. "The fact reminds every parents that they should pay more
attention to children during the winter and summer breaks, " said
Wang.</P>
      <P>However, the report appears to be woefully inaccurate, as
National Police Agency records show that the number of missing
children already exceeds 3,000.</P>
      <P>A documentary recording the life stories of two families that
have not found their missing children after more than 13 years but
who have never give up searching, premiered at the press conference
in the hope of boosting public support in the search for missing
children.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 7 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tsai Kuang-shen and Ho Li-lan still believe
that one day they will see their missing son again, although their
last glimpse of the baby boy was almost 35 years ago.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ming-chih, who was only 2 years old when he was taken from
his parents in 1972, is one of more than 3,000 missing children in
Taiwan, according to National Police Agency (NPA) records. Although
NPA records show one case in which a family succeeded in finding a
missing child after 13 years, the Tsais have never found their
beloved son.</P>
      <P>Still, Tsai Kuang-shen has managed to keep the faith and was
optmistic about finding his son at a press conference in Taipei
Monday.</P>
      <P>"I imagine that somewhere, Ming-chih -- 36 years old by now -- has
a family and a successful career. I used to hope we would have him
back for a family reunion. Not anymore. The only thing I need right
now is to know where he is and how he's doing," said Tsai.</P>
      <P>According to witnesses, Tsai Ming-chih was taken away in front of
his grandmother's house in Chiayi, southern Taiwan, by a woman
dressed in red on the afternoon of October 3, 1972.</P>
      <P>The Tsais would never see him again. And they were unable to
identify the woman, even with the assistance of police and child
welfare organizations over the next 35 years.</P>
      <P>Thousands of sleepless nights and tears did not impede their
search for Ming-chih, as numerous bits of information -- notes on
tips, photographs and news clippings -- piled up in the Tsais' living
room.</P>
      <P>"You don't often find such a determined family like the Tsais. A
lot of parents give up [searching for their children] after a number
of years," said Wang Yu-min, executive director of Child Welfare
League Foundation, an organization founded 14 years ago to help
parents like the Tsais find their children again.</P>
      <P>"After all these years, I believe it's easier if he [Tsai
Ming-chih] comes to us instead of going out to find him," Tsai said,
adding that media outlets would be of great help by spreading the
news.</P>
      <P>"Sometimes all parents need is a definite answer -- no
matter what that answer may be. The last thing they need is a
question mark in their minds," Wang said.</P>
      <P>"If we can eventually find Ming-chih again, it will be another
inspiring Taiwan Miracle," she said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Control Yuan said Monday it will ask the
Ministry of Finance to provide data concerning an alleged "secret
bank account" of President Chen Shui-bian, and that it would ask
Taishin International Bank to confirm whether such an account exists.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan made the statement in response to media reports
the president may have violated laws governing public functionaries'
private assets and political donations by failing to report his
alleged Taishin Bank account to the Yuan.</P>
      <P>If it turns out that such a bank account exists and the account
holder has failed to abide by relevant laws, the Control Yuan said it
would "take further steps" as necessary.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office has not yet provided what it called
"further explanation" about the alleged account, which opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Chiu Yi claimed was used to launder slush
funds.</P>
      <P>Lee Nan-yang, director of the office's department of public
affairs, has said the alleged account was actually an open account
set up during the 2004 presidential elections.</P>
      <P>Tan Sun Chen, secretary-general to the president, referred the
press to Lee's "initial explanation" about Chiu's allegation, adding
that if there is need for further understanding on the issue, the
Presidential Office will provide further explanation to the people.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-lang, spokesman for the ruling Democratic Progressive

      <P>Urging the president to sue Chiu for defamation, Tsai also called

      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that a
controversy over land development in the city's Beitou District would
not affect the city government's determination to push ahead with a
"build, operate and transfer" (BOT) project to build a cable-car
system.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks at a meeting of the city's tourism committee,
whose members said they were concerned the building of the cable-car
system could be delayed because of the recent controversy.</P>
      <P>Some members said they were worried about Beitou District's
tourism industry because fewer people have visited the area after
Hsuehshan Tunnel opened to motorists in June.</P>
      <P>Ma told them that suspected irregularities had occurred when land
developers tried to bribe Ministry of the Interior officials, and
that a controversy erupted over whether an "environmental review"
should have been conducted on two of the area's housing development
projects.</P>
      <P>"Both the suspected crime and the environmental review
controversy will not affect the city government's plan to build the
cable-car system," he added.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the decision to build the cable-car system was
made while Chen Shui-bian was mayor in 1998.</P>
      <P>In 2001, when Ma was mayor, Ma said the city government sent a
copy of its "environmental impact assessment report" to the
Yangmingshan National Park Administration even though the
Environmental Protection Administration did not require such a report
for projects covering less than 10 hectares of land.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 7 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Residents of three townships near a Formosa
Plastics Group (FPG) plant in Kaohsiung county, southern Taiwan
staged a protest Monday against a local plant's decision to transport
and deal with mercury-laced sludge that was improperly dumped in
a neighboring county.</P>
      <P>More than 50 residents of Chunghua, Wuho and Chuho townships in
Jenwu village gathered in front of FPG's factory, displaying large
white banners decrying the planned return of toxic industrial waste
the plant had stored in Wantan township, Pingtung county.</P>
      <P>According to organizers of the rally, the Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA) under the Executive Yuan has notified
FPG's Jenwu plant to prepare to process the mercury-tainted sludge,
as it is slated to be transported back to the plant Aug. 9.</P>
      <P>Protesters accused the Jenwu plant of trying to hide the truth
and demanded that plant authorities call a coordination meeting to
forge a consensus with local residents. They also warned they would
resort to more violent means of resistance if the plant fails to
reach a consensus with them on the issue -- first, before the
toxic waste is delivered.</P>
      <P>Local residents continued protesting about thirty minutes after
law enforcement officers asked them to leave for not having obtained
advance permission from police to demonstrate.</P>
      <P>Lin Chen-jung, manager of FPG's Jenwu plant, received a petition
from the protesters and pointed out the whole matter was being
directed and arranged by the EPA.</P>
      <P>Claiming the Jenwu plant is only responsible for disposing of the
mercury-tainted sludge, Lin expressed hope the EPA would first talk
with local residents to settle the issue.</P>
      <P>A large amount of mercury-laced sludge was created by PFG's
Jenwu plant, but illegally dumped by a waste disposal company and
later uncovered by EPA inspectors in Wantan township, Pingtung county
in 1996. Some 8,300 metric tons out of a total 34,000 metric tons of
toxic sludge were found to contain high levels of mercury.</P>
      <P>Through an out-of-court settlement, FPG's Jenwu plant agreed
to process the mercury-tainted sludge using an EPA subsidy of NT$90
million.</P>
      <P>But residents living in Kaohsiung's Jenwu township rejected the
EPA's proposal in July this year to allow the industrial waste dumped
in Pingtung's Wantan township to be transported back to the Jenwu
plant for processing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEA WARNING ISSUED AGAINST TROPICAL STORM BOPHA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A sea warning was issued Monday evening
againt tropical storm Bopha as the tropical depression continued
swirling toward waters off southeastern Taiwan coast.</P>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) said Bopha was centered 630 km
east of Oluanpi, the southernmost tip of Taiwan, at 8 p.m. Monday,
moving in a westerly direction toward eastern Taiwan at 15 kph.</P>
      <P>If the storm maintains its present course and speed, CWB
meteorologists said Bopha will be centered about 290 km
east-northeast at 8 p.m. Tuesday.</P>
      <P>They also forecast that occasional showers or thundershowers will
hit eastern and northern parts of Taiwan Tuesday because of the
influence of Bopha's surrounding airstreams. Rainfall in eastern
Taiwan will become even heavier Wednesday, CWB analysts said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, they added that Bopha is likely to sweep a bit
southward due to the effect of medium Typhoon Saomai. Should Bopha
moves southward earlier, they said, its influence on Taiwan's inland
will be minimized.</P>
      <P>"It remains uncertain whether the weather bureau will issue a
land warning against Bopha. We are closely monitoring several
variables, including the storm's direction and strength. If it tilts
southward earlier, we may not issue a land warning, " said Lin
Hsiu-wen, deputy director of the CWB's forecast center.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, Bopha is likely to weaken in strength and
shrink in radius because of certain weather conditions unfavorable to
its development into a typhoon.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin said Typhoon Saomai is still far away from Taiwan.
It is forecast to gradually move close to the Japanese island of
Okinawa Wednesday or Thursday. Whether Saomai will influence Taiwan
requires further monitoring, she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROSECUTORS MAKE 3RD APPEAL AGAINST BAIL RULING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei Prosecutor's Office filed its
third appeal with the Taiwan High Court Monday against a lower
court's ruling on bail for three indicted suspects in a high-porfile
insider trading scandal involving President Chen Shui-bian's
son-in-law Chao Chien-ming.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors asked the high court to revoke the Taipei District
Court's bail ruling on the ground that the crime committed by the
three suspects deserve continued detention in accordance the Criminal
Procedure Law.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors formally indicted Chao and two accomplices July 10 on
charges of using insider information to profit from Taiwan
Development Corp. (TDC) stock dealings. In the indictment,
prosecutors recommended that Chao and former TDC Chairman Su
Teh-chien be sentenced to eight years behind bars, with 10 years for
businessman You Shih-yi.</P>
      <P>In the evening of that same day, Chao and You were freed on NT$10
million bail and Su on NT$5 million bail.</P>
      <P>The prosecutor's office appealed to the high court July 14,
seeking to have the trio detained once again. In response to the
first appeal, the high court ruled July 17 that the lower court had
to review the case again because its previous decision was flawed.</P>
      <P>In its second ruling issued July 20, the district court stuck to
its decision on allowing the trio to remain free, but raised bail for
Chao to NT$17 million from the original NT$10 million, while
maintaining that bail for the other two suspects should remain the
same at NT$10 million and NT$5 million, respectively.</P>
      <P>The prosecutor's office re-appealed the case July 26 to try to
have the trio detained once again. On July 28, the high court
rescinded the district court's second ruling and demanded a further
review.</P>
      <P>On July 31, the district court upheld its second ruling on
allowing the trio to remain free on bail.</P>
      <P>In is third appeal, the prosecutor's office rebutted the district
court's argument that as insider trading suspects are normally
unlikely to repeat their illegal stock trading practice once their
case are exposed, they need not be detained in the wake of their
indictment.</P>
      <P>Quoting the Criminal Procedure Law, the prosecutor's office said
that any suspect who faces a recommendation of five years behind bars
can be kept in custody pending trial regardless whether he or she is
likely to repeat previous criminal acts.</P>
      <P>In the TDC case, the prosecutor's office argued that as all the
three suspects deserve a minimum seven-year prison term, the high
court should invalidate the district court's bail ruling.</P>
      <P>While granting bail, the district court banned the trio from
leaving the country or changing residence without due notice.</P>

      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) urged
the Cabinet Monday to allow the director of China's Taiwan Affairs
Office to visit Taiwan for a forum on cross-Taiwan Strait
agricultural cooperation.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, deputy director of the KMT's Policy Coordination

diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China to interfere in a
decision of whether to grant an entry visa to Chen Yunlin, director

farmers," Chang said, adding that if the Democratic Progressive
Party-led government blocks Chen's visit to Taiwan, it will only hurt
Taiwan's farmers.</P>
      <P>Noting that Premier Su Tseng-chang said last week that Chen
should not come to Taiwan if his purpose is to engage in a "united
front tactics," the KMT official said, "The government should allow

said the time ranges between 12 hours and 18 hours, and 23.36 percent
said they spend less than six hours with their children every week.</P>
      <P>The figures indicate young fathers have scant or insufficient

      <P>Christensen said Taiwan should try harder to improve its free

an FTA in the future.</P>
      <P>Lee said Christensen's remarks should not be interpreted as a
negative development as the signing of a Taiwan-U.S. FTA is not
something that can be attained in a short period of time.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office said Tuesday that it
will only respond after receiving a request from the Control Yuan
concerning the sources of the first lady's jewelry assets.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Department of Public Affairs of the
Presidential Office made the remarks as reports said the Control
Yuan, the nation's highest watchdog party, will ask the Presidential
Office to reveal the identity of relatives and friends from whom the
first lady has borrowed jewelry.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan needs information related to those who lent
jewelry to the first lady for further checks, the reports also said.</P>
      <P>However, the Presidential Office officials reaffirmed that "it
is not convenient" for the first family to reveal their names "for
privacy reasons of individual assets."</P>
      <P>The first couple sent a corrected version of jewelry assets to
the Control Yuan in early July, listing 15 pieces of jewelry and
watches that they own, with a total value of NT$3.725 million
(US$113,560).</P>
      <P>Legislators from the opposition Kuomintang and People First Party
then produced photos of 31 pieces of jewelry worn by the first lady
on various occasions. The Control Yuan therefore asked for an
explanation from the first family within 15 days.</P>
      <P>The first couple, replied last Friday -- the last day of the
deadline -- that they had acquiesced to the Control Yuan's request by
filing reports on their jewelry but had not reported on jewelry
borrowed from relatives or friends because the relatives and friends
were not being audited and should have the privacy of their assets
protected.</P>
      <P>According to the Public Functionary Assets Disclosure Law, any
piece of jewelry, including watches, worth over NT$200,000 should be

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) released
Tuesday a guidebook on the prevention of suicide, which has been one
of the top 10 killers in Taiwan for nine consecutive years.</P>
      <P>According to DOH tallies, 4,282 people died by suicide in Taiwan
last year, for a figure of 18.84 suicides for every 100,000 people --
the highest level in the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>The guidebook is a Chinese translation of the article "Preventing
Suicide" released by the World Health Organization. It provides
advice and strategies on suicide prevention to physicians, healthcare
workers, teachers, reformatory institutions, media workers and
suicide survivor support groups, who are most likely to have contact
with people who are prone to attempt suicide.</P>
      <P>The DOH has prepared 10,000 copies of the guidebook for
distribution to local health authorities, medical associations and
educational institutions, officials said.</P>
      <P>Lee Ming-pin, director of the DOH's center for suicide prevention
and control, noted that more than 50 percent of those who committed
suicide had directly or indirectly disclosed their intent to their
friends or relatives or had received non-psychiatric treatment before
killing themselves.</P>
      <P>"This shows that suicide can be prevented as long as people are

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's daughter Chen
Hsing-yu has reimbursed over NT$2 million (US$61,000) that the
Presidential Office paid to "janitor" Lin Hsiu-chen who actually
worked as a housemaid at Hsing-yu's home, a spokesman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee Nan-yang, director of the office's department of public
affairs, said Chen Hsing-yu has paid that amount to the accounting
office of the Presidential Office, which then passed it on to the
national coffers.</P>
      <P>The first family made the move following media reports that Lin
Hsiu-chen, also known as "Sister A-Ching, " had been paid by the
government to work as a housemaid at the president's previous
residence, now occupied by his married daughter.</P>
      <P>The reports created quite a stir, as calls for "integrity" and
"clean politics" rose again amidst a spate of corruption scandals
involving members of the first family and close aides to the
president.</P>
      <P>On Aug. 1, 2006, the Presidential Office announced that Lin had
resigned as a janitor but then was reemployed by the president to
work at his daughter's home on Minsheng East Road in Taipei and that
Lin's salary and bonuses from Oct. 2001, when Hsing-yu got married to
Chao Chien-ming and moved to the current home, would be reimbursed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BOOMING EXPORTS TO HELP BOLSTER TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC GROWTH: THINK TANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Booming exports will bolster the nation's
economy, and there is a good chance that economic growth this year
will surpass 4 percent, the head of a local think tank said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Liang Kuo-yuan, president of the Polaris Research Institute,
noted that soaring crude oil prices this year will "place a
tremendous burden on Taiwan's imports, " although strong exports will
provide momentum for the economy's continued growth.</P>
      <P>Liang noted that there's a good chance that average crude oil
prices will break the US$70 per barrel mark for this year, given the
fact that West Texas Intermediate crude oil averaged US$68.24 a
barrel in the first eight months this year,</P>
      <P>He said that soaring oil prices will lead to a rapid increase in
imports. He cited 2005 as an example, saying that crude oil imports
totaled US$18.8 billion that year, leading to a dramatic decline in
the nation's trade surplus.</P>
      <P>Crude oil prices have continued to increase this year, and if
exports cannot maintain the same strong momentum, then Taiwan's
economic prospects will become worrisome, he added.</P>
      <P>However, he said, exports have been more brisk than expected,
noting that July exports totaled US$19.58 billion, setting a
single-month record and an increase of 21.1 percent over the same
month last year. </P>
      <P>He attributed the increase mainly to the fact that 60 percent of
Taiwan's exports go to China, Japan, and member states of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) -- all high economic
growth areas.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance noted Monday that export orders in June
also recorded the second-highest level in history, showing that the
momentum of exports has been strong.</P>
      <P>Ministry officials noted that because of rising oil prices and
slower economic growth in the United States, Taiwan's exports in the
latter part of the year will be affected.</P>
      <P>Taiwan still has a chance to reach the goal of exporting more
than US$20 billion worth of goods in a single month in the latter
part of the year and of maintaining double-digit export growth,
although the increase is not expected to be higher than 21.2 percent
in July, they added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) has launched a drive to collect second-hand computers to help
disadvantaged children.</P>
      <P>EPA officials said they welcome groups or individuals to donate
their spare computers before the end of December so as to help narrow
the digital gap between the urban and rural areas.</P>
      <P>They noted that this is the second year the EPA has launched the
drive, adding that all collected computers will be repaired and
installed with related software before being donated to children from
low-income families and those residing in remote areas.</P>
      <P>They said the goal for this year will be 3,800 computers. Judging
from past experience, the officials said, they can only assemble one
usable computer from between three and five old computers donated. In
other words, they need to collect about 18,000 computers to reach the
goal.</P>
      <P>Those who want to donate computers can visit the Web site
www.istec.iii.org.tw or contact the EPA by phoning the toll-free
number 0800-000-156. The EPA will send officials to collect donations

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  8  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several fugitives wanted by Taiwan's
authorities for alleged involvement in a spate of scams were
repatriated from China to the outlying island of Kinmen Tuesday, a
spokesman for the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) said.</P>
      <P>According to the CIB spokesman that same day, the 11 fugitives
were sent back from Mawei in Fujian province to Kinmen Island on the
"three mini links" shipping route under the terms of the "Kinmen
agreement" -- a set of crime-fighting mechanisms agreed upon by
Taiwan and China in the early 1990s.</P>
      <P>The number of repatriates is the highest-ever in Taiwan's
history, with most being masterminds behind various criminal fraud
rings -- marking a departure from similar cases in which only
"downstream" ciphers were detained, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The 44-year-old Hsu Shiou-ting, one of the fugitives returned to
Taiwan, was on the run in China for little more than two months. The
Kaohsiung Prosecutor's Office issued a warrant for Hsu's arrest May
30 after he repeatedly failed to show up in court for questioning.</P>
      <P>In May, Hsu was caught and detained by police in Kaohsiung on
charges of allegedly cajoling an accomplice into smuggling illicit
narcotics into Taiwan through Kaohsiung's Hsiaokang airport. The drug
trafficker was apprehended by airport police early that month, trying
to enter the airport with heroin in his anus, looking suspicious.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  8 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) legislators
accused Minister of Foreign Affairs Huang Chih-fang Tuesday of
damaging Taiwan's international image after Huang was reported to
have met with Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah during a
secret visit to Lebanon in April.</P>
      <P>According to the Apple Daily, the meeting was covered by local
media in Lebanon, and related information has also been posted on the
official Web site of Hezbollah, a Shi'a Islamic organization and the
political party defending Southern Lebanon against Israel's
occupation and current offensive -- and considered by the United
States, Canada and Israel as a terrorist organization.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chin-lung, a KMT legislative caucus whip, demanded that
Huang provide a public explanation for the matter, which Tsai said
has betrayed Taiwan's image as a democratic country practicing the
rule of law and an advocate against terrorism.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the incident shows Huang is incompetent as minister of
foreign affairs and that Huang should resign to take responsibility
for the mistake in judgement.</P>
      <P>Accusing Huang of "dancing with the devil," KMT Legislator Joanna
Lei said the ruling Democratic Progressive Party pays no attention to
the well-being of Taiwan's people while repeatedly claiming it "loves
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>In response to the allegations, Ministry of Foreign Affairs
spokesman Michel Lu clarified that Huang was only paying a courtesy
call on Nasrallah and that the meeting took place before the conflict
began between Lebanon and Israel.</P>
      <P>Lu said the purpose of Huang's Lebanon visit was to try to
establish substantive relations with the Middle East nation, and the
minister had arranged a meeting with Nasrallah because Hezbollah is
the governing party of the Lebanese government.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan has no intention of getting involved in disputes
between Israel and other countries in the Middle East, adding that
different parts of the world have different interpretations as to
what constitutes terrorism.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is still willing to promote exchanges
and visits by ranking officials between Taiwan and China if Beijing
provides a reasonable explanation for the Chad incident, Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Huang Wei-feng said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Huang made the comments while delivering a speech on the outlook
of Taiwan's foreign relations at a seminar sponsored by Taiwan
Thinktank. </P>
      <P>Early Sunday morning, Taiwan announced the severing of diplomatic
ties with Chad after learning the central African county had decided
to switch official recognition from Taiwan to China -- the latest
setback for Taiwan in its cross-strait diplomatic struggle.</P>
      <P>If Beijing would offer a fair explanation to Taiwan's people
about why it employs every possible means in its arsenal to suppress
Taiwan, the government would still do its best to boost two-way
exchanges by ranking officials, including a planned mid-October visit
to Taiwan by Chen Yunlin, head of the Chinese Communist Party's
Central Office for Taiwan Affairs, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Stating that it is a set government policy to step up exchanges
and dialogue between Taiwan and China, Huang suggested that Beijing
demonstrate concrete acts of goodwill toward Taiwan before the two
sides begin negotiations.</P>
      <P>The government will continue trying to forge a consensus with the
Chinese side on opening up Taiwan to Chinese tourists and
implementing direct cross-strait charter flights, the MAC vice
chairman said.</P>
      <P>According to the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), Chen will file
an application with the MAC later this month to visit Taiwan, where
he hopes to take part in a KMT-sponsored agricultural seminar in
mid-October.</P>

Chao's bank accounts, but the discussion "was not expanded to cover

(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's government should increase its
diplomacy budget to counter China's relentless oppression in the
international community, academics said in a seminar Tuesday.</P>
      <P>China has been pouring money in every imaginable way into Africa,
South America and the South Pacific since its economic rise, said
Michel Lu, spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) . And
one of its main objectives is to win over Taiwan's allies in those
regions, he added.</P>
      <P>The number of Taiwan's allies went from 29 in 2000 -- when the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) became the ruling party -- down to
the present 24. The five countries were won over by more aid and
financial promises from China, and switched diplomatic recognition.</P>
      <P>With a NT$28 billion diplomacy budget, which accounts for less
than one percent of the NT$320 billion gross domestic
product (GDP), it's difficult for Taiwan to counter China's
influence, Lu said, adding that only half the budget -- NT$14
billion -- is designated for international aid expenditures.</P>
      <P>"I think Taiwan should increase its diplomacy budget. A diplomacy
budget under one percent of the nation's GDP, especially in Taiwan's
case, is unfathomable," said Lin Cheng-yi, a research fellow
specializing in European and American studies at Academia Sinica,
Taiwan's top research institution.</P>
      <P>The seminar was organized by Taiwan Thinktank to dicuss Taiwan's
foreign relations after diplomatic ties were severed Sunday with the
central African country of Chad. Taiwan cut off diplomatic ties with
Chad on Aug. 6 after learning the African nation was ready to switch
diplomatic recognition to Beijing.</P>

Wall Street Journal: Mixed Message, In
Volatile Mideast, U.S. Finds a Use For Old
Autocrats

With radicalism on the rise and battles
flaring from Beirut to Baghdad to Gaza, the Bush
administration's quest for democracy in the
Middle East is literally under fire. the
administration is also showing new eagerness
to maintain pillars of the old Middle East --
particularly America's steadiest allies in the
region, the autocracies of Egypt, Jordan and
Saudi Arabia. It was Israel's bombardment of
Lebanon, designed to cripple the Hezbollah
militant group, which most recently underscored
America's need for friends in the region.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>PFP SEEKS TO TOPPLE CABINET, IMPEACH PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 8 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP) will
seek to topple the Cabinet through a no-confidence vote in the
legislature while asking the Council of Grand Justices to impeach the
scandal-ridden president, a PFP legislative caucus whip said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Hung-chun, general secretary of the PFP's caucus,
said the PFP will use the two-pronged approach to apply pressure on
President Chen Shui-bian to make him step down as head of state.</P>
      <P>Chen, his family members and senior aides have been implicated in
a series of corruption and embezzlement scandals, some of which have
entered legal proceedings.</P>
      <P>Lee indicated the PFP is unlikely to cooperate with the
opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) -- a partner of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the "pan-green camp" --
although the TSU also plans to topple the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>"The TSU wants to introduce a motion to topple the Cabinet
because it is displeased with Premier Su Tseng-chang's policy, which
favors relaxing restrictions on exchanges with China," he said.</P>
      <P>"Our reason for toppling the Cabinet is different," Lee said,
adding that the PFP is unhappy with the premier because instead of
distancing himself from the president, the premier chose to support
Chen's leadership after a presidential recall bid failed to pass the
Legislative Yuan in late June.</P>
      <P>Lee acknowledged that although the PFP will try to oust the
premier and topple his Cabinet through a no-confidence vote in the
next legislative session, the party's prime target for doing so
remains the president.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FINANCE MINISTER DECLARES WAR AGAINST TAX EVADERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 8 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tax evaders beware -- Taiwan's Minister of
Finance Ho Chih-chin has declared a war on you, and has vowed to
exact an additional NT$30 billion in income taxes for the government.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, Ho -- who helped the United States
set up a tax management mechanism to stamp out tax evasion -- said he
has recruited a Yale professor who is an expert in tax collection
to help transplant the U.S. tax management system in Taiwan in
October.</P>
      <P>The system, which is expected to be in place by early next year,
will help the Ministry of Finance more effectively collect personal
and corporate income taxes, Ho said.</P>
      <P>Citing his experience in the United States, Ho estimated that
about 17 dollars out of every 100 dollars in taxes will be evaded for
various reasons, and that about five dollars of that sum could be
reclaimed by an effective tax management system.</P>
      <P>In light of the fact that personal income taxes and corporation
income taxes total NT$600 billion in Taiwan every year, the
minister predicted the new tax management system would help his
ministry collect NT$30 billion more in taxes next year.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will
continue its scholarship program for 17 Chadian students until they
have completed their studies in Taiwan, despite the rupture of
diplomatic relations between the two countries, a MOFA official said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>This will mark a shift in Taiwan's policy on financial aid for
foreign students receiving college education or doing advanced
studies in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the past, the ministry has usually terminated scholarships for
foreign students as soon as their countries forged diplomatic ties
with China.</P>
      <P>This time, MOFA spokesman Michel Lu said, the ministry decided
not to go this route, in line with new thinking in terms of
diplomatic affairs.</P>
      <P>After discussing the issue with Premier Su Tseng-chang, Lu said,
Minister of Foreign Affairs Huang Chih-fang decided to continue
offering scholarships to the 17 Chadian students.</P>
      <P>"The breaking of diplomatic ties is not the fault of those
students and we need not punish them by withdrawing their
scholarships. We should instead continue our financial aid in the
hope that they will contribute to international society after
concluding their studies," Lu said.</P>
      <P>Some of the 17 students came to Taiwan just earlier this year to
receive one year of Chinese language training before starting
four-year university programs, while the others are doing master's or
doctoral programs here.</P>
      <P>Taiwan announced its decision to cut diplomatic ties with Chad at
midnight Aug. 5 after learning that the central African country was
ready to switch diplomatic recognition to Beijing the following day.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHOULD CHANGE APPROACH ON ALLIES: ACADEMICS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 8 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's diplomacy has been long caught up
in the "myth" of the numbers of diplomatic allies, and it is probably
time to adopt a new approach, academics said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The academics were attending a seminar organized by the Taiwan
Thinktank that focused on cross-Taiwan Strait relations after Taiwan
cut its official ties with the central African country of Chad, which
switched its diplomatic ties to China Aug. 6.</P>
      <P>"Theoretically, the more allies the better, because it helps us
in international organizations, " Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
spokesman Michel Lu said.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan had 60 or 80 allies, the situation would definitely
not be the same, " said Lu. But he admitted that it is "almost
impossible" for Taiwan to add more allies within a short period of
time.</P>
      <P>"How many allies do we need? What does an ally mean to Taiwan? Is
it realistic and meaningful to offer financial aid that exceeds our
capability just to keep an ally that could switch recognition at any
time? It's time for us to re-visit these basic issues, " said Chen
Wen-hsien, a professor at National Chengchi University.</P>
      <P>As more and more people disapprove of the so-called "checkbook
diplomacy" in which Taiwan has been engaged for the past several
decades, the government will definitely change its direction to a
more pragmatic route, said Lu.</P>
      <P>"We will no longer promise our allies something we cannot do. We
won't accept blackmail either, " he said.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-cheng, chairman of the Department of Political Science of
Soochow University, offered a different perspective on the numbers of
Taiwan's allies. The fact that China has wrestled away five allies
from Taiwan in the past five years means that China has changed the
status quo in the Taiwan Strait, he said.</P>
      <P>Lo encouraged the international community to pay attention to the
decreasing numbers of Taiwan's allies and the increasing numbers of
China's ballistic missiles across the Taiwan Strait -- both a sign of
the change of status quo.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 8 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China never stops its suppression of Taiwan
although it talks about friendship and goodwill all the time, as can
be seen in its move to induce Chad to switch diplomatic recognition,
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Deputy Chairman David Huang said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan cut diplomatic ties with Chad Aug. 6 after learning that
the African nation was ready to switch diplomatic recognition to
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Since 2001, Huang said, China has wrested five allies from
Taiwan. It also did so with plotted timing to humiliate the Taiwan
government.</P>
      <P>"China always talks about its goodwill toward the Taiwanese
people -- if not the government -- but what it has done has obviously
hurt their feelings deeply, " according to Huang.</P>
      <P>At the end of the day, it just shows us that China has never
given up on its military threats, said Huang.</P>
      <P>"It tells us that China will never give Taiwan any 'breathing
room' internationally if Taiwan does not recognize Beijing's 'one
China' policy, " he said.</P>
      <P>He also said the MAC will pragmatically keep working on vested
plans such as cross-Taiwan Strait cargo flights and allowing Chinese

    <HEADLINE>FINANCE MINISTER SETS 2011 GOAL FOR BALANCED BUDGET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 8 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Finance Minister Ho Chih-chin said Tuesday
that he has begun work on building a "financial forecast" system in
order to reach the goal of balancing the budget by 2011.</P>
      <P>During an exclusive interview with the CNA, Ho said balancing the
budget by 2011 was a consensus reached at a recent Cabinet-sponsored
economic sustainable development conference and that his ministry
will push for its realization.</P>
      <P>At present, the central government's debts account for 34 percent
of the gross national product (GDP), and although the budget deficit
has dropped from NT$310 billion (US$9.45 billion) in 2001 to NT$250
billion (US$7.62 billion) , it is still "quite some distance away"
from a balanced budget, Ho said.</P>
      <P>In order to have a balanced budget, it is critical to honor
"financial disciplines," he said, adding that his staff are studying
whether to propose legislating a "financial disciplines law" to stave
off political pressure calling for tax reductions and increased
welfare spending.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that to reach the 2011 goal, the Ministry of
Finance will have to manage the "income" part of the balance sheet
well by continuing to pursue such reforms as cancelling tax
exemptions for school teachers and men and women in uniform,
combining corporate and personal income taxes, and levying heavier
taxes on business net income that is not disbursed as dividends to
shareholders.</P>
      <P>In this connection, the national tax administration should be
reformed and new methods of cracking down on tax evasion should be
adopted so that government revenues can be increased by about NT$30
billion (US$0.91 billion) annually, an income that will go a long way
to balancing the budget, he said.</P>
      <P>He also recommended using the U.S. experience of a "financial
forecast" mechanism that enables government departments to understand
that different policies will have different impacts on government
revenues, which will help each department contribute to a balanced
budget and decide on government subsidies to industry.</P>

showing that the DPP's popularity has dropped drastically due to
Chen's and his family's suspected involvement in various corruption
scandals, while that of the People First Party (PFP) has also

      <P>Only the Kuomintang, which Lee led until 2000, and the TSU are
enjoying rising support from the people, according to the polls,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Finance Ho Chih-chin said
Tuesday that he will give top priority to pushing for a law revision
to cancel the longstanding income tax exemption privilege for
military personnel and elementary and junior high school teachers.</P>
      <P>When the Legislative Yuan opens its new session next month, Ho
said in an interview with CNA that he will vigorously lobby
legislators to pass the long-talked-about tax reform proposal to
reinstate income tax levies on military service members and
compulsory education school teachers.</P>
      <P>Ho, an academic-turned-technocrat who had a long service record
with the U.S. tax authorities before returning to Taiwan, said that
tax reform is one of his favorite research topics.</P>
      <P>"I look forward to introducing into Taiwan the U.S.-style
taxation system and its efficient tax management system," Ho said.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that Taiwan has held extensive discussions on
various tax reform initiatives and options over the years, Ho said
Taiwan now needs to take action to implement them.</P>
      <P>In addition to pushing for reinstatement of income taxes on
military personnel and elementary and junior high school teachers, Ho
said he will begin to promote reforms in inheritance and bequeathment
taxes in the first half of next year.</P>
      <P>Ho said there is still ample room for improvement in Taiwan's
inheritance tax management efficiency. Noting that high inheritance
tax rates tend to push rich people to keep their capital or assets
abroad, Ho said Taiwan should work out a viable mechanism to lure
back those assets.</P>
      <P>According to foreign studies, Ho said the cost for wealthy people
to keep their assets abroad to save on taxes tends to reach 15
percent of their financial holdings.</P>
      <P>"So long as we can craft a sound and profitable mechanism, rich
people will be willing to remit their funds back to Taiwan for
lucrative investment projects under a healthy income and inheritance
taxation system," Ho said.</P>
      <P>As for business tax reform, Ho said the timing should take into
account the domestic inflation situation. If apprehension about
domestic consumer price fluctuations remains high, he said, the
finance ministry will not be hasty in taking relevant reform steps.</P>
      <P>"In any event, reforms in income tax, inheritance and
bequeathment taxes, as well as business tax, will be kickstarted
gradually and significant progress will definitely be achieved next
year, " Ho said confidently, adding that the Finance Ministry will
infuse new thinking and new vigor into the tax reform operations.</P>

      <P>"So long as we can craft a sound and profitable mechanism, rich
people will be willing to remit their funds back to Taiwan for
lucrative investment projects under a healthy income and inheritance
taxation system," Ho said.</P>
      <P>As for business tax reform, Ho said the timing should take into
account the domestic inflation situation. If apprehension about
domestic consumer price fluctuations remains high, he said, the
finance ministry will not be hasty in taking relevant reform steps.</P>
      <P>"In any event, reforms in income tax, inheritance and
bequeathment taxes, as well as business tax, will be kickstarted
gradually and significant progress will definitely be achieved next
year, " Ho said confidently, adding that the Finance Ministry will
infuse new thinking and new vigor into the tax reform operations.</P>

      <P>Coast guard officers said Tuesday they will

to facilitate their operations in those regions. Some of the vessels
have even sneaked into waters near Pekan to poach oysters.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
declined to comment Tuesday on a media report that a five-year
cooperative research program with the United States on a mobile
electronic warfare system ended in failure.</P>
      <P>According to a local evening newspaper, the U.S. military

after the 1996 Taiwan Strait crisis in which China lobbed missiles
into waters close to Taiwan's Keelung and Kaohsiung ports in an
attempt to intimidate local voters ahead of the country's first-ever

      <P>The report said the research project, dubbed "Iron Fist, " was
launched in 1998, but the program, which cost Taiwan taxpayers NT$2.2
billion, turned out to be a flop and closed in 2004. According to the
report, eight senior military officers have been punished for the
botched program.</P>

      <P>Washington believes that Taipei remains
committed to countering terrorism despite an April meeting between a
Taiwan official and the leader of a Lebanese group considered by the
United States to be a terrorist organization, a senior U.S. State
Department official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>It was reported in Taiwan Tuesday that ROC Minister of Foreign
Affairs Huang Chih-fang had met with Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan
Nasrallah during his secret visit to Lebanon in April.</P>
      <P>While opposition legislators in Taiwan claimed that the meeting
has damaged the nation's image, Huang clarified that he was only
paying a courtesy visit to Nasrallah since Hezbollah holds one-third
of the seats in Lebanon's parliament.</P>
      <P>The State Department official said that the United States was
aware of the meeting between Huang and Nasrallah and that there have
been no signs since the meeting indicating that Taiwan has changed
its commitment to fighting terrorism.</P>
      <P>According to the department's Office of the Coordinator for
Counterterrorism, Hezbollah has been listed by the United States as a
terrorist organization since 1997 and has killed more Americans than
any other terrorist groups besides al-Qaida.</P>

books, a recommended reading list, and a handbook providing guidance
on reading and learning for children at different stages, they said.</P>
      <P>While applications for library cards will be accepted at any
branches of the library, 15 lectures have been scheduled between

    <HEADLINE>POVERTY CYCLE UNFAVORABLE TO TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC TRANSITION: ACADEMIC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Increased unemployment among the older
segment of the population, lowering real-term income and higher costs
of education are aggravating a "poverty cycle" that will have an
adverse impact on Taiwan's plan to upgrade its economy, an academic
warned Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tai Chao-yang, a department director of the Taiwan Research
Institute (TRI) , issued his warning in an article he contributed to
the electronic newspaper of the Ministry of Economic Affairs aimed at
Taiwan's business people around the world.</P>
      <P>He wrote that recent statistics about unemployment, real-term
income growth and other aspects of the economy reflect an
"unsatisfactory" reality about people's livelihoods that points to a
"worrying" trend of a vicious cycle of poverty leading to worse and
greater poverty.</P>
      <P>In terms of unemployment, he said that although the official rate
reached a high of 5.17 percent in 2002, a number of the government's
"make-do" projects to expand employment led to an apparent reduction
in the jobless rate while in fact "hidden" unemployment has gone up.</P>
      <P>Tai referred to the situation in which businesses use outsourcing
strategies that offer only temporary jobs and non-fixed incomes --
incomes that are often barely enough to support a normal family.</P>
      <P>As to the lack of growth in incomes, Tai said a sluggish economy
has been the main reason for a minimal increase in salaries and wages
in recent years.</P>
      <P>Soaring international crude oil and commodity prices have forced
manufacturers relying on their imports to adjust their export prices
as well as salaries. He noted that the minimal increase in wages has
failed to keep pace with consumer price hikes, indicating that
real-term incomes have decreased.</P>
      <P>He went on to quote Ministry of the Interior statistics as
showing that some 200,000 people in 80,000 low-income families have
been strapped by the rising cost of education, making it more and
more difficult for them to change their fortunes through education.</P>
      <P>Tai said that when more people in advanced-age groups are
jobless, people's real-term incomes are dropping and the number of
poor families are increasing, the mechanism of realizing social
justice through education is crumbling, delaying the schedule of
economic transition to a higher level of development.</P>
      <P>The issue of the "poverty cycle" in Taiwan society is in fact
more serious than attracting investment and easing up on the 40
percent- of-net-assets limit for Taiwan companies investing in China,
he added.</P>
      <P>Until the issue can be solved, he went on, it is quite unlikely
that Taiwan's economy will develop in a healthy way and he called on
the government to face the issue and come up with a solution.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER WANTS PEOPLE TO KNOW CHINA'S 'TRUE COLORS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang urged the Taiwan
people Wednesday not to harbor any illusions about China following
Taiwan's severance of diplomatic ties with Chad.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a weekly Executive Yuan meeting, Su said that the
public should "perfectly know China's true colors, " as the rupture
of Taiwan-Chad diplomatic ties orchestrated by Beijing is the latest
proof of its attempts to suppress Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Su described the incident as humiliating for Taiwan and called
for close attention to be paid by all political parties to China's
ambition to swallow Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The premier also thanked Minister of Foreign Affairs Huang
Chih-fang and the ministry staff for their hard work in minimizing
the impact of the Chad incident.</P>
      <P>The ministry's monitoring system effectively helped detect
changing relations between Taiwan and Chad, enabling it to announce
the Taiwan government's decision to cut diplomatic links with Chad
before the central African country announced its diplomatic
recognition of Beijing, the premier said.</P>
      <P>Turning to the question of 17 Chadian students pursing academic
degrees on Taiwan scholarships, Su said they should be allowed to
stay in Taiwan until they have completed their studies.</P>
      <P>"Allowing this will not cost much but will help the Chadian
students get to know the Taiwan people's hospitality and kindness, "
he said, adding that "this should help them gain a good impression of
Taiwan and spread the message to their compatriots after they return
to Chad."</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Education and relevant government agencies should
continue allocating budgets to offer scholarships to foreign
students, allowing elite students from other countries, regardless of</P>
      <P>whether they have diplomatic ties with Taiwan or not, to better
understand the country.</P>
      <P>Although it is not a key point to care about the number of
Taiwan's diplomatic allies, the premier claimed, the government
should help the people gain an understanding of its efforts in
reaching out to the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>For instance, Taiwan has sent healthcare, agricultural and
technical missions to many countries in need, helping such countries
improve the livelihoods of their people, he said.</P>

(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 2006 Asia-Pacific Traditional Arts
Festival, which starts Aug. 12 in the northeastern Taiwan county of
Yilan, will try to raise awareness of the diversity of cultural
heritage with more than 20 local and foreign performing groups
showcasing the richness of traditional cultural resources in the
Asia-Pacific region, the organizers said at a press conference
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese people have long valued Western culture and have
"neglected" the rich cultural assets of neighboring countries,
according to Lin Chao-hao, Director of The National Center for
Traditional Arts (NCFTA). The event, which runs from Aug. 12-Sept. 3,
will include artistic performances, demonstration lectures, special
exhibits and academic seminars.</P>
      <P>Four foreign groups highlighting the event include the Muqam Art
Ensemble from China's Xinjiang Province, the Yuanshe Water Puppet
Troupe from Vietnam, a group from Thailand performing Ramayana
traditional dance and the National Center for Korean Traditional
Performing Arts from South Korea.</P>
      <P>The groups will perform for three weeks in a tour that will also
take them to Taipei, Taoyuan, Tainan, Kaohsiung and Taitung.</P>
      <P>Also on the performing list will be more than a dozen local
groups, such as the Ju Percussion Group, the Lan Yang Dancers and
various groups of the Songjiang Battle Array.</P>
      <P>The event will focus on the topic of "Proclamation of
Masterpieces of the Intangible Heritage of Humanity" in response to
"Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage,
" which was adopted by UNESCO in 2003 and entered into force in April
this year.</P>
      <P>In addition to artistic performances, an international conference
will discuss the topic of "East Asian music and modernity." An
exhibition on the traditional percussion instruments of the Asia-
Pacific area will also be held from Aug. 12-Sept. 30 at the NCFTA.</P>
      <P>In the past four festivals, over 500 events performed by groups
from more than 20 countries were held. The festival covers music,
dance, fine arts, drama, crafts and installation art, and has become
one of the biggest platforms of Asian traditional culture.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT SHOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER OWN FATE: FORMER DPP HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beleaguered President Chen Shui-bian should
answer the question of whether he will stay on or step down from his
post, a former chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Shih Ming-teh, a close comrade of Chen until they went their
separate ways in recent years, made the remark at a news conference
called to explain why he wrote a letter Monday to the president
urging him to quit.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office declined to respond to Shih's call.</P>
      <P>Shih claimed in the letter, which was prominently reported by the
mass-circulation China Times Wednesday, that Chen "blatantly embraced
conglomerates" by forming an advisory group comprised of major
businessmen and academics shortly after he was first elected
president, claiming that this was "the first step toward his
downfall."</P>
      <P>"If you yourself are so close to the conglomerates, how can you
expect your right-hand men, your family and your in-laws to keep a
distance from them?" Shih asked in the letter.
</P>
      <P>Shih urged Chen and his administration, whose popularity has
continued to slip since a spate of corruption allegations implicating
his close aides and family members came to light earlier this year,
not to force the people "to openly stand up against them."</P>
      <P>Shih said the people have the power to demand a breaking of the
stalemate and an end to chaos. When such demands cannot be met, they
will have to seek "other political methods from outside the existing
system."</P>
      <P>He claimed he does not want to see "revolutionary methods" being
used, but said that if the present chaos continues, Chen will not
come out unscathed.</P>
      <P>"The people have lost trust and faith in the government, " Shih
said, adding that this has become the biggest crisis of the nation.</P>
      <P>The president cannot rely on "his supporters, DPP legislative
caucus, the DPP to come to his defense," he said. </P>
      <P>He called for Chen to come up with effective solutions, adding
that "persistent arguments and defense will not help national
stability."</P>
      <P>He said that he submitted all possible options for the reference
of the president more than a month ago, but has received no response.</P>
      <P>"As a national leader, you are obligated to solve the problem,
but when you yourself have become the source of this chaos, you
should consider the question of stepping down."</P>
      <P>Asked whether Chen should again report to the people, Shih said
that "the people do not need an orator but an executor and political
leader." The president reported to the people in June on TV in
response to an opposition-initiated motion to recall him, instead of
giving a written rebuttal to the Legislative Yuan. </P>
      <P>Shih said that the more important thing is for the president to
present objective evidence to assuage the misgiving of the people,
adding that the people have to learn about the truth.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) emphasized
Wednesday that it will deal with every complaint concerning fair
trade violations impartially, including the dispute surrounding
Yahoo! Taiwan's decision to charge transaction fees for its online
auction service.</P>
      <P>The commission made the remarks after some Internet users
expressed doubt about the FTC's ability to handle the Yahoo! case.</P>
      <P>The users alleged that the FTC is "only good at slapping flies
but dares not fight tigers, " saying that of the more than 1,000
complaints received by the commission every year, less than 20 cases
are considered valid.</P>
      <P>The announcement by Yahoo! Taiwan -- Taiwan's largest portal and
operator of online auctions -- that it will start charging a 3
percent transaction fee on most auction items in August has generated
strong reactions from sellers, which has forced the company to
postpone the implementation of the policy until Sept. 1.</P>
      <P>FTC officials noted that the commission started an investigation
into the case immediately after Yahoo! Taiwan made the announcement
July 24.</P>
      <P>They said that since the commission was established in 1992, it
has handled 1,000 to 2,000 cases of alleged fair trade violations per
year, with an average of 150 cases per year having been determined as
valid.</P>
      <P>While the commission looked into 143 cases last year, it has
investigated 194 cases between January and July this year, they said.</P>
      <P>As of the end of July 2006, the fines the FTC has handed down on
law-breaking companies have amounted to NT$1.86 billion, they said.</P>
      <P>They said Yahoo! Taiwan can be fined up to NT$25 million if the
company is determined to be a monopoly that has abused its market
status.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian quitting the
presidency is not what the people want at present, a legislative whip
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Responding to a recent letter sent to Chen by former DPP Chairman
Shih Ming-teh calling for the president to step down, Yeh Yi-jin,
chief secretary of the DPP legislative caucus, said it would not be
in line with the people's expectations if the president bowed out
without evidence proving that he has committed certain crimes.</P>
      <P>Yeh said Shih might have been out of the party for too long and
might have become unfamiliar with the "ecology" of the DPP and its
modern core values.</P>
      <P>In his letter, which was reportedly sent to the president Monday,
Shih urged Chen to relinquish the presidency as his credibility is in
tatters and he has lost the people's trust, which Shih described as
the biggest crisis facing the nation.</P>
      <P>Shih urged Chen to be "courageous" by relinquishing his post "for
the benefit of the people and the country."</P>
      <P>Yeh argued that stepping down now would be easier for the
president than continuing to serve his term, but Taiwan is a country
upholding rule of law and any alleged wrongdoings or irregularities
should be referred to the judicial system and handled through legal
channels, including those allegedly committed by the president and
his family.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the DPP has not deviated from its path and tradition,
nor is it supporting Chen "blindly, " adding that the DPP will not
condone the president if he is discovered to have been involved in
any wrongdoing.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tsai Huang-liang, director of the DPP Department of
Culture and Information, offered his appreciation for Shih's concern
for the DPP, saying that the party must "reform boldly and
resolutely" to regain the people's confidence in the ruling party.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A top presidential aide said Wednesday that
he hopes to arrange a meeting between President Chen Shui-bian and
former ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Shih
Ming-teh after Shih wrote a letter to Chen asking him to step down
"for the sake of Taiwan's future."</P>
      <P>Tan Sun Chen, secretary-general of the Presidential Office,
expressed the hope after the China Times reported earlier the same
day that Shih, who described himself as "an old battle companion" of
the president, sent Chen Shui-bian a letter Aug. 7 urging him to
resign as the people have lost confidence in him.</P>
      <P>Shih also called a news conference Wednesday in which he urged
the president to bravely "acknowledge his wrongdoing" and voluntarily
step down to help Taiwan get back to its right track at a time when
the country has been plunged into a confidence crisis.</P>
      <P>Tan Sun Chen said he hopes to arrange a tete-a-tete between the
two "old friends" because the president deeply respects Shih and
since they have not met for a long time.</P>
      <P>Tan Sun Chen also denied a rumor that Chen had rejected an
earlier proposal by Shih for a meeting.</P>
      <P>In the face of repeated calls from the public and academics for
Chen to quit the presidency to take responsibility for a spate of
corruption allegations related to his family members and close aides,
the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) suggested that the
president respond to the situation.</P>
      <P>According to TSU legislative caucus whip Lo Chi-ming, Chen must
face the current situation with clear-cut moves, despite having vowed
to cede some administrative power to Premier Su Tseng-chang.</P>
      <P>"The difficulties faced by the president now are not a question
of offering an apology or a pledge to delegate his power to the
Executive Yuan," Lo said.</P>
      <P>TSU lawmaker Ho Ming-hao prodded Chen to comprehensively gauge
his next move as the Taiwan people are carefully examining his
response in line with a set of principles that underpins Taiwan's
core values.</P>
      <P>Citing former President Lee Teng-hui, the TSU's so-called
"spiritual leader, " Ho said the that most important quality in a

    <TEXT>
      <P>The caucus of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) in the legislature expressed the hope Wednesday that President
Chen Shui-bian will heed the advice of former Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Chairman Shih Ming-teh and step down to "return the
nation to a clean space."</P>
      <P>Tsai Chin-lung, KMT caucus whip in the legislature, made the
remarks in the wake of a letter to Chen by Shih.</P>
      <P>Shih claimed in the letter that if the embattled president
refuses to step down, democracy in Taiwan will continue to suffer and
the nation will flounder.</P>
      <P>Tsai noted that Shih said in the letter that the president has
reneged on his pledges prior to the 2000 presidential election that
he would form a five-member advisory team including himself and
another former DPP chairman, Lin Yi-hsiung. However, Chen later
invited academics and big businessmen to join the team instead.</P>
      <P>Lu Hsueh-chang, a caucus whip of the opposition People First
Party, predicted that Chen will turn a deaf ear to Shih's advice and
to an earlier call by a group of pro-DPP academics for him to quit.</P>
      <P>Lu said that the judicial authorities must get tough and be
relentless in its probe into various irregularities, including the
alleged abuse of state funds for Chen's discretionary use, in order
to find solid and unequivocable evidence that will force the
president's resignation.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou also said he feels the
president "will cling onto his post." </P>
      <P>But Ma said the opposition will not take action to topple the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawyers for President Chen Shui-bian's
son-in-law Chao Chien-ming and Chao's father Chao Yu-chu, both
indicted in a high-profile insider trading case, told conflicting
stories Wednesday about how the senior Chao obtained insider
information about Taiwan Development Corp. (TDC) stocks.</P>
      <P>Chao Yu-chu's lawyer said his client did not have any contact
with his son before making a decision to invest in TDC stocks but
made the decision at the recommendation of Tsai Ching-wen, a board
member of the Waterland Securities Co. and another suspect in the
case.</P>
      <P>He denied that Chao decided to buy TDC stocks after his son told
him that TDC stocks were worth investing in -- which is what the
investigative report shows.</P>
      <P>Chao Chien-ming's lawyer said his client had admitted talking to
his father about the TDC stocks and asking him to contact Tsai about
how to invest. After that, Chao told investigators, Chao senior and
Tsai were in direct communication with each other.</P>
      <P>If Chao Yu-chu denied he had heard his son talking about the TDC
shares, he might have had a "slip of memory" or a "hearing" problem
because he did not hear his son's recommendation clearly, according
to the lawyer, Ku Li-hsiung.</P>
      <P>The lawyers made the remarks in reply to media questions after a
court hearing on the case, which has greatly hurt the image of the
president even though he has apologized for his in-law's actions.</P>
      <P>The two Chaos, Tsai, businessman You Shih-yi and former TDC
Chairman Su Teh-chien -- all indicted on insider trading charges --
appeared in court.</P>
      <P>Two other suspects -- business executives Chen Ching-yao and Hung

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan youths between the ages of 15 and 24
spend more than 30 hours per week using the Internet, which is the
highest among young people in East Asia, according to the results of
an international survey released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The results were unveiled by Zhu Jian Hua, a professor at City
University of Hong Kong's Department of English and Communication,
during the third conference of the Asia Pacific International
Research Alliance hosted by the Taiwan Network Information Center in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>According to Zhu, East Asia is home to more than 20 percent of
the world's Internet users and mobile phone users and the Internet
penetration rate in the region is also higher than that of Europe.</P>
      <P>Zhu said more than 90 percent of youths in Taiwan, Hong Kong,
Macau, South Korea, Japan and China are Internet users.</P>
      <P>He said in Taiwan, men in the 15-24 age group spend an average of
36.2 hours per week using the Internet, while women in the same age
group spend an average of 32.5 hours. These figures compare with 16.7
hours per week by men in the same age group in South Korea and 15.4
hours per week by women, he added.</P>
      <P>On the preferences of young Internet users in East Asia, the
survey shows that South Korean youths use the Internet most
frequently to browse Web sites, entertain themselves, search for data
and blog, while Hong Kong youths do so most often to browse Web
sites, use instant messenger services and receive or send e-mail, Zhu
said.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, youths use the Internet most often to browse Web
sites, do online shopping, receive or send e-mail, use instant
messenger services and watch movies, he said.</P>

(By Ada Tsai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Wednesday that
former Economics Minister Hwang Ing-san resigned rather than being
dismissed, as had been reported by local newspapers.</P>
      <P>Presiding over a ceremony in which Hwang handed over his office
to his successor Chen Ruey-long, Su said he rarely administers
handover ceremonies of misterial chiefs because of his busy schedule,
but he attended Hwang's handover because he wanted to clear his name.</P>
      <P>Contradicting news reports that Hwang's performance on the job
did not meet Su's expectations, which was the cause of his sudden
ousting, the premier awarded Hwang a medal in recognition of his
excellent contributions.</P>
      <P>"I have never been displeased with his performance, but he asked
to be relieved of his responsibilities, citing heavy stress, " Su
said.</P>
      <P>Although Hwang had submitted several letters of resignation to
the premier, Su said he did not accept them until the end of a
national conference for sustainable development of Taiwan July
28.</P>
      <P>In response, Hwang said he took heart from the premier's remarks
and that he had been prepared to step down at any time ever since he
assumed office Jan. 23.</P>
      <P>Hwang was ridiculed as a layman in economics by the newspapers
and billed as the shortest-lived economics minister in five decades,
with only 198 days on the job.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Coastal patrol agents of the outlying island
of Matsu have dispersed four Chinese vessels poaching in waters near
the island group since the start of a massive operation launched a
day earlier, a spokesman for the Matsu coastal patrol authorities
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, the authorities were acting on
tipoffs provided by local fishermen who said that increasing numbers
of fishing boats from China were illegally operating in waters near
the islands, which lie just off the coast of China's Fujian Province.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FISHING POLICE EMBARK ON PATROL MISSION IN ATLANTIC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Aug. 9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official Taiwan fishery training ship
embarked Wednesday on a six-month mission to police Taiwan vessels
and foreign ships operating in the Atlantic Ocean.</P>
      <P>The Yuhsun No. 2 -- authorized by the Coast Guard administration
and the Fisheries Administration under the Council of Agriculture
(COA) -- left the southern port city of Kaohsiung for the Atlantic
Ocean fishing grounds to monitor fishing boats operating there for
184 days to demonstrate Taiwan's determination to strengthen fishery
management on the high seas.</P>
      <P>It is the first time Taiwan has sent a fishing police vessel to
the Atlantic Ocean since the International Commission for the
Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT) late last year cut Taiwan's
total allowable bigeye tuna fishing quota and slashed the number of
Taiwan vessels allowed to operate in the Atlantic, said Sun
Chih-peng, director of the southern Taiwan operations of the
Fisheries Administration.</P>
      <P>Sun said police and ocean patrol officers aboard the vessel will
not only police Taiwan fishing boats operating in the Atlantic but
will also report their findings to the ICCAT authorities if they find
irregularities committed by other foreign fishing boats operating
there to jointly help maintain fishing order.</P>
      <P>The Yuhsun No. 2, which is expected to navigate nearly 30,000
nautical miles on the mission, is scheduled to return to Taiwan next
February.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Sun noted that operations to cut the number of Taiwan
tuna fishing boats is being continued, aiming at dismantling another
60 deep-sea fishing vessels by October this year and sinking another
50 into the seas surrounding the island to be used as artificial fish
culture reefs.</P>
      <P>Both measures are designed to help protect deep-sea fishery
resources and maintain sustainable fishing operations, Sun noted.</P>
      <P>More Taiwan fishing vessels will be allowed to return to the
Atlantic Ocean only if the ICCAT decides in its annual meeting, to be
held in November, that Taiwan has done a satisfactory job in curbing
its overfishing and helping replenish fishery resources, according to
Sun.</P>
      <P>The ICCAT cut Taiwan's total allowable bigeye tuna fishing quota
from 14,900 tons in 2005 to a mere 4,600 tons for 2006 because of
alleged overfishing by Taiwan vessels.</P>
      <P>The ICCA also allowed only 15 out of Taiwan's 60-strong bigeye
tuna fleet to continue their operations in the Atlantic Ocean for
2006 on a trial basis.</P>
      <P>The decision was made during the ICCAT's 19th regular meeting
held in Spain in late December 2005, after Japan proposed a quota
cut, citing overfishing by Taiwanese vessels.</P>
      <P>Most bigeye tuna caught by Taiwanese boats are sold to Japan. The
amount exported to Japan over the past two years has exceeded the
total yearly catch quota, prompting the charge of overfishing by the
Japanese.</P>

      <P>The Bureau of Tourism on Wednesday slapped a
fine of NT$150,000 (US$4,570) on a local travel agency who had a
dispute with a group of Chinese tourists it was hosting and took them
to the police.</P>
      <P>Tourism officials said the travel agent did not handle the matter
properly, resulting in damage to the nation's image.</P>
      <P>The officials urged all travel agents to learn a lesson and
to charge reasonable fees, instead of relying on commission from
colluding WITH shops and tourist spots.</P>
      <P>The officials said the incident, which took place Aug. 1, was the
result of the travel agency demanding an extra US$100 from the
tourists when it was settling the total bill.</P>
      <P>The Chinese leader of the 12-member group said he was not aware
that it was a shopping group, which is often charged a cheaper fee
and on which the travel agent makes up the losses from commissions
collected from the shopping stops, and refused to pay the Taiwan
travel agent any extra money when his group members did not buy
anything.</P>
      <P>The angry tourists said they wanted to return a day earlier,
whereupon the travel agent took them to the aviation police bureau at
the Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, claiming that the tourists
wanted to abscond. After questioning, police found the tourists had
no such intention.</P>
      <P>The tourists continued their scheduled itinerary after both sides
reached a settlement under mediation from the Travel Agent
Association of ROC, Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tourism officials said any discrepancy in regular fees should be
discussed between Taiwan travel agents and their Chinese counterparts
and should not concern the tourists.</P>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung city police announced Wednesday
that they have uncovered a phone "phreaking" ring and arrested five
suspects.</P>
      <P>Police said the ring was led by the 36-year-old mastermind
surnamed Kuo. The five suspects were nabbed after separate raids in
Taipei City, Kaohsiung City, Kaohsiung County and Pingtung County.
Also seized in the raids were 10 cell phones, nine cell phone SIM
cards, several computers and other tools used in gaining illegal
access to other people's phone systems.</P>
      <P>According to the police, the stolen phone numbers have been used
by other crime rings, including those based in China, to conduct
telephone fraud. The police are still tracing members of those rings.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, the ring managed to "steal" more than 10,000
phone numbers around the island, selling them to fraud rings in
Taiwan and China for NT$3,500 apiece.</P>
      <P>Initial investigations show that Kuo was in charge of making
contact with the ring's counterparts in China, while other members
were responsible for hacking into the telephone systems of
residential buildings at dawn when most people were asleep.</P>
      <P>Police warned local telephone subscribers to inform the telephone

Senator Lieberman, a national party leader and

to the senator said that Lieberman was emboldene

    <HEADLINE>NEW YORK'S HISTORIC PRESERVATION MOVEMENT SERVES AS EXAMPLE FOR TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The historic preservation movement in New
York serves as an excellent example for Taiwan, Taiwanese scholars
said after a videoconference with a preservation leader Wednesday
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Lee Chian-lang, a professor and historic buildings expert, and
Ma Yi-kung, a professor at National Tsing Hua University, exchanged
views and opinions with Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel, chairwoman
of the Historic Landmarks Preservation Center in a teleconference
hosted by the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT).</P>
      <P>The program, in conjunction with the Landmarks of New York photo
exhibition now on display at the National Taiwan Museum, aimed to
draw upon the experience of New York landmark preservation to tackle
the importance of cultural heritage and historic legacies for a
city or a country, while making progress toward the contemporary.</P>
      <P>"Among American cities, New York is the leader in the
preservation of its landmarks, and in the range and quality of its
surviving architectural resources," said Diamonstein-Spielvogel.</P>
      <P>"This year marks the 40th anniversary of the enactment of the New
York City Landmarks Preservation Law. Since its passage on April 19,
1965, the result of an awareness of the increasing loss of New York's
iconic historic, architectural and cultural monuments ... New York
City has been in the forefront of what has become an established
worldwide preservation movement," she said.</P>
      <P>New York boasts 1,118 landmarks, 104 interior landmarks, 9 scenic
landmarks and 84 historic districts.</P>
      <P>While New York preserves interior and scenic landmarks, it seems
Taiwan only preserves "buildings" -- although the awareness of
historic preservation in Taiwan has been making headway, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee also mentioned Taiwan should work on "minority
preservation," which the New York program paid attention to in
preserving some African burial grounds and aboriginal buildings.</P>
      <P>"The preservation of our landmarks provides a sense of continuity
between the past and present, and an appreciation of the
accomplishments that outlast an individual life, "
Diamonstein-Spielvogel said.</P>
      <P>Representatives from the Department of Cultural Affairs of Taipei
City and Taipei County asked about the problem of private property
with historic value.</P>
      <P>"It's a universal problem [dealing with private property],"
she answered. "We should educate the public and let them know that we
have only 'temporary custody' of the landmarks."</P>
      <P>For compensation, the U.S. government also offers tax breaks
for those who donate their private property, she added.</P>
      <P>However, Diamonstein-Spielvogel pointed out that designated
landmarks in New York's preservation program account for only less
than two percent of "the buildings, property or objects that are at
least thirty years old and have a special character, esthetic value
or meaning" -- New York's definition of a landmark.</P>
      <P>It means even New York has a long way to go, she said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A five-member Taiwanese delegation led by an
aboriginal legislator will depart for Japan Thursday in a second bid
to have the names of their ancestors who died as Japan's colonial
soldiers removed from Japan's national war shrine.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kao-Chin Su-mei and the group will file a lawsuit with
an Osaka court to have Yasukuni Shrine remove the names of their
ancestors, so that their spirits will not be worshipped along with
the spirits of Japanese war criminals.</P>
      <P>Another group, formed by 45 Taiwanese aborigines, will depart for
Japan Sunday to join a protest demonstration in Tokyo that will be
staged simultaneously with other demonstrations by some 3,000 people
in Taiwan, South Korea and Okinawa to express anger with Japanese
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's annual visits to the Yasukuni
Shrine.</P>
      <P>In June last year, Kao-Chin and fellow aborigines representing
nine tribes from Taiwan attempted to visit Yasukuni Shrine to take
their ancestors' tablets back to Taiwan, but were barred entry.</P>
      <P>The shrine also rejected their requests to perform religious
rituals on the property to call home the spirits of their ancestors.</P>
      <P>Japanese police even prevented the group from leaving their buses
on grounds they had to be separated from Japanese protesters to avoid
clashes. The Taiwanese group reportedly received death threats from
radical Japanese.</P>
      <P>Kao-Chin and other plaintiffs won a court case against Koizumi in
September last year when the Osaka High Court ruled that Koizumi had
violated the Japanese constitution by visiting Yasukuni Shrine.</P>
      <P>Since 2001, Koizumi's successive visits to the shrine have drawn
outrage from those countries that fought Japan during and before
World War II, because homage paid to war criminals is perceived as a
sign that Japan is still clinging to the same militarism that
prompted its aggression against other countries.</P>
      <P>Koizumi has insisted his visits to the shrine were made as a
private citizen.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) has lost its ability for self-examination as its members are
still trying to "consolidate the leadership" of scandal-ridden
President Chen Shui-bian, an opposition leader said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou made the remarks after
former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh published an open letter urging the
president, whom Shih called an "old comrade," to step down so the DPP
and Taiwan would have a future.</P>
      <P>Shih loves the DPP very much, and he has a special love for the
president, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"That's why he is urging the DPP to distance itself from the
president, but DPP members are acting in a strange way, making it a
rallying point that they must stand together to uphold the top
leadership."</P>
      <P>"Consolidating the top leadership" is a feudalistic term that
belongs to the era of Chiang Kai-shek, former leader of the KMT, and
yet the DPP is turning it into a precious motto, much to the surprise
of current KMT members, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"If the DPP insists on a practice the KMT has cast aside, it
means the DPP is losing its ability for self-reflection," he added.</P>
      <P>For the KMT, he said, "We should not rejoice in the DPP's chaos.
Rather, we must remind ourselves never to make a similar mistake."</P>

      <P>With the help and support of people around the island, the 36
participants -- ranging from 13 to 80 years of age -- completed the
1,100-kilometer journey, braving Taiwan's sultry summer temperatures,
two typhoons, heavy rains and the hustle and bustle of Suao Hualien
Highway.</P>
      <P>Chung Ting-mao, a professor of ecology at Providence University,
noted that the activity aims to call the public's attention to the
environment in which they live.</P>
      <P>According to Chung, the hardest part of the journey was not the
physical fatigue the walkers suffered, but witnessing the
contamination and destruction of the environment.</P>
      <P>Chung said Taiwan's environment is diverse and beautiful;
however, he lamented, the environment has been rapidly degraded due
to over-exploitation.</P>
      <P>Chung urged the public to leave nature in its original state,
while the government needs to stop developing high-energy consumption
industries such as steel refinery plants and naphtha cracker
projects, which also emit high quantities of greenhouse gases.</P>
      <P>He urged the government to abide by conclusions reached at the
country's first energy conference -- by reducing greenhouse gas
emissions and assuming its global responsibilities as a member of the
international community.</P>
      <P>The 80-year-old Chen Kuo-hen said he has come to understood more
about Taiwan's environmental problems from the trek, and promised to
do it again next year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SANYI WOOD-CARVING FESTIVAL TO SHOWCASE ARTWORK FROM ASIA, AFRICA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 2006 Sanyi Woodcarving Festival, one of
Taiwan's most important cultural festivals, begins Aug. 19 and is
designed to celebrate the beauty and diversity of woodcarving arts, a
Miaoli county government official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Peng Chi-shan, director of the Miaoli county government's
Cultural Affairs Bureau, announced at a news conference in Taipei
that the festival will take place in the county's Sanyi township.</P>
      <P>The festival, now in its 14th year, will showcase more than 200
works by woodcarvers from Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia,
Vietnam and 14 African countries, including Ghana and Mali, Peng
said.</P>
      <P>"This year's activities will feature exotic themes to promote
cultural exchanges with Asian and African countries," Peng said,
adding that noted woodcarving masters and craftsmen from those
countries have been invited to exhibit their work at the festival,
which runs until Aug. 27.</P>
      <P>With "metamorphosis and a happy life" as the festival's main
theme, Peng said that the festival's series of woodcarving
demonstrations and training programs will enable interested
individuals to experience the beauty of woodcraft and stimulate their
interest in the art.</P>
      <P>On opening day, Peng said, concerts and dance performances
showcasing Taiwan's ethnic and cultural diversity will take place
at the main exhibition site at Tzuchi parking lot on Sanyi's famous
Shuimei Street, which is dotted with numerous handicraft shops.</P>
      <P>Sanyi, a hilly township, has been known internationally as the
center of Taiwan's woodcarving and woodworking industry. Its streets
are perfumed with the fragrance of freshly cut sawdust.</P>
      <P>Along Shuimei Street's half-kilometer stretch, there are some 160
shops selling everything from trinkets to Buddhist statues and
furniture. Two other streets -- Sculpture South Street and Shuanghu
Old Sculpture Street -- form the heart of Sanyi's wood-carving and
woodworking industry, where carving tools designed by local sculptors
of olden days are shown on display.</P>
      <P>In 1995, the Miaoli Wood Sculpture Museum was established to
house sculptures by members of both aboriginal and Han groups in
Taiwan, and representing numerous ethnic traditions around the world.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's reliance on the vast Chinese
market increased further in the first half of this year, with 39.4
percent of its exports going to China and Hong Kong, the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a half-year analysis on Taiwan's global trade, the
Cabinet-level council also said Taiwan's trade surplus with China and
its special administrative region of Hong Kong amounted to US$29.41
billion during the six-month period, marking a 17.3 percent
year-on-year growth.</P>
      <P>All these numbers indicate that Taiwan has not obstinately
restricted commercial exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, CEPD
officials said.</P>
      <P>According to the CEPD report, Taiwan's exports picked up 16.7
percent in the January-June period from the year-earlier level, while
the ratio of its sales to China and Hong Kong surged to 39.4 percent
from 38.1 percent recorded a year earlier.</P>
      <P>During the same period, imports from China and Hong Kong spiked
15.5 percent and the ratio of imports from the two Chinese-speaking
societies advanced to 12.6 percent of the total.</P>
      <P>The CEPD report also said Taiwan's exports to the United States
posted a 10.8 percent gain in the first half of the year, with the
year-on-year growth rate topping 13.5 percent in the second quarter
and 7.9 percent in the first quarter.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Taiwan's imports from the United States declined 3.8
percent from the year-earlier level, which enabled Taiwan to enjoy a
trade surplus of US$4.92 billion, up 64.3 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>On trade with Europe, Taiwan recorded a 6.4 percent rise in sales
to European countries as a whole, with the annual growth rate
reaching 8.4 percent in the second quarter and 4.5 percent in the
first quarter. The CEPD report attributed the surge to
faster-than-expected economic growth in the euro zone.</P>
      <P>During the same period, Taiwan's imports from Europe dwindled 3.3
percent. As a result, Taiwan reaped a trade surplus of US$1.75
billion with the continent -- a figure nearly 1.7 times the amount
recorded in the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>Trade with major Southeast Asian countries, including Thailand,
Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia, also posted a
remarkable increase, with exports up 14.8 percent and imports up 15.9
percent. Taiwan raked in US$3.41 billion in trade surplus with its
Southeast Asian trade partners, up 11.4 percent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Taiwan aborigines led by
Legislator Kao Chin Su-mei left for Japan Thursday in a fresh attempt
to have the Japanese government remove the names of their ancestors
from a controversial shrine for war dead.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin said that she and the aboriginal representatives whose
ancestors were forced to fight for the Japanese Imperial Army during
World War II will file a new suit with a court in Osaka to have their
ancestors' names removed from the Yasukuni Shrine.</P>
      <P>They will also demand that the Japanese government set up a
committee to investigate the matter and make public the true version
of the historical episode, Kao Chin said.</P>
      <P>"The aborigines have the right to know how their ancestors died.
The Japanese government should not only offer a verbal apology but
also apologize with concrete actions," she said.</P>
      <P>Also, the legislator said she and the aboriginal representatives
will join more than 4,000 protesters from Korea and Japan in staging
a demonstration at the Yasukuni Shrine to demand that the names of 13
war criminals be removed from the shrine and that the shrine be
transformed into a "peace shrine."</P>
      <P>Kao Chin said they plan to return to Japan next year if the
Japanese government does not respond to their requests.</P>
      <P>Last year, the legislator also led an aboriginal delegation to
Japan for a similar purpose.</P>
      <P>She won a suit against Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi
in September 2005 when the Osaka High Court ruled that Koizumi had
violated the Japanese constitution by visiting the Yasukuni Shrine,
which is perceived by many as a symbol of Japanese militarism.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORCING PRESIDENT TO RESIGN COULD SPARK SOCIAL UNREST: LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ruling party lawmaker warned Thursday
that since Taiwan is a democratic country ruled by law, using
non-institutional means to force its president to resign could create
social turmoil and affect the daily life of the people.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yi-jin, secretary-general of the Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP) legislative caucus, issued the warning as former DPP
Chairman Shih Ming-teh was reportedly preparing to kick off a
high-profile signature-collecting drive to call for President Chen
Shui-bian to step down.</P>
      <P>Chen has been dogged by a series of corruption scandals involving
his family members and close aides, and now even he himself has
become embroiled in suspected irregularities revolving around
Presidential Office accounting reports on his use of a special "state
affairs fund" budgeted for his discretionary use.</P>
      <P>A businesswoman was listed as a suspect early Thursday after
being questioned by prosecutors investigating alleged use of "fake
invoices" to claim "state affairs" expenses.</P>
      <P>Shih, who calls himself an "old comrade" of Chen, published an
open letter Wednesday urging Chen to quit so that the DPP and Taiwan
"can have a future."</P>
      <P>Shih reportedly will stage a signature drive on Saturday at the
228 Peace Memorial Park near the Presidential Office to push for Chen
to step down, a campaign that influential figures from legal and
medical professions, political circles and other sectors of society
are expected to support.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that the nation's problems cannot be solved by the
resignation of the president, claiming that his resignation would
only increase social chaos and affect national security and that a
majority of the people agree social unrest would affect their daily
life.</P>
      <P>She urged Shih to "understand" that all these controversies over
the president's integrity and competency have been caused by
"political strife" and are not "legal issues."</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun has said that the president need not
step down as he has not violated the law.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) will restrict the production, import and sale of
mercury-containing batteries starting next month to reduce the
mercury hazard to the environment and human health, EPA officials
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Starting Sept. 1, battery manufacturers and importers must
present test reports proving that their products contain less than 5
ppm of mercury before they are permitted to manufacture or import the
products, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Also, battery sellers will be forbidden from selling or giving
away mercury-containing batteries that have not passed EPA
inspection, they said.</P>
      <P>After the new policy comes into force, the EPA will send
officials to inspect and sample batteries sold at supermarkets, night
markets and street vendors, with sellers to be subject to fines of up
to NT$6,000 (US$183.49) if their products are found to contain an
excessive level of mercury, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Manufacturers and importers violating the rule can be fined up to
NT$300,000 and ordered to recall their products, they added.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the new policy will help reduce the
circulation of an estimated 217 kg of mercury per year and that 254
kinds of mercury-containing batteries have so far been certified by
the EPA.</P>
      <P>According to the EPA, many countries around the world have
restricted or banned mercury-containing products in light of the
hazard they pose to the environment and human health.</P>
      <P>While Japan banned the production of mercury-containing batteries
in 1995, the European Union has recommended that its member nations

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  10  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui has
instructed the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) to get ready for the
possible resignation of President Chen Shui-bian, a TSU lawmaker said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-ming, who is also TSU secretary-general, quoted Lee as
saying that following former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Shih Ming-teh's call for Chen to step down, DPP members will
probably demand the same, so the TSU must be prepared for the
eventuality of the president resigning.</P>
      <P>In fact, according to Lo, Lee had told his followers in the TSU,
which considers Lee as its spiritual leader, to "get fully prepared"
last week for Chen's leaving the scene because "a regime that cannot
win the hearts of the people will not last long."</P>
      <P>The popularity of the president and his DPP has drastically
dropped in recent months as Chen has been dogged by a spate of
corruption charges against his family members and close aides.</P>
      <P>In recent days, the president himself has become embroiled in
suspected irregularities revolving around Presidential Office
accounting reports on his use of a special "state affairs fund."</P>
      <P>Lo quoted Lee as predicting that calls for Chen to step down will
rise within the DPP now that Shih has openly made the call and that
once his own party members begin demanding his head, the chances of
him resigning will become "quite great."</P>
      <P>If that should come to be, Lee said the TSU must do what it can
to help stabilize the domestic situation, according to Lo.</P>
      <P>Lee's main concern, Lo said, is that the pro-independence and
Taiwan-sovereignist political forces must remain in power, so the TSU
must do all it can to "retain the ruling power of a sovereignist
regime."</P>
      <P>The TSU is an ally of the DPP in the "pan-green camp," as opposed
to the Kuomintang and the People First Party, which form the
"pan-blue alliance."</P>

      <P>The Taipei District Court ruled Thursday
that Taipei City Councilor Wang Yu-cheng and his assistants should
pay a total of NT$3.25 million in compensation to 46 food vendors
affected by his falsified claim that some vendors in the city used
funeral offerings to prepare food for sale.</P>

were true evidence to back up his claim violated established
morality, and such dishonest behavior is not protected by the
liability immunity enjoyed by city councilors for their speeches.</P>
      <P>In June last year, Wang released film images that he said
supported his claim that workers at city government-run funeral
parlors were reselling funeral offerings as food ingredients to

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 10 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Government auditors felt "great pressure"
when they visited the Presidential Office in June to examine its
allegedly questionable accounting records, the National Audit
Office's (NAO) spokesman said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wang Yung-hsing said when a group of auditing officials went to
the Presidential Office June 28, they discovered Hyatt Hotel invoices
that were suspected to have been used to claim the president's
special "state affairs" expenses.</P>
      <P>The president's staff tried to show them three envelopes whose
contents the staff claimed "showed what we have done which cannot be
disclosed, and so we used Hyatt Hotel invoices for accounting
purposes."</P>
      <P>The auditors, unsure of the connection between the "secret"
contents in the three envelopes and the accounting books, left
without seeing what was inside the envelopes, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Even though the Presidential Office staff would not allow
auditors to take a look at half the files and receipts they asked
for, they still found "suspicious" receipts worth more than NT$10
million (US$0.3 million).</P>
      <P>There was no record of what the sums shown on the receipts were
used for, he explained, adding that the presidential staff simply
replied "I forgot" when asked how this money had been spent.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the Presidential Office improve its staff's
ability to manage and record the use of public funds.</P>
      <P>Wang complained that when the auditors asked to make a photocopy
of some receipts for further analysis, Presidential Office officials
refused.</P>
      <P>To fulfill their official duties, he added, the auditors then
asked the presidential staff to fill in forms with the serial numbers
of Hyatt Hotel receipts and Sogo Department Store vouchers -- another
source of controversy over the first family's integrity.</P>
      <P>The auditors asked Presidential Office officials to fill in the
serial numbers of all Hyatt Hotel invoices, but they provided only
numbers of those kept in the accounting office, refusing to provide
information about those kept in the president's office, according to
Wang.</P>
      <P>As regards the Sogo vouchers, Cho Jung-tai, deputy
secretary-general to the president, filled in only the numbers of
five batches which Cho had shown earlier to the press, although it
was evident the Presidential Office was in possession of additional
Sogo vouchers.</P>
      <P>He would not go into details about these "other" vouchers on
grounds they are currently being investigated by the prosecution.</P>
      <P>In spite of efforts to carry out the auditing as required by law,
Wang said some critics still suspected his colleagues of being
"pro-pan-blue alliance" and betting their future on the election of
Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou as president in 2008.</P>
      <P>In response to the criticism, he said, "This is the most
ridiculous joke I've ever heard."</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHANGHUA DUCK FARMERS WANT GOVERNMENT AID OVER DIOXIN POLLUTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of duck farmers from Changhua
county in central Taiwan demanded Thursday that the government set up
a task force to help cope with the aftermath of an incident involving
dioxin pollution that occurred in late 2004.</P>
      <P>The group of farmers issued the appeal at a coordination meeting
held by opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker Lin Chan-ming and
Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU) lawmaker Chen Ching-ting.
Officials from the Executive Yuan, the Council of Agriculture (COA)
and the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) were also
invited to take part.</P>
      <P>The Changhua duck farmers complained about the government's
failure to set forth a concrete solution to help them overcome their
difficulties when they were forced to stop raising ducks and destroy
all duck eggs after a case of dioxin pollution broke out in Hsiensi
township in late 2004.</P>
      <P>According to the duck farmers, the Changhua County Government did
not come up with a compensation package until September 2005, when it
offered farmers NT$12 per duck by requiring them not to raise any
during a four-month period.</P>
      <P>But they pointed out that the government did not continue
offering monetary compensation as required by law at a time when
farmers were allowed to begin raising ducks again in July this year,
they said, adding that the central government should also grant the
local government the right to make environmental impact assessments.</P>
      <P>Chen asked the government whether the dioxin pollution has now
been fully eradicated in Hsiensi township, whether it is safe to eat
duck meat and eggs and if duck farmers are leading a satisfactory
life.</P>
      <P>Chen also suggested that the government establish a task force to
carry out monthly inspections of duck farms and nearby sources of

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office denied Thursday
that the presidential staff had placed any pressures on National
Audit Office (NAO) officials or refused their requests to check files
related to their auditing inspection in June.</P>
      <P>NAO spokesman Wang Yung-hsing said the auditors felt "great
pressure" when they visited the Presidential Office June 28 to
examine its allegedly questionable accounting records.</P>
      <P>Wang complained that when auditors asked to make a photocopy of
some receipts for further analysis, the president's staff refused.
The prosecution is probing whether the allegedly illegal receipts
have been used to claim special "state affairs" expenses.</P>
      <P>A presidential staff member explained that the request was turned
down because the receipts NAO officials tried to photocopy involved
"classified information."</P>
      <P>Although the Presidential Office refused to allow a photocopy
to be made, it did permit the auditors to examine the sensitive
receipts, the staff member said.</P>
      <P>In fact, he noted, the Presidential Office was quite cooperative
with NAO officials and "absolutely did not put any pressure on them."</P>
      <P>As to why they still felt pressure, he said it might have been
caused by the two sides' different understandings of the institution and that
the Presidential Office hopes to narrow these differences by building
a more transparent mechanism.</P>

      <P>More office workers are looking for
outsourced jobs in an attempt to supplement their income as consumer
prices in the country continue to rise, an online employment service
provider said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Tien Chu-cheng, the manager of an outsource jobs Web
site operated by 104 Job Bank, the number of job-seeking members on
the site increased 6.3 percent in July compared to June, with as many
as 75 percent of job-seekers being office workers looking for
moonlighting opportunities.</P>
      <P>The number of outsourced jobs available in July also saw a 6.3
percent increase, with job openings in the category of "animated

percent, Tien said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Government Information Office Minister
Cheng Wen-tsang expressed hope Thursday that several legislators and
a rap singer could reach an out of court settlement in a defamation
lawsuit.</P>
      <P>Cheng made the remarks after the leader of a rap band was
indicted by the Taipei Prosecutor's Office on charge of damaging the
reputation of several legislators in his songs.</P>
      <P>The singer, Jeff Huang, argued he was only expressing
dissatisfaction over a proposal by several legislators to amend
copyright laws in 2003, which if passed would have allowed artists to
receive some compensation for their work when downloaded by clients
at legal download Web sites, while operators would also have to pay a
certain percentage of their benefits to copyright holders.</P>
      <P>Huang found the Web sites' compensation "trivial, " claiming such
Web sites infringe artists' intellectual property rights.</P>
      <P>Last year, a not-guilty ruling by the court on the music download
Web site ezPeer ignited Huang's fury. Huang then composed a song in
which he directly named those legislators, saying they were bribed by
Web site operators and therefore "murdering" Taiwan's music industry.</P>
      <P>In response to Huang's lyrics, the legislators, including former
legislator Chiu Yi-ying, who is now a deputy head of the Council for
Hakka Affairs, decided to sue Huang for damages to their reputation.</P>
      <P>Noting the amendment proposal was aimed at protecting artists'
intellectual property rights, Legislator Lu Hsueh-chang said Huang
can express his difference of opinion in this regard but it is
inappropriate for him to criticize the legislators in such a
"radical" way.</P>
      <P>For his part, Cheng said establishing legal download Web sites is
the government's set policy, which he said is a "benign development
in the music industry."</P>
      <P>He urged people in all social quarters to discuss the proposed
legal amendment with peace and patience.</P>

      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has

official due to the current cross-Taiwan Strait relations following
the breaking of Taiwan-Chad diplomatic relations, a party spokesman
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, deputy director of the KMT Policy Coordination

the government has made it clear that Beijing must apologize to
Taiwan over the Chad issue before Chen Yunlin, head of the Communist

Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Wednesday that the public must not

    <HEADLINE>NICARAGUA WILL HONOR COOPERATIVE PROJECTS WITH TAIWAN: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 10 (CNA)
(By Ada Tsai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A foreign ministry official said Thursday
that regardless of which candidate wins Nicaragua's next presidential
election, the country's cooperative projects with Taiwan will be
honored.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Michel Lu was
responding to media reports that if the Sandinista National
Liberation Front (SNLF), Nacaragua's opposition party, wins the Nov.
5 presidential election, the Central American country will switch
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.</P>
      <P>The reports quoted an SNLF National Assembly member as saying in
late June that if the presidency is won by Daniel Ortega, the SNLF
secretary-general who is also the party's candidate for the upcoming
presidential election, China will send a high-level delegation to
attend his inauguration in preparation for resumption of bilateral
diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the reports, Lu said that since Nicaragua is now a
democracy, the election results will logically have an impact on the
country's major policies.</P>
      <P>"The MOFA will keep a close watch on developments in Nicaragua,
particularly the platforms and policy goals of its various political
parties. And we are convinced that whoever wins the Nicaraguan
presidency will not neglect or ignore the many cooperative projects
with Taiwan, as well as Taiwanese investments in the country," Lu
said.</P>
      <P>Nicaragua's diplomatic relationship with the Republic of China
dates back to the 1930s, but the country switched its diplomatic
recognition to the People's Republic of China in 1985. In 1990,
Nicaragua resumed diplomatic ties with the ROC and has since
maintained close cooperation with Taiwan in many fields, from
agriculture, education, public health to infrastructure construction.</P>

      <P>The Government Information Office (GIO)
backed the Taiwan Public Television Service (PTS) Thursday in its
decision to broadcast Major League baseball matches in which New York
Yankee's Taiwanese pitcher Wang Chien-ming plays a major role.</P>
      <P>GIO Director-General Cheng Wen-tsan said Wang, who has posted 13
wins in the 2006 season, is "Taiwan's pride" and that the government
fully supports PTS broadcasting games in which he pitches.</P>
      <P>Cheng claimed that it serves public interests better for PTS to
broadcast Yankees games because any baseball games televised live
will not be interrupted by commercials.</P>
      <P>PBS was criticized earlier this week for paying expensive
television rights fees to focus the limelight on Wang, while not
paying enough attention to local baseball.</P>
      <P>PBS defended itself, saying it did so because of a need to serve
the public interest.</P>
      <P>Wang, 26, a second-year starting pitcher for the Yankees, has
earned the status of a "top 10" pitcher in the American League of
Professional Baseball. His record of 13 wins and four losses this
season ties him with four other pitchers for the second highest
number of wins in Major League baseball.</P>
      <P>Wang is the third Taiwanese recruited into the Major League but
is apparently the most successful. The others are Dodgers outfielder
Chin-Feng Chen and Rockies pitcher Chin-hui Tsao.</P>

Wall Street Journal: Diplomatic Moves, Rice
Pushes Envoys To Spend Time In Hardship Posts

The Bush administration is pushing a very
grass-roots diplomacy to make up for the
diplomatic damage done by the Iraq war and to
try and leave the U.S. better positioned to
respond to -- and possibly even pre-empt --
conflagrations of the future. Instead of
dictating terms from on high, the administration
is trying to nudge along reforms from below,
often far from national capitals. And that, goes
the new logic, requires making the U.S.
diplomatic corps more agile and less hemmed in
by the high walls and bureaucracies of the
traditional embassy. Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice has quietly made the push a
central plank of the administration's
second-term drive to promote ground-level change
in some of the world's remotest nooks and
crannies.</TEXT>

      <P>Police in the southern city of Chiayi
cracked a robbery ring Wednesday night, arresting four men who are

Chiayi area.</P>
      <P>According to the police, the victims had reported that the

armed with black handguns and knifes. The group was described as
having committed the robberies "with military precision."</P>
      <P>After two recent household robberies July 2 and July 20, police

as the suspected ringleader.</P>
      <P>Led by Tsao Ho-yi, a prosecutor from the Chiayi Public
Prosecutor's Office, police arrested Tsai and the other members of
the ring -- Hsu Huan-kai, 36; Yang Ying-chan, 24; and Huang Yi-hau,
19 -- and seized three handguns and four samurai swords.</P>
      <P>They were immediately referred to the Chiayi Public Prosecutor's
Office.</P>
      <P>A police spokesman said the ring members divided the work among
themselves and even used rehearsals to sharpen their team
effectiveness.</P>

      <P>Administrators at Chiang Kai-shek (CKS)
International Airport, Taiwan's main gateway, decided Thursday to set
up a special boarding area for aircraft bound for the United States
and the United Kingdom to facilitate security inspections for their
passengers.</P>
      <P>The airport administration announced the new measure after
British police uncovered a suspected terrorist plot earlier in the
day to blow up trans-Atlantic flights in mid-air.</P>
      <P>Besides tightening overall security measures at the airport, a
special boarding area has been designated for aircraft bound for the
U.S. and the U.K., CKS Airport officials said.</P>
      <P>In addition to receiving normal security inspections, passengers
bound for the U.K. and the U.S. will be required to undergo another
round of security inspections, inclduing carry-on luggage and body
inspections, at the special boarding zone prior to getting aboard the
aircraft.</P>
      <P>According to the newest U.K. security requirements, passengers

British police uncovered the alleged terrorist plot to bomb aircraft
out of the sky.
</P>
      <P>In some of the tightest restrictions ever placed on air

    <HEADLINE>APPEAL FOR CONTINUED DETENTION OF TDC SUSPECTS REJECTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court rejected Thursday a
third appeal by prosecutors against a lower court ruling that freed
on bail three indicted insider trading suspects, including President
Chen Shui-bian's son-in-law Chao Chien-ming.</P>
      <P>The disapproval marked a dramatic departure from the high court's
previous views. In its response to the prosecutors' two previous
appeals, the high court rescinded the Taipei District Court's bail
ruling for the three suspects in the Taiwan Development Corp. (TDC)
stock insider trading scandal and demanded it take a second look at
the case.</P>
      <P>In its latest ruling, the high court argued that the three
suspects do not warrent a "preventive detention" mandated in Article
101 of the Code of Criminal Procedure that says the accused may be
detained after examination if there are facts sufficient to justify
an apprehension that they may abscond, or destroy, forge or alter
evidence, or conspire with a co-offender or witness.</P>
      <P>As to whether the trio meet the requirements for continued
detention in congruent with conditions set forth for those facing
felony charges, the high court said it's up to the discretion of the
district court.</P>
      <P>Since the district court has explained in detail why it sees no
need to continue holding the three suspecs in custody, the high court
said the Taipei Prosecutor's Office's defiance against the lower
court's bail ruling lacks justification.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the high court went on, prosecutors have concluded
investigations and indicted the three suspects after having held more
than 150 hearings in which the three suspects and numerous witnessed
had been subpoenaed and cross-examined.</P>
      <P>On prosecutors' argument that if Chao remains free, he may
collude with other suspects or witnesses to confront or overturn the
insider trading charge, the high court contended that should that be
the case, prosecutors would have been guilty of malfeasance for
failing to get to the bottom before indicting the suspects.</P>
      <P>Under the current criminal procedure system, the high court
continued that prosecutors can cross-examine witnesses after they
make direct testimonies. If witnesses make false testimonies, they
will face perjury charges.</P>
      <P>As to prosecutors' misgivings that Chao may jump bail or flee the
country because he purchased a flight ticket to Japan when the TDC
scandal just came to light, the high court said although Chao indeed
had a Japan-bound ticket dated May 20, he also booked a seat for
return five days later.</P>
      <P>Given Chao's high-profile status, the high court claimed that
it's hardly possible for Chao to flee abroad.</P>
      <P>On the prosecuttors' argument that the bail amounts for two
accomplices -- businessman Yu Shih-yi and former TDC Chairman Su
Teh-chien -- are disproportionate to the profits from their illegal
stock trading, the high court said there have been no established
bail amount calculating formula.</P>
      <P>Noting that bail is neither damages nor fines, the high court
said the main purpose of bail deposits is to ensure smooth proceeding
of follow-up judicial procedures.</P>
      <P>Claiming the bail amounts demanded by the lower court for the two
suspects are not below the average figure, the high court said that
judging from the fact that the defendants have consistently appeared
in court on time so far, it sees no flaws in the lower court's ruling
on bail amounts.</P>
      <P>The high court made the ruling in response to the prosecutors'
Aug. 7 appeal seeking to have the three suspects, or Chao in
particular, detained again on the ground that their crime warrants
continued detention in line with existing legal provisions.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors formally indicted Chao and the two accomplices July
10 on charges of using insider information to profit from TDC stock
dealings. In the indictment, prosecutors recommended that Chao and
former TDC Chairman Su Teh-chien be sentenced to eight years behind
bars, with 10 years for businessman You Shih-yi.</P>
      <P>In the evening of that same day, Chao and You were freed on NT$10
million bail and Su on NT$5 million bail.</P>
      <P>The prosecutor's office appealed to the high court July 14,
seeking to have the trio detained once again. In response to the
first appeal, the high court ruled July 17 that the lower court had
to review the case again because its previous decision was flawed.</P>
      <P>In its second ruling issued July 20, the district court stuck to
its decision on allowing the trio to remain free, but raised bail for
Chao to NT$17 million from the original NT$10 million, while
maintaining that bail for the other two suspects should remain the
same at NT$10 million and NT$5 million, respectively.</P>
      <P>The prosecutor's office re-appealed the case July 26 to try to
have the trio detained again. On July 28, the high court rescinded
the district court's second ruling and demanded a further review.</P>
      <P>On July 31, the district court upheld its second ruling on
allowing the trio to remain free on bail.</P>
      <P>In is third appeal, the prosecutor's office rebutted the district
court's argument that as insider trading suspects are normally
unlikely to repeat their illegal stock trading practice once their
case are exposed, they need not be detained in the wake of their
indictment.</P>
      <P>Quoting the Criminal Procedure Law, the prosecutor's office said
that any suspect who faces a recommendation of five years behind bars
can be kept in custody pending trial regardless whether he or she is
likely to repeat previous criminal acts.</P>
      <P>In the TDC case, the prosecutor's office argued that as all the
three suspects deserve a minimum seven-year prison term, the high
court should invalidate the district court's bail ruling.</P>
      <P>While granting bail, the district court banned the trio from
leaving the country or changing residence without due notice.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP URGES FORMER CHAIRMAN NOT TO PUSH FOR PRESIDENT'S OUSTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on
Friday urged its former chairman Shih Ming-teh not to target
President Chen Shui-bian and set his ouster as the only criterion in
examining the ruling party.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Tsai Huang-liang made the remarks one day after
Shih, who served as DPP chairman between 1994 and 1996 before
quitting the party in 2000, said he will gauge public opinion by
launching a "one million citizens to oust President Chen" fundraising
drive to see how badly the people want the resignation of President
Chen, who has been dogged by a series of corruption and embezzlement
scandals implicating his family members and senior aides.</P>
      <P>Shih, often called "the Nelson Mandela of Taiwan" after a 25-year
imprisonment for his dedication to the democratic movement, also said
that if the target of one million donors can be reached within one
month, the campaign to depose Chen will be launched Sept. 9 with
daily sit-ins by protesters in front of the Presidential Office. If
the target of one million can be achieved sooner, the campaign will
also start to roll earlier than planned, according to Shih.</P>
      <P>"The DPP holds Shih in great esteem, and the party will seriously
address his recent move, " Tsai said, referring to Shih's recent
letter to the president urging him to step down. In the letter, Shih
also criticized Chen for blatantly embracing major businesspeople,
saying that it was a step toward his downfall and that he has lost
the trust of the public.</P>
      <P>Tsai expressed the hope that Shih will not use President Chen's
resignation as the only criterion in examining the party.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that trust among people is currently weak due to
long-term political rivalry, and he called for officials and
politicians to show restraint instead of fueling restive sentiment.</P>
      <P>"We should not ask whether President Chen will step down or not,
but instead ask what he can do during his remaining years in office,"
Tsai added.</P>
      <P>"The DPP is willing to work with Shih and all others who
criticize the DPP administration, " Tsai said, stressing that
"discussing what Chen can still do for society and constitutional
reform is more significant than discussing who should step down and
who should succeed."</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Kuan Bi-ling also said the party "will not
condone" any irregularities in the administration.</P>
      <P>"However, the current three-stage mode of making sensational
allegations, inciting public discontent and launching social
movements to oust President Chen will only cause further social
divisions and animosity," she added.</P>
      <P>Kuan called for the use of methods within the framework of the
nation's system to solve controversial issues.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP PLANNING SLANDER SUIT AGAINST KMT LEGISLATOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  11 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said Friday that legal action is being planned against
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Chiu Yi over his allegations
that President Chen Shui-bian had maintained a secret bank account to
launder money.</P>
      <P>Dismissing the allegations as "total nonsense" based on gossip
and misleading information, DPP spokesman Tsai Huang-liang said a
slander suit will be filed against Chiu as soon as lawyers decide on
whether the DPP or Chen himself should make the move.</P>
      <P>At issue is Chiu's claim that Chen had a secret account at the
Taishin International Bank from 2002 to 2004 which he said was used
by the president to receive "unlawful donations" from businesses and
that the account had a balance of more than NT$190 million (US$5.82
million) when it was closed in May 2004, with some of the money
having been remitted overseas.</P>
      <P>Also, the legislator claimed that Chen's daughter, Chen Hsin-yu,
had remitted NT$2 million into the account after receiving the amount
of money from her husband, Chao Chien-ming, who was charged with
insider trading of Taiwan Development Corp. (TDC) stocks last month.</P>
      <P>Chiu said he suspects that Chao was only a middleman who was
helping Chen launder money, and he urged investigative authorities to
start a probe into the president.</P>
      <P>Showing a transaction statement of the account in question
Friday, Tsai said the account was opened only on Jan. 5, 2004 to
receive donations for Chen's second presidential campaign and had
only a balance of NT$1.7 million when it was closed on April 1 the
same year.</P>
      <P>In addition, Tsai clarified that neither the president's daughter
nor his son has remitted any money to the account, nor was any money
from the account remitted overseas.</P>
      <P>He said that the account was taken charge of by a financial
management committee during Chen's presidential campaign and that its
operation did not violate the Political Donations Law or the law
governing the asset disclosure of public functionaries.</P>
      <P>Also Friday, Chiu challenged the DPP to present the passbook of
the account instead of showing some transaction statement which he
said is "insufficient to prove anything."</P>
      <P>Chiu claimed he has managed to trace 16 secret remittances with a
total amount of NT$170 million in the account and that there are
other more suspicious remittances.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Bureau of Investigation's Money Laundering
Prevention Center has referred the case to the Public Prosecutors'
Office of the Taiwan High Court for investigation, Chiu said the
authorities would not have done so if the account had been a clean
one.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER DPP CHAIR CANNOT LEGALLY ACCEPT DONATIONS AS AN INDIVIDUAL: MOI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Shih Ming-teh is not eligible according to
the law to accept political donations in his planned fundraising
campaign, an official of the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Huang Li-hsin, director of MOI's Department of Civil Affairs,
made the remarks one day after Shih, who served as DPP chairman
betweeen 1994-1996 before quitting the party in 2000, said he will
soon launch a "one million citizens to oust President Chen"
fundraising drive to gauge the level of support among the people to
depose Chen, who has been dogged by a series of corruption and
embezzlement allegations implicating his family members and senior
aides.</P>
      <P>Huang, together with Tseng Chung-ming, director of the MOI's
Department of Social Affairs, said in a news conference held at the
ministry that such fundraising is governed by the public interest
donation statute as well as the political donation law.</P>
      <P>According to Article 3 of the statute governing donation for
public interest purposes, such fundraising activities must be
initiated by a group or organization.</P>
      <P>Huang said that according to the statute, donations collected in
the name of the public interest are to be used for social welfare or
humanitarian assistance, and not for political or religious
activities.</P>
      <P>Shih's planned campaign clearly falls into the category of
political activities and should be governed by the political donation
law, Huang said, citing Article 5 of the law as stating that only
political parties, political groups or candidates running in
elections can accept such donations.</P>
      <P>"As Shih is not a candidate in any election, he should not accept
political donations as an individual," Huang said.</P>
      <P>If Shih insists on pushing forward with his plan, he will be in
violation of the law, Huang said, adding that anyone found guilty of
violating the law must return all the funds collected and pay a fine
equal to the total amount collected.</P>
      <P>Shih, often called "the Nelson Mandela of Taiwan" after a 25-year
imprisonment for his dedication to the democratic movement, said
Thursday that a bank account will be opened to accept donations from
Aug. 14.</P>
      <P>If the target of one million donors can be reached within one
month, the campaign to depose Chen will be launched Sept. 9 with
daily sit-ins by protesters in front of the Presidential Office. If
the target of one million can be achieved sooner, the campaign will
also start to roll earlier than planned, according to Shih.</P>

    <HEADLINE>IBM CALLS FOR TAIWAN PARTICIPATION IN GLOBAL GRID PROJECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 11 (CNA)
(By Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>International information technology giant
IBM has launched a non-profit project with the collaborative efforts
of several renowned institutions in the United States by utilizing
the capacity of the World Community Grid to facilitate cancer
research.</P>
      <P>The company's Taiwan branch said Friday that it hopes as many
Taiwanese as possible can join the grid computing effort, called the
"Help Defeat Cancer" project, to further accelerate the research
process.</P>
      <P>The researchers have begun analyzing breast cancer and will soon
proceed to evaluating protein and molecular expression patterns in
head and neck cancers, according to the company.</P>
      <P>The World Community Grid, initiated in 2004 by IBM and 213
partners, is dedicated to humanitarian research. To date, the project
has already arranged research efforts in several areas, including a
"Smallpox Research Grid, " the "Human Proteome Folding Project, "
"FightAIDS@Home, " as well as the most recent "Help Defeat Cancer" --
which has been organized by IBM, the Cancer Institute of New Jersey,
Rutgers University and the University of Pennsylvania.</P>
      <P>The "Help Defeat Cancer" project has adopted a newly developed
investigative technique, called tissue microarray, to compare
therapies and combinations of treatments against various kinds of
cancers and cancer subclasses, in order to prescribe optimal courses
of treatment to cancer patients.</P>
      <P>Through the use of the tissue microarray technique, researchers
can now simultaneously examine specimens totaling up to 2,000 on a
single biopsy slide. Meanwhile, arrays can also be digitized for
computer-assisted cross-examination.</P>
      <P>An IBM research fellow explained that within a general category
of cancer, there are a number of subclasses, each of which requires a
specific treatment or a combination of treatments. Although the
introduction of tissue microarrays has facilitated the biopsy
process, running interactive evaluations amongst tissue microarray
samples and cancer therapies is still beyond human ability or the
capacity of a single super-computer, he added.</P>
      <P>Grid computing is thus required to manage such an enormous task,
he said, adding that by pooling unused computer time of millions of
single users around the globe, the World Community Grid can complete
in a single day computations that would take a single computer
running continuously for 130 years to complete.</P>
      <P>According to IBM tallies, 209,278 members with 385,031 computing
machines have joined the World Community Grid to date, generating a
run time totaling 51,760 years.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan market for information and
communications technology (ICT) hardware, software and services will
see growth of less than 5 percent in 2006, according to a report
released by the International Data Corp. (IDC) Friday.</P>
      <P>The report said growth momentum is lacking in the Taiwan market
mainly because the market is mature and saturated, while many
contract high-tech manufacturers have moved to China.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan's business application software and business
intelligence products posted total sales of US$71 million and US$10.8
million, respectively, in 2005, the market for these products is
expected to expand slightly by 1.1 percent in 2006, the report said.</P>
      <P>Educational institutions were the major clients of the personal
computer market in 2005 and the government's measures to stimulate
domestic demand also helped encourage businesses to replace and
upgrade their computer systems, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Sales of notebook computers were boosted by promotional packages
offered by manufacturers such as Acer, Asus and HP in 2005, with the
shipments of notebook computers 30 percent higher than that of
personal computers in the third quarter of 2005, according to the
report.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's fixed-line telecommunications services saw a 2.9 percent
growth in 2004 and sales of the traditional telephone service market
did not decline despite the popularity of mobile phones and Internet
telephones, the report said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's mobile phone penetration rate stood at 92.5
percent in 2005, while the launch of 3G services is expected to
further boost the penetration rate, the report said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The spokeswoman for former Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Shih Ming-teh's "one person, NT$100"
campaign to call for President Chen Shui-bian's resignation claimed
Friday that the fundraising activity is not breaking any law.</P>
      <P>Ho De-fen, professor emeritus of National Taiwan University, was
responding to a Ministry of the Interior (MOI) official's claim that
because Shih was not a candidate in any elections, he cannot use his
name to raise political donations.</P>
      <P>The MOI official was hinting that it would be illegal for Shih to
collect a targeted NT$100 million (US$3.06 million) for what he calls
a "one million people to topple the president" drive.</P>
      <P>Shih is scheduled to kick off the campaign Saturday at Taipei's
228 Peace Memorial Park.</P>
      <P>Ho said the NT$100 (US$3.06) contribution is a "registration fee"
for joining the campaign, not a donation for somebody to engage in a
political activity.</P>
      <P>Some critics said the fund-raising drive might be violating the
law governing the collection of charity donations, but Ho pointed
out that the campaign is not a charity and that there is no
"institutional person" in charge of the movement.</P>
      <P>The NT$100 contributions from the people would be used to pay for
food and drinks and cleaning the proposed sit-ins, she pointed out,
noting that it would mean an individual citizen's commitment and
authorization in support of the campaign.</P>
      <P>Ho said the organizers will hire professional accountants to keep
tabs on how the public donations are used and an auditing report will
be made available on the Internet every day.</P>
      <P>She said that if indeed 1 million people stage a sit-in, NT$100
million will not be enough to keep the activity going. If there
should be surplus, it will be donated to schools to help pay for poor
children's lunches, she added.</P>
      <P>The spokeswoman said that she and other organizers had studied
relevant laws and concluded that no laws will be broken if they urge
the public to make a NT$100 donation. She added that the three
account numbers that will be used to receive people's contributions
are: Changhua Bank Tucheng Branch #9283-51-41111-700; Union Bank
#0049-10-0002991; and Post Office Remittance #19990461 -- all under

late Thursday for allegedly smuggling in illicit drugs worth millions

Administration (CGA) said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, the suspect, surnamed Tsai, was
arrested by CGA agents at the Chiang Kai-shek International Airport
when he was found to have brought in 2.695 kg of heroin hidden in a
bottle of powdered milk. The drugs have a market value of millions of
dollars in Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>The CGA agents were acting on a tipoff provided by an informant
who revealed that Tsai had been hired by a criminal ring to bring in
drugs from the Philippines, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>According to the informant, the criminal ring usually employs
individual tourists -- different people each time -- to act as mules.</P>
      <P>Tsai claimed that he had no idea the heroin was concealed in the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
lawmakers displayed their full support for President Chen Shui-bian
Friday amid mounting pressure from all walks of life demanding that
he step down amid many corruption allegations involving his family
members and close aides.</P>
      <P>The demonstration of their loyalty came one day after former DPP
Chairman Shih Ming-teh declared that he will launch a national
campaign to oust Chen "for the sake of Taiwan's future."</P>
      <P>Shih also said that Vice President Annette Lu is one of the key
factors as to whether the campaign will succeed because many people
are terrified of the idea of Lu being put in charge of state affairs,
out of fear of her radical pro-Taiwan independence stance.</P>
      <P>However, DPP lawmaker Huang Wei-cher claimed that DPP members are
not fearful of Lu and that most of the party's members still support
Chen.</P>
      <P>"Unless new evidence is found showing Chen's clear involvement in
any allegation, DPP members will continue to support the president, "
Huang said.</P>
      <P>According to DPP lawmaker Cheng Yun-peng, the government is
operating in line with the constitutional system rather than with
personal preference. The question of whether Chen should step down or
stay on must be determined by constitutional practices, he contended.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Huang Chien-hui said that all the corruption
allegations that have surfaced so far are unrelated to Chen
personally and he argued that there is no need for Chen to quit the
presidency to take responsibility for the allegations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NUMBER OF GUEST HOUSES INCREASES BY 42% ANNUALLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 11 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As of June, there were 1,755 guest houses
around Taiwan, representing growth of 42.2 percent over the same
month of last year, according to statistics released Friday by the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>A DGBAS official said that as the government has been encouraging
tourism and extending assistance, the number of beds and breakfasts
has also increased rapidly during the last few years.</P>
      <P>Among the 1,755 guest houses, 1,426 have obtained government
permission offering a total of 5,773 rooms.</P>
      <P>The statistics also show that as of June, the number of
world-class and ordinary hotels on the island reached 60 and 28,
respectively, offering 21,486 rooms and representing a slight growth
of 3.5 percent over June of last year.</P>
      <P>The average price for one night in a Taiwan hotel was NT$3,125
(US$95), according to the statistics.</P>
      <P>The official noted that most of the country's guest houses are in
Hualien County, Nantou County and Yilan County.</P>
      <P>In Hualien County alone, there are already 343 guest houses,
showing an annual increase of 57.3 percent.</P>
      <P>The official went on that although the number of rooms offered by
guest houses lags behind the number offered by tourist hotels, the
rise of guest houses around the island still poses a considerable
threat to tourist hotels.</P>
      <P>For example, the occupancy rate in tourist hotels averaged 69
percent in the first six months of this year, representing a decrease
of 2.1 percent over the same period of last year, the official added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Severance of official ties with Chad will
not affect Taiwan's campaign to join the United Nations, a senior
Taiwan official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Andrew Hsia, representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office (TECO) in New York, said Taiwan will keep telling the U.N.
that it is determined to be part of the U.N. family in spite of its
recent break-off of ties with Chad.</P>
      <P>Hsia was scheduled to hold a press conference later in the day to
announce which of Taiwan's remaining 24 allies will sponsor a motion
for the U.N. General Assembly to discuss Taiwan's participation.</P>
      <P>This year, Taiwan's U.N. campaign will focus on the theme of
"UN-HUMAN" to underscore the world body's "unhuman" treatment of
Taiwan's people, he said.</P>
      <P>Last year, Taiwan campaigned on the theme of "UN-FAIR" and the
U.N. turned out to be "unfair" to Taiwan by not just refusing to
discuss Taiwan's representation in the organization but also cutting
short the time its allies had to speak for it.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China gave up its U.N. membership in 1971 when
the China seat was given to the communist regime in Beijing. Since
1993, it has been calling for international attention to its plight
and asking its allies to push for U.N. recognition.</P>
      <P>This year's campaign will be Taiwan's 14th attempt to obtain U.N.
membership. All of its previous attempts have failed because of
China's obstruction.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REPORTED ALLIANCE NOT HELPFUL IN SOLVING PROBLEMS: DPP LAWMAKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  11  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Friday they are not in favor of a
reported alliance between former President Lee Teng-hui, Vice
President Annette Lu and Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng,
claiming that the idea will not solve any problems.</P>
      <P>The DPP legislators were responding to reports that some DPP
members are worried that if such an alliance is formed, the DPP will
not only lose its grip on power, but will run the risk of being
splintered. </P>
      <P>The reports have as their premise the idea that Lu would succeed
President Chen Shui-bian if he were to step down as a result of the
series of corruption allegations against his close aides and family
members, while Wang would be appointed premier, which reportedly is
what Lee would like.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lin Cho-hsui said the current political turmoil
can be traced to the corruption allegations implicating the first
family, as well as the DPP's lack of dominance in the legislature.</P>
      <P>If a Lu-Wang team were to be formed, then it would be "one
minority rule replacing another minority rule" that will not solve
the current impasse the DPP fares in the legislature, according to
Lin.</P>
      <P>However, Legislator Huang Wei-cher pointed out that unless the
DPP or Lee confirms the report, it remains no more than idle press
speculation.</P>
      <P>The DPP's aim is to continue the DPP or "pan-green camp" rule,
but if the Lu-Wang team were to be formed it's purpose would be to
rival Ma Ying-jeou, chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang and
the best bet for the party in the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Kuan Bi-ling also said the reports are aimed at
creating the impression that the party is about to collapse and that
Chen will soon step down.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Tsai Huang-liang also said that the reported
alliance is an attempt to drive a wedge into the party.</P>
      <P>Reports have said that with Chen embroiled in alleged misuse of
state affairs funds and former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh calling for
his resignation, Lee has instructed the Taiwan Solidarity Union, an
ally of the DPP, to prepare a contingency plan should Chen leave the
scene.</P>
      <P>The reports have speculated that Lee, the so-called spiritual
leader of the TSU, is worried that if Premier Su Tseng-chang, who
was appointed by Chen, is ousted along with the president, fighting
within the DPP could erupt. Lee therefore supports Lu to take over
the presidency with Wang heading the new Cabinet to stabilize
political situation, according to the reports.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOME HAIR DRYERS SOLD IN TAIWAN TOO NOISY: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  11 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some hair dryers sold in Taiwan make too
much noise or provide too much heat, which can be dangerous for
users, according to the results of a survey released Friday by the
Consumer's Foundation.</P>
      <P>The foundation sampled 23 hair dryers sold in stores in the
Taipei area in April. While six of the products were made in Taiwan,
16 were made in China and one was made in Thailand.</P>
      <P>Tests conducted on the products showed that three produced more
than 90 decibels, two produced heat that was higher than the maximum
accepted level of 110 degrees Celsius, and one even melted while in
use.</P>
      <P>Wu Chia-cheng, a chemistry professor at National Taiwan Normal
University and a member of the foundation, said hair dryers should be
produce between 55 decibels and 65 decibels and should not exceed 75
decibels.</P>
      <P>While the noise made by the surveyed products ranged between 72
decibles and 98 decibels, only four were lower than 75 decibels and
three were higher than 90 decibels, Wu said.</P>
      <P>In terms of temperatures, the Sunpentown SH-6512 hair dryer and
Lapolo HD-275 hair dryer both released maximum heat of more than 110
degrees Celsius, with the maximum heat by the former even reaching
130 degrees Celsius, which can burn the scalp, Wu said.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the temperature of hair dryers should not exceed
55 degrees Celsius, as heat exceeding that level can damage the hair.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the funnel of the Hsueh Yin SI-170 hair dryer melted
due to the heat released by the product, Wu said.</P>
      <P>He warned that the melted plastic cover of the hair dryer can
release toxic substances and he urged the government to step up
inspections of hair dryers.</P>

Sophistication and Scale of Plane Scheme

U.S. Intelligence and counterterrorism officials said yesterday
that the scale and sophistication of the scheme to blow up jetliners
over the Atlantic could mean that Al Qaeda, whose central command has
been severely damaged since 2001, was again able to direct attacks.
But some specialists on the shifting networks of international
terrorism said the alternative explanation -- that homegrown British
jihadists had managed to conceive a plot of such ambition -- might
hold even graver implications for the future.

Wall Street Journal: U.K. Terror Plot Points to New Threat

Britain's disruption yesterday of what authorities say was an
audacious plot to blow up trans-Atlantic airliners increases the fear
among terrorism investigators that significant numbers of Islamic
radicals born or raised in the West intend to carry out
sophisticated, large- scale attacks, inspired or guided by al Qaeda.
The possibility that home-grown radicals could link up with
international terrorist networks or simply draw inspiration from them
to wreak mass destruction complicates the challenge of identifying
and tracking potential terrorists, according to people involved in
those efforts.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BIDS FOR U.N. SEAT AGAIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  11 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will again bid for a seat in the
United Nations, with two proposals presented by its diplomatic allies
and the bid will be a continuous effort even if it fails once again,
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Michel Lu said in a
press conference Friday.</P>
      <P>The government does not rule out the possibility of applying for
U.N. membership under the name of Taiwan, although the issue is still
under discussion, said John Chen, director-general of MOFA's
Department of International Organizations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's allies submitted two proposals -- the "participation
proposal" and the "peace proposal" -- to the U.N. Secretariat in New
York early Friday, Lu said, requesting that the General Committee put
the proposals on the assembly agenda.</P>
      <P>The participation proposal was very similar to those put forward
in the past -- urging the U.N. General Assembly to ensure the
representation of the 23 million people of Taiwan in the world body.</P>
      <P>There is a modification in the peace proposal, Lu said. The
proposal requests the U.N. to play a proactive role in maintaining
peace in the East Asia region instead of last year's proposal, which
mentioned only the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>With China's military budget showing double-digit growth for the
18th consecutive year and the latest North Korean missile test, the
regional security in East Asia -- not just the Taiwan Strait -- is
becoming a notable issue in global security, Lu said.</P>
      <P>"The proposal calls for the U.N. to urge East Asian countries to
settle arguments peacefully and to take necessary measures to
prevent the regional tension from rising," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, Taiwan has failed 14 times in its bids to enter the
U.N.</P>
      <P>When the U.N. was founded in 1945, the Republic of China was one
of its founding members. However, it has been shut out of the body
since 1971, when U.N. Resolution No. 2758 gave the "China" seat to
the People's Republic of China at the ROC's expense.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's bid to become a member of the
United Nations is a joint and continuous effort, Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Michel Lu said Friday.</P>
      <P>It will not be easy for Taiwan to enter the U. N., as evidenced
by the last 14 failed attempts to do so. But Taiwan has shown time
and again that it is willing and capable of being a responsible
member of the international community, according to Lu.</P>
      <P>Even China, he said, spent 22 years before securing its U.N.
membership -- although it was at Taiwan's expense.</P>
      <P>"And China has been doing whatever it takes to block Taiwan from
international organizations and events. That tells us we don't have
any reason to stop working at a bid, which has become an annual task
for us, " he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan shares the same values -- which Lu claimed are "democracy,
human rights and development" -- with the 192 member countries of the
United Nations and went from an aid recipient to a contributor that
reaches out a helping hand to less-developed countries, Lu said.</P>
      <P>The U.N. bid is always a priority issue for MOFA and every Taiwan
president since 1972, when the Republic of China was replaced in the
U.N. by the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Over 100 embassies and representatives offices around the world
have spent countless hours delivering Taiwan's message and hope,
while MOFA has been tackling the New York area, where
the U.N. headquarters are located, with publicity campaigns,
parliamentary lobbies and mobilizing overseas Taiwanese groups, said
John Chen, director- general of MOFA's Department of International
Organizations.</P>
      <P>It is also possible that President Chen Shui-bian will discuss
the bid with the U.S. media in a teleconference, which is si miliar to
the one Chen had with European media when Taiwan was trying to bid
for World Health Assembly observer status earlier this year, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>"It has not been and will not be easy, but the 23 million people
of Taiwan have the right to participate in international affairs. We
will keep working on it, " Lu said.</P>

      <P>The number of companies willing to open up
shop in Taiwan's five free trade port zones might exceed 100 by the
end of this year, as the figure has already hit 73, the Cabinet-level
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Friday.</P>
      <P>CEPD Vice Chairman Thomas M.F. Yeh said that the 73 companies
have applied to set up shop in the five free trade port zones located
in Keelung, Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung ports, as well as at the
Chiang Kai-shek International Airport.</P>
      <P>He predicted that the number will further increase, probably to
105 in the initial stage, by the end of December, providing a major
fillip for the government in its efforts to make Taiwan into an
international business procurement and operations hub.</P>
      <P>The goal to develop the five free trade port zones is one of the
prime objectives outlined by the Executive Yuan in its 2008 national

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT'S HOUSEMAID'S 'SECRET SERVICE SUBSIDY' DRAWS FLAK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  11 (CNA)
(By Lilian  Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Monthly payments to Lin Hsiu-chen, a
housemaid who works for President Chen Shui-bian in a property owned
by him and occupied by his daughter, drew flak from opposition
lawmakers again Friday after it was revealed that she had received a
"secret service subsidy" from the National Security Bureau (NSB) over
the past five years.</P>
      <P>Local reports cited NSB officials as saying that in addition to
receiving a monthly payment of NT$25,000 while named as a janitor on
the payroll of the Presidential Office, Lin also received more than
NT$20,000 per month from the NSB as a "secret service subsidy."</P>
      <P>NSB officials said Lin received the subsidy because she "assisted
and worked with the secret service." But because of changes in her
working conditions, the subsidy was stopped in August, according to
the reports. The subsidy is given to secret service staff maintaining
the security of the president and the vice president, and Lin's
subsidy was equal to that paid to an army captain, the reports said.</P>
      <P>Opposition lawmakers lambasted the subsidy payments as "very
improper, " but the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
legislative caucus said that in view of the public feelings, the
subsidy for the past five years -- estimated at around NT$1.17
million -- had been returned.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chin-lung, a caucus whip of the main opposition Kuomintang
in the legislature, said it is "pathetic" to use taxpayer money to
pay for Lin, and ridiculed her for being described as a member of the
secret service while actually working as a housemaid.</P>
      <P>Lu Hsueh-chang, a caucus whip of the People First Party noted
that Lin is neither a secret servicewoman, nor a plain clothes
policewomen, and so had no right to claim such a subsidy from the
NSB.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-ming, a caucus whip of the Taiwan Solidarity Union, said
that Lin's claiming of the subsidy was outrageous and that the NSB
should make a full review.</P>
      <P>Reports have said that although Lin claimed a monthly salary of
NT$25,000, she actually received nearly NT$60,000 from other sources.</P>
      <P>After the matter came to light, Lin resigned from the
Presidential Office but remains in Chen's private employ at his own
expense, while his daughter has also returned more than NT$2 million,
including salary and bonuses paid to Lin from Presidential Office
funds since she married and moved into her parent's house on Minsheng
East Road in Taipei five years ago.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP CHIEF SUPPORTS FORMER DDP HEAD'S CAMPAIGN TO TOPPLE PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 11 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition party leader voiced support
Friday for former Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Shih
Ming-teh's campaign to topple President Chen Shui-bian, claiming he
was the first to have such a call.</P>
      <P>James Soong, chairman of the People First Party, said he was the
first politician to have called on Chen to step down to take moral
and political responsibility for a spate of corruption charges
against the first family and senior aides.</P>
      <P>Shih and another former DPP chairman, Hsu Hsin-liang, said they
had lost confidence in the president because Chen's son-in-law, Chao
Chien-ming, was at the center of a high-profile insider trading
scandal. Chao and his father were among the seven indictees in the
case.</P>
      <P>While calling on the public to support Shih's "one person,
NT$100" drive to topple the scandal-ridden president, Soong devoted
more time attacking his "pan-blue alliance" ally, Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou of the Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Soong said he admired Shih's views of the political situation,
including Shih's satirization of an opposition leader as a
"fodder-fed chicken" -- an apparent reference to Ma, who has been
criticized for being too weak during the pan-blue alliance's
presidential recall campaign.</P>
      <P>Soong said while the campaign was being waged, even DPP members
realized that if Chen remained in the executive, it would be a shame
not only for Taiwan but also for the DPP.</P>
      <P>"If the KMT had insisted on recalling the president and followed
up with a no-confidence motion against the Cabinet, Chen would have
been thrown out by now," Soong said.</P>
      <P>Instead of being tough with the president, Soong said the KMT
backed down right before the recall motion went to a vote in the
legislature, considering non-judicial means to be "too radical."</P>
      <P>That, Soong claimed, was "conceding defeat even before the
battle."</P>
      <P>Ma was not immediately available for response to Soong's comment,
nor did he specify whether he would donate NT$100 in support of
Shih's campaign, saying "money is a minor matter" and the real issue
is "people" if the president is to be overthrown.</P>
      <P>Ma claimed that his party's drive to recall the president has
managed to collect more than 2.3 million signatures.</P>

      <P>Chen Chu, who was a fellow inmate of
former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Shih Ming-teh
during the Kuomintang (KMT) rule, said Friday that she regretted
Shih's campaign to topple President Chen Shui-bian based on moral
grounds.</P>
      <P>Chen, a former chairwoman of the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
and now the ruling DPP's nominee for Kaohsiung mayor, said she
opposed the idea of forcing a president to step down when he has done
nothing illegal, on moral considerations.</P>
      <P>"I respect our friendship developed in our joint efforts to
oppose the KMT's authoritarian rule, but I cannot agree with [Shih's]
accusation that President Chen is at the heart of Taiwan's turmoil, "
she said in a statement.</P>
      <P>She claimed that the real "center of turmoil" lies with "pan-blue
alliance" legislators who make all sorts of allegations against the
president, as well as TV personalities who are bent on toppling
Taiwan's "democratic, sovereign government."</P>
      <P>She called on Shih to beware of these "reactionary" forces
working to return the pan-blue politicians to power at any price.</P>
      <P>She advised Shih to "respect judicial proceedings" and to bow to

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Tainan Prosecutor's Office in southern
Taiwan will launch an experimental program Sept. 1 to offer drug
addicts suspended indictments on condition of compulsory treatment as
part of efforts to reduce overall drug dependency, a spokesman said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Under the program, addicts who voluntarily undergo treatment will
have their legal charges suspended if they contribute NT$50,000
toward a special fund that finances the cost of compulsory
rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>Drug addicts who are first caught by law enforcement will have to
contribute NT$100,000 toward the special alternative treatment fund
to qualify for the suspension of charges.</P>
      <P>Chu Chao-liang, chief prosecutor at the Tainan Prosecutor's
Office, said the contribution requirement is congruent with the
"making users pay" principle.</P>
      <P>The compulsory treatment will require drug addicts to visit a
designated hospital regularly to drink a dose of Methadone -- a
substitute drug that reduces dependency on more lethal drugs such as
heroin -- and reduce the risk of contracting diseases through
hypodermic needle infections.</P>
      <P>Chu unveiled the experimental program at a coordination meeting
of officials from the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH), the
Tainan county government and the Tainan city government.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the meeting at the DOH-run Chianan Psychiatric
Center in Tainan County, Kuo Hsu-sung, director of the DOH's Center
for Disease Control, said the DOH welcomes the new experimental
program to help drug addicts quit the vice by offering suspended
indictment charges on condition of compulsory treatment.</P>
      <P>"We hope the new program will provide an incentive in our fight
against drug hazards and drug addiction," Kuo said.</P>
      <P>As drug addiction has become a main source of Taiwan's AIDS/HIV
transmissions -- with two out of every three new HIV carriers
being intravenous drug users -- the DOH launched an experimental
needle exchange project in Taipei City, Taipei County, Taoyuan County
and Tainan County last year.</P>
      <P>The project has initially borne fruit, as all new HIV infection
rates in those areas have fallen below the country's average level of
56.38 percent. Since July 1 this year, the "clean needle" program has
been implemented across the country.</P>
      <P>Kuo said Tainan County has been the most successful in the first
stage of the DOH's drug reduction plan by integrating the clean
needle and alternative treatment projects.</P>
      <P>A total of 129 drug addicts have entered the Chianan Psychiatric
Center's alternative treatment program. With the Tainan Prosecutor's
Office and additional medical institutions in the region taking part
as well, Kuo believes the results will be even more remarkable.</P>
      <P>Kuo added that the DOH plans to invite U.S. and Australian
experts to Tainan in September to review the county's achievements in
drug hazard control and prevention.</P>
      <P>"We'll also introduce Tainan's drug-fighting experience to other
counties and cities around Taiwan," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S POLITICAL SITUATION COMPLICATES U.S. POLICY: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   Aug.  11  (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The public enthusiasm displayed
formerly by the U.S. government for supporting Taiwan initiatives
appears to have abated in the wake of recent political developments
in Taiwan, according to a report released Friday by the U.S.
Congressional Research Service (CRS).</P>
      <P>"While still pursuing a closer U.S. relationship with Taiwan,
U.S. officials now appear to be balancing criticisms of the PRC
military buildup opposite Taiwan with periodic cautions and warnings
to the effect that U.S. support for Taiwan is not unconditional, but
has limits," the report said.</P>
      <P>The report titled "Taiwan: Recent Developments and U.S. Policy
Choices" was written by Kerry Dumbaugh, a specialist in Asian affairs
at the CRS' Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division.</P>
      <P>The report said that early in its tenure, the George W. Bush
administration seemed to abandon the long-standing U.S. policy of
"strategic ambiguity" on Taiwan in favor of "strategic clarity" that
placed more emphasis on Taiwan's interests and less on PRC concerns.</P>
      <P>For example, Bush publicly stated in 2001 that the United States
would do "whatever it takes" to help defend Taiwan and approved a
substantial sale of U.S. weapons to Taiwan, the report noted.</P>
      <P>It said the White House was more accomodating to visits by Taiwan
officials than previous U.S. administrations, permitting visits by
President Chen Shui-bian in 2001 and by Vice President Annette Lu in
2003.</P>
      <P>With support for Taiwan growing in the U.S. Congress, a House
Congressional Taiwan Caucus was established in 2002 and a Senate
Taiwan Caucus was set up in 2003, it said.</P>
      <P>However, while Chen's position that Taiwan already "is an
independent, sovereign country" has worried many Taiwan voters, the
recent string of corruption scandals allegedly involving government
officials and Chen's family members have led to record-low approval
ratings for Chen and a mounting political outcry against him, the
report said.</P>
      <P>"These political trends have raised anxieties about the
possibility of a future political or constitutional crisis in Taiwan
that could further complicate U.S. policy," the report said.</P>
      <P>It said U.S. officials have been under subtle but increasing
pressure from both Taipei and Beijing to become directly involved in
some aspects of cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>In late 2003, Beijing officials began quietly urging Washington
to pressure Chen into shelving plans for a national referendum, and
in 2004, they pressed U.S. officials to avoid sending the "wrong
signals" to Taiwan, the report said.</P>
      <P>Taipei officials, on the other hand, have begun suggesting that
the United States strengthen or reevaluate the Taiwan Relations Act
and support Chen's constitutional reform plans, the report said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan supporters within the U.S. Congress continue to
press for more favorable U.S. treatment of Taiwan and for Taiwan's
inclusion in international organizations, it said.</P>
      <P>"Faced with competing pressures and with continuing
transformations in both the PRC and Taiwan systems, U.S. officials
may be facing new and more difficult policy choices concerning Taiwan
in the next few years," the report said.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, the U.S. government might take any
number of actions, including reassessing all the fundamentals of U.S.
China/Taiwan policy in light of changing circumstances, reinforcing
American democratic values by providing greater support for Taiwan
and possibly support for Taiwan independence, or abandoning Taiwan in
favor of the geopolitical demands and benefits of close U.S.-China
relations, the report said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROSECUTORS TO GIVE REPORT ON PROGRESS IN 'STATE AFFAIRS FUND' PROBE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The first-stage probe into the "possible
irregularities" in the handling of President Chen Shui-bian's special
state affairs expenditure account has almost been completed, the
Taiwan High Prosecutors Office (THPO) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>"After more than a month of intensive investigations, we have
accumulated a rich collection of data on the use of the president's
special 'state affairs fund' and plan to give a public briefing on
progress in our work next week," a THPO official said.</P>
      <P>The THPO formed a special task force in late June to investigate
the case after receiving suspicious financial data and accounting
records related to the president's special "state affairs fund" from
the Ministry of Audit (MOA) under the Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>Members of the task force confirmed for the first time Saturday
that they have interviewed at least 20 people, including the
Presidential Office accounting department staff, about the "state
affairs" expenditure account.</P>
      <P>Some of the task force members have visited the Presidential
Office to gather information, including examining classified files.
Nevertheless, they declined to confirm whether they had interviewed
former Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Ma Yung-cheng,
who used to be Chen's right-hand man.</P>
      <P>So far, only Lee Pi-chun, the owner of a pharmaceutical company,
has been listed as a suspect and banned from leaving the country.</P>
      <P>Opposition politicians have accused Chen of using "fake invoices"
to reimburse the special "state affairs" expenses after the MOA found
irregularities in the Presidential Office accounting report.</P>
      <P>During Wednesday's questioning, Lee Pi-chun told the
prosecutorial task force that she had given Grand Hyatt Hotel
invoices to "other people" but that she had no idea why those
invoices ended up in the accounting reports of the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>Lee denied that she has ever given the controversial invoices
directly to first lady Wu Shu-jen. Opposition lawmakers had alleged
that Wu might have used the controversial invoices to help her
husband reimburse the "state affairs fund." The president has
repeatedly denied that he has ever pocketed a single cent from the
fund budgeted for his discretionary use.</P>
      <P>According to a long-established custom, half of the president's
"state affairs fund" can be reimbursed with just his personal
signature, while the remaining half requires invoices or receipts for
reimbursement.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said they have focused probes on the part that
requires invoices for reimbursement, adding that they have discovered
some suspicious invoices and receipts as well as cases in which
invoices provided by "unrelated individuals" were used to reimburse
the fund.</P>
      <P>Those involved may face charges of fraud and document forgery,
prosecutors said, adding that if necessary, they will interview more
suspects and witnesses, including President Chen himself.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EMBATTLED PRESIDENT ADDRESSES CALLS FOR HIS OUSTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  12  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Saturday
indirectly answered the mounting calls for his resignation over a
series of corruption allegations implicating his close aides and
family members by stressing that all actions taken should adhere to
constitutional procedures.</P>
      <P>The embattled president made the remarks while delivering a
speech on "the art of leadership" at a training class at the
Ketagalan Institute, a school which he founded in 2003 with the aim
of nurturing the nation's future leaders.</P>
      <P>On calls by Shih Ming-teh, a former chairman of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, to launch a "one million citizens to
depose President Chen" drive the same day, the president said all
actions taken must fall within the framework of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Shih's call came on the heels of an appeal for the president's
resignation by a group of pro-green academics July 15.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed the importance of "the rule of law in a democracy,"
adding that "if a president has done a poor job, then the
Constitution has provisions for recalling or impeaching the president
or even holding a no-confidence vote to topple the Cabinet, " which
he said are "all important parts of constitutional order by which
everyone should abide."</P>
      <P>"Using revolutionary means which lead to the shedding of blood
does not mark progress in a democracy, but instead marks its
regression, "he said.</P>
      <P>"The issue is by no means who should step down and who should
take over. The core issue is the constitutional system, " he
continued.</P>
      <P>He also touched on the issue of "transitional justice, "
saying that many difficulties could arise in the transformation of a
nation from authoritarian to democratic rule.</P>
      <P>The controversial issues of his alleged misuse of the "state
affairs fund" put under his discretionary use, as well as his sending
of his housemaid to work at his residence occupied by his married
daughter at the public's expense are examples of "legacies from the
past" when such actions were permitted but which are criticized
harshly nowadays.</P>
      <P>Many of the old practices and irregularities could be thoroughly
reviewed and a fair governing system established for the future in
order to avoid unnecessary controversies, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen's words came against the backdrop of the People First Party,
the second largest opposition party, mulling whether to move to
introduce a motion to impeach him in the upcoming legislative
session.</P>
      <P>President Chen survived a recall attempt in late June when an
opposition-initiated motion to recall him failed to receive the
required endorsement of two-thirds of all lawmakers in order to be
put to a national referendum.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT RENEWS PROPOSAL ON U.N. APPLICATION UNDER TAIWAN'S NAME</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  12 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian renewed his
proposal Saturday that the country should seriously consider applying
to join the United Nations under the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Stressing that identifying with Taiwan and sticking to the
Taiwanese identity is the right path for the country, Chen said
Taiwan should not waste any more effort competing for China's
representation in the United Nations and disputing the rightfulness
of Resolution 2758 under which the Republic of China's U.N. seat was
given to the People's Republic of China in 1971.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is Taiwan, and China is China. Taiwan is definitely not
China, " Chen said while giving a lecture at the Ketagalan Institute
which he founded in 2003 with the aim of nurturing the country's
future leaders.</P>
      <P>"We should consider applying to join the United Nations directly
under the name of Taiwan, and it's time for us to conduct a serious
review of our policy, " he added.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan is facing a problem that does not exist in other
countries, namely that people in this country are split in terms of
their national identity.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that a travel guide on Taipei mentions that some
people who immigrated to Taiwan from China after 1949 do not feel
comfortable being called "Taiwanese, " and this makes him feel very
strange and is hard for him to accept.</P>
      <P>While some politicians in Taiwan have claimed to be "new
Taiwanese, " they should not feel ashamed but should be proud of
being Taiwanese, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said the "one China" policy adopted by the former Kuomintang
government has led to Taiwan's exclusion from the United Nations and
its isolation in the international community.</P>
      <P>Over the past 35 years, Taiwan has been forbidden from using its
official name "Republic of China" and asked to change its name, he
said.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan has taken part in the Olympic Games under the name
of "Chinese Taipei" since 1984, the country became a member of the
World Trade Organization in 2002 under the name of "the Separate
Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu," Chen pointed
out.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan has been trying to gain entry to the World
Health Organization for the past decade but that the bid has been
unsuccessful even under the name of a health entity.</P>
      <P>The president said the recent severance of diplomatic relations
between Taiwan and Chad has again demonstrated the limitations that
the country is subject to under China's diplomatic suppression.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, China was not any more lenient toward Taiwan
during the past KMT government, with Taiwan losing 13 diplomatic
allies to China during the 12 years that President Lee Teng-hui was
in office.</P>
      <P>"This shows that the 'one China' policy adopted by the former
government was nothing but a myth," he said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  12  (CNA)
(By Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's recently launched sounding
satellite, FORMASAT-3, has begun sending weather data, as the first
micro-satellite of the constellation settled in its designated
orbital plane, a senior official of the FORMOSAT-3 Program Office
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Yen Lung-cheng, director of the program office, said that
FORMOSAT-3 at present stage is only able to collect and transmit per
day 700 entries of atmospheric data and 2,500 entries of ionospheric
data, adding that when all six micro-satellites are in position, the
satellite constellation will reach its full capacity of sending per
day 2,500 pieces of atmospheric data and ionospheric data each.</P>
      <P>FORMASAT-3, an atmosphere observing constellation of six micro-
satellites, lifted off in the U.S. state of California in April 15
and reached its initial parking orbit of 500 kilometers above ground.
The six micro-satellites will gradually move into position on their
orbital planes at 800 kilometers above ground by mid 2007, with the
first of the micro-satellites already having done so July 19.</P>
      <P>According to the program office, the other five are still on the
parking orbit at an altitude of around 500 kilometers to 550
kilometers and waiting to lift to the final orbits to carry out their
five-year weather observation mission.</P>
      <P>FORMASAT-3 is Taiwan's third satellite project, following the
launch of FORMOSAT-1 in 1999 and FORMOSAT-2 in 2004. FORMOSAT-3 --
also known as Constellation Observing System for Meteorology,
Ionosphere and Climate -- is a collaborative project between Taiwan'
s National Space Organization and the University Corporation for
Atmospheric Research in the United States.</P>
      <P>Researchers from 26 countries, as well as Taiwan's Central
Weather Bureau and weather centers in the United States and Britain,
have been using FORMOSAT-3's sounding data for weather forecasts and
atmospheric research, Yen said, adding that the preliminary research
results will be presented at a seminar on FORMAT-3 to be held Nov. 28

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT REAFFIRMS DREAM OF CRAFTING NEW CONSTITUTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  12  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed
Saturday his dream of crafting a new Constitution for the country,
saying that it is his "historic mission."</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while delivering a speech titled
"The Art of Leadership" at a training class at the Ketagalan
Institute, a school he founded in 2003 to nurture the nation's future
leaders.</P>
      <P>Chen, currently dogged by a series of corruption allegations
implicating his top aides and family members, said that the issue now
is not who should step down or who should assume office.</P>
      <P>"The serious issue is the constitutional system, and we need to
make efforts to firmly establish a constitutional system," he said.</P>
      <P>He said his "biggest dream is to bring about a timely, relevant
and viable Constitution that Taiwan needs."</P>
      <P>"If this is done, I'll accomplish my historic mission. If not,
I'll regret it forever. I'll feel sorry for this nation and its great
people," he said.</P>
      <P>The president stressed that in his remaining time in office, he
will "shoulder the cross of Taiwan history, insist on Taiwan's
sovereignty, push for constitutional re-engineering and follow the
right path, " even if this means enduring "injury to myself or the
shedding of my blood."</P>
      <P>He said that the present Constitution has to be changed, adding
that Shih Ming-teh, a former chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , has advocated a "parliamentary system" in
which the dominant party in the legislature forms the Cabinet, in
contrast to the current system in which the president appoints a
premier who then forms the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>He stressed that every one is entitled to freedom of speech and
that he has no preset ideas on which kind of system should be
adopted.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that any changes to the Constitution will require
the consent of the people, he said that as long as a revised version
can gain the support of three-fourths of the legislature and be
passed by a majority of the people in a national referendum, he will
have no objections.</P>
      <P>Noting that the DPP is scheduled to propose its version of a new
Constitution next month, while its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) , will also submit its own version, President Chen that it is
"very gratifying" that many are moving in the same direction.</P>
      <P>The president began his speech by congratulating the TSU on the
fifth anniversary of its founding and expressing his respect for the
contribution of former President Lee Teng-hui, the spiritual leader
of the TSU, to the nation's democratization as well as his guidance
in 2000 when the DPP swept the Kuomintang from power after five
decades of rule.</P>
      <P>Chen lauded Lee as the "father of Taiwan's democracy" and said he
should be considered the spiritual leader of the 23 million people of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although former DPP Chairman Shih called a news conference to
explain his drive to depose the president the same day, Chen lauded
Shih as one of the major forerunners of Taiwan's democratic movement.</P>
      <P>"The DPP is a homegrown political party, and one that stresses
Taiwan identity and democracy, " Chen said, expressing his
appreciation to pioneers of the democratic movement such as Shih.</P>
      <P>Without Shih, who served as the DPP chairman 1994-1996 before
quitting the party in 2000, Chen said, it would have been impossible
for him to have won the 1994 Taipei mayoral election, a DPP victory
in the city's first direct mayoral election in 30 years.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian is more than

      <P>Opposition politicians have accused Chen of using "fake invoices"
to reimburse the special "state affairs" expenses after the MOA found
irregularities in the Presidential Office accounting report.</P>
      <P>During Wednesday's questioning, Lee Pi-chun told the
prosecutorial task force that she had given Grand Hyatt Hotel
invoices to "other people" but that she had no idea why those
invoices ended up in the accounting reports of the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>Lee denied that she has ever given the controversial invoices
directly to first lady Wu Shu-jen. Opposition lawmakers had alleged
that Wu might have used the controversial invoices to help her
husband reimburse the "state affairs fund." The president has
repeatedly denied that he has ever pocketed a single cent from the
fund budgeted for his discretionary use.</P>
      <P>According to a long-established custom, half of the president's
"state affairs fund" can be reimbursed with just his personal
signature, while the remaining half requires invoices or receipts for
reimbursement.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said they have focused probes on the part that
requires invoices for reimbursement, adding that they have discovered
some suspicious invoices and receipts as well as cases in which
invoices provided by "unrelated individuals" were used to reimburse
the fund.</P>
      <P>Those involved may face charges of fraud and document forgery,
prosecutors said, adding that if necessary, they will interview more
suspects and witnesses, including President Chen himself.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT PROPOSES DRAWING UP NEW CONTROL YUAN NOMINEE LIST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  12  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Saturday
proposed drawing up a new list of Control Yuan member nominees if the
opposition promises not to insist on raising the threshold of
confirmation to two-thirds of the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The president made the proposal during his speech at the
Ketagalan Institute, a school he founded in 2003 to nurture future
national leaders.</P>
      <P>The president stressed that before the current five-branch system
of government is changed to a three-branch system, he hopes the
legislature will confirm the Control Yuan member and the State Public
Prosecutor-General nominees speedily.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan, the nation's highest watchdog body, has been
left vacant since the terms of the previous Control Yuan members
expired in January 2005 as the opposition-dominated legislature is
unsatisfied with some of the president's nominees, especially the
nominee to serve as Control Yuan president, namely Clement C.P.
Chang. The opposition also rejected a nominee to serve in the
nation's top prosecutorial post earlier this year.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and
People First Party (PFP) immediately dismissed Chen's
proposal as a ploy to shift public attention away from the ongoing
investigations into a series of corruption allegations implicating
his family members and his top aides.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chin-lung, KMT caucus whip in the legislature, expressed
suspicions about President Chen's intentions in offering to draw up a
new list at a time when he is embroiled in allegations of misusing a
"state affairs fund."</P>
      <P>Tsai called for the president to "first clear up the scandals"
before dealing with other issues, such as the nominee list.</P>
      <P>Lu Hsueh-chang, a PFP caucus whip, said that legislators have yet
to reach a consensus on raising the threshold for the confirmation of
Control Yuan member nominees, adding that the opposition's rejection
of the list has to do with the nomination procedures as well as
misgivings about the nominees and that it is not related to the
threshold issue.</P>
      <P>"If the president wants to redraw the list, then he should just
go ahead and do it without linking it to the threshold issue, " Lu
added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  12 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Whether President Chen Shui-bian should
resign ought to be determined according to the Constitution, and
there are many more tasks for the president to complete during the
remainder of his term, a group of Taiwan independence advocates said
at a forum Saturday.</P>
      <P>"The president's legitimacy is regulated and defined by the
Constitution. Taiwan's ongoing problems should be resolved within the
framework of the Constitution, instead of by resorting to 'outside
powers'," political commentator Chin Heng-wei said.</P>
      <P>The forum, titled "2008 and Taiwan's Future, " was organized by
Taiwan Society North, a Taiwan independence advocacy group, on the
same day that a number of public rallies were held in several cities
calling the president to step down.</P>
      <P>"What the president should do is tell the Taiwan people what he
will do in the future as a president and apologize for what he has
done wrong, " said Koo Kuan-min, a former senior advisor to President
Chen.</P>
      <P>Koo further said that President Chen failed to deliver on his
promises related to all-out reform and economic policies during the
last six years, adding that he has been unable to "flex his muscles"
because of the "Four Noes" pledge given in his inaugural speech in
2000.</P>
      <P>On the topic of the 2008 presidential election, Koo made clear
that the election will be a choice between unification with China and
Taiwan independence, adding that he is still optimistic that "the
local regime will not be defeated."</P>
      <P>"The outcome of the 2008 presidential election will be a defining
moment for President Chen. If the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
fails to win, it will be seen as a 'one-hit wonder' and Chen will be
remembered for this," Chin stressed.</P>
      <P>Chen Mao-hsiung, a professor at National Sun Yat-sen University,
said that both Ma Yin-jeou, the possible presidential candidate of
the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , and Chen both value short-term
"tactics" over long-term "strategies" because both of them have been
through so many elections.</P>
      <P>"All they want is to win (the elections). However, sometimes this
does not serve the public's interests, " he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GARBAGE REDUCTION CAMPAIGN ACHIEVES GOAL AHEAD OF SCHEDULE: EPA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's "garbage classification"
campaign has achieved its initial goal of "cutting trash volume by 25
percent in three years" ahead of schedule, an environmental
protection official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)
launched a three-year compulsory waste classification campaign in
2004 with an aim of reducing the country's overall garbage volume by
25 percent by 2007.</P>
      <P>"At the end of May this year, the amount of recycled garbage was
836,200 tons, with the recycling rate reaching 26.13 percent, " said
Sung Yi-jen, a division chief with the EPA's Waste Management
Department.</P>
      <P>The recycling rate marked an increase of 8.24 percentage points
over the figure of 17.89 percent recorded in 2003, Sung said, adding
that the figures indicate that the country's waste volume has been
reduced by 25 percent through recyling, a goal that was originally
set for completion in 2007.</P>
      <P>In May, recycled kitchen leftovers totaled 228,400 tons for a
recycling rate of 7.14 percent, compared to a mere 2.19 percent two
years ago, Sung said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the average daily amount of trash per person declined
to a record low of 0.618 kg in May from 1.143 kg in 19976, Sung said.</P>
      <P>Despite the encouraging results, Sung said, the EPA will not be
complacent and will work even harder to push for realization of a
further goal of cutting garbage volume by 40 percent in 2011 and 75
percent by 2020.</P>

      <P>Lukang in Changhua County in central
Taiwan has been chosen as the top township in terms of friendliness,
taste and distinctive features in a "smiling town" contest whose
results were published Saturday.</P>
      <P>In terms of friendliness, cleanness, taste, distinctive features
and sense of happiness, Taiwanese people appreciate Lukang most. It
was followed by Suao in Yilan County, Tamshui in Taipei County,
Chiunglin in Hsinchu County, and Tachia in Taichung County.</P>
      <P>Further analysis found that Lukang, which is dotted with cultural
relics in central Taiwan, has been the most friendly, tasteful and
distinctive town, while Suao has been the cleanest and has given the
greatest sense of happiness.</P>
      <P>The contest was the climax to a "revisit 319 towns with a smile"

    <HEADLINE>EFFECT OF OPENING TO CHINESE TOURISTS WILL BE LESS THAN EXPECTED: CIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The contribution to Taiwan's economy of
opening the country to mainland Chinese tourists will not be as great
as most people expect, a think tank said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER) made the
prediction after the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said recently
that Chinese tourists are expected at the end of the year judging
from the progress in negotiations between the two sides on the
matter.</P>
      <P>Chou Ji, director of the institute's center for economic
outlook, said that if 1,000 Chinese tourists visit Taiwan each day,
then there will be 365,000 visits by Chinese tourists a year.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Tourism said that if Chinese tourists spend
US$180.5 per day on average and stay for 7.61 days per visit, then
this will translate into US$501 million in tourism revenue for
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chou noted that tourism revenue should be counted as commodity
and service exports. The institute had originally estimated that if
Chinese tourists began arriving in August, then the commodity and
service exports in the third quarter would increase by around NT$3
billion (US$91.46 million), or a 0.04 percentage point increase in
the nation's economic growth, pushing growth to 4.15 percent from the
original estimate of 4.11 percent.</P>
      <P>However, as the policy is not expected to be implemented until
the end of this year, the contribution to Taiwan's economic growth
will only begin next year, Chou added.</P>
      <P>In 2007, the opening will bring in roughly NT$16 billion in
tourism revenue, and economic growth will be a modest 4.22 percent,
showing that the benefits of the opening will not be as great as
anticipated.</P>
      <P>Chou explained that the main reason is that Taiwan's policy is to
set a ceiling of 1,000 Chinese tourists per day. Even if there are a
total of 365,000 visits by mainland Chinese to Taiwan a year, the
number of mainland Chinese tourists will only account for 9.25
percent of the total number of foreign tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Until the government raises the ceiling on the number of Chinese
tourists, there will not be a significant boost to economic growth,
he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Fair Trade Commission
(FTC) warned manufacturers, distributors and retailers in all
industries Sunday that they could face heavy fines or even prison
terms if they take concerted action to fix prices.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the FTC noted that market prices have fluctuated
frequently in the past year and that more and more suppliers of
similar products or services have collaborated with one another to
adjust their prices.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Fair Trade Law prohibits suppliers from taking
"concerted action" to fix prices of goods and services, the spokesman
said, adding that violators can be fined NT$25 million (US$765,955),
and that repeat offenders are likely to face a maximum sentence of
three years in prison.</P>
      <P>He said the FTC will hold a seminar Aug. 15 in Hualien, eastern
Taiwan, to explain Article 7 of the Fair Trade Law governing monopoly
and concerted action in price fixing, which occurs when two or more
competitors agree on how they will charge customers for products or
services.</P>
      <P>The Hualien seminar will be the third in a series held by the FTC
to help businesses understand the Fair Trade Law. The previous two
seminars took place in Taichung and Kaohsiung on July 21 and Aug. 4,
respectively.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT WILL NOT TAKE PART IN ANTI-PRESIDENT DRIVE: CAUCUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will not
get directly involved in an anti-President Chen Shui-bian drive
initiated by a former chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) but is supportive of such an action, a high-ranking KMT
official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of the KMT Central Policy
Committee, said the KMT approves of former DPP Chairman Shih
Ming-teh's launch of the anti-Chen drive a day earlier and will not
rein in its members or followers who want to support the movement
demanding that Chen step down, but will not take part in the campaign
directly in order to avoid providing Chen and the DPP administration
with an opportunity of accusing the KMT of orchestrating
"party-to-party struggle."</P>
      <P>Tseng said that since the KMT has been long considered by Chen
and the DPP administration as a sworn enemy, participation in Shih's
movement might provide Chen and his government with an opportunity to
blur the focus of the movement.</P>
      <P>He said this stance is in line with KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's
viewpoint that Shih has a greater chance of dragging the president
from office than does the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT
and the People First Party.</P>
      <P>Shih, who was DPP chairman between 1993 and 1996, launched the
campaign that calls on the people to stand up to force Chen to step
down amid corruption allegations dogging his family and close aides.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tseng said that Chen's renewed calls for crafting a new
constitution and for Taiwan to join the United Nations under the name
of "Taiwan" amid mounting pressure for his resignation are only ploys
to shift public attention away from the ongoing investigations into
the series of corruption allegations in which he is
allegedly involved.</P>
      <P>Tseng urged Chen to clear the people's doubts about his alleged
use of the Presidential Office's special state affairs fund for his
family's own expenses and to stop "fooling the country with political
hot air."</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu claimed Sunday
that Taiwan is experiencing an "unprecedented calamity" and she urged
the ruling and opposition politicians to stop bickering and pray for
their "common mother" -- Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks while addressing a gathering of Buddhist
monks and practitioners in Kuishan, in Taoyuan County, to which
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and other political
leaders were also invited.</P>
      <P>She cited the war between Israel and Hezbollah in southern
Lebanon to warn of the consequences that might befall Taiwan if the
public do not cherish what they have.</P>
      <P>"Stop the ruling and opposition stand-off and duel, " she urged,
adding that she has been calling for establishing a "grand alliance
of blue sky and green earth" because "only through working together
can we hope to create a bright future for Taiwan."</P>
      <P>While calling on the ruling and opposition politicians to cast
aside their grudges against each other, she also urged the Buddhists
to pray for peace in the Middle East.</P>
      <P>Lu said Buddhism has been a positive force in educating the

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) criticized former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman
Shih Ming-teh Sunday for showing "excessive individual heroism" by
launching a "one million people campaign to depose President Chen
Shui-bian."</P>
      <P>Ho Min-hao, executive director of the TSU Policy Committee, said
Shih has "made some contribution" to Taiwan's democracy, but whether
his current campaign will "move the people" remains to be seen.</P>
      <P>The president should do some soul searching as to why his six
years in office have produced such poor results, but Shih is not
acting in a rational way, Ho claimed, describing Shih's depose-Chen
campaign as "insignificant."</P>
      <P>The TSU executive lauded Chen's promise to kick off a national
campaign to "rectify the national title and introduce a new
Constitution for Taiwan" -- a promise Chen has made many times but on
which he has consistently failed to act.</P>
      <P>Ho said he hopes this time the president means what he says. If
Chen were to keep his promise, people would stand behind him, Ho
speculated.</P>
      <P>He noted that Chen would have to overcome huge pressure from the

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 13 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Facing a plunge in Taiwan's birth rate, the
government is projecting to increase subsidies on various fronts to
help couples get better monetary aid and assistance to overcome their
difficulties in raising children.</P>
      <P>According to Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD)
Chairman Hu Sheng-cheng, although the impact of a shrinking workforce
on the economy remains to be seen, a conclusion was reached in the
recent Conferene on Sustaining Taiwan's Economic Development that the
government should offer incentives to encourage people to have more
children.</P>
      <P>Hu said that Taiwan couples have fewer children than couples in
other major countries, and cited statistics compiled by the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) to
validate his concern.</P>
      <P>In 2005, Taiwan women of child-bearing age had an average of 1.1
children in their lives, far lower than the world average of 2.7 and
an average of 1.6 in the world's industrialized countries, according
to CEPD tallies.</P>
      <P>Compared with neighboring countries, Taiwan's 1.1 was only
slightly ahead of Hong Kong's 1.0, but still lagging behind China's
1.6, Japan's 1.3 and South Korea's 1.2.</P>
      <P>The number of Taiwan's newborns this year might not break
200,000, the DGBAS forecast.</P>
      <P>After having assessed measures adopted by other nations, the CEPD
is working to provide better subsides for maternity leave and
inexpensive high-quality day care services for career women, Hu said,
adding that detailed measures will be made public by the end of this
month.</P>
      <P>But he pointed out that it is critical to win support from
enterprises to put the measures in place, predicting that this should
take place in a piecemeal fashion.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's population is rapidly greying, Taiwan's industry is
set to suffer a worsening labor shortage, Minister of Economic
Affairs Chen Ruey-lung warned, suggesting that the business community
make adjustments to secure persistent growth both at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the increase in Taiwan's population will
not come to a halt suddenly, Chen said that its gradual decline will
still deal a heavy blow to the social, educational and political
sectors.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS predicted that by 2018, the number of people in
Taiwan's 20-24 age group will be fewer than that of the 60-64 age
group. Japan, Germany and Italy have already experienced this change
in demographic structure, while France and Canada are expected to
face the same situation in 2010 and 2015, respectively, and the
United States and Britain in 2020, according to the DGBAS.</P>
      <P>In the late-July Conference on Sustaining Taiwan's Economic
Development, it was agreed that the government must do something to
boost Taiwan workers' participation rate, in particular among women
and middle-aged and elderly workers, Economics Ministry officials
said.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan still has some 20 years before the pain to be
created by a dropping workforce becomes acute, the officials said
that the government must take precautions to fend off the possible
impact.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Sunday that
it is the government's job to insist on Taiwan identity, realize
social justice and develop the economy, and he added that if the
government has not done a good job, he would like to apologize and
make a self-examination before "making new start."</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while talking to a group of people
representing different sectors of society in Hualien, eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Reiterating remarks he made a day earlier in Taipei, Chen said he
will "carry the cross of Taiwan's history" during the remainder of
his term, which expires May 20, 2008, although more and more people
are demanding that he step down much earlier than that.</P>
      <P>Following a call last month by a group of pro-Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) academics for him to resign to take moral and
political responsibility for a spate of corruption charges against
his family members and close aides, former DPP Chairman Shih
Ming-teh, who described himself as a "comrade" of the president,
kicked off a "one million people depose the president" campaign
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen said that like other emerging democracies, Taiwan is
experiencing a difficulty of "transition from authoritarianism to
democracy" for which he is under pressure from his critics.</P>
      <P>"But it is the people who have the greatest power. Let's believe
in the people and let them decide [whether I should step down ahead
of schedule]," he said.</P>
      <P>He said his role during the coming one year and nine months will
be like "a trailblazer in the mountains, " with him leading the way
despite injury.</P>
      <P>"But it does not matter. My personal suffering is nothing, " he
added.</P>
      <P>The president reiterated that he respects freedom of the press
and freedom of expression, and he that would rather be criticized by
the media than return the country to the authoritarian days when the
media did not enjoy such freedoms.</P>
      <P>He added that he believes history will leave a record of which

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will not succeed
in his attempts to divert public attention from a series of
corruption and embezzlement scandals implicating himself, his family
members and senior aides, main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the president's address a day earlier at a training
class at the Ketagalan Institute, Ma said it is useless for Chen to
keep tossing out debate topics in an attempt to shift the people's
attention from the scandals.</P>
      <P>Chen proposed a series of plans Saturday, including drafting a
new constitution, applying to join the United Nations under the name
"Taiwan, " submitting a new list of Control Yuan member nominees to
the legislature, and measures to strengthen the people's
identification with Taiwan, including changing the name of Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport to Taipei International Airport.</P>
      <P>Describing Chen as a "spent force," the KMT chairman said tossing
out a series of topics will not make the people of Taiwan believe
Chen is clean and innocent.</P>
      <P>Citing an example, Ma pointed out that the city of Taipei already
has an airport, called Sungshan Airport. "Why should Chiang Kai-shek
international Airport in Taoyuan County be renamed Taipei

      <P>An unofficial tally kept by TV commentators shows that the
president, his family members and senior aides have been involved in
at least 29 corruption and embezzlement scandals since Chen began
serving his first term as president in 2000. Only a few of the
scandals have entered legal proceedings.</P>

      <P>Huang expressed his disagreement with the DOH plan at a news

      <P>Huang urged the DOH to put auxiliary measures in place before

      <P>"It is important to ward off the spread of AIDS, but it should

      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui said in

Chen Shui-bian are "calm and easy, " seen as an attempt to dispel
allegations that Lee and the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
will bash Chen for the string of corruption allegations against
members of his family and close aides.</P>
      <P>During talks with the media after attending a ceremony held in
the southern port city of Kaohsiung to mark the fifth anniversary of
the TSU's founding, Lee said that as a retired president, he had
better not attempt to exert any influence on the incumbent president.</P>
      <P>Lee said Chen and he should show respect and cordiality to each
other and that the last thing he should do is to criticize Chen.</P>
      <P>However, he said it is not the right time for him to meet with
Chen when the country is wracked by the string of corruption
allegations dogging Chen.</P>
      <P>The former president also drew a clear line between him and a
rumor that he is supportive of Vice President Annette Lu's succeeding
Chen with Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng as premier should
Chen resign, saying that the rumor is a complete fabrication.</P>
      <P>Lee also lambasted Premier Su Tseng-chang's advocacy of a more
liberalized China policy, which runs counter to the "active
management, effective opening" principle that Chen spelled out at the
beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>Lee said Su's proposal is nothing but an "economic unification"
plot, which he said not only reneges on the Taiwan people's will but
will also lead Taiwan to across-the-board unification with China.</P>
      <P>Responding to Lee's criticism of Su, Executive Yuan spokesman
Cheng Wen-tsang said the Cabinet respects Lee's freedom of speech.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA TO FIND OUT BUSINESSES' 'REAL NEEDS': ECONOMICS MINISTERBy S.C. ChangCNA Staff Writer</HEADLINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P> New Economics Minister Chen Ruei-long acknowledged that
cross-Taiwan Strait trade and economy is a "sensitive and difficult"
issue that cannot be solved by his ministry alone, but he said his
staff will find out businesses' "real needs" before coming up with
possible solutions.</P>
      <P>During an exclusive interview with the CNA, Chen claimed
that lifting an investment ceiling on Taiwan companies investing in
China would be "oversimplifying" the issue.</P>
      <P>At present, the government bans Taiwan companies from investing
more than 40 percent of their total assets in their operations in
China, a restriction that businesses have long complained limits
their leverage to win greater access to the market.</P>
      <P>"What are their real problems? Are there any alternatives to
investing in China? What would be the impact on Taiwan if other
alternatives were to be adopted? " he asked, adding that he was still
thinking about the precise measures to be adopted.</P>
      <P>Another concern of the business community is that quite a number
of Taiwan's world-leading products have now fallen to No. 2, No. 3 or
even lower in ranking, with critics wondering if Taiwan's
competitiveness has been falling too.</P>
      <P>To this, Chen said that if "made by Taiwan" products are also
counted, as well as "made in Taiwan, " Taiwan could still be ahead in
the individual industries.</P>
      <P>For example, Chen noted, although many of Taiwan's notebook
computer manufacturing lines have moved to China or elsewhere, Taiwan
still controls them and therefore remains influential in this
industry.</P>
      <P>He said that "we need not make everything ourselves. If we could
keep R&amp;D and design, marketing and capital on the island, we would
not have to worry too much about moving manufacturing lines to other
countries."</P>
      <P>Chen suggested that Taiwan corporations devote more human
resources to enhancing competitiveness for items with high added
value, since securing competitive edges for low value-added products
will not be cost-effective.</P>
      <P>He said he is optimistic about the future of Taiwan's high-tech
and service industries, particularly in combining the manufacturing
capabilities with services or high technologies -- an area that he
said Taiwan should invest in.</P>
      <P>On the overall economy, Chen, who became minister barely a week
ago, also showed his upbeat attitude toward the second half of the
year, in which he said he expects performance to be "at least as good
as the first half."</P>
      <P>He cited the export orders and export volumes of recent months,
such as June's record export orders totalling US$24.9 billion and
July's exports totalling US$19.6 billion, both of which represent
monthly highs.</P>
      <P>Since export orders are a leading indicator for the coming
months, Taiwan's exports and industrial production will be quite
impressive for the second half of this year, he predicted.</P>
      <P>The only variables would be rising international oil prices and
interest rates in major economies such as the United States, Japan
and Europe, as oil prices and interest rates will affect Taiwan's
economy, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ELDERLY WILL DEPEND MORE ON SOCIAL WELFARE THAN FILIAL PIETY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The elderly in Taiwan are expected to rely
more on social welfare than on filial piety by 2030, by which time
the country's family and demographic structures will have experienced
major changes, government sources said Sunday.</P>
      <P>With increasing number of Taiwan people getting married later in
life while the country's birth rate continues to decline, financial
support for Taiwan elderly will diminish year by year, causing social
welfare and public services to become important sources of support,
according to officials from the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>According to DGBAS officials, the average age of first-time
mothers in Taiwan stood at 27.7 in 2005, 1.6 years older than that
posted in 1995, while the birth rate declined to 1.1 children in 2005
from 1.8 children posted in 1995.</P>
      <P>In addition to the impact of a shrinking workforce on the economy,
the greying of the population is having a major impact on Taiwan
society, they added.</P>
      <P>The number of people aged over 65 stood at 2.22 million in 2005,
a number which is expected to have tripled by 2050, making Taiwan a
truly grey society, DGBAS officials said in a recently released
demographic report.</P>
      <P>Although there were still 61.7 percent of the elderly aged over
65 who lived with their adult children in 2002, the figure was a
decline of 8.5 percentage points from 1986, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They predicted that most of the elderly in Taiwan will still
depend on their children for financial and family support prior to
2030, but said the situation will change dramatically after that
point as a result of changes in social aspects and demographic
structure.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PEOPLE HESITANT ABOUT GETTING MARRIED: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  13 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Amid the alarming drop in Taiwan's birth
rate, government authorities attributed the phenomenon Sunday to
Taiwan people's reluctance to get married.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a telephone poll carried out by the
Bureau of Health Promotion (BHP) under the Cabinet-level Department
of Health, the ratio of people willing to get married dropped to 58.2
percent at present from 61.5 percent two years ago, while the
percentage of those who are not interested in forming a family rose
to 24.5 percent from 16 percent during the same period.</P>
      <P>On average, nearly 30 percent of Taiwan's single men and women
aged between 20 and 39 are not interested in having a family,
according to the survey.</P>
      <P>As high as 35.9 percent of Taiwan's single men in the 20-39 age
group said that they would not consider getting married due to
economic constraints, while 21.9 percent of their female peers said
that they prefer to enjoy greater freedom by staying unmarried.</P>
      <P>The prime reasons cited by Taiwan's single men and women that
prevented them from getting married were poor economic conditions,
preference for singleness, not having a suitable partner for marriage
and fearing trouble, the poll found.</P>
      <P>As more and more Taiwan people prefer to remain single and more
and more couples have fewer children, the number of this year's
newborns might not exceed 200,000 -- further dropping from last
year's 206,000, the DOH estimated.</P>
      <P>If the situation persists, Taiwan will see a zero-growth rate in
population in 2017, a few years sooner than the earlier projected
2021, BOH officials said, warning that a continued low birth rate
will eventually lead to a shortage in the workforce and put the
spotlight on health care for the elderly.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the Cabinet-level Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), Taiwan's women
of child-bearing age had an average of only 1.1 children last year --
lower than the world average of 2.7 children and the average 1.6
children in developed countries.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's level of 1.1 children per woman is only higher than Hong
Kong's 1.0, but lower than China's 1.6, Japan's 1.3 and South Korea's
1.2, the DGBAS statistics show.</P>

(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Police in Kaohsiung City announced
Sunday the arrest of a fraudster who sold replica firearms as real
guns through the Internet and cheated nearly NT$500,000 out of at
least 20 buyers.</P>
      <P>A police spokesman said they arrested Koh Chao-chin, 44, in an
operation Saturday and seized a number of replica handguns and
submachine guns, along with toy rifle grenades.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said Koh posted a notice on the Internet saying
that he owned a variety of firearms, including rocket launchers, and
would offer low prices to interested buyers.</P>
      <P>Criminals attracted by the seeming bargains remitted money to
Koh's bank account at NT$20,000 for a handgun and NT$100,000 for a
rocket launcher, but Koh never delivered the goods.</P>
      <P>When buyers began to phone Koh to demand delivery, he sent them
photos through the Internet showing himself in handcuffs, along with
a message that he was now in police custody for selling firearms and
that police were trying to find out who the buyers were.</P>
      <P>Fearing they might become targets of police investigation, most
of Koh's victims wrote off the money they had lost, according to

    <TEXT>
      <P>"Thanks for your help. Without it, I would
not be what I am today, " Lee Chun-cheng, associate professor of
accounting at Soochow University, said at a ceremony Sunday to mark
the 56th anniversary of the Taiwan Fund for Children and Families.</P>
      <P>Lee said his father died when he was a university freshman,
plunging the family into poverty.</P>
      <P>As the eldest son, Lee said he undertook the responsibility of
tending the family's rice field, although he could only plow, plant
and harvest during weekends and vacations.</P>
      <P>In order to continue his studies at university, Lee said he
applied for and got grants from the children and families fund.</P>
      <P>Lee said he felt shy when he went to the fund's branch office
near his home to get his first grant, which was paid monthly, but was</P>
      <P>comforted by the fund's staff, who encouraged him not to give up
his aspirations to further his studies.</P>
      <P>"I took heart from the aid granted to me by the children and
families fund and vowed to become a sponsor of it if I became capable
of doing so," he said.</P>
      <P>"I owed the fund whatever little achievement I have had today.
It's help encouraged me to take the bit between my teeth and face up
to the hardship in my life," he went on.</P>
      <P>Lee was one of nine people honored at Sunday's ceremony, all of
whom had been helped by the fund and are now its sponsors.</P>
      <P>The others included the owner of a bakery, the hostess of a radio
show, the owner of a company, a councilor of Pingtung County, a
manager, an engineer, a water technician and a chief of a cleaning
squad at a local government.</P>
      <P>The fund, founded in 1938 under the name of China's Children Fund
by a group of American Christians, has expanded its original cause of
helping Chinese children bereaved of parents by war to helping abused
children or children whose families cannot afford to pay for their
tuition. It now operates 23 offices around the country.</P>

      <P>Anti-avian flu drugs enough for 2.37
million people, or 10 percent of Taiwan's population, have been
prepared for possible epidemics, according to a statement released
Sunday by the Department of Health (DOH).</P>
      <P>Liao Chi-jou, director-general of the Pharmaceutical Affairs
Bureau under the DOH, said the drug reserves includes 627,000 doses
of Tamiflu in capsule form, 1,694 kg of Tamiflu powder and 49,000
diskhalers of Relenza.</P>
      <P>As of the end of July, the DOH had completed the prescription
training of 1,573 local pharmacists on anti-bird flu drugs, who will
be able to prepare dosages for at least 63,000 people per day, Liao
said, adding that in case of extreme situations, the pharmacists will
be able to prepare dosages sufficient for a maximum of 500,000
patients per day.</P>
      <P>Liao noted that 70 percent of the reserved drugs are
pharmaceutical raw materials of Tamiflu, which can be kept for up to

only five to six years.</P>
      <P>According to DOH estimates, besides the current reserves, the
National Health Research Institute, which has received a compulsory
license for Tamiflu from Roche, can also produce Tamiflu from stored
shikimic acid to increase the dosage amount to provide for 17 percent
of Taiwan's population in case of an outbreak.</P>

      <P>A Taiwan businesswoman based in Australia
who has claimed to hold documents proving that some of her receipts
have been used by the first lady returned to Taiwan early Monday
morning to undergo questioning by Taiwan High Court prosecutors as a
witness.</P>
      <P>Ligi Lee, also known as Lee Huei-fen, said upon her arrival at
Chiang Kai-shek International Airport at around 1 a.m. that she has
brought with her four full paper bags of documents, mostly
photocopies of receipts and invoices, so that she can show the
investigators how some of her receipts have been misused.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's wife, Wu Shu-jen, has been accused of
pocketing cash from the Presidential Office's special "state affairs
fund" through reimbursements for fake expenditures, using receipts
provided by Lee Bi-chun, who is a cousin of Ligi Lee.</P>
      <P>According to the investigators, there are mountains of receipts
that President Chen has used to claim "state affairs" expenses, and
Ligi Lee's receipts only constitute a small portion of the total.</P>
      <P>Lee Pi-chun told investigators last week that she had given Hyatt
Hotel invoices to "other people" but that she had no idea why those
invoices ended up in the accounting reports of the Presidential
Office. She also admitted that some of the invoices she gave out
belonged to her cousin Ligi Lee.</P>
      <P>Lee Pi-chun denied that she has ever given the controversial
invoices directly to the first lady, who might have used them to help
her husband claim the "state affairs" expenses. Chen has denied that
he has ever pocketed a single cent from the fund budgeted for his
discretionary use.</P>
      <P>Opposition politicians have charged that the president used "fake
invoices" to claim his "state affairs" expenses after the Ministry of
Audit under the Control Yuan found irregularities in the Presidential
Office accounts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CPC ASSESSING POSSIBILITY OF OIL EXPLORATION IN PARAGUAY, GUATEMALA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp.
(CPC) will step up overseas oil exploration amid soaring world oil
prices, and it is assessing the possibility of oil exploration in
Paraguay and Guatemala, CPC officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>The CPC has sent officials to the two countries in Central and
South America to learn more about the oil reserve information there,
they said. Guatemala is rich in crude oil, while Paraguay is rich in
natural gas, as far as they know, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The CPC is also interested in Sao Tome and Principe after reports
said there are probably oil reserves in waters near the African
country, they said.</P>
      <P>However, the oil reserves are reportedly in a deep-water zone,
and exploration could be costly, they said. With a limited budget for
overseas oil exploration, the CPC will collect more information for
further study, they added.</P>
      <P>The officials made the remarks as new Economic Affairs Minister
Chen Ruey-long said in a recent interview with CNA that he will agree
to the CPC's duly increase of its budget for oil exploration,
although the budget will still have to be passed by the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>CPC officials noted that the budget for oil exploration in 2006
has been set at NT$3.2 billion (US$97.56 million) . The company has
submitted a budget of around NT$3 billion for next year, with
overseas exploration accounting for a large part of it.</P>
      <P>They also said that the CPC's oil exploration in Ecuador and
Venezuela has borne fruit. Crude oil production has begun in Ecuador,
while production in Venezuela will begin at the end of this year or
early next year.</P>
      <P>They stressed that if oil exploration in overseas is successful,
it will not only bring a steady supply of oil but will also create a
surplus for the company and mitigate the impact of soaring oil
prices, which they said are positive for the nation, the company as
well as consumers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN MINISTER DEPARTS FOR THREE-LEG CENTRAL AMERICA VISIT</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister Huang Chih-fang
departed Sunday for a five-day, three-leg visit to Taiwan's
diplomatic allies in Central America, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Panama, Costa Rica and Honduras, Huang is
expected to call on the presidents, foreign ministers as well as
ranking officials of the three countries to exchange views on
bilateral relations as well as various cooperation projects to cement
and promote friendly ties, the MOFA said in a press release.</P>
      <P>Huang will also convene a regional working meeting with ROC
ambassadors and representatives stationed in Central and South
America during his stay in Panama, MOFA spokesman Michel Lu said.</P>
      <P>Huang's visit comes on the heels of Taiwan's severing of
diplomatic ties with Chad in early August. Upon learning that Chad
was ready to resume diplomatic relations with China, Taiwan announced
its decision to sever diplomatic ties with Chad hours before its
premier's scheduled departure for the Chadian capital of N'Djamena
Aug. 6 to attend Chadian President Deby's inauguration for a new term.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT URGED TO OPEN TAIWAN'S DOORS TO CHINESE GRAD STUDENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education was urged Monday
to open Taiwan's doors to Chinese students for postgraduate studies
to help solve problems that have plagued the country's higher
education system.</P>
      <P>At a news conference, a group of scholars associated with the
Taiwan Provincial Education Association and the Education
Reconstruction Alliance urged the education ministry to allow Chinese
college and university graduates to come to Taiwan to attend graduate
school.</P>
      <P>By allowing in Chinese students, they said, Taiwan can solve
problems that have plagued the country's higher education system,
including the fact that many universities have difficulty recruiting
new students due to the large number of universities in the country.</P>
      <P>According to Wang Ling-hui, executive director of the Taiwan
Provincial Education Association, the number of university graduates
in Taiwan doubled within seven years as a result of the government's
relaxing of restrictions on the establishment of new universities and
on the upgrading of colleges and vocational institutes to university
status.</P>
      <P>Wang said that nowadays, higher academic degrees in Taiwan do not
guarantee "higher quality or higher proficiency of the graduates."</P>
      <P>Instead, Wang said, an increased number of university graduates
means higher unemployment. Citing government tallies, she said the
jobless rate among new university graduates surged from 2.67 percent
in 2000 to 4.23 percent in 2005.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Huang Kuang-kuo, a professor at National Taiwan
University and a leader of the Education Reconstruction Alliance,
said the government's "mass production of university graduates" in
recent years has led to low-quality graduates.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that another problem facing Taiwan's higher education
system is that most of the institutes have been unable to raise
funds. Instead, he said, these universities, both public and private,
have relied on government subsidies, with those receiving fewer
subsidies running operating deficits.</P>
      <P>Recruiting students from China will also help these universities
financially, Huang added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Over half of the respondents to a
recent poll say any ministers that are unfit for their jobs should
step down immediately, according to the survey results released
Monday.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by local Global View magazine, shows that
52.4 percent said the economic and finance ministers should step down
immediately if they are not fit for their posts, compared with 18
percent who said a dramatic change of Cabinet ministers would be
unfavorable to the continuity of government policies.</P>
      <P>The poll was unveiled on the heels of a series of major changes
in the nation's financial and economic heads. Chen Ruey-long took
over from Hwang Ing-san as minister of economic affairs, He Chih-chin
replaced Joseph Lyu as finance minister and Shih Jun-ji took over
from Kong Jaw-sheng as chairman of the Cabinet-level Financial
Supervisory Commission.</P>
      <P>The magazine said amid a sluggish economy, more than half the
respondents said newcomers should bring freshness to the
administrative team, with even 47.3 percent of respondents professing
to be supporters of the "pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) holding
that view.</P>
      <P>In addition, the magazine said that more than half of those
polled think Premier Su should dictate his own policy instead of
acting as the executive director of President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Although Chen announced May 30 that he would delegate some of his
power so as to let the premier have a full rein over the Cabinet
personnel, 55.6 percent said they feel that the premier still cannot
act independently, with the controversy over cross-Taiwan Strait
issues during a national economic development conference in late July
an example of this.</P>
      <P>The premier is believed to have advocated a more open attitude
toward cross-strait issues, but the president reiterated the "active
management and effective opening" cross-strait trade policy prior to
the July 27-28 conference.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's announcement of severing diplomatic ties with Chad
Aug. 5, the poll also found that 59 precent said there is no need to
disrupt cross-strait exchanges.
</P>
      <P>Fifty-seven percent also said the government should agree to a
visit by Chen Yulin, director of China's Taiwan Affairs Office under
the State Council, at the invitation of the main opposition
Kuomintang for a forum in Taipei. The KMT later suspended the
invitation due to the sour cross-strait situation resulting from the
Chad issue.</P>

Aug. 10-11, with a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.</P>

      <P>Chen invited visiting Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh

      <P>Sogavare, who arrived in Taipei last Friday, met with Chen at the
Presidential Office, where Chen asked Sogavare to speak for Taiwan in
his capacity as one of the representatives from the Solomon Islands
at the United Nations when it convenes its annual general assembly in
September.</P>
      <P>Chen told Sogavare that for the first time, Taiwan will try to
gain U.N. membership this year under the title "the Republic of China
(Taiwan) ." Taiwan has been using "the Republic of China" in its U.N.
bid for the past 13 years. All attempts have failed due to the
intervention and opposition of Beijing.</P>
      <P>The ROC has been shut out of the United Nations since 1971, when
U.N. Resolution No. 2758 gave the China seat to Beijing at Taiwan's
expense. While Resolution No. 2758 resolved the issue regarding
China's U.N. representation, Chen said it did not address
the representation of Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Taiwan and the Solomon Islands have maintained
formal diplomatic relations for the past 23 years and exchanges in
urban development, anti-poverty projects, agricultural development
and medical as well as public health between the two countries have
been flourishing.</P>

      <P>"In fact, Chairman Lee made quite a substantial contribution to
protecting the KMT's assets," it added.</P>
      <P>It noted that investment is accompanied by risks and suggested
that how the KMT-owned enterprises were operated should be judged by
their net asset values, not by underscoring some profits and losses
related to certain investment projects.</P>
      <P>It said that when Lee left office as KMT chairman, the party's
assets were overall in surplus.</P>
      <P>Investments by the party's enterprises were just "part of the use
of the party assets, " it said, adding that the party leadership
should tell the people what happened to the party's assets, including
how they were used to fund the party's election campaigns in 2000 and
2004.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said some people have
raised questions about the KMT's assets, which should not be confused
with its finances.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the newspaper reports that the KMT is ready to "cut
its ties with Lee, " the so-called "spiritual leader" of the
pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), Wang said it would be
difficult and unrealistic for Ma to do so.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VETERAN RETURNS TO TAIWAN AFTER BEING STRANDED IN XIAMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14 (CNA)
(By Ada Tsai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A 78-year-old veteran returned to his
Taoyuan home Friday after being stranded penniless for several days
in Xiamen City, in China's Fujian Province, officials on the outlying
county of Kinmen said Monday.</P>
      <P>Liu Chia-ho departed for Yunnan Province in southern China Aug.
10 last year to visit his relatives there, and planned to return to
Taiwan via Kinmen, which has ferry service linking with Xiamen.</P>
      <P>However, when he arrived in Xiamen in early August, Liu was
denied entry into Taiwan via Kinmen on the grounds that the ferry
service is reserved only for Taiwan businessmen working in China and
residents of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Liu by this time had run out of money and could not afford to pay
for flight tickets to return to Taiwan through Hong Kong or Macau,
which are the regular routes prescribed for ordinary travelers.</P>
      <P>He asked the Xiamen authorities to relay his requests for entry
permission to the Kinmen county government, which refused him entry.</P>
      <P>Kinmen officials, however, informed the Veteran Affairs
Commission in Taipei of Liu's case, and the commission bought Liu a
ticket for him to return via Macau.</P>
      <P>Noting that many senior veterans originating from China are not
permitted to visit China via Kinmen, the Kinmen county government
called for the relaxation of the current rules to accommodate them,
pointing out that they are usually living on meager government
pensions and are categorized as disadvantaged.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SPEAKER URGES PRESIDENT TO RE-DRAW CONTROL YUAN NOMINEE LIST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
urged President Chen Shui-bian Monday to draw up a new Control Yuan
member nominee list on his own initiative and "not worry" about how
and whether the legislature will handle it.</P>
      <P>Wang said Chen should redraw the list of nominees since some of
his original nominees have passed the legitimate age to be a member,
while others have joined the Cabinet over the past two years.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan, the nation's highest watchdog body, has been
left incomplete since the terms of the previous Control Yuan members
expired in January 2005, as the opposition-dominated legislature is
unsatisfied with some of the president's nominees, especially the
nominee for Control Yuan president, Clement C.P. Chang.</P>
      <P>Chen proposed Saturday drawing up a new list of Control Yuan
member nominees if the opposition promises not to insist on raising
the threshold of confirmation to two-thirds of the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Wang called for the president not to worry that his list will
not have a chance of clearing the legislative floor if the lawmakers
decide to raise the threshold from one-half to two-thirds of the
legislature for approval of the new Control Yuan members.</P>
      <P>Wang said the proposal demanding an amendment to the Organic Law
of the Legislative Yuan to raise the threshold of confirmation of the
members of Judicial, Examination and Control Yuans nominated by Chen
is still pending at the Legislative Yuan Procedure Committee.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that the president should redraw a Control Yuan
member nominee list regardless of whether the two-thirds threshold is
passed or not, adding that the Control Yuan must resume its
operations as soon as possible as a show of respect for the
five-branch government system and to live up to the expectations of
the public.</P>
      <P>"The Legislative Yuan will dutifully perform its task in handling
the Control Yuan member nomination list once the president redraws
and submits the list," he said.</P>

      <P>A jobless man was detained by Hualien city

punching a friend of his father the previous night, an attack that
allegedly caused the man's death early this morning.</P>
      <P>According to Hualien police, 31-year-old Wu Chih-wei admitted to
beating his father's friend and was turned over to the Hualien

    <HEADLINE>KMT: PARTY ASSETS REPORT DOES NOT TARGET FORMER CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The implication that an opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) party assets report is aimed at shifting some
responsibility to former President Lee Teng-hui, who was the KMT's
chairman from 1988-2000, is taking the report out of context, the
party's spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Huang Yu-chen, the leaked report simply details how
party assets were managed at different times and does not target or
criticize Lee.</P>
      <P>He noted that the report, prepared by the party's Deputy
Secretary-General Chang Che-chen and lawyer Lee Yung-jan, describes
how the assets were managed when Chiang Kai-shek, Chiang Ching-kuo,
Lee Teng-hui, Lien Chan and Ma Ying-jeou were at the helm of the
party.</P>
      <P>Ma, who was elected chairman in July last year, has asked his
staff to tackle the controversy over the party's assets "as soon as
possible " and so the party is ready to look at the issue one year
after Ma became party leader, Huang said.</P>
      <P>He said the party will bare all of its assets in an open,
transparent and comprehensive manner and will not try to "shun or
hide" any questions.</P>
      <P>He acknowledged that investment profits and losses, included in
the report, might have been leaked and made into news stories.</P>
      <P>Ma said the report is simply the KMT's "response to people's
expectations" and he expressed surprise it has been interpreted as an
attempt to "cut off ties" with Lee.</P>
      <P>He added that he will explain how the party is going to handle
its assets following an Aug. 23 KMT Central Standing Committee
meeting, when members will discuss the report.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its "pan-green
camp" ally the Taiwan Solidarity Union have tried to legislate a law
to tackle what they call the KMT's "ill-gotten" assets.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH CONFIRMS  LEGIONNAIRES' DISEASE CONTRACTED VIA  SPA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) confirmed
Monday the first case of legionnaires' disease contracted at a spa,
but said the patient has fully recovered after a course of
antibiotics for a few days..</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-yi, deputy director of DOH's Center for Disease Control,
said the patient was a 39-year-old man who was infected by
legionella, a bacterium found primarily in warm water environments,
at the spa in February 2005. Both the disease and the bacterium were
first isolated following an outbreak traced to a 1976 American Legion
convention in Philadelphia.</P>
      <P>Medical examiners found the bacterium in the man's phlegm after
he developed the disease and they also found the bacterium
to be identical to that found in a specimen taken from the spa.</P>
      <P>The specimen had a low level of bacterium, but no signs of the
bacterium were found at the man's home, showing that he was infected
at the spa.</P>
      <P>The operator of the spa has since disinfected his facility, Shih
said.</P>
      <P>The DOH also checked the health of the other patrons of the spa,
but found no additional cases, he added.</P>
      <P>Shih speculated that the man, a heavy smoker and drinker, has
poor lung function and weakened resistente to the bacterium, making
him vulnerable.</P>
      <P>He said the annual incidence rate of legionnaire's disease is
between 0.2 and 0.4 per 100,000 and that Taiwan reports between 10 and
100 cases annually.</P>
      <P>The high risk groups are those who smoke, the elderly, diabetics
and sufferers of kidney disease, with an average mortality rate of
around 15 percent, although there have been no deaths for the past
five or six years, he added.</P>
      <P>The DOH has written a paper based on the case that was published
by the U.S.-based medical journal Microbiology and Immunology.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SPECIAL COMMITTEE FORMED TO OVERSEE TAIWAN-GUATEMALA FTA EXECUTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia  Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An executive committee was established in
Taipei Monday to oversee the execution of a Taiwan-Guatemala free
trade agreement (FTA) that took effect July 1.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long and his Guatemalan
counterpart, Marcio Cuevas, announced the inauguration of the new
commission at a ceremony held at the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA).</P>
      <P>Chen said the committee will be charged with handling matters
related to the FTA, including addressing bilateral trade disputes.</P>
      <P>The committee passed at its Monday meeting unified "country of
origin" certification forms and enforcement rules for resolving trade
disputes under the FTA.</P>
      <P>The agreement is the second such accord Taiwan has signed
following a similar pact with Panama. It is also Guatemala's first
FTA with an Asian country.</P>
      <P>Describing the two countries' economies as complementary to each
other, Chen said the free trade pact will spawn new business
opportunities for both sides, with Guatemalan farm produce finding
new markets in Taiwan while Taiwan's industrial goods will enter
Guatemala on better terms.</P>
      <P>Under the FTA, Chen said, Taiwan has agreed to offer an annual
60,000 ton quota for Guatemalan sugar, which, besides benefiting
Guatemalan farmers, is expected to help stabilize domestic sugar
prices.</P>
      <P>As a Guatemalan FTA with the United States has entered into
force, Chen said, the Central American country can become a major
bastion for Taiwan manufacturers, particularly textile makers,
seeking to tap into the vast U.S. market.</P>
      <P>Under the FTA, 3,964 categories of Taiwan-produced items can now
enjoy tariff-free status on entering the Guatemalan market, while
Taiwan offers tariff-free privileges for Guatemalan products.</P>
      <P>Besides using the tariff-free treatment to expand their
Guatemalan market shares, Chen said, Taiwan companies can also set up
footholds in Guatemala to explore regional markets.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen went on, Taiwan's state-owned Chinese Petroleum
Corp. (CPC) will negotiate with the Guatemalan authorities the
possibility of cooperation in prospecting for oil in that country,
which has rich reserves. The CPC sent oil prospectors to Guatemala
last year on an oilfield survey mission, he added.</P>

      <P>A gangster was recommended for a 10-year

selling modified arms and collecting debts through violent means.</P>
      <P>According to Wang Chieh-tuo, a prosecutor at the Taichung

head of the "Green Grass Gang" in the Miaoli area, was arrested by
police in April in Miaoli and a batch of firearms were discovered.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Monday that
the possibility of the nation applying to join the United Nations
under the name of "Taiwan" this year is small.</P>
      <P>The vice president made the remarks when she attended a ceremony
marking the first anniversary of the Democratic Pacific Union, an
organization she helped found. President Chen Shui-bian and
Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng also attended the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Asked about Chen's proposal Saturday that the nation should
seriously consider joining the U.N. under the name of Taiwan, Lu said
that "some friends" strongly recommended the proposal and that the
Presidential Office convened meetings to study it.</P>
      <P>"But as the General Assembly of the United Nations will soon
open, the timing seems a bit late and the possibility is small this
year, " she said, adding that "whether we should make such a proposal
in the future remains to be seen."</P>
      <P>Wang claimed that the name of the nation has been "the greatest
contention" in the country, where the dispute over unification vs.
independence is persistent.</P>
      <P>Given the sensitivity of the issue, Wang suggested that "the
nation act cautiously and take into consideration the views of other
countries before making a move."</P>
      <P>Lu also said that a Democratic Pacific Legislative Caucus will be
established Dec. 8, which will rely heavily on Wang's assistance.
This, she went on, is the gist of a so-called "Lu-Wang alliance."</P>
      <P>The reported alliance surfaced last week when a local newspaper
said that should Lu succeed Chen -- who has been dogged by corruption
allegations implicating himself, members of his family and his top
aides -- Wang would be appointed premier, which reportedly is favored
by former President Lee Teng-hui, who still has some clout in Taiwan
politics.</P>
      <P>Lu said that the forming of the legislative caucus will need the
cooperation of the Legislative Yuan and that Wang also thinks the
matter is important.</P>
      <P>"There is no need to speculate further," Lu said. </P>
      <P>Wang said the second DPU conference will be held Dec. 8, at which
point the legislative caucus will be established.</P>
      <P>Lu said more than 50 legislators from at least 20 countries will
take part in the conference, hoping to increase understanding of the
operations and elections of the legislatures in various countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAINAN COUNTY HEAD WANTS BINAN INDUSTRIAL PARK PROJECT SCRAPPED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 14 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-chih urged
Premier Su Tseng-chang Monday to abolish the Binan Industrial Park
development plan in order to preserve the county's Chiku wetland
habitat for the critically endangered black-faced spoonbill.</P>
      <P>Su vowed that during his four-year term as magistrate, he will
never issue a permit to allow the project to begin, although an
environmental impact assessment approved by the Cabinet-level
Environmental Protection Administration in 1999 was finalized by the
Democratic Progressive Party-led government in January this year.</P>
      <P>Su recommended that the Cabinet withdraw its approval of the
report on grounds the Binan industrial complex project would ruin
6,000 hectares of wetlands and seriously impact the local ecosystem.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the industrial park would become the site of
highly polluting industries, such as Taiwan's Seventh Naphtha Cracker
and the Yieh Loong steel plant.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he added, the development plan goes against Taiwan's
commitments to control the level of greenhouse gas emissions, as set
by the Koyto Protocol.</P>
      <P>"The project is totally contradictory to the concept of
ecological conservation," he said, adding that procedures behind the
government's review of the environmental impact are "highly
suspicious."</P>
      <P>International conservationists have reminded Taiwan's authorities
of the critical role played by the Chiku wetlands -- it is the winter
habitat of more than 70 percent of the world's population of
black-faced spoonbills.</P>
      <P>The rare birds -- estimated at about 800 -- migrate between areas
in North and South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, China, Vietnam and the
Philippines.</P>
      <P>In addition to the threat to wildlife in the Chiku wetlands'
ecosystem, there are serious concerns the park's construction may
speed up coastal erosion, destroy sandbars, adversely affect water
resources and harm the local fishing industry.</P>

Wall Street Journal: Flight Risk, Laptop
Dangers Draw Scrutiny From Airline-Safety
Regulators

Long before last week's foiled plot to blow
up airlines using material secreted in carry-on
luggage, a growing number of transportation and
product-safety officials had expressed concerns
that batteries in laptops and other electronics
pose a serious risk to airplanes -- for reasons
completely unrelated to global terror. Although 
the risk is small, the Consumer Product Safety
Commission has documented 339 cases of lithium
and lithium-ion batteries for portable
electronics overheating, emitting smoke and
fumes or exploding since 2003. There is no
record of a serious injury or death, but the
Federal Aviation Administration has logged 60
incidents since 1991. In the past two years, six
incidents have occurred on aircraft, including
five fires and an overheated flashlight that had
to be handled with oven mitts.</TEXT>

      <P>Two former Kaohsiung City officials in
charge of labor affairs were found not guilty Monday of charges
related to importing Thai workers to work on the city's rapid transit
project.</P>
      <P>A surprised prosecution said they would consider appealing the
ruling after receiving the Kaohsiung District Court's verdict.</P>
      <P>Both Fang Lai-chin, former director of the city's Bureau of Labor
Affairs, and Kuo Keng-hua, a section chief under Fang, were found not
guilty based on the prosecution's lack of evidence.</P>
      <P>The court ruled it was the Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs
(CLA) that had authorized bringing more than 1,800 Thai workers to
Taiwan through a special program -- not the city's Bureau of Labor
Affairs.</P>
      <P>The judges said there was no evidence to prove Fang and Kuo had
attempted to profit Kaohisung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) and Huapan
Administration Consultant Co., which was authorized to import and
manage the Thai workers.</P>
      <P>Kuo was also found not guilty on charges of dereliction of duty
-- for having failed to act on an "early warning" petition from Thai
workers complaining of harsh treatment by Huapan staff.</P>
      <P>The court said Kuo must have had the petition translated into
Chinese to learn of the real circumstances of the situation, and that
his handling of it did not have a cause-and-effect relationship with
the workers' riot in August, 2005. That riot brought to light a host
of suspected irregularities concerning labor management and the
awarding of construction projects for the transit system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TINY KUIPER BELT ROCKS DISCOVERED BY TAIWAN ASTRONOMERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14 (CNA)
(By Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tiny Kuiper Belt objects, rocks of 100
meters or less in diameter, have been spotted for the first time by
an astronomical research team at National Tsing-hua University
(NTHU), according to a press release issued by the university Monday.</P>
      <P>The team, organized by Professor Chang Hsiang-Kuang, proved the
existence of the objects by analyzing the time "bins" -- the duration
of occultations -- in X-rays emitted by the star Scorpius X- 1.</P>
      <P>Their findings have been published by the renowned scientific
journal Nature in its Aug. 10 issue.</P>
      <P>Astronomers have long suggested that there should be billions of
Kuiper Belt objects beyond the planet Neptune, which are sometimes
referred to as "trans-neptunian objects." However, due to the limits
in visible light observation, objects with diameters of less than 1,
000 meters had never been discovered.</P>
      <P>The Kuiper Belt is an area surrounding the solar system extending
from the orbit of Neptune, at 30 astronomical units (AU) , to 50 AU
from the Sun.</P>
      <P>Chang and his team utilized X-ray data collected by the Rossi X-
ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) of the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space
Administration to see the minute rocks, because occultations as short
as one millisecond are still perceivable in X-ray observation.</P>
      <P>When combing through the RXTE database, the team found 58
suspicious time bins -- dips in light -- in the X-ray records of
Scorpius X-1, a neutron star 9,000 light years from Earth. These
possible occultations were later re-examined in a control comparison
by the team.</P>
      <P>Chang explained that in order to rule out the possibility that
the dips are caused by instrumental errors, they ran a second search
through the data of the Crab nebula, which is an extensive source of
X-rays, unlike Scorpius X-1, a point source of X-rays.</P>
      <P>The reason to use the Crab nebula is that if there is really a
tiny rock existing in Kuiper belt, while the rock can entirely block
Scorpius X-1's light, it would not be able to obscure the Crab
nebula's, Chang noted, adding that if the time bins exist in both
databases, then they are uncertainly instrumental errors; otherwise,
the dips would lead to the finding of trans-neptunian objects.</P>
      <P>The result showed that the dips were caused by tiny rocks in the
Kuiper Belt and the estimated the number of rocks as being up to 10
to the power of 15.</P>
      <P>The team now plans to measure the distance from Earth to these
small objects.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BUSINESS TURNOVER OF 3 HIGH-TECH PARKS MAY HIT RECORD: NSC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The combined business turnover of the
country's three largest high-tech industry parks may hit a record
high of NT$2 trillion (US$60.61 billion) this year, the National
Science Council (NSC) said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to NSC tallies, the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial
Park's business turnover amounted to NT$540 billion in the first half
of the year, compared to the Central Taiwan Science Park's NT$70.56
billion and the Southern Taiwan Science Park's NT$211.97 billion.</P>
      <P>The three parks' year-on-year growth rates were 21 percent, 198.4
percent and 50.7 percent, respectively, according to NSC statistics.</P>
      <P>NSC Vice Chairman Tai Chien said the three parks' combined
business turnover for 2006 is conservatively estimated at NT$1.77
trillion, but if the global economy remains robust or grows even
faster, their total sales may set a record of NT$2 trillion by year's
end.</P>
      <P>Yen Chung-ming, deputy director of the Hsinchu Science-based
Industrial Park Administration, said the park posted a 21 percent
year-on-year growth in its first half-year business volume, with IC,
optoelectronics and precision machinery industries registering the
most significant gains of 21 percent, 54 percent and 40 percent,
respectively.</P>
      <P>In contrast, computer peripherals manufacturers in the Hsinchu
park suffered a 2 percent decrease in business turnover in the
first half of the year; the communications industry registered a 16
percent decline; while business in the biotechnology sector was flat
for the same period. The Hsinchu park's overall business revenues for
2006 are estimated at NT$1.15 trillion, Yen added.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-huang, deputy director of the Central Taiwan Science
Park Administration, said the park's overall business volume for the
first six months doubled year-on-year, with the optoelectronics
industry accounting for 93.13 percent of the total. The park's annual
turnover is expected to hit NT$120 billion.</P>
      <P>Chen Chun-wei, director of the Southern Taiwan Science Park, said
companies there have become more pessimistic about business
prospects in the coming three to six months because of a combination
of factors, including skyrocketing crude oil prices, re-emergence of
terrorist attack threats and the domestic political turmoil.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen said, the park's overall business volume is
expected to increase to NT$500 billion by year's end thanks to a
rebound in the TFT-LCD industry boosted by a steady decline in flat
panel prices.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FIRST DAY OF DRIVE TO REMOVE CHEN FROM OFFICE DRAWS NT$10 MILLION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Between 50,000 and 70,000 people donated
nearly NT$10 million to a campaign calling for "one million people to
depose President Chen Shui-bian" Monday, in a drive initiated over
the weekend by former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman
Shih Ming-teh.</P>
      <P>Shih called on members of the public to each contribute NT$100,
saying if within 30 days less than one million people have made
donations, it would mean the country's "anti-corruption forces" are
still not strong enough and that Chen will likely continue to be
their national leader.</P>
      <P>Accountant Lin Hsien-lang said NT$9.35 million was received in
two designated bank accounts. If donations made to a designated
postal account are added, the first-day amount would exceed NT$10
million.</P>
      <P>But he said not all donors were contributing NT$100 as campaign
organizers hoped -- some have remitted NT$10,000 or NT$5,000. He
urged supporters to contribute just NT$100 to make it easier to
calculate the number of donors.</P>
      <P>Lawyer Huang Hsu-tien said all donations will be used to organize
sit-ins scheduled to begin Sept. 9 in front of the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>"Each dollar from the donations can be used only after my chop
and that of Yeh Ta-hui, another lawyer, have been stamped on a
receipt. We will monitor the use of the funds very closely, " Huang
added.</P>
      <P>Shih said he was organizing the campaign because "legal means
within the establishment" were no longer useful to solve current
problems.</P>
      <P>He claimed that what he and fellow organizers were adopting was
"political means within the establishment" -- by rallying the voices
of a million people to give Taiwan a fresh start, after driving Chen
out of office.</P>
      <P>He said the current DPP leadership is "corrupt at the roots" and
people in Taiwan will teach them "what morality means."</P>
      <P>In response, DPP spokesman Tsai Huang-lang said 99 percent of DPP
politicians in government and party posts are "hard-working and
clean, " as all of the DPP members are required to observe the
"highest moral standards."</P>

    <HEADLINE>HIGH-PROFILE PROTECTION OF KEY WITNESS JUSTIFIED: PROSECUTORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Public Prosecutors' Office at the
Taiwan High Court defended itself Monday, saying that its
high-profile protection of a key witness in a case involving
President Chen Shui-bian's suspected embezzlement of state affairs
funds is justified.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the High Court's Prosecutors' Office made the
remarks in response to criticism by legislators of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) that the Investigation Bureau
"made a fuss" by providing "chief of state-class protection" to a
Taiwanese businesswoman based in Australia who returned to Taiwan
around midnight Sunday to provide evidence in the case.</P>
      <P>More than 100 law enforcement officers were escorting Lee when
she arrived at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport. Agents from the
Investigation Bureau are reportedly providing round-the-clock
protection during Lee's stay in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The spokesman also said that before Lee departed from Australia,
the High Prosecutors' Office had obtained her consent that she would
be protected as a key witness.</P>
      <P>"Providing protection for Lee is fundamental and necessary," he
said, adding, "The measure will allow prosecutors to proceed with
their investigation smoothly and let other witnesses feel safe during
the investigation."</P>
      <P>Lee claimed she has brought documents with her to prove that her
cousin, Lee Bi-chun, took many of her hotel and shopping receipts and
gave them to the first lady, Su Shu-jen.</P>
      <P>Initial probes by the Ministry of Audit showed some of Lee's
receipts were used by the president to claim state affairs allowances
for fake expenditures.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug.  14 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) under the
Cabinet is considering amending the Animal Protection Act to increase
the penalty for maltreatment of animals.</P>
      <P>A COA spokesman said Monday that a recent case of animal cruelty
indicates that it may be time to amend the law to provide better
protection for animals.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan's Animal Protection Act, promulgated in 1998, those
found guilty of animal cruelty can face a fine of between NT$10,00
and NT$50,000.</P>
      <P>Animal welfare advocates have complained that the current law
does not serve as a deterrent against cruel behavior toward animals.</P>
      <P>An Internet user recently posted photos online showing how he
enjoyed abusing his kitten in a sadistic manner. Other animal-loving
Internet users managed to track him down, but law enforcement
agencies found the most they could do was to fine him NT$50,000.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>How much does a policy flip-flop cost? For
stopping and then resuming construction on the fourth nuclear power
plant in Taipei County, taxpayers paid NT$7.2 billion (US$2.2
million), according to a report released by the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) Monday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the total budget for building the controversial plant
has been adjusted upward from NT$169.7 billion to NT$233.5 billion,
the CEPD said, adding that if all goes well, the power plant will
begin commercial operations in 2009.</P>
      <P>The government halted the plant's construction in 2000 but
resumed work the next year, a delay costing NT$7.2 billion in broken
contractual obligations.</P>
      <P>When the project was announced in 1992, the government approved a
total budget of NT$169.7 billion for its completion; by 2004, that
figure had increased to NT$188.8 billion.</P>
      <P>At one time, the Ministry of Economic Affairs called for a
total of NT$243.1 billion to wrap up the project. A CEPD work
group cut NT$9.6 billion from that estimate, leaving the final budget
of NT$233.5 billion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUTISTIC YOUTH WITH MUSIC TALENT GAINS ADMISSION TO UNIVERSITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Aug. 14 (CNA)
(By Ada Tsai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lee Shang-hsuan, a 19-year-old autistic
pianist with multiple disabilities, has successfully gained admission
to a local university to further develop his musical talent.</P>
      <P>Lee was born with G-6-PD deficiency -- a hereditary, sex-linked
enzyme defect that results in the breakdown of red blood cells when
the person is exposed to stress from infection or certain drugs. He
was further diagnosed as a "hyperactive autistic child with
medium-grade mental disability" at the age of 3 -- yet he is gifted
with an extraordinary memory for numbers and musical scores.</P>
      <P>Undaunted by his multiple deficiencies, his parents have devoted
an enormous amount of energy and patience toward fostering and
developing his talent in the musical field.</P>
      <P>He began to play piano at the age of 4. With his acute
sensitivity to sound and rhythm and his exceptional ability to
memorize musical scores, Lee quickly excelled; his piano teacher
praised him as a genius.</P>
      <P>Over the past 15 years, Lee has taken part in numerous piano
competitions, both nationwide and for the mentally or physically
challenged, winning numerous medals. In 2005, he won one of the top
honors in a national piano contest for senior high school students.</P>
      <P>Lee has gradually gained international fame, capturing two awards
in the first international Paralympic piano competition held in Japan
last year, and is scheduled to give a piano recital at the National
Concert Hall in Taipei Jan. 27, 2007.</P>
      <P>Lee graduated from a special school in NanTzu, Kaohsiung last
year. Because of his multiple disabilities, he was unable to pass any
entrance exams for local universities.</P>
      <P>But through coordination among the Presidential Office,
educational authorities and several universities in southern Taiwan,
Pingtung University finally agreed to admit Lee as a student at the
school's special educational resources center so he can continue his
musical training.</P>

      <P>Tsai Duei, political deputy minister of
transportation and communications, will take over the helm of the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC), Executive Yuan
sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the source, Premier Su Tseng-chang made up his mind
to promote Tsai to the MOTC's top post after comprehensive talks with
Tsai in the evening.</P>
      <P>Tsai will succeed Kuo Yao-chi who tendered her resignation Aug. 7
amid the shambles surrounding the controversial electronic toll
collection (ETC) system on the nation's freeways.</P>
      <P>A seasoned technocrat at the MOTC, Tsai said he is grateful to
the premier for promoting him to a key post.</P>
      <P>On the thorny ETC issue, Tsai said the MOTC will deal with it in
a very circumspective manner under the principle of respecting the
Supremer Administrative Court ruling on the case.</P>
      <P>Throughout his 37-year career in public service, Tsai has spent
36 years working at the MOTC, with only a one-year stint at the
Public Construction Commission.</P>
      <P>Before becoming an MOTC deputy minister, Tsai had been director
of the Civil Aeronautics Administration and a deputy director of the
Directorate General of Telecommunications, which used to be under the
jurisdiction of the MOTC, but is now administered by the National
Communications Commission.</P>
      <P>The ETC project, which had already become a scandal when Kuo took
over as transport minister Jan. 25 this year, was ruled by the
Supreme Administrative Court early this month as illegal because the
MOTC did not follow the principles of equality and public interest in
awarding the project to Far Eastern Electronic Toll Co. (FETC).</P>
      <P>The FETC, which was stripped of its "priority applicant" status
in winning the contract as a result of the ruling, has been running

    <TEXT>
      <P>How much does a policy flip-flop cost? For
stopping and then resuming construction on the fourth nuclear power
plant in Taipei County, taxpayers paid NT$7.2 billion (US$2.2
million), according to a report released by the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) Monday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the total budget for building the controversial plant
has been adjusted upward from NT$169.7 billion to NT$233.5 billion,
the CEPD said, adding that if all goes well, the power plant will
begin commercial operations in 2009.</P>
      <P>The government halted the plant's construction in 2000 but
resumed work the next year, a delay costing NT$7.2 billion in broken
contractual obligations.</P>
      <P>When the project was announced in 1992, the government approved a
total budget of NT$169.7 billion for its completion; by 2004, that
figure had increased to NT$188.8 billion.</P>
      <P>At one time, the Ministry of Economic Affairs called for a
total of NT$243.1 billion to wrap up the project. A CEPD work
group cut NT$9.6 billion from that estimate, leaving the final budget
of NT$233.5 billion.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Between 50,000 and 70,000 people donated
nearly NT$10 million to a campaign calling for "one million people to
depose President Chen Shui-bian" Monday, in a drive initiated over
the weekend by former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman
Shih Ming-teh.</P>
      <P>Shih called on members of the public to each contribute NT$100,
saying if within 30 days less than one million people have made
donations, it would mean the country's "anti-corruption forces" are
still not strong enough and that Chen will likely continue to be
their national leader.</P>
      <P>Accountant Lin Hsien-lang said NT$9.35 million was received in
two designated bank accounts. If donations made to a designated
postal account are added, the first-day amount would exceed NT$10
million.</P>
      <P>But he said not all donors were contributing NT$100 as campaign
organizers hoped -- some have remitted NT$10,000 or NT$5,000. He
urged supporters to contribute just NT$100 to make it easier to
calculate the number of donors.</P>
      <P>Lawyer Huang Hsu-tien said all donations will be used to organize
sit-ins scheduled to begin Sept. 9 in front of the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>"Each dollar from the donations can be used only after my chop
and that of Yeh Ta-hui, another lawyer, have been stamped on a
receipt. We will monitor the use of the funds very closely, " Huang
added.</P>
      <P>Shih said he was organizing the campaign because "legal means
within the establishment" were no longer useful to solve current
problems.</P>
      <P>He claimed that what he and fellow organizers were adopting was
"political means within the establishment" -- by rallying the voices
of a million people to give Taiwan a fresh start, after driving Chen
out of office.</P>
      <P>He said the current DPP leadership is "corrupt at the roots" and
people in Taiwan will teach them "what morality means."</P>
      <P>In response, DPP spokesman Tsai Huang-lang said 99 percent of DPP
politicians in government and party posts are "hard-working and
clean, " as all of the DPP members are required to observe the
"highest moral standards."</P>

      <P> (repeat)</P>
      <P>Taipei, Aug. 14 (CNA) The Public Prosecutors' Office at the
Taiwan High Court defended itself Monday, saying that its
high-profile protection of a key witness in a case involving
President Chen Shui-bian's suspected embezzlement of state affairs
funds is justified.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the High Court's Prosecutors' Office made the
remarks in response to criticism by legislators of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) that the Investigation Bureau
"made a fuss" by providing "chief of state-class protection" to a
Taiwanese businesswoman based in Australia who returned to Taiwan
around midnight Sunday to provide evidence in the case.</P>
      <P>More than 100 law enforcement officers were escorting Lee when
she arrived at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport. Agents from the
Investigation Bureau are reportedly providing round-the-clock
protection during Lee's stay in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The spokesman also said that before Lee departed from Australia,
the High Prosecutors' Office had obtained her consent that she would
be protected as a key witness.</P>
      <P>"Providing protection for Lee is fundamental and necessary," he
said, adding, "The measure will allow prosecutors to proceed with
their investigation smoothly and let other witnesses feel safe during
the investigation."</P>
      <P>Lee claimed she has brought documents with her to prove that her
cousin, Lee Bi-chun, took many of her hotel and shopping receipts and
gave them to the first lady, Su Shu-jen.</P>
      <P>Initial probes by the Ministry of Audit showed some of Lee's
receipts were used by the president to claim state affairs allowances

    <TEXT>
      <P>Lee Shang-hsuan, a 19-year-old autistic
pianist with multiple disabilities, has successfully gained admission
to a local university to further develop his musical talent.</P>
      <P>Lee was born with G-6-PD deficiency -- a hereditary, sex-linked
enzyme defect that results in the breakdown of red blood cells when
the person is exposed to stress from infection or certain drugs. He
was further diagnosed as a "hyperactive autistic child with
medium-grade mental disability" at the age of 3 -- yet he is gifted
with an extraordinary memory for numbers and musical scores.</P>
      <P>Undaunted by his multiple deficiencies, his parents have devoted
an enormous amount of energy and patience toward fostering and
developing his talent in the musical field.</P>
      <P>He began to play piano at the age of 4. With his acute
sensitivity to sound and rhythm and his exceptional ability to
memorize musical scores, Lee quickly excelled; his piano teacher
praised him as a genius.</P>
      <P>Over the past 15 years, Lee has taken part in numerous piano
competitions, both nationwide and for the mentally or physically
challenged, winning numerous medals. In 2005, he won one of the top
honors in a national piano contest for senior high school students.</P>
      <P>Lee has gradually gained international fame, capturing two awards
in the first international Paralympic piano competition held in Japan
last year, and is scheduled to give a piano recital at the National
Concert Hall in Taipei Jan. 27, 2007.</P>
      <P>Lee graduated from a special school in NanTzu, Kaohsiung last
year. Because of his multiple disabilities, he was unable to pass any
entrance exams for local universities.</P>
      <P>But through coordination among the Presidential Office,
educational authorities and several universities in southern Taiwan,
Pingtung University finally agreed to admit Lee as a student at the
school's special educational resources center so he can continue his
musical training.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The British government should take heed of
the British House of Commons' Foreign Affairs Committee's calls for
more political contact with Taiwan, a diplomatic official said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The British parliamentary committee issued its first East Asian
report in seven years on Monday. The 152-page report contains nine
pages exclusively dealing with Taiwan-related topics.</P>
      <P>The report urged the British government to work to have the
European Union (E.U.) maintain its ban on arms sales to China. The
ban has remained in place since the 1989 Tiananmen massacre in which
Chinese troops brutally cracked down on pro-democracy demonstrators.</P>
      <P>It further called for the British executive branch to back Taiwan
in the latter's quest for full membership in the World Health
Organization (WHO), in addition to increasing political contact with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that China's military expansion, particularly its missile
deployment along its southeastern coast opposite Taiwan, poses a
threat to East Asian peace and stability, the report said the British
government should continue pushing the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
to resolve their disputes by peaceful means.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, the official with the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said the Republic of China government
appreciates the British Parliament's Taiwan-friendly proposals and
hopes other E.U. member states can take a similar stance and support
Taiwan's WHO bid.</P>
      <P>The British parliamentary committee started a review of British
relations with East Asian countries early this year. In May, Mike
Gapes, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of
Commons, headed a nine-member group on a visit to Hong Kong, Beijing,
Tibet, Shanghai and Taipei to gather first-hand information about the
latest situation in the region in preparation for collating a
comprehensive report for policymaking reference.</P>
      <P>During the delegation's visit to China, Chinese officials
fiercely dissuaded the delegation from traveling to Taiwan. However,
the delegation issued a statement rejecting China's request and
reaffirming that the committee will continue voicing its support for
democratic countries around the world, including Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The British parliamentary delegation arrived in Taiwan May 17 for
a two-day visit, during which the group met with President Chen
Shui-bian, Minister of Foreign Affairs Huang Chih-fang and other
senior government officials to obtain a better understanding of
Taiwan's political and economic development and cross-strait
relations.</P>

      <P>Bilateral cooperation between Panama

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two national universities jointly debuted
Taiwan's first locally-developed remotely operated underwater vehicle
(ROV) Tuesday, marking a giant step forward for Taiwan in the
development of ocean exploration technology.</P>
      <P>The unmanned, highly maneuverable underwater robot, jointly
developed by students and professors from National Cheng Kung
University (NCKU) and National Sun Yat-sen University (NSYSU) , was
officially presented at a news conference held at the Ministry of
Education.</P>
      <P>After three years of planning, research, development, design and
testing, the Taiwan-made ROV underwent final laboratory testing at a
depth of 200 meters earlier this year. The vehicle passed the 12-hour
test, said Fang Ming-chuan, a professor with NCKU's Department of
Systems and Naval Mechatronic Engineering, who is also director of
the ROV development project.</P>
      <P>The ROV passed further testing in June in waters off
Hsiaoliuchiu, an islet to Taiwan's southeast, operated by a person
aboard a surface vessel, Fang said, adding that the vehicle
successfully acquired underwater images and other information about
the seas, including the depth, location, water clarity, light
penetration and temperature, during the testing.</P>
      <P>Fang said ROVs and ROV technology can be used for many
applications, including national defense, ocean energy development,
underwater engineering, underwater rescue and search, archaeological
work and maritime environment research.</P>
      <P>He said that the Taiwan-developed ROV is equal in quality to
those currently available in Western countries and that its
production cost is only about half that of Western-made ROVs.</P>
      <P>According to Fang, since most foreign-made ROVs are not capable
of resisting strong currents, which are prevalent in the seas
surrounding Taiwan, his team will focus on the development of
current-resistant ROVs as the immediate goal of the team's work.</P>

      <P>Taiwan High Prosecutors Office has twice
asked the Control Yuan for asset reports filed by President Chen
Shui-bian, a Control Yuan official confirmed Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Yu-nan, director of the department in charge of asset
reporting by high-ranking officials, said that the Control Yuan first
received a request from Taiwan High Prosecutors Office to provide all
asset reports filed by the president dating back to the start of
his first term in 2000, including two recent corrected versions
on the assets of the first family, on Aug. 4.</P>
      <P>Taiwan High Prosecutors Office asked to review President Chen's
supplementary report on 31 pieces of jewelry of first lady Wu Shu-jen
again Monday, Hsieh added.</P>
      <P>Asked about the reasons for reviewing the asset reports, Hsieh
said that whenever law enforcement officials feel there is a need in
their investigations, they will make such a request.</P>
      <P>According to the Public Functionary Assets Disclosure Law, any
piece of jewelry, including watches, worth over NT$200,000
(US$6,100) should be listed with the Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>The first couple sent a corrected version of jewelry assets to

luxury watches that they own, with a total value of NT$3.72 million.</P>
      <P>Legislators from the opposition Kuomintang and People First Party
then produced photos of 31 pieces of jewelry worn by the first lady
on various occasions. The Control Yuan therefore asked for an
explanation from the first family within 15 days.</P>
      <P>The first couple replied on the last day of the deadline that
they had acquiesced to the Control Yuan's request by filing reports

    <HEADLINE>DPP LAWMAKER URGES FORMER CHAIRMAN TO STOP DEPOSE-PRESIDENT CAMPAIGN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
legislator urged former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh Tuesday to stop
his campaign calling on one million people to donate NT$100 each
toward deposing scandal-ridden President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Wang Shih-chien called on Shih not to "please our enemy and
inflict pain on our camp" after some 70,000 people donated almost
NT$10 million in support of Shih's campaign on the very first day
Monday. Shih launched the drive over the weekend.</P>
      <P>Shih has said that if the one million target is reached earlier
than Sept. 9, he will move ahead his schedule to take the people to
the streets to demand that the president step down for the sake of
Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>Wang said it would not be a problem at all for Shih to win one
million supporters since the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) alone has
more than two million members and the KMT has recently been
"fattened" by selling huge amounts of its "ill-gotten" assets.</P>
      <P>"As long as the KMT clandestinely encourages its members to
donate money to Shih, his good reputation will be ruined, " Wang
claimed.</P>
      <P>He said that he believes Shih will be able to collect NT$100
million soon, adding, however, that he would like to remind Shih "not
to take the KMT's money" in order to avoid tainting his own name.</P>

      <P>As high as 79 percent of the people in
Taiwan are in favor of the proposal that the country apply to join
the United Nations under the name of Taiwan, according to the results
of a survey released Tuesday by the Taiwan Thinktank.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by Focus Survey Research for the think tank
from Aug. 10-11 on 1,072 adults, has a margin of error of plus or
minus 2.99 percentage points.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 81.4 percent of the respondents said
they are aware that Taiwan and Chad recently severed diplomatic
relations. While 42 percent of the respondents think that China's
suppression of Taiwan and its efforts to tempt Taiwan's diplomatic
allies with financial offers were to blame for the outcome, 24
percent think that the failure of Taiwan's diplomatic policy was
responsible, and 23 percent think that the Chadian government was
acting "too expediently."</P>
      <P>Sixty-five percent of the respondents think that it was an insult
to the people of Taiwan for Chad to announce its decision to switch
recognition to Beijing right before Premier Su Tseng-chang's
scheduled visit to Chad.</P>
      <P>The survey shows that after this incident, only 8.6 percent of
the people have a positive impression of China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 68 percent of the respondents think that Taiwan should
continue to develop its foreign relations even if this leads to
increased tensions in cross-Taiwan Strait ties.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan facing increasingly relentless suppression from
China, 38 percent of the respondents think that Taiwan should
negotiate with Beijing for a resolution, 35 percent think that Taiwan
should seek breakthroughs on its own, and 18 percent think that
Taiwan should seek the assistance of other countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA'S DIPLOMATIC SUPPRESSION HAS HURT CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGES: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China's relentless diplomatic suppression
of Taiwan has hurt cross-strait exchanges, Huang Wei-feng, deputy
chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) , said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks during a seminar on "The Public's View on
Taiwan's Current Diplomacy" sponsored by the Taiwan Thinktank.</P>
      <P>He said Beijing's suppression has not only hurt the Taiwan
people's feelings and dignity, it has also led the Taiwan people to
doubt China's sincerity in trying to improve cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>He noted that Beijing has adopted a policy "of sabotaging
Taiwan's diplomatic relations with its allies, containing the
maneuvering space of Taiwan internationally, and squeezing all of
Taiwan's bargaining chips for engaging in talks with China on an
equal footing."</P>
      <P>"And this diplomatic offensive has been conducted under the guise
of a peaceful development," he added.</P>
      <P>Hsu Yung-ming, an assistant researcher at Academia Sinica, the
nation's highest research institute, said on the same occasion that
Taiwan's severance of diplomatic ties with Chad recently was due to
the internal struggle between China's forces in charge of
cross-strait affairs and those in charge of diplomatic affairs.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who just returned from a visit to China, said that those
forces in China in charge of cross-strait affairs have performed
brilliantly over the past few years, resulting in pressure on those
forces in charge of diplomatic affairs.</P>
      <P>Taiwan severed diplomatic ties with Chad hours ahead of Premier
Su Tseng-Chang's scheduled departure for Chad Aug. 6. Taiwan
made the move upon learning that the Central African country was
about to re-establish diplomatic relations with China.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign AFfairs spokesman Michel Lu said that the
Chad incident has made the Taiwan people realize the diplomatic
difficulties that the nation is facing.</P>
      <P>Lu expressed the hope that the public will understand that
although the number of Taiwan's diplomatic allies, currently standing
at 24, is important, more attention should be paid to "substantive
diplomacy, " referring to such matters as trade, high-tech exchanges,
medical assistance, and exchanges between non-governmental
organizations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Democratic Action League (DAL), which
has obtained a permit to use Ketagalan Boulevard in downtown Taipei
Sept. 9-10, said Tuesday it has invited supporters from former
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Shih Ming-teh's "one
million people campaign to depose President Chen Shui-bian."</P>
      <P>DAL convener Huang Kuang-kuo said since his group launched a
"democracy night market" campaign at Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall
July 27, it has also been engaged in a national campaign to drive the
scandal-ridden president out of office.</P>
      <P>"We've been trying to awaken people's social conscience, hoping
they can rise above their political differences marked by the
'pan-blue' and 'pan-green' colors," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Since DAL and Shih's campaigns share a common goal, Huang said
his group would be happy to share the boulevard with Shih's
supporters so more people can join forces and push for change in the
nation's politics.</P>
      <P>Huang said as the president appeared dead set on remaining in
power, the DAL's national campaign would "wage a war of nerves" with
Chen, a war he claimed would never cease until the president steps
down.</P>
      <P>Besides rallying on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the
Presidential Office, DAL members -- mostly intellectuals -- and
supporters will also stroll past the president's residence --
code-named Yushan or Jade Mountain -- to show their discontent with
Chen, whose family members and senior aides have been indicted on
insider trading and other corruption charges.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tsai Tui, deputy minister of transportation
and communications, will be promoted to take over the helm of the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC), a spokesman for
the Executive Yuan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Cabinet spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang confirmed at a news conference
that Premier Su Tseng-chang decided to promote Tsai to the MOTC's top
post after having comprehensive talks with Tsai the previous evening.
Tsai, 59, will be succeeding Transportation and Communications
Minister Kuo Yao-chi, who offered to resign Aug. 7.</P>
      <P>Su wanted Tsai to work toward solving disputes surrounding the
freeway electronic toll collection system, which has whipped up
political rows around the country and constituted one of the reasons
Kuo quit the post.</P>
      <P>For his part, Tsai answered the premier by saying he was
extremely grateful for the promotion and was determined to do his job
devotedly, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>Cheng said Tsai, a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from National
Taiwan University, is a seasoned technocrat who has held other
prominent MOTC posts, including deputy director-general of the
Directorate General of Telecommunications; director-general of the
Civil Aeronautics Administration; and senior supervisor to the MOTC.</P>
      <P>Kuo Yao-chi tendered her resignation Aug. 7, citing "policy
differences" with the premier and other superiors. Kuo served the
shortest ministerial term in Taiwan's history as transportation and
communications minister. She was sworn in as minister on the day
Premier Su Tseng-chang launched his new Cabinet Jan. 25.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Tsai's promotion, a whip of the opposition People
First Party legislative caucus said Tsai's professionalism is beyond
question, but it remains to be seen whether Tsai will be able to
survive political pressure and resist the push from interest groups.</P>
      <P>Lee Hung-chun said if these adverse conditions aren't tackled, no
one in the country could be a good transportation and communications
minister.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KEY WITNESS CALLS FOR PUBLIC TRUST IN TAIWAN'S JUSTICE SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 15 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese businesswoman who has returned
from Australia to provide testimony about her knowledge of a special
state affairs fund urged the people of Taiwan to "have confidence in
the justice system" Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee Hui-fen, also known as Ligi Lee, was interrogated for 15
hours after arriving from Australia early Monday by investigators who
are probing suspected irregularities in the use of the state affairs
fund by Presidential Office staff and potentially President Chen
Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>A recent investigation found that fake invoices and questionable
receipts had been submitted to claim "state affairs" expenses, and
some of that evidence had originated from Lee.</P>
      <P>Lee reportedly handed over many invoices from her business trips
in Taiwan to her cousin Lee Pi-chun, owner of a pharmaceutical
company and a friend of first lady Wu Shu-jen.</P>
      <P>Lee Pi-chun has confessed to the prosecution that she had given
some of her cousin's invoices to "other people" but had no idea why
they ended up in the accounting reports of the Presidential Office on
the use of the state affairs fund. Pi-chun is a suspect in this case
and barred from leaving the country.</P>
      <P>Lee Hui-fen said she was quite hesitant, even suspicious, before
telling anything to prosecutors.</P>
      <P>"I have been convinced by Prosecutor Chen Jui-jen, " who has
investigated a series of major political and economic scandals
including the "Stock Vultures" case, she said.</P>
      <P>"When I realized that judicial officials were really serious
about pursuing all the facts and delivering justice, I started to
tell everything I know about this case," she added.</P>
      <P>Now that she has been convinced she can trust the justice system,
"I need not worry about the case being 'eaten up' or going nowhere,"
she said, urging the public to also have confidence in the country's
judicial authorities.</P>
      <P>Lee, who runs Taiwan Ang Corp. which sells designer jewelry and
apparel, told the press that when she provided testimony she intended
to strike at no one, including the president.</P>
      <P>But out of her love for Taiwan, she said she has donated NT$100
to a campaign calling upon one million people to stand up and depose
the scandal-ridden president.</P>
      <P>The campaign was initiated by former Democratic Progressive Party
Chairman Shih Ming-teh, who vowed to lead a million people to topple
Chen Shui-bian if they each donate NT$100 toward the campaign.</P>
      <P>"I am a Taiwanese, and I love Taiwan," she said.</P>

The U.N. Security Council has passed far-reaching resolutions on
Lebanon before -- especially Resolution 1559, in September 2004,
which called for the disbanding of Hezbollah's fighting force and all
other militias and the extension of Lebanese government control over
the entire country. That resolution had no enforcement mechanism and
was largely ignored. After 34 days of warfare, the latest resolution,
1701, repeats the goals of 1559 but provides more teeth. But will it
be effective? As always, the real test is not in the resolution but
in its fulfillment, and there are reasons for skepticism. If the
skepticism turns out to be correct, how long will Israel stand by and
watch the rearmament of Hezbollah in violation of the resolution?

Wall Street Journal: Student Plagiarism Stirs Controversy At Ohio

Vipul Ranatunga, an engineering professor at Miami University of

directly from the thesis of a Chinese student who had re ceived his
master's degreee at Ohio the year before. The lapse of attribution
has embroiled him in one of higher education's largest plagiarism
scandals. Plagiarism, of course, isn't limited to international
students. According to a 2005 study by Duke University's Center for
Academic Integrity, 40 percent of all U.S. college students admit to
having woven unattributed material from the Internet into their
written work. Still, international students may lack the English
fluency needed to read and paraphrase scientific literature, and may

    <HEADLINE>MINISTER DENIES CENTRAL AMERICAN TRIP AIMED AT AVOIDING DOMINO EFFECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Panama City,  Aug. 15 (CNA)
(By Ramon Huang and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Minister of Foreign Affairs
Huang Chih-fang denied Tuesday reports suggesting that his current
visit to three of the country's diplomatic allies in Central America
is aimed at preventing a possible domino effect from Chad's recent
switching of diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Huang pointed out to CNA that the trip to Panama, Costa Rica and
Honduras was arranged long before Taiwan severed diplomatic ties with
Chad Aug. 6 and that the trip has nothing to do with the Chad
incident.</P>
      <P>Huang said the major purpose of the visit is to discuss bilateral
cooperation projects.</P>
      <P>On Honduras President Manuel Zelaya's two cancellations of
planned visits to Taiwan, Huang said Zelaya's decision should not be
"over-interpreted" as a move to express his displeasure with Taiwan,
as Zelaya is beset with domestic problems.</P>
      <P>Huang said his ministry will do its utmost to maintain the
country's relations with its diplomatic allies while China is using
every possible means to suppress Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said the other purpose of his Central American trip is to
attend a meeting with Taiwan diplomats in the Central and Southern
American and Caribbean regions.</P>
      <P>Noting that Central America is home to the largest number of
Taiwan's diplomatic allies, Huang said he hopes the diplomats will
use the opportunity to exchange views on the problems faced by the
country and do some brainstorming.</P>
      <P>On his present visit in Panama, Huang said he had met President
Martin Torrijos and held talks with First Vice-President and Minister
of Foreign Relations Samuel Lewis Navarro and seven other members of
the Panamanian Cabinet to discuss bilateral cooperation plans.</P>
      <P>For example, Taiwan is planning to build bamboo houses in
mountainous areas in northern Panama, where there are a large number
of indigenous people, in a bid to help Panama eliminate poverty, he
said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan will also help enhance education, health and
medical services for the middle and lower classes in Panama, he said.</P>
      <P>Huang said that during his meeting with Torrijos, he expressed
his approval for Torrijos' policies to improve social welfare, take
care of disadvantaged groups, eliminate poverty and enhance the
standard of education.</P>
      <P>Huang said he told Torrijos that Taiwan's experience in terms of
education, health and agriculture can be a good reference for Panama.</P>

month -- a time that might coincide with a plan by the Democratic
Action Alliance to stage a large-scale demonstration Sept. 9 on the
square in front of the Presidential Office to demand his resignation.</P>
      <P>Soong said that he fully supports and wishes the best for the
civic group's drive to unseat Chen, saying that "no one wants a
corrupt regime." But he added that the PFP will not take part in the
activity to avoid confrontation between the opposition "pan blue
alliance" and the "pan green camp."</P>
      <P>Soong also prodded main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou to "have more teeth" and to show his determination to boot
out Chen to meet what he claimed are public expectations.</P>
      <P>"The people are entitled to ask for a clean and proficient
government when a nation's leadership has gone wrong," he said.</P>
      <P>The PFP has raised a proposal to impeach Chen at the Legislative
Yuan, Soong said, calling for firm support from other opposition
parties in its bid to remove Chen in an attempt to end the woes and
disorder that have "tainted Taiwan's democratic image."</P>
      <P>Wu Kung-yu, deputy director of the PFP's publicity department,
echoed Soong's remarks, saying that Chen should stay in Taiwan and
provide a clear explanation to the public as soon as possible at a
time when Chen himself and members of his family are dogged by a
spate of corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>Members of the legislative caucus of the KMT criticized Chen
earlier the same day for attempting to shift the public's attention
from the corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at the Legislative Yuan, KMT
legislative caucus whip Tsai Chin-lung questioned the motive behind
Chen's Palau visit.</P>
      <P>If Chen does not mean to divert away public attention with the
Palau trip, he must be seeking to find a way out, KMT lawmakers
claimed.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmaker Chiu Yi also called a news conference at the
Legislative Yuan asking the prosecution and investigation authorities
to get to the bottom of the various high-profile corruption
allegations, such as the suspicious reimbursement of state affairs
expenses by the Presidential Office on behalf of Chen and the
acceptance of Sogo Department Store gift vouchers by first lady Wu
Shu-jen.</P>
      <P>Citing Ligi Lee, a businesswoman roducing who returned to Taiwan
from Australia early Monday to answer prosecutors' questions
regarding irregularities found in the president's use of the state
affairs spending, Chiu said that it is clear that the Presidential
Office used Lee's invoices to claim state affair funds.</P>
      <P>The key point in the issue is whether the Presidential Office
used other people's invoices to obtain reimbursement from the funds,
rather than the number of invoices it has used, Chiu argued.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, she brought solid evidence from Australia to
prove that her cousin, Lee Pi-chun, a close friend of first lady Wu
Shu-jen, took away many of her invoices to "help" Wu during the
2003-2005 period.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Center for Disease Control (CDC) urged
travelers to Indonesia to avoid eating raw food and drinking unboiled
water Tuesday after three people returning from Indonesia were
diagnosed with dysentery.</P>
      <P>According to the CDC, the three were members of a 43-member tour
group that visited Bandong, Java last month for religious activities.</P>
      <P>Six of the visitors had fever on arrival at the Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport July 31, two had diarrhea and one had
stomachache.</P>
      <P>After collecting samples from all the group members for tests,
the CDC confirmed that three were infected with bacillary dysentery.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director-General Shih Wen-yi said the visitors had
eaten raw fish and fruit during their stay in Indonesia, which could
have been the cause of their infection.</P>
      <P>The latent period of bacillary dysentery usually lasts from one
to three days and sometimes extends as long as one week, and the
symptoms of the disease include diarrhea, fever, nausea, vomiting,
cramps and bloody stools, according to the CDC.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLOSE COLLABORATION BETWEEN TAIWAN'S BUSINESS, ACADEMIC BODIES: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan ranked 12th in the world and
second--next only to Singapore-- in Asia, in terms of the
collaboration between business and academic institutes, the Council
for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials made the remarks when they unveiled a report on
how to increase collaboration between business and academic
institutes in order to create a more favorable environment for an
innovative and value-added era.</P>
      <P>The officials cited a 2006 global competitiveness report by the
Lausanne-based International Institute for Management Development in
pointing out that in the index of "knowledge transfer between
companies and universities, " Finland was top, followed by the United
States. Taiwan ranked 12th, ahead of Hong Kong, Japan and South
Korea. Singapore was sixth. </P>
      <P>They also cited the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness
Report 2005-2006 to note that Taiwan ranked eighth in the index of
collaboration among industries, academic and research
organizations, putting it ahead of South Korea in 10th and Hong Kong
in 24th.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Taiwan Institute for Economic Research found in
a survey of 900 manufacturers that 43 percent of enterprises have
worked with colleges and universities on research and development,
showing that businesses attach importance to cooperation with
colleges and universities to improve business efficiency.</P>
      <P>The CEPD said the ratio of college and university R&amp;D budgets
coming from enterprises accounted for 5.2 percent in 2004 up from 4.2
percent in 2003, representing a new high in nearly six years.</P>
      <P>But the ratio still lagged behind that of 6.1 percent on average
among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), showing that there is room for growth in
collaboration between the business and the academic and research
sectors.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The production value of Taiwan's hi-tech
industry amounted to NT$5.78 trillion in 2005, up 30 percent compared
with the level of 2000 and accounting for 54 percent of the total

Tuesday by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>However, the amount represents an increase of only 2.8 percent
from 2004, owing to the exodus of Taiwan businesses to China, DGBAS
officials said.</P>
      <P>While the electronic parts and components industry contributed
37.4 percent to the total production value of the hi-tech industry in
2005, the semiconductor industry contributed 16.9 percent, marking
the first time the ratio of the semiconductor sector has declined
since 2001, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the contribution of computer, communications and video
and audio electronic products dropped to 15.3 percent, they said.</P>
      <P>In 2005, Taiwan exported US$45.7 billion- worth of electronic
products, up more than 40 percent over the 2000 level, according to
the officials.</P>
      <P>The export value of information and communications products fell
to US$10.5 billion in 2005, down 46 percent from 2000, they added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN `HOME AWAY FROM HOME' FOR INDIAN PH.D STUDENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The friendliness of the Taiwanese people
was not why Vikas Saxena and Gopi Kuppuraj, a pair of Ph.D students
from India studying in the Taiwan International Graduate Program
(TIGP) of Academia Sinica, came to Taiwan, but it is why they
gradually have come to view Taiwan as "a home away from home."</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese are helpful in nature. They would even leave their job
to try to help you, " says Kuppuraj, who comes from the southern
Indian city of Chennai and has been in Taiwan for two years.
Friendliness of local people was what brought him out of his "little
shell" and prompted him to start exploring Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>Saxena's most unforgettable memory is similar. Saxena, a former
veterinarian who was admitted to the program one year ago, recalled
an incident at Moon Festival last year.</P>
      <P>Saxena went out that night trying to find a restaurant to
celebrate the festival. "Surprisingly, all the stores and restaurants
nearby were closed, " he said, adding that restaurants in India would
stay open all night on traditional holidays like the Moon Festival.</P>
      <P>A family having a barbecue party, a traditional Moon Festival
activity for local people, invited Saxena to join them. "Then a girl
took me far away to find a restaurant, " said Saxena, who comes from
a city near the Indian capital of New Delhi.</P>
      <P>The first six months in Taiwan was hard for Kuppuraj, who
experienced culture shock. "I didn't speak or read Chinese. The food
was different. I was totally lost, " he said.</P>
      <P>"I still get lost sometimes, but at least I knew how to get back
to the dormitory, " said Kupperaj, who studies chemical biology and
molecular biophysics.</P>
      <P>Saxena, who has at least three more years to go in the molecular
and cell biology program, is also getting comfortable with the
environment as he now switches between cooking with Indian friends
and eating in Indian restaurants in Taipei.</P>
      <P>TIGP, a program established by Academia Sinica in 2002, is open
to local and international students. Academia Sinica currently
administers eight such programs, with degrees issued from partner
universities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OVER 200,000 PEOPLE DONATE NT$25.5 MILLION TO DEPOSE PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Supporters of a "one million people
campaign to depose President Chen Shui-bian" donated NT$16.2 million
to two designated bank accounts Tuesday, bringing to NT$25.5 million
the total donations by more than 200,000 people in the first two days
of the campaign, according to a spokeswoman for the campaign.</P>
      <P>The figures do not include donations to a third postal account
that received 53,600 remittances totalling NT$8.67 million Monday.
Organizers are urging people to give just NT$100 per person.</P>
      <P>Ho De-fen, spokeswoman for the campaign initiated by former
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Shih Ming-teh, said no
cash will be accepted and all donations must be made to the two bank
accounts and the one postal account under the name of Shih Ming-teh.</P>
      <P>Ho urged the public not to be defrauded after it was reported
that in Hsinchuang, Taipei County, some people have claimed to be
campaign workers offering "the service" of remitting NT$100 on behalf
of donors.</P>
      <P>"We do not accept cash and we do not raise funds through
telephones or cell phones," she added.</P>
      <P>The campaign has caught attention abroad, according to the
spokeswoman, who said she has been approached by overseas Chinese
asking if they could run ads for the campaign in local media. She
said she has declined their offers.</P>
      <P>She added that people in Shanghai and Heilongjiang in
northeastern China have also called her to express their envy of
Taiwan people, who enjoy the freedom to demand that their corrupt
government leader step down.</P>
      <P>"They also said they wanted to donate to our campaign. But we
will never accept even one cent from them," Ho said.</P>
      <P>She claimed that she has never been disappointed by Taiwan's
democracy, although she sometimes feels frustrated. However, she
added: "I believe we will weather this difficult time. Taiwan's
democracy is a proud example for the Chinese world."</P>
      <P>Starting Wednesday, each day's donations will be published on the
Internet. In addition, she said, campaign leaders will organize
speech tours to cities and towns to explain why and how to drive the
scandal-ridden president out of office.</P>
      <P>Shih has planned to start a mass sit-in Sept. 9 calling on Chen
to step down. He said that if the one-million-person target is
reached earlier, he will move the schedule forward.</P>

      <P>Misconceptions about India can be corrected
if there are more exchanges between India and Taiwan, according to a
couple of Indian students in a graduate program run by Academia
Sinica, Taiwan's top research institute.</P>
      <P>"In Taiwan, most information on India comes from English
channels, but all they show is images of flood, drought, dying
people, starving skinny kids. It's not the whole picture of India, "

cell biology in one of eight programs offered by the Taiwan

will be able to see "the better parts of India, which no-one has
shown you before, " according to Saxena.</P>
      <P>Gopi Kuppuraj, who is in the chemical biology and molecular
biophysics program, agreed and encouraged Taiwanese people to visit
India.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese need to know more about India. On the other hand, most
people in India do not know much about Taiwan, " he said, adding that
most of his friends did not even know where Taiwan is until he showed
them photos the last time he went home.</P>
      <P>Kuppuraj said he would also like to see more collaboration
between India and Taiwan, which boasts strong competition in
the software and hardware sectors.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CRITICIZES MA'S PERFORMANCE SINCE ASSUMING KMT CHAIRMANSHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  16 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) criticized opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman and Taipei
Mayor Ma Ying-jeou Wednesday for causing his party "to degenerate"
and the city's development "to regress" over the past year since he
assumed the chairmanship.</P>
      <P>Making the comment on the first anniversary of Ma's inauguration,
DPP spokesman Tsai Huang-liang said Ma has been busy during the past
year taking trips around Taiwan and overseas to pave the way for his
presidential bid and has neglected municipal governance, with a
series of corruption scandals having been reported in the city.</P>
      <P>Tsai noted that several KMT politicians whose campaigns Ma
supported, including Hsinchu Magistrate Cheng Yung-chin and Keelung
Mayor Hsu Tsai-li, have been charged with corruption since being
elected, which he said proves that "the corrupt system of the KMT has
remained unchanged."</P>
      <P>Tsai said that while Ma has repeatedly promised to deal with the
controversies surrounding the party's "ill-gotten" assets, the KMT
has sold a total of NT$23 billion (US$703.36 million) worth of its
assets under Ma's leadership.</P>
      <P>He said that the DPP has begun a signature drive for a proposal
to hold a public referendum to reclaim the KMT's "ill-gotten" assets
and that it will submit more than 80,000 signatures to the Central
Election Commission (CEC) for review by next Wednesday.</P>
      <P>He said that after the CEC finishes the review process, the DPP
will kick off a second-stage signature drive with the goal of
collecting 800,000 signatures by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The DPP hopes that the referendum will be held next year, he
added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NATIONWIDE BIRD FLU PREVENTION DRILL TO KICK OFF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A nationwide bird flu drill will kick off
on the outlying island of Matsu Thursday as part of the government's
efforts to prevent avian flu outbreaks.</P>
      <P>After the Department of Health (DOH) made 2006 a "Bird Flu
Prevention Drill Year" earlier this year, the DOH's Center for
Disease Control (CDC) announced Wednesday that a series of drills,
dubbed the "White Egret, " will take place nationwide beginning
Thursday in Matsu.</P>
      <P>The drills, to take place around the nation without notification
in advance, are aimed at testing the central and local governments'
preparedness for dealing with bird flu outbreaks, CDC Deputy
Director-General Shih Wen-yi said.</P>
      <P>The drills are designed to bolster Taiwan's preparedness against
bird flu, which seems to be making a comeback in recent days after
having disappeared for nearly half a year, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Recent reports of new cases of bird flu include cases in
Thailand, Russia and a case in China's Xinjiang Province, in which a
person died after being infected with the avian flu virus. The
fatality was the 14th among 21 confirmed human bird flu cases in
China over the past three years.</P>
      <P>The appearance of new cases has raised concerns among World
Health Organization specialists that the avian flu virus may have
mutated into a new and more lethal strain.</P>
      <P>Among other preventive measures, the DOH established the National
Influenza Center (NIC) last month to serve as Taiwan's command post
against flu epidemics, including potential bird flu outbreaks.</P>
      <P>The duties of the NIC include integrating the country's flu virus
monitoring efforts, reporting and analyzing data, providing complete
epidemic information, monitoring new types of flu virus and related
developments, and producing antibodies against indigenous strains of
the flu virus.</P>
      <P>Shih said that although Taiwan remains free of highly pathogenic
avian flu, precautions should still be taken against a possible flu
pandemic, adding that the establishment of the NIC is a necessary
first step.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWANESE ARCHITECTS TO PRESENT MICRO CITIES CONCEPT AT VENICE FAIR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   16  (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese architects will offer
introspection on micro cities at the upcoming Venice Architecture
Biennial to confront the trend of "The Meta City" -- the main topic
of the prestigious architectural exhibition.</P>
      <P>The exhibition will take place in Venice, Italy from Sep. 8 to
Nov. 9. Taiwanese architects Hsieh Ying-chun, Huang Sheng-yuan and
Liu Kuo-chang will present their works in an exhibit titled "Micro
Cities and Non-Meta Architecture in Taiwan" along with a pair of
Nordic studios.</P>
      <P>The meta-city -- defined as a city with a population of over 5
million people -- is the contemporary trend, said curator Roan
Ching-yueh. However, the Taiwan architects want to reflect at the
exhibition on the price our environment has paid for this trend and
on how conventional structures, including culture, society, morality
and religion, are losing out in "the global giant system."</P>
      <P>"This is where the concept of the micro city comes from, " Roan
said, explaining that "a micro city is a small, self-sufficient city
with a complete cycle of food, energy, waste and information. It is
able to face the individual needs of its residents."</P>
      <P>"Such a city can also co-exist inside or outside any mega-city, "
he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will also host an East Asia forum in Palazzo delle
Prigioni, where the Taiwanese design will be displayed, discussing
the global impact of emerging East Asian cities. Forum participants
will include architects from Taiwan, Korea, Singapore and China.</P>
      <P>The architecture section of the Venice Biennale, which includes
art, cinema, music dance and theater categories, was established in
1980.</P>

      <P>As the greying of Taiwan society has
boosted the market demand for care-giving services, health
institutions and retirement financial planning services, job
opportunities in these fields are also increasing, an online
employment service provider said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, the
number of elderly people accounts for 9.83 percent of Taiwan's
population at present and is expected to continue to expand, with at
least one in every five people in Taiwan expected to be a senior
citizen 20 years from now.</P>
      <P>While more than 650,000 elderly people in Taiwan require
long-term care in 2006, there is a severe shortage of caregivers in
the country.</P>
      <P>Chiu Wen-jen, marketing director of the 104 Job Bank, noted that
a lot of local families have problems hiring cheap foreign caregivers
for sick and elderly family members since the government tightened
the hiring requirements, although of course they are still free to
hire local caregivers.</P>
      <P>Chiu said there is a shortfall of at least 5,000 caregivers in
the Taiwan market and some institutions offer pay of between
NT$40,000 and NT$60,000 to qualified candidates.</P>
      <P>Also, as many elderly people living alone or those with chronic
diseases are being sent to health institutions, there is a demand for
a total of more than 4,000 licensed nursing workers by these
institutions, Chiu said.</P>
      <P>In term of retirement financial planning, Chiu said local
insurance and financial companies have launched various finance
management programs to help people plan their retirements, with
approximately 7,000 job openings for financial advisers available.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a number of companies providing services to help
retirees fulfill their dreams and travel plans are also looking for

    <HEADLINE>DOH TO LEVY HEAVY PUNISHMENTS ON BROKERING OFFSHORE ORGAN TRANSPLANTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health
(DOH) has decided to levy heavy punishments on doctors or medical
personnel who broker offshore human organ transplants, a DOH
spokesman said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Doctors and medical personnel who are found to have engaged in
brokering cross-border organ transplants for patients, no matter
whether they just act as a go-between or personally take patients to
receive operations overseas, will be punished by the DOH in line with
a set of newly revised regulations, the spokesman said, adding that
serious offenders could have their licenses revoked.</P>
      <P>The DOH hopes to wipe out such malpractice and to help maintain
medical ethics in view of a growing number of Taiwan patients
undergoing organ transplants overseas -- mostly in China and the
United States, the spokesman said, noting that last year alone, 450
Taiwan patients headed for China to undergo an organ transplant.</P>
      <P>Of the 450 patients, 118 were questioned, with 69 of them
admitting that they were brokered through a doctor, while 49 said
they were introduced by friends. Another three gained access through
brokers. </P>
      <P>According to relevant statistics, about 6,900 Taiwan patients
were waiting for a healthy organ to save their lives as of the end of
July, with a vast majority of 6,178 awaiting a kidney, followed by
those waiting for a heart or lung.</P>
      <P>Most of the Taiwan patients received their transplants in Beijing
and Tianjin in China's Hebei Province as well as in Guangdong
Province. Each human organ transplant operation in China costs from
NT$300,000 to NT$1.2 million.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN TO FURTHER CLARIFY PARTY ASSETS AUG. 23</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou said Wednesday that he will explain Aug. 23 how the party
has handled its assets, which its rivals claim are "ill-gotten"
properties, acquired at a time of authoritarian one-party rule when
the KMT equalled the state.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks in response to reports that a group is
planning to initiate a nationwide referendum to have the KMT return
its assets to national coffers and that the group has also questioned
why the assets, valued at around NT$150 billion (US$4.58 billion)
under the leadership of former Chairman Lien Chan between 2000 and
2005, have diminished precipitously to some NT$5 billion since Ma
took the helm last year.</P>
      <P>Discounting the reports as "the result of misunderstanding, " Ma,
who doubles as Taipei mayor, said that is why he will explain
following an Aug. 23 KMT Central Standing Committee meeting how the
party has handled the party assets, including investment profits and
losses.</P>
      <P>Ma, who was elected chairman in July last year, has asked his
staff to tackle the controversy over the party's assets "as soon as
possible " and so the party is ready to look at the issue one year
after he became party leader.</P>
      <P>Ma's proposed "explanation" will come on the heels of a report
issued by the KMT earlier this month. The report, prepared by the
party's Deputy Secretary-General Chang Che-chen and lawyer Lee
Yung-jan, describes how the assets were managed when Chiang Kai-shek,
Chiang Ching-kuo, Lee Teng-hui, Lien Chan and Ma Ying-jeou were at
the helm of the party.</P>
      <P>The compilation of the report was aimed at baring all of the KMT
assets in an open, transparent and comprehensive manner and not
trying to "shun or hide" any questions, according to KMT spokesman
Huang Yu-chen.</P>

      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang exhorted the country
Wednesday to strive to win the right to host the world design
conference authorized by the International Council of Societies of
Industrial Design (ICSID) in 2011.</P>
      <P>Hosting the conference would help raise Taiwan's design standards

      <P>The distinctive emerald earrings that first
lady Wu Shu-jen wore at her son's wedding were "borrowed from
friends, " according to a "corrected version" of the presidential
couple's report to the Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>But Wu and President Chen Shui-bian did not disclose who loaned
her the earrings, other than describing them as borrowed from
"friends and relatives, " a Control Yuan official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Yu-nan, director of the Control Yuan's department in charge
of public functionaries' private assets reporting, pointed out that
his department has sent official requests three times to the
Presidential Office for more information about the "friends and
relatives."</P>
      <P>According to law, the president must explain who are the real
owners of the earrings within 15 days -- by Aug. 25. However, Hsieh
admitted that if he continues to refuse to do so, "we don't have any

      <P>The latest report filed by the presidential couple regarding
their jewelry shows that they have reported 15 items with a total

      <P>If an individual item is worth less than NT$200,000, it need not

    <HEADLINE>CABINET HOPES TO GET TO BOTTOM OF NOISE-CONTROL SCAM SOON: SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan hopes prosecutors will
get to the bottom of a noise control scam at Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport as soon as possible, Cabinet spokesman Cheng
Wen-tsang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Cheng made the remarks one day after Taoyuan Prosecutors Office
questioned Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) Director-General
Chang Kuo-cheng and other aviation officials over a noise-control
project in which villagers living under the flight paths were
provided with subsidies for installing soundproof glass and air
conditioners, even though they were scheduled to be relocated away
from the airport. Chang and other officials are suspected of lining
their own pockets from the scam.</P>
      <P>Chang was released on NT$1 million (US$30,480) bail, while CAA
Secretary-General Wang Teh-he and CKS Air Terminal Director Wei
Sheng-chi were each released on NT$500,000 bail.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors also suspect that the decision-making process in
awarding the subsidies was flawed.</P>
      <P>Chang for his part denied any wrongdoing or profiteering but said
the execution and verification process indeed "had problems."</P>
      <P>He noted that the air terminals started to levy noise control
fees on airlines in 1996, and it was established in 2001 that the
villagers would not get compensation directly but would instead be
subsidized for the cost of installing the soundproof windows and air
conditioners.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that after the subsidy program began in 2002, it was
established that residents in one village would be relocated, but
they still demanded the subsidy.</P>
      <P>As the airport could not distribute them directly, and it was a
waste to install soundproof windows in houses that would soon be
demolished, the airport agreed to subsidize the villagers for air
conditioners if they presented photos of the installed air
conditioners.</P>
      <P>However, the villagers used various fraudulent means to obtain
the subsidies without actually buying air conditioners.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SERVICES INDUSTRY  ENGINE OF TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC GROWTH: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  16 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Combining the services industry with the
information technology sector will be a major policy of the
government to boost the development of the services industry, which
is a major engine for the country's economic growth, the Council for
Economic Planning and Development said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials noted that trade in services has become an
important part of the international industrial division of labor
since the 1990s, with World Trade Organization statistics showing
that global trade in services registered an average growth rate of
7.6 percent between 1981 and 2005, which was higher than the 6.8
percent for merchandise trade.</P>
      <P>In 2005, global trade in services contributed 22 percent to the
growth of world trade, which indicates that trade in services is
playing an increasingly important role in world trade, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's trade in services accounted for 1.2 percent of the
world's total in 2005, while Taiwan's merchandise trade accounted for
1.8 percent of the world's total, they went on.</P>
      <P>Between 1996 and 2005, Taiwan's trade in services posted an
average growth rate of only 4.2 percent, which was lower than the 5.8
percent registered by the merchandise trade, they said.</P>
      <P>The officials added that as the services industry contributed as
high as 73.56 percent to Taiwan's gross domestic product and is a
major engine for the country's economic growth, the government will
try to expand trade in services by combining the services industry
with information and communications technology in an effort to make
inroads into the international market.</P>
      <P>In light of the potential of the information software industry,
the green industry, the sport and leisure industry, the tourism
industry and the culture and creativity industry, Taiwan should work
out a strategy to integrate their development, they said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the government should establish a high-quality and
friendly travel environment to attract more foreign tourists to
Taiwan to increase the country's income from trade in services, they
added.</P>

young people to study hard to raise themselves out of poverty
Wednesday while attending a ceremony in which he presented
certificates to students from low income families in recognition of
their efforts in this regard.</P>
      <P>Ma issued the call while taking part in a ceremony held by the

      <P>According to Ma, the three-year program is the first of its kind
in Taiwan and it has been quite successful.</P>
      <P>Of the 70 students, eight have been admitted to graduate schools,

    <HEADLINE>ALLOWING 0.18 MICRON PROCESS TO GO TO CHINA NOT BAD FOR TAIWAN: TSMC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Allowing 0.18 micron process technology to
go to China will not be detrimental to Taiwan's high technology
industry but will instead help sharpen Taiwan companies'
competitiveness, the founder and chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) claimed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Morris Chang, who has been nicknamed the founding father of
Taiwan's semiconductor industry, claimed that Taiwan's export of 0.18
micron process technology to China will not backfire as some people
have predicted, because it is now a mature technology and Chinese
manufacturers have for long used it with proven high yields.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered to a gathering of industrial leaders on the
prospects of Taiwan's hi-tech development, Chang said that when
Taiwan hi-tech companies decide to invest in China, they must first
acquire permission from the Republic of China government and then
permission from the U.S. Department of Commerce if their production
equipment and technologies originate from the United States.</P>
      <P>Chang said Taiwan's restrictions are even stricter than those
imposed by the U.S. government and he suggested that Taiwan further
relax its restrictions, at least restrictions on technologies that
are already fully developed and commonly used.</P>
      <P>Chang claimed that TSMC relocating part of its production lines
to China was "not for the purpose of cutting costs, but to seek added
value."</P>
      <P>However, he admitted that if Taiwan were to allow the 0.18 micron
process technology to be exported to China, it would help TSMC win a
larger market share in China, which is currently "the world's
factory."</P>
      <P>He said TSMC, one of the biggest IC chip foundries in the world,
is expected to post a 20 percent growth in its overall transactions
this year.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan High Court overruled Wednesday
an appeal by President Chen Shui-bian's former deputy secretary-
general to be freed from detention.</P>
      <P>Chen Che-nan, who has been detained since April 4, claimed that
he should no longer be kept in custody since the court has obtained
testimony against him from a businessman.</P>
      <P>But the court ruled that more investigations are needed to gather
the facts from him and other witnesses regarding fraud and insider

      <P>Since Chen has already been found to have been in contact with
witnesses over his case, the court decided to deny his request for

Liang settle embezzlement charges.</P>

Hezbollah Leads Work to Rebuild, Gaining 
Stature 

As stunned Lebanese returned Tuesday over
broken roads to shattered apartments in the
south, it increasingly seemed that the
beneficiary of the destruction was most likely
to be Hezbollah. In addition to its hard-won
reputation as the only Arab force that fought
Israel to a standstill, Hezbollah is already
dominating the efforts to rebuild with a
torrent of money from oil-rich Iran. Hezbollah's
reputation as an efficient grass-roots social
service network was in evidence everywhere.

Wall Street Journal: Fractured Land, Vast
Rebuilding Job Looms in Lebanon; It, Too, Is
Political

An estimated 35,000 homes and business
places have been destroyed in Lebanon by
fighting and Israeli bombs. Perhaps a quarter of
the country's four million residents were in
temporary housing when the cease-fire took hold
Monday. Some 400 miles of Lebanese roadway have
been destroyed, along with about 150 bridges and
interchanges - - one of every four in the
country. Now, as residents pour back into
Lebanon's ravaged south, hundreds of thousands
will need food, water and shelter in the coming
weeks. And wrapped in the reconstruction
challenge is a critical struggle for Lebanon's
weak government: seizing the political
initiative from a Hezbollah energized by its
battlefield performance against Israel. "The
postwar period...is the real war," says Jihad
Azour, Lebanon's finance minister. The
rebuilding of Lebanon, and who gets credit for
it, are part of a larger battle for influence

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Japanese company has expressed keen
interest in a build-operate-transfer (BOT) project for a community
for senior citizens in Pinglin, Hualien County, the Construction
and Planning Agency under the Ministry of the Interior said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Officials said that if all goes well, the project will set a good
example for providing an excellent living environment for the
elderly. It will also introduce billions of dollars and create around
300 jobs, as well as promoting the full use of local land and the
development of related industries.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that with the graying of the Taiwanese
population, the ratio of Taiwan elderly -- defined as those aged over
65 -- has continued to rise. The ratio of the elderly was 7 percent
of the total population in 1993, but it had increased to 9.87 percent
as of the end of last month.</P>
      <P>In view of the need for communities for the elderly, the
administration promoted the BOT project in Pinglin and invited
bidders, although during its first attempt in March 2005 attracted
no bidders.</P>
      <P>However, after active promotion of its proximity to a noted farm,
hospital and scenic spots, several domestic and overseas enterprises
have expressed interest.</P>

      <P>A group of 15 Chinese-language teachers
from Vietnam arrived at the Wen Tzao Ursuline College of Modern
Languages in the southern Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung Wednesday to
take part in a two-week training course to sharpen their teaching
skills.</P>
      <P>The group, mainly composed of Chinese-language teachers from the

      <P>Lee said that he was deeply touched by the Vietnamese teachers'

confident they will reap a handsome harvest by the time they end
their studies at the end of the month.</P>
      <P>In addition to attending Chinese language classes at the college,
the Vietnamese teachers will also visit various tourist spots around

    <HEADLINE>DPP CHAIRMAN ASKS FORMER CHAIRMAN FOR 'SELF-RESTRAINT'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  16 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun, chairman of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), urged the party's former Chairman
Shih Ming-teh Wednesday to show "self-restraint" in his push to oust
President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Yu made the appeal after an estimated 400,000 people donated
NT$100 each to Shih's campaign of "one million people to depose
President Chen Shui-bian," a mere three days after its launch.</P>
      <P>The public response is in defiance of the Ministry of the
Interior's warning that the "political" donations are illegal, and
bolster the efforts of Shih, who claimed the public contributions
were "registration and authorization fees" for his planned sit-ins.</P>
      <P>Yu warned the campaign would create a "blue-green" standoff and
scuttle government operations, referring to the political
confrontation between the ruling "pan-green camp" and the opposition
"pan-blue alliance."</P>
      <P>He called on the opposition Kuomintang and People First Party to
join forces with the ruling party in initiating a "new sunshine
political movement" and to legislate laws ensuring clean politics are
carried out in the country.</P>
      <P>He said forcing the president to step down is not a priority for
the country, and that people should not view the DPP based only on
the criteria of whether the president would step down or not.</P>
      <P>"There are many more things we can do to help the president do
what he needs to accomplish during the remainder of his term in
office," he added.</P>
      <P>Turning to Shih's anti-president drive, Yu said some DPP
lawmakers -- such as Wang Hsing-nan -- have expressed an interest in
organizing "counter-Shih" forces.</P>
      <P>Some DPP senior executives, including Legislator Wu Ping-jui and
Chiayi County Magistrate Chen Ming-wen, were also suggesting the
party launch a fund-raising campaign in support of the president.</P>
      <P>These radical "countermeasure" proposals were turned down because
Yu said he would not like to further stimulate Shih at this moment.</P>
      <P>"Rather, more efforts should be made to start the new sunshine
political movement," he added.</P>
      <P>He blamed the opposition KMT for not being keen on a sunshine law
or setting up an anti-corruption agency which, he claimed, would have
gone a long way in establishing clean politics in this country.</P>
      <P>Because of the legislature's failure to pass relevant laws on
clean politics and anti-corruption institutions, society has paid a
huge cost, Yu said.</P>
      <P>He called on Shih and KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou not to
"over-simplify" the issue by stirring up another round of
"blue-green" confrontation, but instead to "rise above political
differences and build an effective system" that benefits the people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-PALAU DIPLOMATIC TIES NORMAL: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Diplomatic relations between Taiwan and
Palau remain normal and President Chen Shui-bian is still planning to
visit the South Pacific diplomatic ally early next month, MOFA
spokesman Michel Lu said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lu's remarks came after local media speculated earlier the same
day that Chen's planned visit to Palau might be aborted.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan-Palau diplomatic relations remain "business
as usual, " Lu said that Palau President Tommy Esang Remengesau Jr.
already sent an invitation to Chen Aug. 14, inviting him to take part
in the first summit between the Republic of China and six South
Pacific nations.</P>
      <P>"There aren't any problems in bilateral Taiwan-Palau ties, " he
assured.</P>
      <P>Lu also refuted a local media report that Taiwan-Naura diplomatic
links might be broken off, calling it "sheer speculation" given that
he has twice spoken by telephone with Ambassador Yu King-yung in
Naura, who pledged that two-way ties remain sound.</P>
      <P>Chen also plans to include Naura in his early September tour of
the South Pacific, but it is still in the pipeline, Lu said.</P>
      <P>But Lu was reluctant to answer the question of how many of the
Taiwan's six diplomatic allies in the South Pacific would participate
in the summit, saying only that "he could not reveal anything in this
regard due to a tacit agreement."</P>
      <P>The MOFA has been closely observing China's moves aimed at luring
away Taiwan's diplomatic partners in the region," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen's projected diplomatic tour to the two South Pacific nations
has come under strong attack from the opposition "pan-blue alliance"
of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP), which have
criticized the president for trying to divert public attention at a
time when he and members of the first family are being dogged by
a series of high-profile corruption allegations.</P>
      <P>But the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) in the
"pan-green camp" with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party said
that it supports Chen's plan to visit Palau and Naura.</P>
      <P>TSU legislative caucus whip Ho Ming-hao urged the KMT and PFP to
stop speculating about Chen's motives behind his plan to go abroad,
as the president truly wants to do something to improve Taiwan's
foreign relations -- particularly after diplomatic relations between
Taiwan and Chad were broken recently due to Beijing's meddling.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan must not engage any further in 'checkbook diplomacy' in
its diplomatic battle against China and the president deserves our
encouragement for trying to contribute something," he said.</P>
      <P>He also opined that Chen does not need to step down from the
presidency because no concrete evidence has shown his involvement in
any of the corruption scandals.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STUDY SHOWS CHILDREN OF TAIWAN'S FOREIGN BRIDES ARE HEALTHIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug.  16 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Children born to foreign mothers who are
married to Taiwanese are generally healthier then children of native
Taiwanese mothers, according to a study by National Cheng Kung
University Hospital.</P>
      <P>Lin Hsiu-chuan, a pediatrician at the hospital's center for
genetics, analyzed data for 230,000 births by foreign brides in
Taiwan between 1998 and 2003.</P>
      <P>She found that only 5.8 percent of newborns of foreign mothers
weighed less than 2,500 grams, while 7 percent of Taiwanese mothers
gave birth to newborns with a low birth weight.</P>
      <P>The study also found that newborns of foreign mothers -- mostly
from southeast Asian countries, including Vietnam, Indonesia, the
Philippines, Cambodia and Thailand -- also had a lower death rate
than children of Taiwanese mothers, although the two groups were
comparable in terms of birth defects.</P>
      <P>In her analysis, Lin said the reason why children of foreign
mothers are generally healthier may be attributed to the fact that
their husbands underwent a strict screening process and selected only
young and healthy women as their spouses.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PUBLIC SUPPORT EXCEEDS FORMER DPP CHAIRMAN'S EXPECTATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Almost half a million people have donated
NT$45.79 million (US$1.4 million) to former Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Chairman Shih Ming-teh's campaign to depose President
Chen Shui-bian, a level of support that Shih said Wednesday has gone
far beyond his expectations.</P>
      <P>He had estimated that it would take nearly a month before one
million people signed up and contributed NT$100 toward his populist
campaign, which he said signifies "water can float a boat and sink
it, too."</P>
      <P>He said he might have to skip a plan to tour the countryside to
solicit support so he can begin a sit-in early, which he vowed "would
not be a nine-to-five job" as he has determined to carry on day and
night until he achieves his purpose -- the resignation of President
Chen.</P>
      <P>Shih called on the nation's religious workers -- monks, nuns,
priests, fathers and sisters -- to come forward and act as security
personnel during the sit-in.</P>
      <P>He noted that campaign organizers have obtained permission to use
Ketagalan Boulevard for a mass sit-in from Aug. 23 to Sept. 14 with
the exception of Sept. 8-9 and Sept. 13.</P>
      <P>Two other groups have secured the right to use the road on those
three days and Shih said he would move elsewhere to continue his
campaign, without elaborating on the alternative site.</P>
      <P>Shih stressed he would not heed the legal ban on public
gatherings after 10: 00 p.m. -- a law that would be enforced by the
Taipei City government led by Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who is also
chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>"We won't disperse. We will move to other places to continue our
sit-in, 24 hours a day, day after day, until we have achieved our
purpose," he claimed.</P>
      <P>He reminded the ruling and opposition politicians that the law on
marches and assemblies was a "violent law" left over from the KMT's
authoritarian rule, and that if the Chen administration dares to use
it to drive rally participants out, "they should remember what
happened to the KMT."</P>
      <P>Shih said he has not contacted Academia Sinica President Lee
Yuan-tseh or former DPP Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung over his current
campaign, which he said aims to "appeal directly to the people to
exercise their own power."</P>
      <P>Shih is using two bank accounts and one postal account under his
name to collect public donations.</P>
      <P>According to the post office, more than 87,000 remittances were
made to his campaign account Tuesday, compared to 50,000-odd deposits
Monday. All told, the postal account has received more than NT$20
million in support of Shih's campaign.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN GROUP TO SEEK AID FROM NYC MAYOR'S ANTI-SMOKING DONATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The John Tung Foundation, Taiwan's largest
anti-smoking advocacy group, said Wednesday it will seek aid from
billionaire New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg to help finance an
Asia-Pacific anti-smoking conference to be held in Taipei next year.</P>
      <P>The foundation made the statement after Bloomberg, a former
smoker, announced a day earlier that he will pour US$125 million of
his own money into a worldwide campaign against smoking, a cause he
said is largely neglected by philanthropists.</P>
      <P>Bloomberg's fortune is estimated at US$5.1 billion, making him
the 40th richest American and 112th in the world, according to Forbes
magazine. He built his wealth after founding the financial
information company that bears his name, and he gives away millions
of dollars each year to benefit medical research, arts groups and
education, among other causes.</P>
      <P>Lin Ching-li, a division chief at the John Tung Foundation, said
the foundation had approached three world-renowned charitable
organizations, including the Rockefeller Foundation, to ask them to
help finance an annual conference of the Asia-Pacific Association for
the Control of Tobacco to be hosted by the foundation in Taipei from
Oct. 17-20, 2007. However, all of them have rejected the foundation's
application.</P>
      <P>"Bloomberg's latest announcement is a welcome fillip to us. We'll
apply for financial aid from the New York mayor's foundation," Lin
said.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, 5 million people around the world die from
smoking-induced diseases every year, outnumbering deaths from
accidents, suicide or cancers.</P>
      <P>Taiwan now has about 4.9 million smokers and an estimated 19,000
people die from smoking-related diseases or second-hand smoking each
year, Lin said, adding that the annual medical and economic expenses
from those diseases far exceed NT$50 billion.</P>
      <P>Lin lamented that Taiwan lags behind many other countries in its
campaign to ban smoking in all public places.</P>
      <P>About 400 to 600 public health and anti-smoking advocacy groups
from around the world are expected to send representatives to the
2007 Asia-Pacific conference on tobacco and health issues, Lin said,
adding that the foundation is raising funds for the conference
through various channels.</P>
      <P>Bloomberg, who quit smoking about 30 years ago, typically writes
his charitable checks without announcing he is doing so, but he
made a special effort to publicize his anti-smoking donation, which
will be spread among several established organizations that have not
yet been selected.</P>
      <P> "Unless we take urgent action, this century a billion people
will die from smoking," Bloomberg said Tuesday. "It is one of the
world's biggest killers, and it has sadly been overlooked by the
philanthropic community."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Grief-stricken over his grandfather's death
last week, Taiwanese basketball player Chou Shih-yuan said his
performance in an Asia Professional Basketball (APB) tournament game
Wednesday night was in tribute to his grandfather.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese national team lost the opening game of the second
round 99-93 to the Perth Wildcats, but it was Chou's four
three-pointers in the third quarter that ignited a furious rally that
almost helped the home team pull off a come-from-behind win.</P>
      <P>Chou was raised by his grandparents until his junior high school
graduation in the southern city of Kaohsiung. Chou's father worked in
another city at the time and was seldom at home.</P>
      <P>For almost ten years, his grandparents were his only family, said
Chou, who learned of his grandfather's death via a cellphone text
message after a team practice session last week.</P>
      <P>"Later, he was bedridden with diabetes and lost most of his
vision, but he listened to almost every one of my basketball games on
television. He always wanted to know if I played well," Chou said.</P>
      <P>"I wasn't able to think about him much while I was on the court
today. But I am glad I had a good game and did not disappoint him,"
said Chou, who scored 16 points in 22 minutes and had his best game
in the tournament so far.</P>
      <P>Chou will miss the next two games as he will be back in Kaohsiung
for the funeral.</P>
      <P>The five-team APB tournament invited four basketball clubs from
Japan, Korea, Australia and the Philippines. The tournament enters
the single round-robin second round Wednesday and concluded on

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug.  16 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP)
should reassess whether it is necessary to introduce a motion in the
next legislative session to topple the Cabinet through a
no-confidence vote, a PFP lawmaker said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chang Hsien-yao, director of the PFP's policy research
center, told reporters that when PFP Chairman James Soong first
announced the PFP would seek to topple the Cabinet, he did it against
a background of Premier Su Tseng-chang voicing support for President
Chen Shui-bian after a legislative motion to recall Chen failed in
late June.</P>
      <P>The recall motion was introduced because the president had been
dogged by a series of corruption scandals implicating his family
members and senior officials at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Chang said, however, that the relationship between the premier
and president seems to have deteriorated recently because in a
partial reshuffle, Su replaced several Cabinet members who were
considered Chen's proteges.</P>
      <P>"The situation is fluid. The PFP must now take into consideration
the tension between the president and the premier, along with other
political factors," Chang said.</P>
      <P>"If we succeed in toppling the Cabinet, we may actually be doing
a service for President Chen by causing the premier to be replaced,"
he explained.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lu Hsueh-chang, convener of the PFP's legislative
caucus, said although the domestic political situation seems
unpredictable, the PFP must still be prepared in case new
developments warrant a no-confidence vote on the premier.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of illegal offenses committed by
Chinese visitors has risen since the Taiwan's government opened
its doors wider to Chinese tourists last year, the Ministry of
Justice (MOJ) reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to MOJ tallies, Chinese citizens made 130,000 to
150,000 visits to Taiwan annually between 2001 and 2004. In 2005,
that number increased to 170,000 as Taiwan allowed in more Chinese
tourists as part of efforts to step up civilian exchanges across
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Between 2001 and 2005, a total of 9,456 Chinese citizens were
caught entering Taiwan illegally, with the annual number hitting a
record of more than 3,000 in 2003.</P>
      <P>Over the past five years, more than 3,000 Chinese citizens have
been convicted of various offenses, accounting for 0.5 percent of
total convictions during the period.</P>
      <P>The Chinese offenders were mainly convicted of document forgery
in marriages of convenience or violating the national security law
due to illegal entry, according to MOJ tallies.</P>
      <P>As of the end of July, 55 Chinese citizens were serving time in
Taiwan's prisons, most of whom were convicted for violating Taiwan's
national security law. Further, 263 other Chinese were being detained

    <HEADLINE>5 TAIWAN ACTIVISTS DEPART FOR TIAOYUTAIS TO PROTEST SHRINE VISIT</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Five Taiwanese activists left for the
disputed Tiaoyutai Islands aboard a boat for recreational fishing
late Wednesday to protest Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's
visit to a controversial Tokyo shrine a day earlier.</P>
      <P>The five protestors, led by Huang Hsi-lin, a member of the Yungho
city assembly in Taipei County, started their voyage from the
county's Shenao fishing port in northern Taiwan. Four journalists
were accompanying them on the voyage.</P>
      <P>Huang said they will sail to waters near the Tiaoyutais -- an
uninhabited island group about 200 km east of Taiwan which is now
held by Japan but also claimed by Taiwan and China -- to protest
Koizumi's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine which honors Japan's war dead,
including 14 Class-A war criminals.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Huang said, the demonstration was also aimed at
protesting Japan's frequent detention and dispersal of Taiwanese
fishermen operating in the overlapping area of the two countries'
200-mile economic zones.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, some Hong Kong activists originally promised
to join them at waters near the Tiaoyutais. But their Hong Kong
counterparts have dropped the plan because their ship has been
impounded by Chinese authorities for unknown reasons, he added.</P>
      <P>Local coast guard officials reminded the protestors not to sail
past the 24-mile demarcation line off the Taiwan coast in line with
the domestic rules governing their stated purpose of "recreational
fishing."</P>
      <P>Koizumi, who intends to step down next month, dealt a blow to
Japan's ties with its Asian neighbors, particularly China and South
Korea, Tuesday by visiting the controversial shrine on the especially
symbolic date of Aug. 15, the anniversary of Japan's surrender in
World War II.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHOU SHIH-YUAN PAYS TRIBUTE TO LATE GRANDFATHER THROUGH BASKETBALL(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 16 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Grief-stricken over his grandfather's death
last week, Taiwanese basketball player Chou Shih-yuan said his
performance in an Asia Professional Basketball (APB) tournament game
Wednesday night was in tribute to his grandfather.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese national team lost the opening game of the second
round 99-93 to the Perth Wildcats, but it was Chou's four
three-pointers in the third quarter that ignited a furious rally that
almost helped the home team pull off a come-from-behind win.</P>
      <P>Chou was raised by his grandparents until his junior high school
graduation in the southern city of Kaohsiung. Chou's father worked in
another city at the time and was seldom at home.</P>
      <P>For almost ten years, his grandparents were his only family, said
Chou, who learned of his grandfather's death via a cellphone text
message after a team practice session last week.</P>
      <P>"Later, he was bedridden with diabetes and lost most of his
vision, but he listened to almost every one of my basketball games on
television. He always wanted to know if I played well," Chou said.</P>
      <P>"I wasn't able to think about him much while I was on the court
today. But I am glad I had a good game and did not disappoint him,"
said Chou, who scored 16 points in 22 minutes and had his best game
in the tournament so far.</P>
      <P>Chou will miss the next two games as he will be back in Kaohsiung
for the funeral.</P>
      <P>The five-team APB tournament invited four basketball clubs from
Japan, Korea, Australia and the Philippines. The tournament enters
the single round-robin second round Wednesday and concluded on
Saturday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOTION TO TOPPLE CABINET SHOULD BE RECONSIDERED: PFP LEGISLATOR(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug.  16 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP)
should reassess whether it is necessary to introduce a motion in the
next legislative session to topple the Cabinet through a
no-confidence vote, a PFP lawmaker said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chang Hsien-yao, director of the PFP's policy research
center, told reporters that when PFP Chairman James Soong first
announced the PFP would seek to topple the Cabinet, he did it against
a background of Premier Su Tseng-chang voicing support for President
Chen Shui-bian after a legislative motion to recall Chen failed in
late June.</P>
      <P>The recall motion was introduced because the president had been
dogged by a series of corruption scandals implicating his family
members and senior officials at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Chang said, however, that the relationship between the premier
and president seems to have deteriorated recently because in a
partial reshuffle, Su replaced several Cabinet members who were
considered Chen's proteges.</P>
      <P>"The situation is fluid. The PFP must now take into consideration
the tension between the president and the premier, along with other
political factors," Chang said.</P>
      <P>"If we succeed in toppling the Cabinet, we may actually be doing
a service for President Chen by causing the premier to be replaced,"
he explained.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lu Hsueh-chang, convener of the PFP's legislative
caucus, said although the domestic political situation seems
unpredictable, the PFP must still be prepared in case new
developments warrant a no-confidence vote on the premier.</P>

      <P>The number of illegal offenses committed by
Chinese visitors has risen since the Taiwan's government opened
its doors wider to Chinese tourists last year, the Ministry of
Justice (MOJ) reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to MOJ tallies, Chinese citizens made 130,000 to
150,000 visits to Taiwan annually between 2001 and 2004. In 2005,
that number increased to 170,000 as Taiwan allowed in more Chinese
tourists as part of efforts to step up civilian exchanges across
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Between 2001 and 2005, a total of 9,456 Chinese citizens were
caught entering Taiwan illegally, with the annual number hitting a
record of more than 3,000 in 2003.</P>
      <P>Over the past five years, more than 3,000 Chinese citizens have
been convicted of various offenses, accounting for 0.5 percent of
total convictions during the period.</P>
      <P>The Chinese offenders were mainly convicted of document forgery
in marriages of convenience or violating the national security law
due to illegal entry, according to MOJ tallies.</P>
      <P>As of the end of July, 55 Chinese citizens were serving time in
Taiwan's prisons, most of whom were convicted for violating Taiwan's
national security law. Further, 263 other Chinese were being detained
for investigation.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  16  (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hezbollah has used sophisticated
weapons made by China and Russia during its latest conflict with
Israel, Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Peres, who is on a visit to the U.S. capital, told a Jewish
gathering that China and Russia sold the weapons to Iran, who then
supplied them to Hezbollah.</P>
      <P>It is widely known that Iran and Syria back Hezbollah, Peres
said, noting that Iran gives US$100 million in aid to Hezbollah per
year, including advanced weapons purchased from China and Russia.</P>
      <P>Iran also helps train Hezbollah fighters, sending at least 100
instructors to Lebanon for that purpose, while Hezbollah has sent its
soldiers to Iran and Syria to receive training, according to Peres.</P>
      <P>Although Israel has been fighting Hezbollah and Palestine, it is
fully aware that the real source of the conflict lies in Iran and
Syria, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Israeli authorities estimated that Hezbollah had 12,000 missiles
and rockets, 4,000 of which have been fired at Israel during the
recent skirmishes.</P>
      <P>"Hezbollah had hoped these missile and rocket attacks could have
destroyed Israel," Peres said, adding, however, most of the mid- and
long-range rockets and missiles were intercepted by Israel's air
force, and only short-range missiles and rockets have caused damage
to Israel.</P>
      <P>The Israeli army was responsible for coping with the short-range
missile and rocket attacks. During the latest conflict, 150 Israeli
soldiers have been killed, and the nation has suffered about US$2
billion worth of damage, he reported.</P>
      <P>On the other side, Peres estimated that 600 Hezbollah fighters
have been killed and nearly 1,000 wounded -- which he called a heavy
blow to its 2,500-strong militia. In addition, 15,000 civilian houses
were damaged or destroyed, he said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  17 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet has set its goals for the
development of the country's information and communications
technology (ICT) platform industry, which include expanding the
production value of the industry from NT$221 billion (US$6.78
billion) at present to NT$1 trillion by 2012.</P>
      <P>Also, the Cabinet aims to nurture three world-class ICT platform
enterprises in the fields of manufacturing services, health services
and Chinese-language digital learning, with the goal of having Taiwan
gain a 50 percent share of the world's Chinese-language digital
learning market by 2012.</P>
      <P>It is the Cabinet's target to shift the pattern of the country's
industries from "Made in Taiwan" to "Service via Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The goals were unveiled during a conference on industrial
technology strategy held Wednesday by the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet predicted that services will become an important
trend in the future, with the services sector contributing 73.2
percent to Taiwan's gross domestic product in 2005 and workers in the
sector accounting for 58.3 percent of the country's employed
population.</P>
      <P>Participants in the conference proposed that Taiwan should take
advantage of information and communications technology to develop
technology-based services.</P>
      <P>Minister-without-Portfolio Lin Ferng-ching pointed out that there
are already several international examples in which ICT is used to
innovate services models, including Skype's interpretation services
and iTune's online music download.</P>
      <P>Lin said Taiwan is in a highly advantageous position in light of
its strong foundation in the manufacturing sector, the popularity of
broadband Internet services in Taiwan, the high quality of Taiwan's
talent pool, and the use of the Chinese language in the country.</P>
      <P>Participants at the conference noted that thanks to the
"Chinese-language fever, " an estimated 30 million people around the
world are learning the Chinese language, with the number expected to

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER PLEDGES TO CREATE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  17 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang pledged Thursday
that the government will create a wide variety of opportunities to
allow young people to display their talent.</P>
      <P>Su said that the youth are an asset of the country and that the
government will help them enrich their knowledge and abilities so
that they can put their learning to practical use.</P>
      <P>He said that the government will create various employment
opportunities so that young people can distinguish themselves in
whatever trade or profession they choose.</P>
      <P>As the division of professions is becoming increasingly
sophisticated, it is very important that education meet the demands
of businesses to ensure that students are properly trained to enter
their chosen professions, Su said.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks during the opening of a national
conference on the development of youth human resources.</P>
      <P>Also at the conference, Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng
noted that European countries have in recent years emphasized that
universities should nurture students' employability.</P>
      <P>However, this does not mean that universities are to be turned
into some kind of vocational training center, he added.</P>
      <P>With more than 90 percent of senior high school graduates in
Taiwan being admitted to universities nowadays, universities are no
longer places for only a small number of elites and should adjust
their concepts accordingly to take into consideration the problems
that graduates might face when seeking employment, Tu said.</P>
      <P>Tu said that in addition to professional knowledge and technical
skills, universities should provide students with training in core
abilities such as problem-solving and working in harmony with others.</P>
      <P>He said that as long as universities strengthen the cultivation
of the humanities and the nurturing of creativity among their
students, no students will lose their employability upon graduation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Japanese government has agreed in
principle to a planned visit to the country in September by former
ROC President Lee Teng-hui, a Japanese TV report said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Japan's public station NHK, the Japanese government
has made the decision based on the judgement that Lee is visiting the
country for sightseeing purposes and has no intention of engaging in
political activities.</P>
      <P>As Japan has offered visa-free entry for Taiwanese tourists since
September last year, the Japanese government is still reviewing if
Lee, as a civilian, is required to apply for a visa for his upcoming
visit, the report said.</P>
      <P>Even if a visa is required, the Japanese government is expected
to issue it promptly, it added.</P>
      <P>Lee first indicated his plan to visit Japan in September during a
news conference Sunday in the southern city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>It will be Lee's third trip to Japan since his retirement in May
2000. He first visited Okayama prefecture in April 2001 to receive
medical treatment for his heart disease and made a second trip
between December 2004 and January 2005 to several Japanese cities,
including Nagoya and Kyoto.</P>
      <P>Lee had originally planned to visit Japan again in May this year
but cancelled the trip after catching a mild case of tuberculosis in
March.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An international forum on healthy cities is
scheduled to take place in Taipei Aug. 22-23 with delegates from 28
cities from home and abroad taking part, Taipei city government
officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The forum, dubbed the 2006 Taipei Healthy Cities Leaders
Roundtable and International Healthy Cities Conference, will bring
together mayors and city officials from the Asia-Pacific, Europe and
the Americas to exchange views on disease prevention, city dwelling
and management of cities, officials from the Taipei City Department
of Health said.</P>
      <P>The forum, sponsored by the Taipei City Department of Health,
will focus on three themes for discussion -- how to optimize city
living standards to make it the most "livable, ' how to instill civic
pride in the city, and city management, said Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Ma said that by holding the international forum, Taipei will
hopefully be transformed into a world-class healthy city.</P>
      <P>Twelve foreign cities are expected to take part, according to Ma.
He said Finland's first capital city of Turku will share its
development experiences at the forum, in particular the city's
renowned birth subsidy plan, its experience in developing automatic
kitchen cabinets and automatic medication boxes for the elderly who
live alone.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Sung Yen-jen, director of the Taipei Department of
Health, said discussions regarding new types of influenza, pneumonia
and AIDS -- as well as relevant healthy policies -- will form the

    <HEADLINE>DPP HEAD MAY CANCEL U.S. VISIT AS DOMESTIC CONFRONTATION LOOMS</HEADLINE>

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman
Yu Shyi-kun said Friday that he is worried about the possible
eruption of conflict between radical forces calling for President
Chen Shui-bian to step down and those opposing such calls.</P>
      <P>Senior DPP officials who have been discussing the domestic
situation suggested that Yu consider canceling his scheduled visit to
the United States in early September.</P>
      <P>According to the DPP officials, the DPP leadership is concerned
as former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh's campaign to depose the
president has been winning much public support while "pan-green camp"
radicals like TV personality Wang Pen-hu and Legislator Wang
Hsing-nan have been urging their supporters to demonstrate their
"power" to protect Chen.</P>
      <P>During a meeting of DPP officials, Yu said if the trend
continues, a conflict could erupt between "depose-the-president"
forces and those vowing to "protect the president, " with social
chaos possibly to follow.</P>
      <P>Senior DPP officials said that as the ruling party, the DPP's
priority is to maintain political stability and concentrate on
national development. For that reason, they said, the DPP will not
organize any "counter-Shih" activities.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, they noted, the party cannot ignore
"grass-roots voices" that call for counter-measures against Shih's
campaign. "The party leadership is indeed in a quandary," they said.</P>
      <P>Yu has called on Shih to exercise "self-restraint" and tried to
pacify people like Wang Pen-hu and Wang Hsing-nan, but to no avail.</P>
      <P>Wang Pen-hu ran an ad Friday urging the public to do something to
"counter" Shih, an indication that he simply could not be pacified,
according to DPP sources.</P>
      <P>The DPP said it is paying close attention to what might happen if
the "counter-Shih" forces continue to gain momentum.</P>
      <P>Since Shih has claimed that he might start a sit-in by late
August, and his opponents are readying for a fight, Yu and his staff
have discussed whether to go ahead with their planned visit to the
United States in early September, DPP officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP LAWMAKER CALLS FOR 'STYLE' IN FACE OF OUTCRY AGAINST PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  17  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A lawmaker of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) on Thursday urged party members to react with
reason and style in the face of a former DPP chairman's campaign to
depose the embattled President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lee Wen-chung made the remarks after Shih
Ming-teh's launch of a drive calling for "one million people to
depose President Chen."</P>
      <P>Lee said that he himself does not support Shih's drive but "feels
ashamed and chose to keep his mouth shut" facing a mounting public
outcry in the wake of a string of corruption allegations implicating
the president himself, his close aides and family members.</P>
      <P>However, he said that he feels "more ashamed for the way some DPP
politicians responded to Shih, " and he urged them "to act with
panache whether they are for or against President Chen, " or it "will
only create further social divisions."</P>
      <P>He called for DPP politicians to engage in "deep
soul-searching" and to show humility instead of resorting to
sensational "character assault."</P>
      <P>Legislator Wang Shih-chien said that many "core" supporters of
the DPP can no longer put up with Shih.</P>
      <P>Wang said that Wang Peng-hu, a former TV host of a political
commentary program, has decided to hold a rally at the 228 Peace
Memorial Park Aug. 26 to highlight a drive to safeguard President
Chen and Taiwan and to stand up to Shih.</P>
      <P>Shih launched his drive at the same park last Saturday, urging
people to each donate NT$100 to the campaign. If the target of one
million donors can be reached within one month, the campaign to
depose Chen will be launched Sept. 9 with daily sit-ins by protesters
in front of the Presidential Office. If the target of one million can
be achieved sooner, the campaign will also start to roll earlier than
planned, according to Shih.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wang estimated that between 10,000 and 20,000 people
will attend the Aug. 26 rally, but there will be no donation
solicitation.</P>
      <P>Wang urged Shih "to stop before the edge of the precipice, "
noting that Shih devoted himself to the democratic movement for over
two decades in his younger years and that he "shouldn't be taken
advantage of by others who have other motives" in the waning years of
his life.</P>
      <P>He referred to the "others" as being the opposition parties,
adding that the main opposition Kuomintang could funnel money from
selling its "ill-gotten" party assets into Shih's accounts. This is
the reason why the amount of money collected in the drive has already
reached NT$45 million as of Wednesday, Wang claimed. </P>
      <P>Yet another DPP legislator, Huang Wei-cher, said that Shih has
turned a deaf ear to goodwill advice from within the party.</P>
      <P>Huang suggested that Shih should not be aloof and not harbor ill
will for the suggestions from within the party, saying that he does
not want to see Shih display "moral arrogance."</P>

attending a Parent-Child Day activity at the Presidential Office
Thursday to pledge to open up their piggy banks at the end of the
year and donate the money to help impoverished children around the
world.</P>
      <P>President Chen said that in the spirit of voluntarism, the

impoverished children at home and abroad, which he said is the
embodiment of love and compassion.</P>
      <P>The president also said that it is very good for the Presidential

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ideological differences over cross-strait
relations may be behind former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Shih Ming-teh's refusal to cooperate with the Democratic
Action Alliance (DAA) , even though both are dedicated to deposing
scandal-ridden President Chen Shui-bian, a DAA leader said Friday.</P>
      <P>Huang Kuang-kuo, DAA convener, said the alliance has invited Shih
several times since June to lead a populist movement to topple the
president, but Shih has consistently refused.</P>
      <P>"Now I realize that it might be our proposal for 'one China, two
Constitutions' that has been the problem," he said.</P>
      <P>The two Constitutions refer to those of the People's Republic of
China and the Republic of China (Taiwan) . Shih is a staunch Taiwan
sovereigntist.</P>
      <P>Huang, Chang Ya-chung and other DAA leaders gave a press
conference in which they announced that after paying a visit to an
ancient temple in Tainan last week, they plan to pay tribute to
another ancient deity in Chiayi's Cheng Huang Temple this weekend.</P>
      <P>They will also continue pushing their proposal to depose the
president in a peaceful, legal and non-violent way in the "democracy
night market" at Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall.</P>
      <P>They again invited Shih to discuss coordinating a plan to topple
the president, as they have obtained permission to use Ketagalan
Boulevard for a mass sit-in.</P>
      <P>As the protest may draw a large crowd, DAA leaders are demanding
that Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who concurrently serves as opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) chairman, to make clear his position with regard to
the street rally.</P>
      <P>"Do you want to be an opposition leader, or a mayor of the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Frank Hsieh, the Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP) nominee for Taipei mayor, challenged his Kuomintang
(KMT) opponent Hau Lung-pin Thursday to a debate on Hsieh's proposal
for Taipei to host the 2020 Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he hopes Hau will not evade a public debate on the
issue, since Hau has openly expressed disapproval of it.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is
expected to decide on a host city for the 2020 Olympic Games in
2013, and cities vying for the right will file an application
with the IOC in 2011.</P>
      <P>Therefore, a country should decide in 2009 or 2010 as to which
city will represent it, Hsieh said, adding that it is mistaken for
Hau to say that making such a bid would keep Taipei residents waiting
14 years for a decision on the application.</P>
      <P>In response to Hsieh's invitation, Wu Hsiu-kuang, the spokesman
of Hau's office, said at present it would be impractical for Taipei
to focus its attention on making a bid to host the Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>Wu said a successful bid would be impossible when Taipei lacks
the funds and a proper venue for hosting the event.</P>
      <P>Hau will only enter a debate on issues related to municipal
governance with other mayoral candidates after he officially
registers his candidacy with election authorities, Wu said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Chen Ruey-long
said Thursday that the key to allowing local companies using 0.18
micron process technology to invest in China is implementing the
proper complementary measures.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks one day after Morris Chang, founder and
chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), urged the
government to allow local chip makers to set up factories in China
using the advanced 0.18 micron process technology. </P>
      <P>Chang argued that doing so will not be detrimental to Taiwan's
high-technology industry but will instead help sharpen Taiwan
companies' competitiveness. The TSMC is one of the biggest IC chip
foundries in the world.</P>
      <P>"The ministry fully understands the stance of TSMC, " Chen said,
adding that the ministry's position is "similar to that of industry
and that the opening is only a question of timing."</P>
      <P>The ministry will convene a meeting with the Investment
Commission under the Ministry of Economic Affairs for further
discussions on the matter and will hold consultations with the
Mainland Affairs Council, the nation's top China policy planner, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>"Whatever the final decision on the matter is, the most important
thing is working out good complementary measures," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Theodore M.S. Huang, president of the influential
Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce, said that
business hopes that the government will cut its interference in their
affairs to a minimum. He was referring to the present 40 percent
ceiling on local businesses investing in China.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks after paying a visit to Chen to
congratulate him on assuming his new post last week and to get a
better understanding of his trade and economic policy.</P>
      <P>Huang said that the attitude of the business sector is clear,
namely that the government should reduce its interference to a
minimum and adopt an "active opening" policy toward cross-strait
economic and trade affairs instead of the "active management" policy
advocated by President Chen Shu-bian earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Huang said that local businesses will make decisions on whether
to invest in China based on considerations of economic efficiency and
not on political considerations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REASSESSMENT OF UNIVERSITY EDUCATION NEEDED: OFFICIALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  17 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a time of globalization and when the
college acceptance rate is nearing 100 percent, traditional thinking
on university education should be re-evaluated to meet the challenges
of today, government officials said Thursday at a conference.</P>
      <P>"Several decades ago, a university graduate was almost guaranteed
an upper-level position within a public or private organization, but
now times have changed," said Premier Su Tseng-chang in his opening
remarks at the National Youth Human Resources Development Conference.</P>
      <P>The impact of globalization and an increasing number of
universities and graduates are two key factors posing problems for
youth who are seeking employment today, since everyone is facing
tougher domestic and international competition, he said.</P>
      <P>"What we need to do is create a diversified environment that
allows young people to find the most suitable profession," Su said.</P>
      <P>"Obtaining employment -- not passing a college entrance exam --
has thus become the first and greatest challenge for local university
graduates," said Chen Bo-chih, an economist and president of
Taiwan Thinktank.</P>
      <P>However, the growing unemployment rate among youth is not -- at
least directly -- the result of booming numbers of universities
and graduates, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The key will be closing the gap between university education and
corporate needs, which currently do not fit, said Minister of
Education Tu Cheng-sheng.</P>
      <P>Tu stressed this does not signify that university education
should and will become a form of pre-employment training for students.</P>
      <P>"A university education should place more of an emphasis on core
competencies such as humanity, responsibility, leadership,
communication, teamwork and entrepreneurship," he said.</P>
      <P>"Professional skills and expertise, the other part of employee
qualifications, can be developed on and off campus," Tu said.</P>
      <P>The National Youth Human Resources Development Conference was
held to tackle four issues -- "employability," creating jobs,
entrepreneurship and equal opportunity -- as proposed by U.N.
Secretary Kofi Annan in 2003.</P>
      <P>For the first time, the conference was coordinated by five
governmental organizations, including the Ministry of Education, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, the National Youth Commission, the
Council for Labor Affairs and the Council for Economic Planning and
Development.</P>

the police would be flexible on this issue.</P>
      <P>Shih has said if the police drive them out at night, usually
after 10:00 p.m., he will lead the crowd to "move to other places to

      <P>The Japanese Defense Agency mobilized seven patrol boats to guard
against the chartered boat, with one surveillance aircraft hovering
above.</P>
      <P>The protesters yielded to the Japanese patrol boats' intimidation
and sailed back to Shenao port shortly before noon Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Tiaoyutais, an uninhabited island group about 200 km east of
Taiwan, which for decades has been claimed by Japan, China and
Taiwan, are currently held by Japan.</P>
      <P>Koizumi's visit to Yasukuni Shrine Tuesday dealt a blow to
Japan's ties with its neighbors, particularly China and South Korea,
and also whipped up anger among Taiwan's political activists.</P>
      <P>The activists' protest at sea has also drawn the attention of the
Coast Guard Administration (CGA) , which sent a patrol boat to sail
alongside the chartered fishing boat -- on one hand to protect the
protesters, CGA authorities claimed, while gathering evidence about
the activity on the other, which the CGA deemed illegal.</P>
      <P>CGA authorities said the protesters may face fines of between
NT$30,000 and NT$150,000 for being in violation of the country's
maritime laws, which stipulate that chartered fishing boats can be
used only for their designated purposes, and must not sail beyond
Taiwan's territorial waters.</P>
      <P>Protesters' leader Huang Hsi-lin, a member of the Yungho city
assembly in Taipei County, said Thursday's protest was just a "warm
up" of their protest against Japan. Huang said a large-scale protest,
with the participation of protesters from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau
and China, will be staged at the end of this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROMOTING YOUTH EMPLOYMENT A FULL-SCALE TASK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,    Aug.   17   (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It will take a full-scale
cross-departmental effort to promote youth employment, a growing
concern and critical factor for Taiwan's future national
competitiveness, a national conference concluded Thursday.</P>
      <P>The National Youth Human Resources Development Conference,
organized by five government agencies, invited more than 400
attendees and laid out a detailed conclusion that covered four topics
-- employability, employment creation, entrepreneurship and equal
opportunity.</P>
      <P>A large part of the suggestions made in the conference were
education-related, including a complete review of the military
conscription system and better integration between vocational
education and corporate needs to improve youth employability.
Attendees also called for only core classes to be taught in the
freshman and sophomore years at universities.</P>
      <P>To promote entrepreneurship, universities are encouraged to
establish entrepreneurship courses and facilitate more exchanges
between students and corporations.</P>
      <P>Government should also play an important role in providing more
business start-up loans, re-defining underprivileged people and
protecting their employment, promoting gender equality and cutting
the salary gap between men and women.</P>
      <P>Employment creation will be one of the most urgent tasks for the
government, the conference concluded. To create more jobs the
government should work on the development of industries such as the
culture and creative industries. Young people should also be
encouraged to work for non-governmental organizations and non-profit
organizations.</P>
      <P>The one-day conference gathered university presidents, academics
and representatives from both industries and youth organizations.
Three regional conferences were held in the north, central and south
of the country before the main conference.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DRIVE TO OUST PRESIDENT DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE: PFP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A nationwide campaign initiated by former
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Shih Ming-teh seeking
President Chen Shui-bian's ouster will have difficulty achieving its
aim, the opposition People First Party (PFP) predicted Thursday.</P>
      <P>PFP legislative caucus whip Lu Shueh-chang told a news conference
at the Legislative Yuan that Chen will not voluntarily quit the
presidency, despite the ouster drive, unless all opposition parties
unite in launching a motion to impeach Chen or proposing a second
motion to recall the president, or unless the United States puts
pressure on him.</P>
      <P>"Only putting forward a motion to impeach Chen or launching a
second recall vote in the Legislative Yuan will keep strong enough
pressure on Chen and force him to step down, " said Lu, calling for
full inter-party cooperation at the Legislative Yuan to impeach Chen
or pass a no-confidence vote.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, the PFP has already prepared a no-confidence
proposal statement to topple the Cabinet and October would be a good
time to call for the vote after the new legislative session opens in
late September.</P>
      <P>Some of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers have
agreed to endorse the PFP's no-confidence proposal, while various DPP
legislators have also reacted positively to the planned move, he
said.</P>
      <P>Lu also urged KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou to "help form a Cabinet"
since the ruling DPP has performed poorly since coming to power in
2000 and because the KMT and the PFP together control more than half
of the seats at the legislature.</P>
      <P>Lu further pointed out that "the PFP would not oppose Legislative
Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, a KMT member, forming a Cabinet" if
incumbent Premier Su Tseng-chang steps down following the success of
a no-confidence vote.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, Chen may replace Su should the opposition launch
a no-confidence vote and will suggest forming a Cabinet with the
opposition as a means of splitting them.</P>
      <P>However, Chang Hsien-yao, director of the PFP's policy center who
is also a legislator, dismissed Lu's rhetoric later that same day,
describing it as "just Lu's personal opinion" and pointing out that
"it is too early to talk about the issue as Chen has not even
questioned Wang regarding his willingness in this regard."</P>
      <P>The China Times daily newspaper quoted an unidentified DPP
heavyweight as claiming that day that relations between Chen and Su
have become tense recently and that Chen "might very probably"
nominate a candidate to replace Su if the opposition resorts to a
no-confidence vote at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The DPP old guard has also predicted that Wang will not accept
Chen's nomination for the premier post due to pressure from the KMT
and that Su may step down before Chen, the China Times reported.</P>

      <P>Customs agents have seized counterfeit
fashion items and pirated video games in recent months worth a
combined NT$20 million, a spokesman for the Taipei Customs Bureau
under the Ministry of Finance's Directorate- General of Customs
reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, customs agents seized 1,713 items of
fake brand-name products, including leather goods, sunglasses and
clothes since customs agents began stepping up inspections of
international express delivery packages in June. The pirated products
bearing the Luis Vuitton, Gucci, Burberry and Ralph Lauren labels had
a market value of NT$11 million, he said.</P>
      <P>A total of 6,800 fake Sony video game disks were nabbed by Taipei
Customs Bureau agents Aug. 14 -- the second seizure of its kind after
1,626 bootleg X-Box video game disks were seized, the spokesman said,
noting that the two seizures were worth more than NT$10 million.</P>
      <P>Since the Taipei Customs Bureau has implemented a fast clearance
measure to allow for quick passage of express delivery packages and
low-priced items within three minutes, smuggling of pirated items
using the method has been on the rise, he said, pointing out that

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN REPORTS SUCCESS IN BREEDING GERM-FREE MICE, RATS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is able to breed germ-free mice and
rats for research and experimental purposes after five years of
efforts, an associate research fellow of the National Applied
Research Laboratories (NARL) reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>Y.C. Huang of the NARL's National Laboratory Animal Center said
they have been successful in establishing isolators and
developing technology to breed the germ-free mice.</P>
      <P>The center now has 38 units of isolators for the germ-free mice
and rats, Huang said, adding that although it can produce 50 germ-
free mice a month, it still cannot mass produce to meet the needs of
researchers.</P>
      <P>He noted that laboratory mice are usually the first stage in
animal testing. The germ- free mice are the highest level of
laboratory mice, in contrast to mice commonly known as specific
pathogen free (SPF), which are only free of specific pathogens.</P>
      <P>Huang said the feed, water and other items for the germ- free
mice and rats have to undergo rigorous sterilization, which is why
only a few laboratories in Europe, Japan and the United States are
capable of breeding germ-free mice and rats, he added.</P>
      <P>He noted that the center sent officials to Japan to learn 
quality control and management procedures five years ago.</P>
      <P>He said germ-free mice and rats are especially useful in the
research of genetic engineering, cancer, normal intestine flora,
immunology and nutrition research.</P>
      <P>The cost of breeding germ- free mice and rats is high, he added,
with the cost of each isolator as high as NT$400,000.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, he said the center has worked with universities and
research institutes to obtain funds from the National Science Council 
for a three-year project to build a bigger isolator.</P>
      <P>Six strains of mice and rats at the center have been kept germ-
free since August 2003, Huang said, adding that he expects the number
of germ- free mice bred by the center to increase 500 by the middle
of next year.</P>
      <P>Because of the success, the Riken BioResource Center of Japan has
expressed the desire to cooperate with the center for research, he
said.</P>

      <P>An American couple adopted a Taiwanese girl
in the southern city of Chiayi Thursday, making her their ninth
child.</P>
      <P>William Adams, an emergency room surgeon at a hospital in
Pennsylvania, and his wife Betty adopted 11-year-old Fan Ya-hui at a
ceremony held at a Catholic church under the witness of Liao Su-hui,
the wife of the Chiayi county magistrate, officials from the Chiayi
county government in charge of social affairs, and church workers.</P>
      <P>At the ceremony, Adams said he and his wife have four children of
their own, four adopted children, and that Ya-hui will be their fifth
adopted child. The four other adopted children include two sons and
one daughter from China, aged four, five and six, respectively, and
one son from South Korea, who is three years old.</P>
      <P>Adams said there are no cultural problems at his home with so
many kids with different ethnic backgrounds around. He said he and his
wife brought their own children to China when they went there to
adopt the three Chinese kids. The "field trip" allowed the children
to get into contact with different cultures and it helped instill
harmony at home, Adams said.</P>

"beautiful child."</P>
      <P>Ya-hui was born in 1996 to a mentally disturbed woman who was
raped by an unknown assailant. Ya-hui's grandmother was also mentally
disturbed and unable to raise her, so Ya-hui's grandfather sent her
to an orphanage in 1998.</P>
      <P>At the ceremony, Adams' youngest daughter, 12-year-old Rebecca
Erin, held Ya-hui by the hand and welcomed her "new sister."</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Liao said that every life in the world
has a place suitable for it. She wished Ya-hui good luck living in

    <HEADLINE>JAPAN'S TOP SUMO WRESTLERS IN TAIPEI FOR EXHIBITION MATCHES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Japan's 42 highest-ranked sumo wrestlers in
the top Makuuchi division of the sport arrived in Taipei Thursday as
part of a delegation of the Japan Sumo Association for a five-day
tour of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 100-strong delegation also includes sumo judges and logistics
workers who will support the wrestlers in two days of exhibition
competition Aug. 19-20 at the Taipei Arena, known as "the Little
Dome."</P>
      <P>The delegation arrived at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport
aboard two flights. Donning Japanese traditional costumes and
standing out among the other passengers, the wrestlers, called
rikishi or sumotori in Japan, attracted immediate attention as they
entered the arrivals lounge.</P>
      <P>Japanese tourists, who looked surprised when they recognized
their heroes of the sumo ring, swarmed around the stars for photos.</P>
      <P>This is the first visit to Taiwan by a Japanese sumo team since
the end of World War II. It is also seen as the first major cultural
exchange between Taiwan and Japan since Japan switched diplomatic
recognition from Taiwan to China in 1972.</P>
      <P>Most conspicuous among the wrestlers is Asashoryu Akinori, 26,
the first sumo wrestler from Mongolia to reach the rank of yokozuna,
or grand champion -- the highest sumo rank. Standing 184 cm and
weighing 148 kg, he is also the sole active yokozuna at present.</P>
      <P>Since being granted the title of yokozuna in January 2003,
Asashoryu has won 14 tournaments and has set a record of seven
consecutive tournament victories, including two 15-0 wins in January
and May of 2005.</P>
      <P>Yokozuna is the ultimate goal for a sumo wrestler and is a rank
greatly respected by everyone associated with the sport. Records show
there have been 68 rikishi crowned yokozuna in the entire history of
the sport. This means that only one in every 1,000 rikishi can
achieve this status.</P>
      <P>Another star wrestler of Mongolian origin is Hakuho Sho, 22, who
is the sixth foreign-born wrestler to reach the rank of ozeki, the
champion rank immediately below yokozuna. He is 192 cm tall and
weighs 153 kg.</P>
      <P>Also ranked as an ozeki is the 23-year-old Bulgarian sumo
wrestler Kotooshu Katsunori, who stands 203 cm tall and weighs 147
kg.</P>
      <P>Loved by the Japanese as the "prince of sumo" because of his good
looks, Kotooshu reached his current rank from the bottom Jonokuchi
division after only 19 tournaments from his professional sumo debut
in November 2002 -- the most rapid rise for a professional sumo
wrestler.</P>
      <P>He is also the first wrestler of European origin to hold the
ozeki rank. Like Hakuho, he is one of only six non-Japanese to have
achieved that status.</P>
      <P>Also ranked as an ozeki is Chiyotaikai Ryuji, 30. Measuring 181
cm in height and weighing 158 kg, he joined professional sumo in 1992
and is one of only three wrestlers in history who have retained the
ozeki rank for seven years. He is known for his explosive first
strike at the start of a bout.</P>
      <P>Another ozeki in the team is Kaio Hiroyuki, 34, who is 185 cm
tall and weighs 170 kg. He has won five top division tournament
championships -- a record for any rikishi who has not achieved the
status of yokozuna.</P>
      <P>Makuuchi, the top division in the sumo sport, consists of four
levels. Below the ranks of yokozuna and ozeki are sekiwake, komusubi
and maegashira.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The possibility of Legislative Yuan Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng forming a Cabinet is low, because the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) will not be willing to cede the central
government's power to the opposition parties, a lawmaker of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whip Tsai Chin-lung made the prediction
while answering questions from reporters after the China Times quoted
an unidentified DPP heavyweight as reporting that Wang, a KMT member,
might be nominated by President Chen Shui-bian to form a Cabinet as
Chen "might very probably" replace Premier Su Tseng-chang in the
short term in an attempt to secure his presidency amid a nationwide
campaign seeking his ouster.</P>
      <P>As Chen has not yet nominated Wang to take over the premier post,
it is better to refrain from speculating on the issue, Tsai said,
adding that in any case, conditions are not yet ripe for such a
nomination to occur.</P>
      <P>Although Tsai speculated that Su is likely to step down soon, he
said Wang will not be nominated by Chen for the premiership.</P>
      <P>Besides Wang's need to acquire Chen's nomination, the KMT's
stance and support is equally important, Tsai said, expressing his
skepticism that the DPP is willing to cede power.</P>
      <P>However, he contended that October would be a good time for the
opposition parties to either initiate an impeachment or launch a
second recall vote against Chen or propose a no-confidence vote to
topple the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>"Whatever move the opposition decides to make, the KMT cannot
achieve it by itself, " Tsai said, adding that "matching the
subjective and objective factors are extremely important" if success
is to be ensured.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's per capita gross domestic product
(GDP) is expected to top US$16,000 in 2007, officials from the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS)
predicted Thursday.</P>
      <P>The GDP per capita is estimated to stand at US$15,580 this year,
up US$289 from the figure posted in 2005, DGBAS officials said,
adding that this increase is the basis for the 2007 forecast.</P>
      <P>The officials predicted that the overall economy for this year
will grow by 4.28 percent, the consumer price index will advance by
1.8 percent, the wholesale price index soar by 5.4 percent, while the
per capita gross national product will top US$16,024, with the GDP
per capita reaching US$15,580.</P>
      <P>They forecast that Taiwan's foreign trade will return to a
"normal track" in 2007 with the expansion of foreign markets slowing
slightly. Domestic consumption will expand mildly as adverse factors
such as the "credit card slave" issue are gradually resolved.
Investment in the private sector is also expected to increase
slightly next year, with investment in high technology industries
continuing to flourish and procurement of passenger aircraft by
private carriers increasing.</P>

      <P>James Soong, chairman of the opposition
People First Party (PFP), said Thursday that he reserves the right to
appeal a Taiwan High Court ruling that upheld a district court
judgment holding former President Lee Teng-hui guilty of slandering
him but slashed the damages awarded to him from NT$10 million
(NT$305,470) to NT$2 million.</P>
      <P>Soong told reporters that he disagreed with the presiding judge's
statement that the amount was reached because damages awarded in
previous libel and slander cases have not exceeded NT$3 million.</P>
      <P>The ruling would "set a bad precedent with far-reaching
implications," he said, adding that by limiting the damages in all
defamation lawsuits to under NT$3 million, it would mean that wealthy
people willing to part with that amount "can now fabricate lies about
others at will."</P>
      <P>Soong, however, expressed appreciation for the fact that the high
court upheld the guilty ruling against Lee, who insinuated in a
public speech April 24, 2004 that Soong was playing mahjong with
friends while his followers were fighting with police in a protest
against President Chen Shui-bian's re-election.</P>
      <P>The high court also ordered Lee to run an apology in three major
newspapers for one day rather than in nine newspapers for three days
in a row, as prescribed in the lower court's judgment of Nov. 18,
2005.</P>
      <P>Soong said that if he is to appeal the high court ruling, he will
ask that another mass-circulation newspaper -- the Apple Daily -- be
added to the three major dailies -- the United Daily News, the China
Times and the Liberty Times.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The administration has stood its ground
despite the pall over the domestic political arena, Cabinet spokesman
Cheng Wen-tsang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Cheng made the remarks after a local newspaper quoted an
unidentified ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) elder
politician as claiming that relations between President Chen
Shui-bian and Premier Su Tseng-chang have soured and that Su is
likely to step down sooner than Chen.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that the DPP administration might face a political

the Executive Yuan has stood its ground intact.</P>
      <P>"None of the looming political upheavals have affected the
administrative team's work schedule and communications between the

exchanged views with Chen extensively prior to the recent

      <P>According to Cheng, the Cabinet is now busy with preparing the
2007 central government budget plan, which must be referred to the

    <HEADLINE>DRIVE TO DEPOSE PRESIDENT 'AN ABSURD DRAMA': DPP LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Friday that former DPP Chairman Shih
Ming-teh's campaign to oust President Chen Shui-bian "is about
the most absurd drama in the world."</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Gao Jyh-peng was referring to Shih's "one million
citizens to depose President Chen" campaign launched last Saturday in
which he has called for every citizen to donate NT$100 (US$3) to the
campaign.</P>
      <P>Shih has said that if the target of one million donors can be
reached within one month, the campaign to depose Chen will be
launched Sept. 9 with daily sit-ins by protesters in front of the
Presidential Office, and that if the target of one million can be
achieved sooner, the daily sit-ins will be launched earlier than
planned.</P>
      <P>Gao, generally considered a protege of the embattled president,
said "the whole world is erratic, " noting that Shih, with the "halo
of being a former DPP chairman around his head, " has attracted core
supporters of the "pan-blue alliance" of the main opposition
Kuomintang and its ally, the People First Party.</P>
      <P>Gao said that core "pan-blue" supporters total more than one
million in number and that Shih is therefore sure to be able to reach
the goal of his campaign. He added that even if the goal is reached,
he doesn't see the campaign as having any legitimacy.</P>
      <P>As of Thursday, the amount of money donated to the campaign had
reached NT$65 million, according to Shih.</P>
      <P>Another DPP legislator, Wang Shih-chien, said he hopes President
Chen, who has been dogged by a series of corruption allegations
implicating himself, his family members and close aides, will review
what must be reviewed but will stick to his guns in these most
difficult times. "This is the darkness before the dawn," he added.</P>
      <P>Wang also said that Wang Peng-hu, a former TV host of a political
commentary program, has decided to hold a rally at the 228 Peace
Memorial Park Aug. 26 to highlight a drive to protect President Chen
and Taiwan and to stand up to Shih.</P>
      <P>Wang said that he expects at least 10,000 people will take part
in the rally at this "critical point in time."</P>

    <HEADLINE>BOTH SIDES WANT MORE U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN CROSS-STRAIT TIES: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Both Taiwan and China have put pressure
on Washington to become more directly involved in cross-Taiwan Strait
relations, an American expert on cross-strait affairs said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Bonnie Glaser, consultant and senior associate at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, made the comment in agreeing
with a similar analysis released last week by the Congressional
Research Service.</P>
      <P>On the China side, Glaser said, Beijing has worked harder to
press the United States to take steps to restrain President Chen
Shui-bian from "unilaterally changing the status quo, " including
preventing changes in the language of sensitive parts of Taiwan's
constitution.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that Beijing pressed Washington to prevent Taiwan
from abolishing the National Unification Council (NUC) and the
National Unification Guidelines (NUG).</P>
      <P>"Beijing now urges the U.S. to play a more active role than in
the past, as long as its efforts serve China's objectives, " Glaser
said.</P>
      <P>However, in areas where the U.S. role is viewed as unhelpful,
Beijing continues to hope for "less interference, " she said, noting
that this includes arms sales to Taiwan and other forms of
U.S.-Taiwan military cooperation, as well as approval of transits by
senior Taiwan officials through the United States.</P>
      <P>On the Taiwan side, Taipei has sought more help from the United
States to promote Taiwan's participation in some international
organizations such as the World Health Organization, Glaser said.</P>
      <P>Taipei has also tried to elicit congressional support through
non-governmental efforts for changing the one China policy and
revising the Taiwan Relations Act and sought to convince Washington
to support its effort to abolish the NUC and NUG, she said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taipei hopes Washington will not exert pressure to
establish direct cross-strait transportation, business and postal
links, she said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in light of the danger of cross-strait conflict and
rising tensions between China and Taiwan, the United States has been
compelled in its own interests to become more involved and has warned
both Taipei and Beijing to forgo any steps that would unilaterally
change the status quo, Glaser said.</P>
      <P>While Washington has informed Beijing that any use of force
against Taiwan, no matter how limited it might be, would lead to a
U.S. response, it has also warned President Chen not to take any
steps that could be provocative, she said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHARITABLE FUND OFFERS INCENTIVE TO ENCOURAGE SELF-RELIANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 18 (CNA)
(By Ada Tsai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local charitable foundation has launched
a special program to encourage college students from poor families to
be self-reliant, a spokeswoman said Friday.</P>
      <P>The project, now in its second year, has proven successful in
inspiring undergraduate students to manage their personal finances
while studying hard and doing volunteer work, said Ho Chiu-hui, a
staff member with the Tainan County branch of the Taiwan Fund for
Children and Families (TFCF).</P>
      <P>Under the project, selected college students who have received
regular TFCF financial support are required to save between NT$1,000
and NT$4,000 per month and deposit the money in their accounts at
Chinatrust Commercial Bank. At the end of the year, the bank will
give each student an amount matching that which they have saved
during the course of the year.</P>
      <P>Since the program was launched last year, many college students
from impoverished families have applied to join, according to Ho. He
said that 10 students were selected for the program last year and
that seven have been chosen this year.</P>
      <P>During the one-year period, each participant has to do 100 hours
of volunteer work at the TFCF and attend 40 hours of training courses
in financial management and social functions, Ho said.</P>

The Moscow City Court convicted Yukos' former security chief

Pichugin's lawyers will appeal the ruling, which they said was

    <HEADLINE>DPP LAWMAKERS BLAST MA FOR ALLOWING INDEFINITE SIT-IN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two legislators from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) lashed out at the Taipei City government
Friday for allowing an "indefinite, round-the-clock" sit-in to be
staged in front of the Presidential Office to unseat President Chen
Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Wang Shih-chien lambasted Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou, who doubles as chairman of the opposition Kuomintang, for
approving the sit-in on Ketagalan Boulevard to be staged from Sept. 9
by former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh and his supporters calling for
one million people to come out to depose the president.</P>
      <P>Wang said Ma was drafting a "Shih Ming-teh Clause" by allowing
Shih and his supporters to launch the round-the-clock sit-in in front
of the Presidential Office. He ridiculed Ma by asking him whether in
the future all people who apply to hold demonstrations or sits-in in
Taipei City would be allowed to stage the activities indefinitely and
round-the-clock.</P>
      <P>Wang said Ma should bear responsibility for whatever might occur
during the sit-in.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Legislator Lin Kuo-ching criticized Ma for
"leading Taiwan's capital to become a chaotic society where there is
no justice and people cannot tell right from wrong."</P>
      <P>In contrast, a whip of the opposition People First Party
legislative caucus gave the thumbs up to Ma, saying that Ma has
"improved" concerning affairs regarding public demonstrations.</P>
      <P>Shih, who has been nicknamed Taiwan's Mandela after being
imprisoned off and on for 25 years for democratic movement
activities, announced the sit-in drive last weekend, saying that the
protest will begin after the campagin obtains the endorsement of one
million people and NT$100 million in donations.</P>
      <P>According to National Taiwan University professor Ho De-fen, who
is also a spokeswoman for the campaign, more than 600,000 people have
signed up and NT$65 million has been raised as of Thursday.</P>
      <P>As public support has been far higher than expected, the sit-in
on Ketagalan Boulevard may begin ahead of the originally scheduled
date, probably some time next week, Ho said.</P>
      <P>President Chen has been embroiled over the past several months in
a string of corruption allegations involving his family members and

    <TEXT>
      <P>Administrative neutrality will be the
guiding principle for the government when looking at a populist
campaign to depose President Chen Shui-bian through a
"NT$100-per-citizen" fundraising and sit-in publicity stunt, Minister
of the Interior (MOI) Lee Yi-yang said Friday.</P>
      <P>Former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Shih
Ming-teh's "one million people campaign to depose President Chen
Shui-bian" has raised the questions of whether the "political"
fundraising is legal and whether Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou was being
fair when he said the city police have the authority to decide
whether to crack down on sit-in protesters after 10 p.m.</P>
      <P>MOI officials have claimed that since the sit-in is a political
activity, donations to the campaign are illegal from the perspective
of the law governing political donations.</P>
      <P>But campaign organizers and the public have ignored the
officials' warning, with an estimated 500,000 people contributing
over NT$65 million barely a week after Shih kicked off the campaign
last weekend.</P>
      <P>Some DPP lawmakers attacked Ma, who is also chairman of the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT), for adopting what they claim is a double
standard with regard to enforcing the law on marches and assemblies.</P>
      <P>Lee, whose ministry is responsible for regulating both political
fundraising and street protests and petitions, said both laws have
nothing to do with policy.</P>
      <P>Rather, the responsible authorities will use their professional
standards to interpret and implement the laws on the principle of
administrative neutrality, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition lawmaker complained Friday
that Chinese chocolate is not properly marked with its place of
origin, which she claimed seriously affects the rights of consumers
and food sanitation.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lai Shin-yuan of the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
made the remarks at a news conference attended by officials from the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) and the Department of Health
(DOH).</P>
      <P>Lai noted that Taiwan opened its market to Chinese chocolate
April 1, but despite an MOEA pledge that it would demand China to
mark the place of origin of the chocolate, it had failed to do so,
citing the reasons of protracted administrative procedure and
poor inter-agency coordination.</P>
      <P>She said that the norm of the World Trade Organization is that
all imported food has to be labeled with its place of origin.</P>
      <P>Moreover, all domestic manufacturers have to label the place of
origin when exporting to China, so Taiwan must in turn demand
that China follow the norm, she said.
</P>
      <P>She noted that chocolate imported from China accounted for 12.25
percent, or 28,564 kg, of all imported chocolate in May, and she
expressed worry that it is easily available on the market.</P>
      <P>Noting that there is a commodity label law and food sanitation
law to govern the matter, she lamented that the MOEA and the DOH have
failed in their responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Chen Ta-wei, a commerce department official under the MOEA, said
that food imported from China should adhere to food sanitation
regulations.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Tung-ming, director of the DOH Bureau of Food Safety, said
the DOH has coordinated the matter with related agencies and will
carry out the labeling regulations "as soon as possible."</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong has to pay NT$26.42 million in unpaid gift taxes
and fines to the national treasury after the Supreme Administrative
Court rejected Thursday his appeal of a lower court's decision in his
tax evasion case.</P>
      <P>The National Tax Administration (NTA) discovered that Soong
failed to pay a gift tax when he remitted more than NT$42 million
left over from his 1994 gubernatorial campaign funds into his
daughter-in-law Wen Jeou-hui's U.S. bank account in five installments
under five different names.</P>
      <P>The amount exceeded the ceiling for non-taxable gifts, the NTA
said. According to the NTA's calculations, Soong must pay NT$13.21
million in gift taxes. As Soong never declared the amount when filing
his tax return, the NTA slapped him with a fine equal to the amount
owed.</P>
      <P>Soong, who was Taiwan's first and last popularly elected
governor, appealed the ruling, but it was upheld by the Supreme
Administrative Court. In the country's administrative litigation
system, the Supreme Administrative Court's ruling was final.</P>
      <P>The supreme court rejected Soong's arguments that the money
remitted into Wen's account was not a gift but instead a donation to
the IHE Foundation -- an organization jointly established by him and
a Dutch technology institute -- and for financing travel expenses by
him and his staff during a U.S. trip in late 1998 soon after his
stint as governor ended.</P>
      <P>As Soong never listed the sum in his subsequent asset reports to
the Control Yuan in line with the public functionary property
disclosure law, the court said in its ruling, it could reasonably be
argued that Soong no longer counted the money as part of his personal
assets.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the court said, Wen did not remit a sum of US$ 1
million to the IHE Foundation until December 2001, more than three
years after she received remittances from her father-in-law. Given
the long time lapse, the remittance should be regarded as a dealing
between Wen and the IHE Foundation and as having nothing to do with
Soong, according to the court.</P>
      <P>If the money was truly meant as a donation to the IHE Foundation,
the court said, Soong did not need to remit it to his daughter-in-law
through so many channels, including his mother-in-law's account, in
the first place.</P>

off the coast of Taiwan's outlying island of Kinmen Friday for
poaching in Republic of China territorial waters, according to
maritime police sources.</P>
      <P>In a sweeping action dubbed "Operation Ching Hai, " some 30
maritime police officers started to patrol the waters surrounding
Kinmen in eight patrol vessels at 6 a.m. Friday, and apprehended 20
Chinese fishing boats poaching in ROC waters.</P>
      <P>The officers brought the 20 fishing boats and 33 crew members to

nets and gear were confiscated while nearly 100 kg of fish found

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun accused Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou Friday of
sacrificing the rule of law in the wake of reports that the city
government will approve a round-the-clock demonstration for almost
one month against President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Yu claimed that if such a demonstration is permitted, Taipei
residents will become the greatest victims because there will be no
peace in the city for the next couple of months.</P>
      <P>A group led by former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh has filed an
application with the city government for the right to stage a
demonstration on the boulevard in front of the Presidential Office
between Aug. 23 and Sept. 17 to pressure Chen to step down over
alleged corruption.</P>
      <P>Although there has not been any precedent in which a 24-hour
demonstration has been allowed, Ma, who is also chairman of the
opposition Kuomintang, reportedly has hinted that this application
might be approved as the country's public assembly law has not set
any time limit on such activities.</P>
      <P>Yu said that Taiwan is a country ruled by law and that it is
wrong for people to try to topple the president through a public
movement.</P>
      <P>He said this will result in a vicious circle and encourage others
to resort to the same method whenever they want to topple those in
power in the future.</P>

urged Ma to deal with the matter responsibly.</P>

      <P>Ku Li-hsiung, Chao's attorney, quoted Chao as complaining that he
has never had such a diamond ring as the UDN alleged.</P>
      <P>Ku said Chao was hurt by the report and planned to file a lawsuit
against the UDN for libel on the same day of the report. Ku added,
however, that he persuaded Chao to give the daily three days to
clarify and apologize.</P>
      <P>The UDN reported in a front-page story that day that Chao
consigned former Taiwan Development Corp. Chairman Su Teh-chien to
sell a13-carat diamond ring after Chao was freed on bail July 10
after he was taken into police custody May 25 on charges of insider
trading.</P>
      <P>The daily said the diamond was sold to a Hong Kong-based jeweler
for around NT$6 million -- about NT$10 million lower than the stone's
value.</P>
      <P>In a July 10 indictment, prosecutors recommended that Chao and Su
be sentenced to eight years behind bars, with 10 years for
businessman You Shih-yi.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ku confirmed that Chao's wife Chen Hsin-yu, who is
President Chen Shui-bian's daughter, plans to move to another
apartment in Taipei City to avoid the annoyance of the media's
paparazzi-style interruption of her daily life.</P>
      <P>It is uncertain, however, whether Chao will be allowed to move
along with his wife to the new apartment as he is still banned from
leaving the country or changing residence without due notice as part
of his bail conditions, Ku said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYORAL ASPIRANT PLANS 20-DAY RALLY AT CITY HALL</HEADLINE>

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union's
nominee for Taipei mayor unveiled a plan Friday to hold a 20-day
rally at the square in front of Taipei City Hall to speak up for
disadvantaged groups.</P>
      <P>Chou Yu-kou, who filed an application with the city government
Friday for the right to use the square starting Aug. 28, said the
rally will comprise speeches and a sit-in for 24 hours a day.</P>
      <P>According to Chou, the failure of a policy by incumbent mayor Ma
Ying-jeou to reconstruct traditional markets has forced a lot of
vendors to quit their businesses and many veterans have also lost
their residences after villages for members of the military and their
dependents have been razed.</P>
      <P>There are also a lot of unemployed people in the city who need
help, Chou said.</P>
      <P>Officials at the New Construction Office of the city's Public
Works Department said the office has "agreed in principle" to Chou's
application to use the square but that it will be up to the police to
decide whether she is allowed to hold a rally there.</P>
      <P>Chou filed the application in the wake of reports that the city
government will approve a round-the-clock demonstration for almost
one month led by former Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Shih
Ming-teh, aimed at pressuring President Chen Shui-bian to step down
over alleged corruption.</P>
      <P>While the New Construction Office has granted its permit to
Shih's group to use the boulevard in front of the Presidential Office
between Aug. 23 and Sept. 17, the police have not decided on whether
to allow them to use the place for a demonstration.</P>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) urged its supporters Friday to refrain from using violence
against former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh, who has initiated a
populist campaign to depose President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-lang, DPP deputy secretary- general and spokesman,
made the call after an organizer of the "one million people campaign
to depose President Chen" claimed that some radical "pan-green camp"
activists have threatened to hurt the former chairman.</P>
      <P>Wang Li-ping, director of the campaign headquarters, said she has
forwarded the threatening messages to the police and has demanded
police protection of the campaign leader.</P>
      <P>She quoted Shih as urging his opponents to calm down, as he is
willing to have a "rational dialogue" with them.</P>
      <P>Shih has vowed to begin a sit-in once a million people in Taiwan
have donated NT$100 each to his campaign, and he claims he will not
stop his sit-in until Chen has stepped down.</P>
      <P>As of Friday, barely a week after Shih launched his campaign, an
estimated 800,000 citizens had contributed more than NT$81 million in
support of his cause, according to the campaign headquarters.</P>
      <P>Campaign spokeswoman Ho De-fen said volunteers at the campaign

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
will support Taiwan's bid to host the 2008 International Small
Business Congress (ISBC) now that Britain has reportedly given up the
right to host the annual event, Minister of Economic Affairs Chen

      <P>Chen made the remarks after visiting Lin Ping-pin, president of
the National Association of Small &amp; Medium Enterprises, Republic of
China.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that when he attended the ISBC conference last year, he
found that Japan, South Korea and Singapore had sent large
delegations to the conference and that they took part in various
activities. In contrast, the Taiwan delegation numbered barely 10,
mainly because it had no financial support from the government.</P>
      <P>Lin said Taiwan is important in the ISBC and that if Taiwan can
host the 2008 meeting, it will help raise the nation's profile as

      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) denied
Friday that there is a conspiracy between KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
and former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Shih Ming-teh
to oust President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Huang Yu-cheng told reporters that there is no such
conspiracy as described in claims printed in a pro-DPP newspaper,
although Ma did meet recently with Shih in his capacity as Taipei
mayor to discuss Shih's application to the Taipei city government for
permission to stage a round-the-clock sit-in in front of the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, Ma made no commitments to Shih, who has
launched a campaign inviting a million people in Taiwan to join him
in the sit-in to pressure the scandal-ridden president to step down.</P>
      <P>Huang said there are no double standards in handling applications
for permission to hold a rally or parades, and that the city
government would grant permission to all applicants who act within
the bounds of the law.</P>
      <P>Asked why Ma, as mayor of Taipei, ordered police to disperse

      <P>Approximately 300 overseas Taiwanese youths
presented the results of their summer internships at an academic
conference Friday, rounding up the eight-week Taiwan Tech Trek
(TTT) 2006 program.</P>
      <P>The TTT, organized by the National Science Council (NSC) , is a
program in its second year that offers overseas Taiwanese youths
hands-on internships at government agencies, non-profit
organizations, private companies and special group projects.</P>
      <P>"The NSC believes that the program not only provides internships
to overseas Taiwanese youths but also helps them to know more about
Taiwan, " said Lin Kwang-lung, director-general of the NSC's
Department of International Cooperation.</P>
      <P>More than 280 interns were selected out of over 1,000
applications collected by Taiwan's foreign agencies, most of whom
came from the United States. The program started in late June.</P>
      <P>Most of the members are native-English speakers but also have a
basic command of Mandarin and Taiwanese, Lin said.</P>
      <P>"By working with Taiwanese in local government agencies and
companies, the members got to know more about 'the Taiwanese way' and
what we are working on right now, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>"On the other hand, their employers and colleagues have benefited
from their creative ideas and new thinking, " he added.</P>
      <P>TTT, with a budget of over NT$30 million and the
cross-departmental cooperation of numerous government agencies,
is designed to attract talent from overseas, which countries like
India and China are also working on, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>"We have received pleasing and promising results so far. Two of
our 2005 members have been hired by local companies, " he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>After long-term efforts, the number of
organ donors in Taiwan has increased, but it still lags far behind
the demand for organs, an organ donation and transplant registration
center said Friday.</P>
      <P>The center said that confined by the traditional Chinese thought
that the body should be kept intact, organ donation is still not as
popular as it is in other countries.</P>
      <P>The number of organ donors was 109 as of Aug. 14 and their organs
have benefited 350 patients, the center said.</P>
      <P>The number of donors represents an increase of around 14 percent
from the same period of last year, or 50 percent from the same period
in 2004.</P>
      <P>Despite the increase in donor numbers, it has still failed to
meet the needs of 7,000 patients who are currently awaiting organ
transplants, many of whom will die while waiting, the center added.</P>
      <P>Liu Chia-chi, vice executive director of the organ donation and
transplant registration center, said the increase in donor numbers
can be attributed to 12 hospitals around the country that have
advocated organ donations and 141 hospitals who are collaborating
with them.</P>
      <P>Liu urged more people to agree to donate their organs after death
so as to give new life to patients who need them.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANTI-PRESIDENT CAMPAIGNS BOISTEROUS BUT NOT CRUCIAL: EX-PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  18  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Campaigns and statements calling on
scandal-ridden President Chen Shui-bian to step down are nothing but
"boisterous" political gestures and are not critical to Taiwan's
survival, Chen's predecessor Lee Teng-hui said Friday.</P>
      <P>The former president was quoted as saying these anti-Chen
campaigns have "political significance, " but are not crucial. The
most urgent task at hand for Taiwan is to revitalize its economy by
increasing domestic investment, Lee was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks while meeting with a group of Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) legislators and several think tank leaders,
including Chang Jung-feng, vice president of Chung Hua Institute for
Economic Research, Taiwan ThinkTank Chairman Chen Po-chih and Taiwan
Futures Exchange Chairman Wu Jung-yi.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan Advocates -- a think tank Lee set up and
heads -- Lee was saddened by the fact that university graduates in
Taiwan earn little more than NT$20,000 (US$612) per month.</P>
      <P>In Lee's view, the low average salaries paid to Taiwan's young
office workers can be blamed on the integration of Taiwan's and
China's economies.</P>
      <P>Lee explained that with increasing economic integration, Taiwan's
wage level has been lowered by China, whose workers are offered lower
wages because of the massive labor force.</P>
      <P>Lee asked participants to discuss ways and means of reviving
Taiwan's economy, partly in response to the conclusions reached at
the Cabinet's recent Taiwan Economic Sustainable Development
Conference.</P>
      <P>The former national leader was pleased by TSU legislators, who
during the conference successfully stopped the government from
adopting a "pro-big businesses" stance in cross-Taiwan Strait trade
and economic policy, according to participants.</P>
      <P>Lee urged them to discuss how to increase Taiwan's investment
ratio, which stands at a low of 16 percent, and how to correct the
"erroneous view" of some government officials and business leaders
about cross-strait trade and economy.</P>
      <P>What Lee considered "erroneous" was the view that the government
should encourage more economic exchanges with China by increasing the
cap for Taiwanese companies investing in China, for example, which is
currently set at 40 percent of a company's net assets.</P>
      <P>Another topic raised by participants was a growing disparity in
development for different regions of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For example, some participants pointed out, northern Taiwan --
with Hsinchu as its southern border -- accounts for 75 percent of
Taiwan's economic output, while only 20 to 30 percent of the
population lives there.</P>
      <P>In contrast, only 25 percent of the gross national product is
generated south of Hsinchu, where a majority of the people live.</P>
      <P>The participants agreed to hold a series of seminars to find ways
of increasing domestic investment and promoting emerging industries;
to put forth a forward-thinking report on Taiwan's society and
economy in the year 2020; and to publish a series of booklets to
debunk China's economic myths.</P>
      <P>The TSU legislative caucus promised to monitor Premier Su
Tseng-chang's "revisionist" economic policy closely, for instance, by
examining the advantages and disadvantages of allowing Chinese
tourists to visit Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) should heed public opinion and distance itself from President
Chen Shui-bian if the party wishes to survive the current political
crisis triggered by a series of corruption and embezzlement scandals

      <P>Legislator Tsai Chin-lung, a legislative caucus whip of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT), noted that according to results of a
China Times poll released Friday, approval ratings for Chen and the
DPP have both dropped to a record low of 18 percent.</P>
      <P>Tsai warned that if the DPP continues to defend the president and
undergird his leadership, it will only squander opportunities for the
party to tide over the crisis.</P>
      <P>He deplored the extent to which some DPP members, including
legislators, "debased themselves" by criticizing former DPP Chairman
Shih Ming-teh in a "vulgar and vicious" manner for launching a
campaign to oust the president.</P>
      <P>Tsai admired the courage of DPP Legislator Lee Wen-chung for
stating openly that he felt "ashamed" of the bad manners demonstrated
by fellow DPP members in leveling criticism against Shih.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An investigation by the Control Yuan
concluded Friday that nothing illegal was found in President Chen
Shui-bian's Taishin International Bank account, which an opposition
lawmaker had alleged was being used to launder money.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Yu-nan, director of the Control Yuan's department in charge
of reporting on senior officials' private assets, said the president
did not include the suspected account in his six reports to the
Control Yuan as of November 2005.</P>
      <P>Moreover, what Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Chiu Yi called Chen's
"secret account" was in fact closed before the law governing
political contributions went into effect, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, the president's Taishin Bank Nanmen Branch
Office account has broken neither the public functionary private
assets registration law nor the political contribution law.</P>
      <P>He noted that said account was set up Jan. 5, 2004 and closed
April 1, 2004. The presidential election was held March 20, 2004.</P>
      <P>Since the account was closed right before the political
contribution law took effect April 2, 2004, there is no question that
the bank account was -- as alleged -- in violation of the law, he
said.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party has claimed that the
disputed account was set up to receive campaign donations.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan said that according to law, candidates must
register their assets with the Central Election Commission (CEC) when
they apply for candidacy, and that it is the CEC's duty to determine
whether the president should have registered his Taishin Bank account

      <P>The MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward China, said China
has imposed constant surveillance on human rights activists,
political dissidents, Falun Gong followers and pro-democracy
activists, particularly those who dare to stand up to corrupt
communist authorities and expose social injustices.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the international community should not keep silent
on China's persecution of its political dissidents and human rights
activists, MAC Vice Chairman Liu Teh-hsun said major international
human rights organizations should voice strong concern about China's
abuses and violations.</P>
      <P>Noting that human rights protection, the realization of social
justice, the promotion of democracy and rule of law are common
duties of civilized countries around the world, Liu said China's
human rights abuses and unwarranted arrests and persecution of
political dissidents and human rights activists are in stark
contrast to its recent rise as an economic powerhouse.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is always concerned about China's human rights
status and political development, Liu said China should strive to
improve its human rights record for the well-being of its own
people.</P>

      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) will
organize a seminar Aug. 24-25 on the implications and impacts of
China's rise as a big power on the Asia-Pacific geopolitics and
security situation, an official said Friday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Liu Teh-hsun told a news conference that many

India, Thailand and Hong Kong will attend the two-day seminar.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairman Joseph Wu will deliver a keynote speech on China's
rise and relations across the Taiwan Strait, Liu said, adding that
the seminar will focus discussions on how Asia-Pacific countries are
grappling with challenges arising from China's accession to big-power

      <P>High on the agenda will be topics related to China's economic
development strategies, crisis management and prevention, regional
strategy as well as challenges to Taiwan and response strategies

      <P>Academia Sinica's Asia-Pacific research center will co-sponsor

    <HEADLINE>GLOBALIZATION HAS LED TO WIDENING GAP BETWEEN RICH AND POOR: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 19 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The trend of globalization has led to an
inequitable distribution of wealth and a widening gap between
rich and poor in Taiwan, the nation's top economic planner said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Hu Sheng-cheng, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, was commenting on reports by the Directorate General of
the Department of Budget, Accounting and Statistics that the income
of Taiwan's wealthiest group was 6.04 times that of the poorest
group in 2005, or slightly higher than 6.03 in 2004, showing the gap
between the rich and the poor has made no remarkable improvement.</P>
      <P>Hu said that Taiwan's economic performance is actually quite
good, but because of globalization wealth distribution is not
equitable.</P>
      <P>The fruit of Taiwan's economic growth was enjoyed by 30 percent 
of people instead of being shared by the remaining 70 percent of
people, he added.</P>
      <P>Hu said that amid globalization, Taiwan cannot raise wages in
view of China's cheap labor. Thus, salary increases are not in
proportion to economic growth.</P>
      <P>Since workers have not felt the benefits of economic growth, they
will naturally feel blue, Hu said.</P>
      <P>But he stressed that "the government has made great efforts, "
citing such short-term measures as social welfare programs,
temporary short-term work, as well as providing long-term vocational
training.</P>
      <P>"Without such efforts on the part of the government, the gap
between the rich and the poor would be even larger," He said.</P>
      <P>He said the CEPD will pay close attention to the matter from a
long-term perspective, saying that equitable wealth distribution will
have to depend on long-term policy, create job opportunities for
disadvantaged groups, and provide an equal quality education for 
children in remote areas so as to gradually narrow the gap between
rich and poor.</P>
      <P>Per capita income in Taiwan now stands at over US$15,000, Hu
said, and the CEPD envisions that it will surpass US$30,000 by
2015.</P>
      <P>Hu said the CEPD hopes the benefits of economic growth will be
shared by all, saying the council would actively address
the nation's long-term issues, such as a graying population,
industrial transformation, the nurturing of talent pool, and the 
strengthening of research and development as well as the service
industry.</P>
      <P>He noted that research by Global Insight, a leading
economic and financial analysis, forecasting and market
intelligence organization, showed that Taiwan's per capita income may
reach US$32,700 by 2015, compared with South Korea's US$31,100.</P>
      <P> Touching on why Taiwan's economic growth has not translated into
an increased income for its people, Hu said this was due to the
depreciation of the new Taiwan dollar over the past few years.

    <HEADLINE>LAWYERS LAUNCH SIGNATURE DRIVE CALLING FOR PRESIDENT'S RESIGNATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  19 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Representatives of 14 bar associations
around the country launched a signature-gathering campaign Saturday
urging President Chen Shui-bian to resign over the recent spate of
alleged corruption scandals surrounding his administration and
family.</P>
      <P>The initiators of the campaign included former Taiwan Association
for Human Rights President Wei Chien-feng, former Consumers'
Foundation Secretary-General Su Chin-hsia, former Taipei City
councilor Chiu Chin-tien, former Taipei Bar Association board member
Tai Sen-hsiung and Hsinchu Bar Association President Lo Ping-cheng.</P>
      <P>They said they hope to collect at least 1,000 signatures from
their colleagues.</P>
      <P>The lawyers said in a joint statement that only if Chen resigns
will Taiwan be able to "say goodbye to corruption and welcome the
rule of law."</P>
      <P>They said when Chen -- a lawyer turned democratic activist -- won
the presidency on March 18, 2000, all members of the profession were
proud of his achievements.</P>
      <P>However, a number of recent developments prove that Chen can no
longer assume responsibility for promoting the rule of law and clean
politics in the country, they said. These include the alleged
irregularities involving Chen's family members and close aides, his
failure to disclose his assets truthfully, his alleged use of others'
receipts to claim expenses under his special state affairs expense
allowance and the alleged collusion between his administration and
business groups, they noted.</P>
      <P>Even worse, the judicial investigations into these cases are not
trusted by the public and are eroding the foundation of social
justice, they said.</P>
      <P>Various private groups have called on Chen to step down following
the exposure of the alleged scandals.</P>
      <P>While a group of pro-Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) academics
issued an open letter urging Chen to resign to take responsibility
over the allegations last month, a group led by former DPP Chairman
Shih Ming-teh is set to stage a large-scale demonstration starting
next week to further pressure the president to step down.</P>

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) has plans
to ship 17,500 tons of rice this year to Swaziland, Lesotho and Laos
as a form of relief to poverty-stricken people in those countries,
COA Agriculture and Food Agency officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>With the cooperation of World Vision Taiwan, the COA donated and
transported 5,000 tons of rice to Swaziland in May, the official
said, noting the rice is likely to feed an estimated 105,000 people
for four months.</P>
      <P>A few days ago, 2,500 tons of COA rice was shipped to Lesotho for
destitute children, people suffering from chronic diseases and those
who are infected with HIV/AIDS. Some 64,400 individuals are expected
to be benefited by Taiwan's donation, according to the COA.</P>
      <P>As for Laos, the council is scheduled to begin transporting
10,000 tons of rice there in September to help relieve the country
from an urgent demand for food.</P>
      <P>Besides the aid, the COA will also assist Laos in creating a
"food guarantee" mechanism as part of efforts to help the country
forever resolve the problem of food shortages, the COA officials
said.</P>
      <P>Due to limited rice production, most children living in poverty
in Laos suffer from serious malnutrition.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT'S OUSTER SHOULD BE ACHIEVED THROUGH LEGAL MEANS: DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 19 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Anyone who wants President Chen Shui-bian
to step down should seek to achieve that goal via legal means rather
than taking to the streets, ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Yu pointed out the country's laws stipulate the president will be
removed from office if he is impeached, if a presidential recall
proposal is passed in a public referendum or if he is convicted of
sedition or treason.</P>
      <P>However, so far Chen has not been proven to have committed any
crimes, Yu noted.</P>
      <P>Yu said while he respects the protesters' freedom to express
their opinions, trying to topple the president through public
demonstrations will only severely jeopardize political stability and
affect the life of local residents, he said.</P>
      <P>He claimed the method will also result in a vicious cycle that
encourages people to resort to the same methods of toppling those in
power in the future.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks during a trip to the northeastern county of
Yilan, ahead of a large-scale demonstration initiated by former DPP
Chairman Shih Ming-teh to pressure Chen to step down over alleged
corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>In June, the opposition People First Party (PFP) and its ally,
the Kuomintang, initiated a motion to recall Chen on grounds that
Chen should take responsibility over alleged irregularities involving
members of his administration and family. But the motion failed to
obtain the support of a two-thirds majority in the legislature -- the
threshold that must be passed before such a motion can be put to a
public referendum.</P>
      <P>Early this month, the PFP further initiated a campaign to impeach
Chen in the wake of revelations that Chen had failed to disclose his
assets truthfully and allegedly used receipts received by others to
claim state affairs funds.</P>
      <P>The impeachment motion must be endorsed by more than 50 percent
of legislators before it can be presented to the legislature for
consideration. If more than two-thirds of legislature votes for the
motion, it will be referred to the Council of Grand Justices for
review. The president will be removed from office if the council
finds the impeachment motion well-grounded.</P>

      <P>Council of Agriculture (COA) officials
estimated Saturday that production of several agricultural goods is
expected to increase over last year if no serious natural disasters
occur before year's end.</P>
      <P>Unlike last year when several strong typhoons hit Taiwan the
weather so far this year has been fine, causing agricultural
officials to revise production estimates upwards for several
agricultural goods, such as tea, pomelos and oranges.</P>
      <P>According to the COA crop estimate report, tea production will
reach 20,417 metric tons this year, a growth of nine percent over the
previous year.</P>
      <P>The officials forecast orange production will reach 225,874
metric tons this year, an increase of 17 percent over last year,
while production of Chinese honey oranges will reach 111,704 metric
tons, registering a 20-percent year-on-year growth.</P>
      <P>Starfruit production is estimated to reach 24,086 metric tons
this year, a growth of 15 percent over last year, while pomelo
production will reach 75,409 metric tons, an increase of eight
percent over 2005, the officials added.</P>
      <P>As damage caused by recent minor typhoons has been recuperated,
the production of vegetables will resume, the officials said,
estimating production of leaf vegetables to reach 38,334 metric tons
in August, a slight increase of three percent over July.</P>
      <P>As for cut flowers, August production of chrysanthemums and
lilies is expected to decrease eight percent over July, while rose
output will increase three percent over the previous month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT VOWS 'NOT TO FALL NO MATTER WHAT DIFFICULTIES LIE AHEAD'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Embattled President Chen Shui-bian strongly
reaffirmed Saturday his commitment to fulfilling his mandate, saying
he "will never fall no matter what difficulties may lie ahead."</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while delivering a speech to
supporters from his hometown in Tainan County at a gathering in
Taipei. Also on hand were Premier Su Tseng-chang, Presidential Office
Secretary-General Tan Sun Chen, ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
(DPP's) Taipei mayoral candidate Frank Hsieh, as well as several DPP
legislators.</P>
      <P>Chen, facing public demands for his ouster in the wake of a
series of corruption and embezzlement allegations implicating
himself, his family members and top aides, said he was particularly
heartened by the boost from his long-term supporters.</P>
      <P>Chen pledged he will put up with any difficulties ahead,
saying "no matter how vicious the attacks and smears are, I'll
stick to my guns and will never fall or lose my will."</P>
      <P>The president refused -- even under heavy pressure -- to renege on
the mandate given him by voters, vowing to "bravely go down the
right path and pursue my goals and campaigns."</P>
      <P>He stressed that he would follow the path of "insisting on a
separate identity for Taiwan, and the realization of social
justice." </P>
      <P>He reaffirmed his four goals -- increasing investment in Taiwan,
creating employment opportunities, narrowing the gap between urban
and rural areas as well as the gap between rich and poor. A recent
report by the Department of Budget, Accounting and Statistics showed
that the income of Taiwan's wealthiest individuals was 6.04 times
that of the poorest in 2005.</P>
      <P>The president said he would also insist on three campaigns
-- joining the United Nations under the name of Taiwan, crafting a
new Constitution that would be "timely, relevant and viable," and
retrieving the opposition Kuomintang's ill-gotten assets, which were
obtained during the authoritarian era.</P>
      <P>He said he as an individual is insignificant, but that
safeguarding Taiwan is very important, saying "everyone should
cherish what Taiwan has today."</P>
      <P>"What is the meaning if we continue this boisterous squabble,"
he asked, adding that if "incessant fighting throws Taiwan into a 
pandemonium, and China takes advantage of the situation to
invade Taiwan, then what good will it bring to Taiwan?"</P>
      <P>The president said that Taiwan is a democratic country, and
democracy means freedom and rule of law, which he said is the pride
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But he urged respect for this freedom, saying that if the public
does not heed the rule of law it will mean chaos for Taiwan. Any
problems should be solved within a legal framework, and should not be
settled through violence or means outside the existing system, he
added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  19 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Saturday
that she does not believe it is proper to handle the country's
constitutional problems with mass movements.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks after 14 lawyers' associations around the
country joined a campaign launched by former ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Shih Ming-teh to depose President
Chen Shui-bian, who has been caught up in several corruption scandals
allegedly implicating his family members and close aides.</P>
      <P>While attending a seminar, Lu discussed factors that have caused
what she described as "the current unrest in society."</P>
      <P>One political factor, she added -- the power transfer from the
Kuomintang (KMT) to the DPP -- still has not completely rooted out
the concept of a "rule by man," a belief that is still held by many.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan has too many elections, and because of these
costly elections those who win sometimes try to recoup their losses
from the elections after assuming the post, Lu went on.</P>
      <P>As for economic factors, Lu said the relocation of many domestic
enterprises to China has seriously damaged Taiwan's industries, while
an era of knowledge-based economies and globalization has created
enormous challenges for traditional industries -- and more
unemployment.</P>
      <P>Referring to lawyers joining in the campaign to oust President
Chen, Lu stressed that constitutional problems should be handled in
accordance with the Constitution. Noting the opposition-proposed
motion to recall President Chen did not clear the legislature, Lu
said this indicates the case has been resolved through constitutional
procedures.</P>
      <P>Upset over so many social and political disturbances, as well as
financial burdens, some 4,200 people chose to commit suicide last
year, Lu said, adding that this is why she organized a series of
seminars to promote social harmony, reconciliation among political
parties, as well as peace between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lu urged the public to hold a rational attitude toward dealing
with various challenges facing the country.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 19 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei city police conditionally approved
Saturday a controversial application for staging a "round-the-clock"
sit-in in front of the Presidential Office on Ketagalan Boulevard to
pressure President Chen Shui-bian to step down. </P>
      <P>The application was filed by former Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) Chairman Shih Ming-teh and his supporters earlier this week as
an attempt to push Chen to resign over a spate of corruption
allegations implicating his family members and aides.</P>
      <P>According to police, the planned 24-hour sit-in campaign can be
held from Aug. 23 to 10 p.m. Sept. 7, excluding the day of Aug. 26,
when another organization has been approved to hold activities on
Ketagalan Boulevard.</P>
      <P>In order to maintain tranquility in the neighborhood, the use of
horns, sirens and loudspeakers are banned between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00
a.m each day during the period.</P>
      <P>Explaining the planned "anti-Chen" campaign, police said that the
organizers call it a "public forum, " which will be attended by 1,000
activists and headed by Shih.</P>
      <P>Only the section of Ketagalan Boulevard spanning between Park
Road and Chungshan South Road are allowed for the sit-in, the police
noted.</P>
      <P>Since the authorities in charge of assembly and parade activities
are local police district stations, under the Assembly and Parade Law
the proposed Ketagalan sit-in can be carried out after the Chungcheng
police district station gives the green light.</P>
      <P>This is the first time police approval has been secured for a
round-the-clock rally, according to Taipei city police, who said
tallies show that in the past every rally in the capital city only
lasted about three or four hours.</P>
      <P>It will be a tough challenge for police to maintain order and
peace in the upcoming 15-day campaign aimed at ousting the president,
they said.</P>
      <P>Shih and his supporters have been calling for 1 million citizens
to come out to support deposing President Chen after several of his
family members and close aides were allegedly involved in a string of
corruption and embezzlement scandals.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) is happy to see President Chen Shui-bian is committed to
fulfilling his mandate of "Taiwan first" during the remainder of his
term, which expires in May 2008, a legislative caucus whip of the
pro-independence party said Saturday.</P>
      <P>TSU Legislator David Huang made the remarks in the wake of 
the beleaguered president's pledge that he "would never fall, no
matter what difficulties may lie ahead," and that he would
follow the path "of insisting on a separate identity for Taiwan and
on the realization of social justice."</P>
      <P>The president, dogged by a series of corruption and embezzlement
allegations implicating himself, his family members and
top aides, pledged to pursue four goals -- increasing
investment in Taiwan, creating employment opportunities and narrowing 
the gap between urban and rural areas as well as the gap between rich
and poor.</P>
      <P> The president also said he would insist on three campaigns;
namely, joining the United Nations under the name of Taiwan, 
crafting a new Constitution that would be "timely, relevant and
viable," and the return of the opposition Kuomintang's ill-gotten
assets.</P>
      <P>Huang said that President Chen's advocacy "conforms with
former President Lee Teng-hui's line," and the TSU would offer him
full support. Lee is the spiritual father of the TSU.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that President Chen would speed up reforms
and deliver on promises during the rest of his term in office.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, as long as Premier Su Tseng-chang -- who had earlier
advocated a more open cross-strait policy -- can identify with the
"Taiwan first" concept and work with President Chen's goals and
campaign, the TSU will throw its support behind him.</P>
      <P>Huang said the TSU does not care who serves as premier, whose
appointment lies with the president, but that it is concerned whether
the premier's administrative ideals are in line with the
former president's.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AWARD-WINNING DOCUMENTARY EXPLORES LIFE AND DEATH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 19 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Facing life and death is never easy, but
the award-winning documentary "Doctor" tries to explore the meaning of
life and death by telling the story of a Taiwanese doctor who loses
his only son to suicide and then a Peruvian boy to cancer.</P>
      <P>The documentary, which was directed by Chung Mong-hong and won
the award for best documentary in the 2006 Taipei Film Festival, will
premiere Sep. 29.</P>
      <P>In the film, Chung begins with an unusual case of teen suicide
occurring on July 4, 1996, in which 13-year-old Felix Wen, Wen
Pi-chian's only son, hangs himself in the closet for unknown reasons.</P>
      <P>Trying to come to terms with Felix's death, Wen -- a radiologist
in Iowa, U.S. -- later spends time with Sebastian, a Peruvian boy who
arrived in the U.S. with his parents to seek cancer treatment.</P>
      <P>During the treatment, Dr. Wen looks back at Felix's short life
and tries to save the boy. However, Sebastian dies the following year.</P>
      <P>"This documentary does not try to be a tear-jerker, as I was
attempting to keep a distance in this film," said Chung, who took
three years to produce the work. "I think it's important to face life
and death with more sense than sensibility. We need to face it, cope
with it and not fear it."</P>
      <P>He does not expect to come up with the answer to life and death
with this film, because these are unpredictable events, Chung
said.</P>
      <P>"The story of Felix Wen tells us that not every case of teen
suicide occurs due to a lack of attention and care from one's
parents. Every teenager has his own character and different
way of thinking," said Claire Teng, a psychiatrist at Municipal Wang
Fang Hospital.</P>
      <P>Chung said Wen Pi-chian and his wife were model parents and Felix
Wen was a bright student with a maturity beyond his age. The only
unusual thing was that he talked about death a lot.</P>
      <P>Just as Chung demonstrated in the film, sometimes life and death
are very complicated and hard to explain, Teng said.</P>

Ford Is Slashing Production 20% for 4th
Quarter

The Ford Motor Company, which is
struggling to keep its grip on second place
in the American car market, said Friday
that it would cut by one-fifth the number
of vehicles it plans to build in the final
three months of the year.

The slowdown represented the deepest
production cuts since the industry's
crisis of the 1980's. It also underscored
the difficulty that Detroit, whose
business relies on sales of sport utility
vehicles and pickup trucks, is having as
gas prices remain around $3 a gallon.
Detroit's market share has dropped to its
lowest level in history, while Asian brands,
known for their fuel efficiency, are
setting sales records.

Wall Street Journal:Why Israel's Plans
To Curb Hezbollah Went So Poorly

When its bombs began falling on southern
Lebanon 39 days ago, Israel had high hopes
that it could severely damage or even
destroy Hezbollah, the militant Islamist
group rooted there. Crippling it, they
and their Washington allies hoped, would
rid Israel of an implacable enemy.
It would also set back Iran, a longtime
supporter of the group, at a crucial time
in Iran's nuclear negotiations with the
West.

But with the fighting stopped,
Hezbollah remains far from defanged.
Indeed, in many eyes it is the victor,
having faced down the mighty Israeli
military and hugely enhanced its standing
with the anti-Israeli populations across
the Mideast.</TEXT>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's current priority lies in refining
its liberal democratic system rather than deposing President Chen
Shui-bian through populist means outside the country's legal system,
a renowned essayist said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lung Ying-tai, whose poignant and critical essays have in the
past contributed toward Taiwan's democratization process, made the
remarks at a seminar for her new book, entitled "Please Convince Me
with Civility."</P>
      <P>Referring to an ongoing "one million people" campaign launched by
former Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Shih Ming-teh to unseat
President Chen over a spate of corruption allegations implicating his
family and aides, Lung said that despite her personal respect for
Shih, she did not "see eye-to-eye" with him on what constitutes
Taiwan's urgent priorities.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has come a long way in the pursuit of democracy. Its most
important goal at present is not which individual should step down or
ascend to power. Its most urgent task lies with consolidating and
refining its democratic system, as well as upgrading the quality of
its democracy," Lung said.</P>
      <P>If upholding Taiwan's democratic system and its quality are core
values, Lung said, one's thinking would not center around how to boot
out Chen, nor on using drastic means or "shedding blood on the
streets" to depose the president.</P>
      <P>As people didn't have the right to elect national leaders under
authoritarian rule, Lung said, they could not but use radical means
to protest injustices or government brutality.</P>
      <P>"But gone are the days of taking to the streets or resorting to
violent means to express discontent with the administration or those
in positions of power. Nowadays, we have universal sufferage. Every
citizen has the right to vote in political elections," Lung said.</P>
      <P>At this time of political turmoil, Lung said the greatest
challenge to Taiwan's people is how to control their angry emotions
and to really understand what the nation's ultimate core values and
goals are.</P>
      <P>Quoting passages in her recent essay, titled "Character, " Lung
said the historical meaning of the failed opposition-initiated motion
in late June to recall Chen lies in confirming the value of following
due process of law to hold a head of state to political
responsibility.</P>
      <P>"What really matters is whether the motion succeeds or not. What
really matters is that the people of Taiwan, through the recall
motion in the legislature, have unequivocally declared that democracy
is not populism, " Lung explained, adding that this same judgment
principle is applicable to Shih's ongoing campaign against Chen.</P>
      <P>Shih, who was jailed for 25 years during Taiwan's martial law era
for his pro-democracy and pro-independence stance, launched the "one
million people" campaign last weekend to pressure Chen to resign and
will start a round-the-clock sit-in near the Presidential Office to
keep up heat on Chen when one million ordinary citizens have each
donated NT$100 to show their support for his cause. The campaign has
so far received enthusiastic response from Chen's detractors,
including the ruling party's previous supporters.</P>
      <P>Lung said she respects and admires Shih as a true hero. But Lung
said she has not made any donation and disapproves of the Shih-led
populist campaign because she most yearns to see at present is the
refinement Taiwan's democratic quality.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FAMILY, SCHOOL PLAY IMPORTANT ROLES IN TEEN SUICIDE PREVENTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 19 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of social workers said in a seminar
Saturday that families and schools can play a key role in
preventing teenagers from committing suicide, as the year's fifth
case of teen suicide was recently discovered in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In fact, there are far more teens who consider committing
suicide than people imagine, said Hsiao Hui-ying, President of the
National Alliance of Parents' Organizations. It's just a few who
really take action, he said.</P>
      <P>"Today, the thoughts running 'round teenagers' minds are highly
complicated. If you don't spend time with them, there's no way to
understand them. This is why parents should be able to listen [to
what their children say] and allow kids to make mistakes," said
Cheng Pi-hua of the Humanistic Education Foundation (HEF).</P>
      <P>In school, where teenags spend most of their daily lives, the
importance of "life education" should be stressed and teenagers'
self-respect and dignity should be protected, not abused, Chang said.</P>
      <P>While it is almost impossible to prevent teen suicide, adults
should pay closer attention to their kid's behavior and talk with
them to better understand their state of mind, said Claire Teng, a
psychiatrist at Municipal Wang Fang Hospital.</P>
      <P>According to statistics from the Department of Health,
between the years 2000 and 2005, suicide ranked as the eleventh
greatest cause of death for those under 14 in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A HEF report indicated that lack of emotional control was the
main reason for teenager suicide, and committing suicide is a way to
express anger and seeking help for teenagers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FAMILY, SCHOOL PLAY IMPORTANT ROLES IN TEEN SUICIDE PREVENTION(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 19 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of social workers said in a seminar
Saturday that families and schools can play a key role in preventing
teenagers from committing suicide, as the year's fifth case of teen
suicide was recently discovered in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In fact, there are far more teens who consider committing
suicide than people imagine, said Hsiao Hui-ying, President of the
National Alliance of Parents' Organizations. It's just a few who
really take action, he said.</P>
      <P>"Today, the thoughts running 'round teenagers' minds are highly
complicated. If you don't spend time with them, there's no way to
understand them. This is why parents should be able to listen [to
what their children say] and allow kids to make mistakes," said
Cheng Pi-hua of the Humanistic Education Foundation (HEF).</P>
      <P>In school, where teenags spend most of their daily lives, the
importance of "life education" should be stressed and teenagers'
self-respect and dignity should be protected, not abused, Chang said.</P>
      <P>While it is almost impossible to prevent teen suicide, adults
should pay closer attention to their kid's behavior and talk with
them to better understand their state of mind, said Claire Teng, a
psychiatrist at Municipal Wang Fang Hospital.</P>
      <P>According to statistics from the Department of Health,
between the years 2000 and 2005, suicide ranked as the eleventh
greatest cause of death for those under 14 in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A HEF report indicated that lack of emotional control was the
main reason for teenager suicide, and committing suicide is a way to
express anger and seeking help for teenagers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The non-profit Industrial Technology
Research Institute (ITRI) is set to present a large number of new
technologies for commercial applications at an upcoming international
invention exposition in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The ITRI -- the key industrial research and development arm in
Taiwan established by the government to attend to the technological
needs of the country's industrial development -- will display some
two dozen new technologies at the 2006 Taipei International Invention
Show and Technomart (TIIST) slated for Aug. 31-Sept. 3 at the Taipei
World Trade Center for the convenience of private companies which are
interested in applying the ITRI know-how in their production
processes.</P>
      <P>The new technologies to be displayed include a process for making
PV inverters, which are also known as a high voltage commercial scale
power conversion gear capable of producing solar photovoltaic utility
interactive renewable energy. Also to be displayed is a portable
blood test kit -- an easy-to-operate electroluminescent micro date
instrument that can detect multiple metabolites in a single drop of
blood.</P>
      <P>The TIIST -- Taiwan's largest technologies and patent rights
exhibition -- is expected to attract some 310 inventors and

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chinese-language United Daily News
published an apology on its front page Sunday for alleging without
prior verification in an Aug. 18 report that President Chen
Shui-bian's son-in-law, Chao Chien-ming, had pawned off a large
diamond ring through a friend.</P>
      <P>In the printed apology, the editorial department of the newspaper
-- one of four mass-circulation dailies in Taiwan -- said it would
like to apologize to Chao; his friend Su Teh-chien, former chairman
of Taiwan Development Corp.; as well as readers for failing to verify
the story with Chao and Su before publishing the report that Chao had
asked Su to sell a 13-carat diamond ring for him.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News made the apology after Chao threatened
through his attorney to file a libel suit against the newspaper.</P>
      <P>The daily's Aug. 18 report said that Chao had asked Su to sell
the diamond ring worth about NT$16 million (US$490,722) shortly after
Chao was released on bail July 10 following 47 days in detention on
charges of insider trading.</P>
      <P>The report alleged that the diamond ring was now in the hands of
a Hong Kong-based jeweler for a tentatively agreed price of about
NT$6 million -- nearly NT$10 million lower than the ring's actual
value.</P>
      <P>In a July 10 indictment, prosecutors recommended that both Chao
and Su be sentenced to eight years behind bars on charges of insider
trading.</P>
      <P>Asked about his reaction to the printed apology by the United
Daily News, Ku Li-hsiung, Chao's attorney, said that it "is not
completely satisfactory but acceptable."</P>
      <P>Ku said he will advise his client to call off his plan to file a
libel suit against the newspaper.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAA PLANNING TO ALLOW PRIVATE COMPANIES TO RUN AIRPORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
is planning to allow private companies to operate commercial airports
in an effort to help the government balance its books.</P>
      <P>The CAA will shortly invite companies from the private sector to
offer suggestions on privatizing airports, officials from the
administration have said. Under the current civil aviation law, only
government agencies or local governments are allowed to run airports</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of Audit, 15 out of the 18 airports in
the country have been losing money in recent years. Among the 18
airports, only Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, Taiwan's main
gateway; Hsiao-kang Airport in the southern port city of Kaohsiung;
and Taipei City's Sungshan Airport have been making money-making.</P>
      <P>The combined deficit of the 15 other airports, most of which are
located in offshore areas, exceeded NT$900 million (US$27.5 million)
for 2005, ministry officials said.</P>
      <P>CAA officials attributed declining business in the domestic air
service market mainly to the opening of the second north-south
freeway in recent years. The opening of the high-speed railway along
Taiwan's west corridor later this year is expected to further dent
the money-losing domestic air service business if remedial measures
are not adopted shortly, they added.</P>
      <P>Late last year, the legislature asked the CAA to conduct a study
and come up with a remedial plan within 10 months.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the officials said, the CAA began from
late last year considering allowing private companies to run airport
operations without compromising the government's jurisdiction over
navigation, control towers, as well as airport security and
quarantine affairs.</P>
      <P>Allowing private companies, including foreign firms, to run
certain aspects of the airports will help diversify the airports'
operations, they said.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that opinions and suggestions from the private sector
on privatizing airports can be referred to the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications by the end of this month for
approval, facilitating the CAA's efforts to make appropriate
revisions to the current law and submit them to the Legislative Yuan
in September for approval, the CAA officials said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
reiterated Sunday its "hands-off" stance regarding a nationwide
campaign to oust President Chen Shui-bian but disclosed that a KMT ad
hoc task force has begun gauging possible developments in the
populist movement.</P>
      <P>KMT Policy Coordination Committee Director Tseng Yung-chuan made
the remarks when answering questions from reporters as the sit-in
movement led by former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman
Shih Ming-teh is slated to kick off Sept. 2 on the square in front of
the Presidential Office -- ahead of the originally scheduled date of
Sept. 9.</P>
      <P>Tseng stressed again that the KMT will not meddle in the activity
so as to avoid confrontation between the "pan-blue alliance" and the
"pan-green camp, " although he said that the party has not banned
individual KMT members from taking part.</P>
      <P>He also revealed that a KMT task force already met once last week
to study possible developments in the movement and that it will
continue to meet to assess countermeasures to deal with any scenarios
that may arise.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Shih's office estimated that at least 200,000 people
will participate in the sit-in aimed at ousting President Chen, who
has been embroiled in scandal allegations involving himself, his
family and close aides in recent months.</P>
      <P>As of Friday, a total of NT$81.2 million had been collected in
Shih's campaign calling on "one million people each to donate NT$100
for the sit-in" since its launch on Aug. 14.</P>
      <P>Shih said when cash donations reach the NT$100 million target, he
and his supporters will immediately begin the planned sit-in.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Aviation officials expressed concern Sunday
that the scheduled opening of the 345-km high-speed railway linking
Taipei and Kaohsiung in October may drive another nail into the
coffin of most of Taiwan's 16 domestic airports.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that the 16 domestic airports in Taiwan and
its outlying islands have seen their passenger volumes plummet since
the government began implementing an open-sky policy 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>Citing Sungshan Airport in Taipei City as an example, the
officials said the airport handled some 500 flights per day 10 years
ago but that the number of daily flights has dropped to less than
half that figure at present.</P>
      <P>The opening of 12 east-west highways in the past four years and
the inauguration of Taiwan's second north-south expressway in early
2004 have brought increased convenience to road travelers but have
also caused domestic airlines to lose many customers, the officials
noted.</P>
      <P>They expressed fear that the opening of the high-speed railway
linking Taiwan's two largest cities in northern and southern Taiwan
may add to the airports' difficulties.</P>
      <P>Although the Civil Aeronautics Administration plans to use

continue to be dogged by the major problem that there are simply not
enough passengers, the officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER PRESIDENT LEE BEMOANS UNFAIRNESS OF KMT'S ASSETS REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 20 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui accused the
KMT Sunday of trying to divert the public's attention away from the
issue of the party's assets by focusing on investment losses during
the time he served as party chairman.</P>
      <P>According to a statement issued the same day by Lee Teng-hui's
office, Lee said that it is extremely unfair for the KMT to only
focus on the NT$42.7 billion in investment losses during the period
when he concurrently served as ROC president and KMT chairman between
1988-2000 in its report on the party's assets and liabilities to be
made public Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The KMT has been Taiwan's largest opposition party since the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) came to power in 2000. Lee stepped
down from the presidency and from the party chairmanship that same
year.</P>
      <P>The statement said that it is unfair for the KMT to fail to
mention how much money Lee helped the party earn to maintain the
party's operations -- some NT$8 billion per year -- during the period
of his presidency. It stressed that Lee's morality and behavior can
be fully scrutinized by the public.</P>
      <P>The KMT, as Taiwan's ruling party during that 12-year period, had
the responsibility to assist in government-led investment projects
both at home and abroad, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that "these kind of projects were all thoroughly
screened by a set of mechanisms within the KMT, the statement claimed
that "there is no way that just one or two people could make a final
decision on these issues."</P>
      <P>The KMT should not ascribe its present financial difficulties to
only a part of its failed investments in the past, the statement
said, adding that public now is more concerned about the party's net
assets -- an issue that it pointed out the KMT must provide a clear
explanation of to the public.</P>
      <P>As to a plan by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to
put the KMT's asset issue to a public referendum, KMT spokesman Huang
Yu-chen called it "political fighting" and expressed his regret over
the DPP's plan to do so.</P>
      <P>According to KMT legislative caucus whip Tsai Chin-lung, the
party's assets currently amount to only about NT$6 billion or NT$7
billion when its some NT$80 billion in debts and over NT$40 billion
in investment losses are subtracted. He said the party's assets
amounted to as much as NT$140 billion during the period when Lee
served as chairman.</P>
      <P>The KMT will give a detailed report to the people on Aug. 23 on
how it has handled its assets, Tsai said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT TO EVENTUALLY WITHDRAW FROM ALL BUSINESS OPERATIONS: CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou vowed Sunday to see to it that the KMT eventually withdraws
from all businesses operations that have nothing to do with party
affairs.</P>
      <P>Ma said that following its withdrawal from media outlet
operations last year, the KMT has begun moving to withdraw from other
business operations not related to party affairs.</P>
      <P>Citing the fact that a proposed political party law will
stipulate that no political party should engage in business
operations, Ma said he agrees that political parties have a
legitimate right to own property and other assets but should not
operate businesses for commercial gain.</P>
      <P>"Quitting all business operations is the KMT's set policy, " Ma
reiterated.</P>
      <P>Ma said that he has asked his staff to tackle the controversy
over the KMT's assets "as soon as possible" since being elected
chairman in July last year and that now it's time for him to give
some explanations on the changes concerning the KMT's assets since
1949 and the current make-up of the KMT's properties one year after
becoming the leader of the party.</P>
      <P>Ma is scheduled to explain Wednesday
how the party has handled its assets, which its rivals claim are
"ill-gotten" assets acquired during the party's five-decade
rule of the country before 2000. </P>
      <P>On Ma's planned explanation on a report on the KMT assets
Wednesday, Tsai Chin-lung, a KMT legislative caucus whip, stressed
that the report -- prepared by the party's Deputy Secretary-General
Chang Che-chen and lawyer Lee Yung-jan -- does not target any
specific individuals and instead is an "objective and comprehensive
account of changes in the party's assets, including investment
profits and losses, over the past five decades.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks in response to a newspaper report Sunday
which quoted the KMT assets report to be released Wednesday as
indicating that former President Lee Teng-hui, who doubled as the KMT
chairman during his 10-year stint as the ROC president, had
squandered some NT$42.7 billion (US$1.3 billion) on failed investment
projects.</P>
      <P>Tsai dismissed speculation that the report is going to come as a
bombshell in Taiwan's political arena, saying that the report --
describing how the assets were managed when Chiang Kai-shek, Chiang
Ching-kuo, Lee Teng-hui, Lien Chan and Ma Ying-jeou were at the helm
of the party -- has been compiled for the sole purpose of dispelling
the public's misunderstandings concerning the KMT over the years.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a private group is reportedly planning to initiate a
nationwide referendum to try to force the KMT to return its assets to

(By Timothy J. Hwang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>New York Times:

Every year since 1999, New York City has
reported that it has all the money it needs
to pay for the pensions that have been
promised to city workers.

With the retirement plans said to be
financially sound, state politicians have
happily showered city employees with
generous pension enhancements -- annual
cost-of-living increases, holiday bonus
payments, early retirement with full
benefits -- that are the envy of private-
sector workers, whose pension benefits
have eroded.

But a close inspection of city pension
records shows that the funds committed to
the plans may fall well short of the
city's promises to hundreds of thousands
of current and retired workers. They look
fully funded chiefly because the city has
been using an unusual pension calculation
that does not comply with accepted
government accounting rules. Even the
city's chief actuary, who helps produce
the annual reports, says the official
numbers are "meaningless" when it comes
to showing the plans' financial health.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The official designation of the
International Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) is scheduled to be
changed to Mega International Commercial Bank Monday, drawing
criticism from opponents of the move.</P>
      <P>Cheng Shen-chi, chairman of Mega Holdings Co., which recently
merged with ICBC -- one of the oldest and most reputable banks in
Taiwan -- is scheduled to make the announcement on the name change
Monday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Criticizing the planned name change of the century-old bank,
opposition Kuomintang Legislator Fei Hung-tai said he suspects Cheng
is making the move as part of efforts to materialize President Chen
Shui-bian's goal of "desinicizing" public-run organizations in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference held at the Legislative Yuan, Fei
lashed out at the Ministry of Finance for defying a resolution passed
by the Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan May 29 demanding
that the finance ministry submit to the Legislative Yuan an
assessment report on the impact of the name change before actually
going through with it.</P>
      <P>Fei said that the name change should be stopped and that Cheng
should be fired by the board of directors of Mega Holdings -- in
which the government holds a majority stake -- for dereliction of
duty.</P>
      <P>Fei threatened to block the budget for the finance ministry in
the legislature's next session which begins in September if Mega
Holdings' board of directors does not elect a new chairman to replace
Cheng.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the news conference, Tsai Chiu-fa, a leader of
the ICBC Workers' Union, said the government "has treated the
feelings of the 3,400 workers of ICBC and their interests as dirt" by
rashly moving to change the name of the bank which was established
more than 100 hundred years ago.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The labor policy of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) has not been at all satisfactory, according
to the results of a survey by the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) which
were released Monday.</P>
      <P>Ho Min-hao, executive director of TSU's Policy Committee,
unveiled the results of the survey on the DPP's labor policy since

      <P>Overall, the DPP administration only received a score of 41.19
points for its labor policy in the survey, with 60 points
representing a passing grade.</P>
      <P>The survey found that most respondents have not felt any dramatic
improvement in labor rights since 2000 and that 91 percent of the
respondents expressed dissatisfaction with the advancement in labor
rights under the DPP administration.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 93 percent of the respondents think
that domestic labor unions have not become more powerful since 2000
and that 70 percent think that the planning of labor pensions has not
conformed with social justice.</P>
      <P>Eighty-four percent said that the current unemployment benefits
don't meet the economic needs of the jobless and their families.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CDC DISPELS RUMORS OF BIRD FLU CASE IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A pathogenic analysis report made public by
the Center for Disease Control (CDC) Monday dispelled rumors that a
human bird flu case had recently been reported in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director-General Lin Ting said that after conducting
chemical and pathological analysis, CDC experts found that the
samples taken from a man from northern Taiwan were free of avian flu
virus, dispelling a rumor circulating around Taiwan over the weekend
that a man had died of bird flu.</P>
      <P>The fears sparked by the rumor contributed to sharp 215-point
drop in the Taipei stock market Monday, one of the steepest single
day declines in the Taiwan bourse in recent years.</P>
      <P>Lin said the northern Taiwan man, in his 30s, was admitted to
hospital recently after displaying symptoms of respiratory disease.
The man had not traveled abroad for tourism but he had come into
direct contact with live birds, including Japanese white-eyes, he
added.</P>
      <P>The man is still in hospital, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The CDC has sponsored nationwide bird flu drills since Aug. 17 to
test the country's ability to deal with an avian flu pandemic despite
the fact that Taiwan remains free of the highly pathogenic avian flu.</P>
      <P>Recent reports of new cases of bird flu -- including cases in
Thailand, Russia and a case in China's Xinjiang Province, in which a
person died after being infected with the avian flu virus -- have
raised concerns among World Health Organization specialists that the
avian flu virus may be making a comeback after having mutated into
new and more lethal strains.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP URGES KMT CHAIRMAN TO FACE HIS PAST AS 'STOOL PIGEON'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  21 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) politicians called on opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou Monday to face what they called his past as a
"stool pigeon" against Taiwan's human rights supporters overseas.</P>
      <P>The group said that unless Ma deals with the matter honestly, he
will not be qualified to run for the presidency.</P>
      <P>They were pointing to allegations that when studying in the
United States in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Ma had acted as a
spy for KMT government at the time to collect evidence to be used
against political dissidents.</P>
      <P>Showing a note signed by then President Chiang Ching-kuo
approving Ma's appointment as director of the Presidential Office's
first bureau on April 22, 1981, DPP Legislator Hsieh Hsin-ni claimed
that Ma was designated for the post when he was still overseas
because he had "performed excellently" as a snitch.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the task assumed by Ma undermined human rights and
hampered Taiwan's democratic development.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei City Councilor Yen Sheng-kuan displayed a
picture taken Jan. 28, 1978 in Boston, in which Ma is shown being
driven away by a group of Taiwan students studying in the United
States who were staging a demonstration against unfair elections and
human rights persecution in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Yen, Ma was unwelcome by the protesters because he
was there taking photos of them, triggering displeasure among the
protesters.</P>
      <P>Yen said that because Ma had "snitched" on the students, a lot of
them were blacklisted by the KMT government and could not return
home. However, Ma has never admitted to this or apologized to the
victims, he added.</P>
      <P>Huang Wei-che, another DPP legislator, said that when the
Kaohsiung Incident happened in 1980, Ma and the KMT both considered
it a riot, with key participants, including Shih Ming-teh, Yao
Chia-wen and Lin Yi-hsiung, being charged with sedition.</P>
      <P>However, Ma is now honoring Shih as a hero because Shih is
leading a campaign to topple President Chen Shui-bian, Huang noted,
urging Ma to face up to history honestly in order to win respect from
the public.</P>
      <P>In response, Ma challenged the DPP Monday to present evidence to
back up the allegations, such as specifying who had been set up by
him and what photos he had provided to the KMT.</P>
      <P>Ma pointed out that early this year, some people said that Jerome
Cohen, his professor at Harvard University, had called him a KMT spy
and that Cohen has clarified that the matter was a misunderstanding.</P>
      <P>Dismissing the DPP's allegations as ridiculous, Ma said the DPP
is only making the allegations to try to divert public attention away
from the alleged corruption scandals surrounding Chen's
administration and family.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KRTC CHAIRMAN SPEAKS ON HARMONIOUS LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Relations between the management and
Thai laborers have improved greatly since a riot by the laborers a
year ago, Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) Chairman Chiang
Yao-chung said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the labor-management relations are so harmonious
that some of the workers are reluctant to leave after their contracts
expire.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks on the first anniversary of the riot by
Thai laborers working on the southern port city's MRT system
construction. The riot was sparked by grievances over the
maltreatment of the workers by Huapan Manpower Consultant and
Management company, which was commissioned by the KRTC to manage the
some 1,700 Thai laborers.</P>
      <P>Chiang noted that in the wake of the riots, the company has
adopted a series of measures to address the issue, including
terminating its contract with the manpower company and
setting up an agency exclusively for the Thai workers.</P>
      <P>The agency has since improved the laborers' living environment,
adopted a more humane way of management and established a
communication channel with Thai laborers.</P>
      <P>He noted that since the KRTC took over the management of the
Thai laborers, it has built more dormitories to relieve the crowded
situation and improve the food, sanitation and facilities in the
living quarters.</P>
      <P>He said that Council of Labor Affairs Chairman Lee Yin-yuan
praised the new living quarters during a visit to them in January.</P>
      <P>A Thai laborer identified only as Pui said that he wants to stay
for another year after his two-year contract expires, and many of his
colleagues share his feelings. But he was disappointed to learn that
related authorities might not want to extend the contracts.</P>
      <P>Over 10,000 laborers are working on constructing Kaohsiung's MRT
system, with more than 8,900 being local workers.</P>
      <P>KRTC officials said that local workers are still the mainstay of
the labor force. The project employs more than 6,600 from Kaohsiung
city and county and over 800 from Pingtung County.
The MRT system construction project has made a great contribution to
employment in southern Taiwan, the officials added. </P>
      <P>With Thai laborers working on the project having begun to leave in
June, the number of Thai laborers had dropped to around 1,100 as of
the end of July.</P>
      <P> With nearly 100 Thai laborers leaving each month, the labor
shortage problem could become more acute, the officials said.</P>

will become an outcast after former Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) Chairman Shih Ming-teh launched a campaign to oust
scandal-tainted President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Ma made the comments during an informal meeting with reporters
after a planned nationwide sit-in led by Shih to boot out Chen has
won enthusiastic response from the public since its launch a week
ago.</P>
      <P>The headquarters of Shih's campaign has announced that the sit-in
is slated to kick off Sept. 2 -- an advance from its earlier
projected date of Sept. 9.</P>
      <P>Although Ma said that the KMT would not feel squeezed even if
Shih succeeds in deposing Chen, he said that the KMT still needs to
cautiously gauge its next move and maintain as much flexibility as
possible.</P>
      <P>But he added that the KMT will not take part in the sit-in,
despite the fact that the KMT and its "pan-blue alliance" partner,
the People First Party, proposed a motion to recall Chen in late June
at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The presidential recall motion failed due to a lack of two-thirds
majority approval at the legislature.</P>
      <P>The KMT will be closely watching the developments of Shih's
campaign to oust Chen, Ma said, adding that Taiwan's political
situation has entered "an era of uncertainty" and that the party must
be very careful in assessing the situation.</P>

official announced Monday.</P>
      <P>Michael Reilly, Director of the de facto British embassy, who met
with the scholars and said: "Since the start of the BTCO scholarship
program in 1990 nearly 200 young Taiwanese have received scholarships
to study in the U.K. and have gone on to contribute to the
advancement of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Applicants are selected on both their academic strength and their
commitment and ambition to make a difference on their return. Each
scholarship winner receives 15,000 to 20,000 pounds.</P>
      <P>The four scholarship recipients include Yen Shu-yi, who will
major in criminology and criminal justice at Loughborough University,
Hsu Po-han (environmental technology at Imperial College) , Chan
Chi-ya (global politics at the London School of Political and Economic
Science), and Amy Hsieh (international political economy at the London
School of Political and Economic Science).</P>
      <P>The scholarship program is operated by the BTCO and administered
by the British Council.</P>
      <P>According to the BTCO, U.K. accounts for 28.2% of the Taiwanese
overseas study market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OVER 200,000 WILL TAKE TO STREETS AGAINST PRESIDENT: CAMPAIGN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  21 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>At least 200,000 people will take to the
streets in the first week of a nationwide campaign led by former
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Shih Ming-teh demanding
that President Chen Shui-bian quit the presidency, a spokeswoman for
the campaign predicted Monday.</P>
      <P>Ho De-fen, a professor at Nanhua University in southern Chiayi
County who serves as spokeswoman for the populist movement to boot
out Chen, made the remarks while answering questions from reporters
at the campaign's headquarters in Taipei.</P>
      <P>As security will be a top concern when Shih and supporters begin
gathering from Sept. 2 on the square in front of the Presidential
Office to stage a sit-in calling for Chen's ouster, "everything must
be ensured" before the activity can kick off, Ho said.</P>
      <P>Ho estimated that more than 200,000 people will take part in the
demonstration in the initial stage and gave his assurance that the
organizers will do their best to maintain order and discipline to
prevent provocation and confrontation.</P>
      <P>According to Ho, the campaign led by Shih, a pioneer in Taiwan's
democracy movement, aims to attract more than 1 million people to
take to the streets to "force" Chen to step down. He claimed that it
can be considered the second big wave in the country's
democratization following the historic power transfer in 2000.</P>
      <P>Shih's campaign to oust Chen has gained a warm response from the
public since its launch only a week ago, and this can be attributed
to the profound awakening of the Taiwan people toward a "disgraceful
and unjust national leader," Ho claimed.</P>
      <P>If the people display strong enough power to show their desire
for Chen's ouster, the president will "not dare" to go abroad at a
time when the public are poised to take to the streets against him,
Ho speculated.</P>
      <P>Chen has announced that he will embark on a visit to Palau and
Nauru in early September -- a time that is set to coincide with
Shih's campaign.</P>
      <P>Chen has been dogged by a series of corruption allegations
involving himself, his family members and close aides in recent
months and public disgruntlement with him is mounting.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Chairman Su
Chin-chiang said Monday that the public should focus their attention
on the problems related to the welfare of the people, instead of
working to depose or support President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks in response to the campaign launched by
former ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Shih
Ming-teh to oust Chen, who has been caught up in several corruption
scandals allegedly implicating his family members and close aides.</P>
      <P>Many elite of the society, including lawyers associations and
academics, have promised to join the campaign which will launch a
large-scale demonstration in front of the Presidential Office in
September.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DPP supporters will also launch a rally headed by
a well-known talk show host on Aug. 26 as a countermeasure against
Shih's demonstration.</P>
      <P>At the meeting of TSU's central executive committee held Monday,
Su ordered TSU staff not to join or involve in all the activities to
depose or support Chen, saying that his party will focus its efforts
on resolving the problems related to the welfare of the people and
the economy of the country at a time when the political situation is
unstable while laborers are suffering hardship.</P>
      <P>Su also expressed worry that violent conflicts may break out
during those activities in favor of and against Chen, which he said
may cause Taiwan's democracy to move back.</P>
      <P>Su urged all the politicians launching those activities to oust
or support Chen to try to prevent bloody conflicts or assume their
responsibilities for the possible violent conflicts.</P>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui, who is the spiritual leader of
TSU, has said recently that these campaigns to get rid of Chen will
do nothing good to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee urged Chen to resolve his own problems by saying that TSU
respects all the activities in favor of or against Chen, but will not
involve in them.</P>
      <P>Lee also urged other political parties not to involve in the
activities to prevent possible bloody conflicts.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Su added, Monday is the first anniversary of the riot
caused by some 100 Thai laborers working on the mass rapid transit
(MRT) railway project in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, but the fact of
the riot has not been clear so far.</P>
      <P>Su urged the Council of Labor Affairs Minister Lee Ying-yuan to
prevent such incident to occur again.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) announced Monday that it will cooperate with the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to promote a public referendum to
reclaim the ill-gotten assets of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>TSU Chairman Su Chin-chiang said the party has collected 40,000
signatures in support of the campaign and will put forth along with
the DPP a proposal to hold the referendum.</P>
      <P>Last week, DPP spokesman Tsai Huang-liang said his party will
submit more than 80,000 signatures to the Central Election Commission
(CEC) for review by Aug. 23.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that after the CEC finishes the review process, the DPP
will kick off a second-stage signature drive with the goal of
collecting 800,000 signatures by the end of this year and having the
referendum held next year.</P>
      <P>On reports that the KMT will publish a report Wednesday to show
that the party lost NT$42.7 billion because of investment failures
during the chairmanship of Lee Teng-hui -- who is now the so-called "
spiritual leader" of the TSU, Su said the KMT should not release the
details regarding the party's assets selectively and should give a
clear account of the spending during presidential elections,
legislative elections and various local elections.</P>
      <P>Su said that Lee established during his chairmanship a system to
manage the KMT assets to ensure that they were not embezzled by
individuals and tried to put the assets to effective use to help
promote national development.</P>
      <P>He urged incumbent KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou to stop selling the
party's assets and to return the party's ill-gotten assets to the
people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYORAL CANDIDATE DREAMS OF 2020 OLYMPIC GAMES IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 21 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Taipei mayoral candidate Frank Hsieh claimed in a seminar Monday that
there is "no way" Taipei cannot host the 2020 Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>However, he then said the road to a successful bid will not be
easy, and that it is highly possible that Taipei might fail. But "the
last thing Taipei city needs right now is defeatism and pessimism, "
Hsieh said, adding that a successful leader is the one who has vision
and the ability to lead people.</P>
      <P>In a forum titled "2020 in Taipei," Hsieh said the International
Olympic Committee (IOC) is expected to decide on a host city for the
2020 Olympic Games in 2013, seven years before the games take place.
Bidding cities will have to submit applications in 2011. Therefore, a
country should decide in 2009 or 2010 as to which city will represent
it.</P>
      <P>History shows that many host cities have been reborn and changed
because of the Olympics, Hsieh said. Since it takes the cooperation
and resources of central and local governments to organize the
games, organization will facilitate urban redevelopment. Tourism and
employment also benefit, he said.</P>
      <P>But the most important advantage will be national pride,
according to Hsieh. Regardless of whether Taiwan wins the bid, the
bidding process will be able to "bond the whole nation together for
one big task" and create national identity, he claimed.</P>
      <P>"It took Beijing three tries before winning the 2008 bid.
Everything is possible, " Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>He also said that 2009 will be an important year for Taiwan, as
it will host the Deaflympics in Taipei and the World Games in
Kaohsiung. If both competitions are successful, Hsieh said, it will
help Taiwan in the Olympic Games bidding process.</P>
      <P>Bidding for the 2020 Olympic Games has been one of Hsieh's most
important initiatives in his mayoral campaign so far. Hsieh had
challenged his opposition Kuomintang (KMT) opponent Hau Lung-pin to a
public debate on the challenge was rejected.</P>

    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Aug. 21 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Japanese government was urged Monday to
facilitate efforts to seek peace across the Taiwan Strait under a
United Nations mechanism.</P>
      <P>Sachio Kiyasu, a seasoned and prolific Japanese writer, wrote in
a letter to the editor of the Sankei Shimbun newspaper Monday that in
order to prevent China from invading Taiwan, it is imperative that
the U.N. moves fast to make possible an environment in which debate
can be conducted on cross-strait peace and stability.</P>
      <P>In his letter titled "Maintaining Taiwan Strait peace under U.N.
Initiative, " Kiyasu called for the Japanese government to adopt
active and useful moves to facilitate cross-strait peace and
stability.</P>
      <P>Kiyasu noted that China passed its "Anti-Secession Law" targeting
Taiwan in March 2005, in which the Beijing leadership reserved the
right to use "non-peaceful means" against Taiwan if the island is
found moving toward formal independence.</P>
      <P>The Chinese authorities have warned that up to 820 missiles will
be fired at Taiwan if the nation makes moves that run counter to the
will of China or takes measures to decide its own future, Kiyasu
said.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan has tried for years to join the U.N. as a
full member but has been thwarted by Beijing and there is not an
environment in which the cross-strait issue can be tackled
efficiently.</P>
      <P>Kiyasu reminded the Japanese leadership that in the event of
Chinese missiles flying across the Taiwan Strait, the damage the
missiles would cause for Japan's national security and economy would
be so huge that the damage caused by Pyongyang's missile tests into
waters near the Japan Sea would pale in comparison.</P>

representatives from the southern Kaohsiung and Pingtung areas in a

Wall Street Journal: Applied Science With
Its Future Now Uncertain, Bell Labs Turns to
Commerce

Lucent Technologies Inc.'s Bell Labs, the 
birthplace of the transistor and the laser, has 
been through a decade of turmoil during which 
it was reduced to a third of its size. Now, 
some of its scientists are warily embracing a 
former submarine officer and entrepreneur as 
perhaps the laboratory's best hope of maintaining
its relevance. Over eight decades, Bell Labs
produced a series of seminal inventions,
including the solar cell, the electronic
microphone and the digital computer. Eleven Bell
Labs scientists have shared in six Nobel Prizes.
But while the labs won glory, other companies 
marketed and profited from its inventions.
Bell Labs managers had little financial
incentive to pursue commercialization of new
technologies. The 1984 breakup of AT&amp;T, followed
by the 1996 spinoff of Lucent, ushered in an era
of uncertainty for the labs. Bell Labs'
scientists are no longer rejecting commercial
approach to science.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A sit-in campaign organized by Shih
Ming-teh, who once headed the Democratic Progressive Party before the
party took power in 2000, to seek the ouster of embattled
President Chen Shui-bian has been approved by a Taipei local police
station and will be legal, government officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>The officials were responding to a request by David Huang, a
caucus whip of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), that the
National Police Agency (NPA) revoke the permission for Shih's
scheduled sit-in in front of the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Huang had claimed that the sit-in will not only violate the March
and Assembly Law but will also take a tremendous toll on society.</P>
      <P>Huang said the law is for individuals to express their views, but
the rights of other individuals should also be heeded.</P>
      <P>The Taipei city government should not approve the 24-hour rally,
according to Huang, who added the claim that if the "the sinister
precedent is set, Taipei's judicial and traffic system will enter a
nightmarish period."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that quite a few elementary, high schools and the
city campus of Soochow University, as well as government agencies and
National Taiwan University Hospital, are in the vicinity of
Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential OFfice where Shih is
scheduled to stage the sit-in.</P>
      <P>The tranquility of the neighborhood and traffic will be greatly
affected if the sit-in takes place, he added.</P>
      <P>However, Vice Interior Minister Chien Tai-lang pointed out that
the Taipei police has approved the application, so the sit-in will be
legal.</P>
      <P>NPA Secretary-General Tsai Yi-chang said that while the NPA is
not in favor of the sit-in, it will not revoke the permission.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for Shih's campaign said the sit-in will
start Aug. 27 at the earliest and Sept. 9 at the latest, the final
decision left up to Shih.</P>
      <P>She also said that four or five days before the sit-in, there
will be an "international" news conference and that there will be ads
in all media to mobilize the people to join the sit-in three days
before the start.</P>
      <P>Shih, who served as DPP chairman from 1994 to 1996, announced
Aug. 12 his plan to call on 1 million people to donate NT$100 (US$3)
each to finance the campaign to oust Chen.</P>
      <P>Shih said that if the target of 1 million donors can be reached
within a month, the campaign will be launched Sept. 9 with daily
sit-ins by protesters in front of the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>If the target can be achieved sooner, the campaign will start to
roll earlier than planned, Shih added.</P>
      <P>The spokeswoman said that as of Monday, the donations had amounted

      <P>The Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning Development (CEPD) -- Taiwan's highest economic planning
agency -- is considering reviving a plan to hold a Taiwan Exposition
in 2011.</P>
      <P>At a regular meeting Monday, CEPD members, most of whom are
Cabinet ministers in their own right, reached a decision that the
Ministry of Economic Affairs should present an analysis on whether a
Taiwan Expo with a target date of 2011 would be feasible.</P>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-led government originally
planned to hold a Taiwan Expo from May to September 2008 to showcase
Taiwan's vitality and creativity in science, technology, tourism and
culture with a budget of NT$19.5 billion (US$597 million). The plan
was included as one of its 10 New Major Construction Projects
program.</P>
      <P>However, the plan was aborted because the opposition-controlled
legislature would not pass a bill to grant the needed budget on the
grounds that the cost was too high.</P>
      <P>The government estimated that the expo would attract 5.5 million
visitors, including 5 million from abroad, and bring NT$5 billion in
revenues and NT$95 billion for the tourism and other industries.</P>
      <P>Opposition legislators disagreed, saying the expo is unlikely to
attract 5 million visitors from abroad and pointing out that fewer
than 2 million tourists visit Taiwan each year.</P>
      <P>CEPD members acknowledged that they still entertain high hopes
that the expo can be held in 2011 to highlight Taiwan's high
technology and expose Taiwan's abundant fruit production to the
world.</P>
      <P>Noting that preparations for a large-scale expo usually take five
or six years to complete, they said that if the 2011 Taiwan Expo is
to take place, related government departments must begin planning and
coordinating their efforts as soon as possible.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reiterated his
pledge Monday to hang on and serve out his term in office no matter
what challenges might lie ahead.</P>
      <P>Chen made the reaffirmation while meeting with a visiting group of
Taiwan-friendly Japanese parliamentarians headed by Hisaoki Kamei, a
member of the lower house of the Diet.</P>
      <P>Without directly mentioning a campaign led by former Democratic
Progressive Party Chairman Shih Ming-teh to press for his
resignation, Chen told his guests that all newly emerging democracies
tend to face a host of thorny problems.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is no exception, " Chen said, adding that Taiwan's
politics are even more complicated and treacherous due to its divided
national identity and prickly cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen, who is embroiled in a series of corruption
allegations implicating members of his family
and close aides, said he has full confidence in Taiwan's democracy
and rule of law.</P>
      <P>"Under our liberal democratic system, all kinds of political
advocacies and opinions are respected and protected. All disputes
should be resolved by due process of law. I don't think our people
and society will use violent or non-peaceful means 'outside the
institution' to settle differences," Chen said.</P>
      <P>For all the challenges and difficulties he faces, Chen said he
will carry on courageously and will never fall. "No matter how big
the difficulty may be, I'll endure it. No matter how spiteful the
smearing may be, I'll stand my ground and perform my duties until the
end of my term May 20, 2008."</P>
      <P>Turning to Taiwan-Japan relations, Chen said he was delighted to
learn that former President Lee Teng-hui will visit Japan next month,
describing the event as symbolizing a further upgrading of
substantive bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of diplomatic ties, relations between the two
coutnries have continued to grow, Chen said. Two-way trade exceeded
US$60 billion last year, with Japan enjoying a trade surplus of US$30
billion. Civilian exhcnages also set a record last year, With Taiwan
people making 1.3 million visits to Japan and the number of Japanese
visits to Taiwan also breaking the 1 million mark for the first time. </P>
      <P>After Taiwan's high-speed railway becomes operational in late
October, Chen said he beleives more Japanese tourists will come to
Taiwan to get a taste of the new bullet train service which uses

      <P>Taiwan's balance of international payments
posted a surplus of US$480 million in the second quarter of 2006,
down from US$2.2 billion in the previous quarter, the Central Bank of
China (CBC) reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>CBC officials attributed the drop to Taiwan individuals'
preference to invest in foreign mutual funds and local insurance
companies' tendency to invest in overseas markets, with the financial
account registering a net outflow for the fourth consecutive quarter.</P>
      <P>The international payments surplus amounted to US$2.72 billion in
the first half of 2006, with a surplus of US$10.63 billion on the
current account and a net outflow of US$10.25 billion on the
financial account, the officials said.</P>
      <P>In the second quarter of 2006, direct investment and equity
investment saw a net outflow of US$790 million and US$6.64 billion,
respectively, they said.</P>
      <P>In terms of equity investment, residents accounted for a net
outflow of US$11.51 billion, which was the second highest
single-quarter level after the US$12.37 billion recorded in the
second quarter of 2003, they said.</P>
      <P>During the same period, equity investment made by non-residents
in Taiwan amounted to only US$4.87 billion, they said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, investment in financial derivatives registered a net
outflow of US$380 million, while other investment also registered a
net outflow of US$1.37 billion, they said.</P>
      <P>On the current account, merchandise trade posted a surplus of
US$4.87 billion, trade in services registered a deficit of US$1.53

    <HEADLINE>TSU LABOR SURVEY TOO CASUAL TO BE ACCEPTABLE: CLA</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union's (TSU's)
handling of an opinion survey on the government's labor management
was too casual to be acceptable, the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The TSU unveiled a day earlier the results of a survey of labor
unions and advocacy groups on their assessment of the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) administration's performance in labor
management.</P>
      <P>The TSU, which has the same pro-independence stance as the DPP
but differs with it on some economic and social policy issues, sent
out 100 copies of questionnaires by fax from Aug. 14-17 and collected
43 valid replies.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that the number of valid samples was so low, the
CLA officials, the accuracy of the results is questionable.</P>
      <P>According to the TSU survey, the DPP administration received a
mere 41.19 points for its labor policy initiatives and management,
far below the passing grade of 60 points. Most of those surveyed said
they didn't feel any dramatic improvement in labor benefits since the
DPP came to power in 2000. The survey also found that 91 percent were
dissatisfied with the slow advancement in labor rights over the past
six years.</P>
      <P>CLA Chairman Lee Ying-yuan said the TSU's criticism is "far from
true, " claiming that the number of labor rights acts passed during
the past six years has exceeded the number for any other period of
similar length in Taiwan's history.</P>
      <P>Lee also outlined the DPP administration's major policy
achievements with regard to labor rights, including implementing a
shortened work-week system; workplace gender equality legislation;
implementation of an occupational accident labor protection law;
establishment of a new labor pension system; an increase in labor
insurance reimbursement; unemployment benefits; the offering of soft
loans for workers in need; improvement in foreign labor management;
reducing the number occupational accidents; job promotion; and
regulation of mass layoffs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EPA TO RAISE REWARD FOR REPORTING LITTERING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 22 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) announced Tuesday its decision to raise the reward for those
who provide information on littering in a bid to boost the effect of
an upcoming cleanup campaign.</P>
      <P>The government is set to launch a nationwide environmental
cleanup campaign in mid-September, with those who fail to keep the
area within a 4-meter radius around their homes or businesses clean
being subject to fines of up to NT$6,000.</P>
      <P>Beginning in October at the earliest, the EPA will give out 30
percent to 50 percent of the fines received from litterers as reward
money for those who report the littering, which means the maximum
amount of the reward will be NT$3,000, EPA officials said.</P>
      <P>At present, only 10 percent to 20 percent of the amount of the
fines is given out as reward money, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>Also, the EPA will shorten the process involved in the payment of
the reward money in order to increase the incentive for the public to
report littering, they said.</P>
      <P>When making a report, people should provide information on the
identity of the literers and when and where the offense took place as
well as attach photos or videotapes as proof, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Local environmental protection authorities will fine the
offenders if the reports are confirmed to be true and will pay the
reward to the informers as early as possible after they receive the
fines, they said.</P>
      <P>According to EPA Minister Chang Kow-lung, the purpose of the
campaign is to use the least possible amount of resources in ensuring
that everyone is responsible in maintaining the cleanliness of their
neighborhoods.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tourists to Taiwan will be fully protected
while shopping on the island after tourism officials announced the
start of a shopping quality assurance system Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Tourism Bureau Director General Hsu Wen-sheng and Lin Chin-lung,
president of Travel Quality Assurance Association (TQAA), jointly
made the announcement.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that tourists, whether they are traveling as individuals
or in groups from home or abroad, can rely on the system if they have
disputes with shops over the commodities they buy, as long as their
itineraries are arranged through travel agents.</P>
      <P>He said that if travel agencies arrange for tourists to head to
shops with unreasonable prices, then such travel agencies have no
need to exist and should have their licenses revoked.</P>
      <P>Hsu also said that the idea of the system came from complaints by
Chinese tourists, who said in letters that they enjoyed their trips
in Taiwan but were not satisfied with the tea they bought at the
scenic Mount Ali, also known a Alishan, and the jade stones bought in
Hualien, claiming they were of shoddy quality and unreasonable price.</P>
      <P>TQAA Secretary-General Chen Yi-chuan said that the system divides
Taiwan's commodities into six categories, including jewels, wood
carvings as well as food and agricultural products.</P>
      <P>Any shops can apply with the association and be accepted as
members if they pass the screening process and make a deposit and pay
the annual fees.</P>
      <P>Chen said that tourists can file complaints with the association,
and a team will then rule whether the shops should return the money
or compensate the tourists for their losses.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO PAY RAISE FOR GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES NEXT YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Government employees, military personnel
and public schoolteachers will not get a pay raise next year, a
senior official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"It was a conclusion reached at a recent meeting of the
government's pay scale screening committee, " said Chou Hung-hsien,
head of the Central Personnel Administration (CPA).</P>
      <P>According to Chou, the committee made the decision after
carefully reviewing a number of factors, including the pay scale
adjustments in the private and public sectors, the government's
financial status, as well as inflation and economic growth rates.</P>
      <P>As the inflation rate remains mild and salaries in the private
sector have not spiked substantially, Chou said the committee decided
not to raise the pay scale for civil servants, military service
members and public schoolteachers in the coming year.</P>
      <P>Over the past six years, Chou said, the government has twice
adjusted its pay scale -- a 3-percent hike in 2001 and 2005,
respectively. During the same period, he said, salaries in the
private sector rose only 4.6 percnet on average.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsu Jan-yau, head of the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics, said that if the government were
to raise its pay scale by another 3 percent next year, its financial
burden would increase NT$20 billion.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan is scheduled to discuss the 2007 central
government budget plan at its weekly meeting Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, the government's 2007 expenditure is projected
at NT$1.66 trillion, marking a nearly 6 percent year-on-year
increase. Hsu said the increased budget will mainly finance
procurement of three big-ticket weaponry items.</P>
      <P>After listening to a briefing on the government's budget planning
early this month, President Chen Shui-bian instructed that the 2007
budget bill should be drafted in line with four principles --
boosting investment in Taiwan, creating job opportunities, bridging
the gap between rural and urban areas and promoting equitable
distribution of wealth.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO FOCUS ON DEVELOPING PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  22 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Developing public transportation will
become the main focus of the government's transportation policy in
the future, according to a report unveiled Tuesday by the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>The CEPD concluded that the government will reduce its funding
for highway development year by year and transfer the investment to
the development of subway and railway systems.</P>
      <P>In 2007, the budget for highway development projects will
decrease to NT$29.4 billion, while the budget for rail transportation
projects will increase to NT$25.9 billion, the report said.</P>
      <P>The report noted that Taiwan's transportation policy has always
emphasized highway development and that the government has for a long
time funneled huge amounts of resources on an annual basis to
building the country's highway systems.</P>
      <P>As a result, the highway density of the country expanded from 791
meters per square kilometer in 1991 to 1,070 meters per square
kilometer in 2005, which has had a negative impact on the
environment, the report said.</P>
      <P>Citing tallies released during a national energy conference held
in 2005, the report pointed out that the amount of greenhouse gas
emissions by the transportation sector has continued to increase,
with vehicles on highways accounting for more than 85 percent of the
emissions.</P>
      <P>By 2025, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions by the
transportation sector is expected to increase more than four-fold
over the level in 1990, the report said.</P>
      <P>Since 2003, the transportation sector has accounted for more than
15 percent of the country's total energy consumption. While highway
transportation has accounted for as high as 93.4 percent of the
energy consumption of the sector, rail transportation has accounted
for only 2 percent, according to the report.</P>
      <P>As the increase in the number of cars and motorcycles has led to
problems such as over-consumption of energy, increased greenhouse gas
emissions and traffic congestion, the government needs to adopt a new
transportation policy that focuses on the development of public
transportation to conserve energy and reduce pollution and noise, the
report said.</P>

      <P>According to Lin, the construction of the Hsuehshan tunnel on the

this year when the ministry had contract problems with its electrical

that time, exercised her coordination ability and finally got the
work to go ahead, Lin added.</P>
      <P>Thanks to her hard work, Lin said, the construction of the
12.9-km tunnel -- the longest highway tunnel in East Asia and the
fifth-longest in the world -- was finally completed in June.</P>
      <P>Lin also hailed the new minister for his long-term efforts in
resolving problems related to transportation.
</P>
      <P>Tsai had been political deputy minister of transportation and

    <HEADLINE>KMT LAWMAKER URGES NO USE OF BARBED WIRE BARRICADE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition lawmaker urged the
government Tuesday to give up the use of barbed wire barricades
to control large demonstrations, saying that they could be lethal.</P>
      <P>Legislator Joanna Lei of the Kuomintang claimed that "no
countries in the world" use barbed wire barricades to deal with
demonstrators, but use alternative means.</P>
      <P>Lei issued her plea amid reports that the National Police Agency
(NPA) recently took delivery of a new kind of barbed wire barricade
fitted with sharp blades as part of a project to provide better
protection against terrorist activities.</P>
      <P>Reports said the new barricades will be used in an 
upcoming sit-in protest in front of the Presidential
Office to pressure President Chen Shui-bian to resign over a
spate of corruption and embezzlement allegations against himself, his
family members and senior aides. But after public criticism, NPA
Director-General Hou Yu-ih said the barricades will
not be used in the protest, instead, Hou instructed police
departments islandwide to send old barbed wire barricades to
Taipei.</P>
      <P>Lei said Taiwan boasts of itself as a democratized country, but
has nevertheless introduced the razor wire barricades, which
she claimed are used "against criminals, enemies, and not on
people who have the rights to march and assembly."</P>
      <P>She pointed out that Article 11 and 14 of the Constitution
enshrine the people's freedom of speech and assembly. The scheduled
sit-in protests launched by Shih Ming-teh, a former chairman of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party, is an activity protected by the
Constitution, she said.</P>
      <P>If the government has misgivings that the demonstration might run
out of control, it should use alternative means to control
traffic and separate crowds, she said.</P>
      <P>She also said that if Taiwan's democracy wants to move forward,
it has to amend the Demonstration Law, changing the outdated concept
of "prior permission" from to "prior reporting" to the police
station for staging a rally, Lei said.</P>
      <P>She said she will work with her colleague, KMT Legislator Kao
Sze-po, to make an amendment of the Demonstration Law in the next
legislative session to "realize" the right of the people to march and 
assembly.</P>
      <P>The Demonstration Law, enacted in 1988, bans people from staging
demonstrations in front of key government offices such as the
Presidential Office, the five Yuans including the Executive Yuan and
the Legislative Yuan, the courts and foreign embassies or
representative offices.</P>
      <P>However, the law is largely ignored, prompting calls for an 
amendment to bring the law into conformity with reality.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The manufacture, import and sales of dry
cell batteries containing more than five parts per million (5 ppm) of
mercury will be banned from Sept. 1 under new government regulations,
environmental authorities of the central city of Taichung said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Officials at the Bureau of Environmental Protection of the
Taichung city government pointed out that the restricted dry
batteries include manganese-zinc batteries and non-button alkaline
manganese batteries.</P>
      <P>According to regulations announced by the Cabinet-level
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA), manufacturers and
importers are required to submit documents, including a test report
issued by an accredited laboratory, to the authorities.</P>
      <P>They are also required to label their products with the message
in Chinese that translates as: "This product has been confirmed by
the EPA to have a mercury content of less than 5 ppm," plus the
confirmation number issued by the authorities.</P>
      <P>Mercury is a hazard to the environment and to health.</P>
      <P>The EPA adopted the regulations late last year, setting
restrictions on the mercury content in dry cell batteries in line
with European Union standards.</P>
      <P>Manufacturers and importers who violate the regulations will be
subject to a maximum fine of NT$300,000 (US$9,152), while vendors
could face fines of up to NT$6,000 if they sell batteries containing
an excessive level of mercury.</P>
      <P>EPA officials have estimated that the new policy will help Taiwan
reduce the circulation of more than 200 kg of mercury per year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WIND TURBINE PLAN QUESTIONED OVER ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 22 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Eco-friendly activists questioned Tuesday a
plan by the Changhua County Government to install 240 wind turbines
along the coast, citing concerns over the machines' potential to
damage the natural environment.</P>
      <P>Environmentalists raised the question based on the argument that
more wind turbines might damage their surrounding environments and
affect the migration paths of the many seabirds that overwinter every
year along Changhua's coast in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But according to Lee Hung-shin, an official at the Bureau of
Economic Development under the Changhua County Government, no studies
from home or abroad have proved that wind turbines damage nearby
eco-systems, as long as they are installed "at safe distances."</P>
      <P>In Changhua's case, each turbine is set at a distance of between
300 meters and 500 meters from its neighbor, he said, adding that
studies in other countries have even found that birds build nests
upon wind turbines.</P>
      <P>To take advantage of the steady winds in the Changhua area, the
state-run Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) and four private power
companies have applied to establish wind turbines in an effort to
step up economic development and create jobs in power-related
industries such as steel and electrical engineering, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The installation of 60 out of the 240 turbines have gained
approval from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, while the
installation of Taipower's 23 turbines is near completion, Lee said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  22 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu called Tuesday
for extreme caution amid rising political uncertainty, suggesting
that all parties concerned must act responsibly and rationally to
avoid confrontation.</P>
      <P>Lu issued the call while answering questions from reporters prior
to a ceremony to mark the 10th anniversary of the founding of the
women's affairs department of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), in which DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, former Premier Frank Hsieh
and former Council of Labor Affairs Chen Chu also took part.</P>
      <P>Hsieh and Chen are the DPP's candidates for the Taipei and
Kaohsiung mayoral elections in December, respectively</P>
      <P>In view of a populist movement led by former DPP Chairman Shih
Ming-teh to pressure scandal-tainted President Chen Shui-bian to
resign, it is hard to predict changes in Taiwan's political situation
even in the next week, Lu said, appealing for caution and seriousness
by all sides for the sake of the future of the people.</P>
      <P>Although the people's basic rights should be respected, Lu said,
all parties concerned must do their utmost to prevent any incidents.
"Otherwise, all the people will have to pay a huge price, " she
warned.</P>
      <P>The vice president also denied that an overseas visit planned by
Chen for next month is a "scheme" to escape strong public pressure
demanding that he step down.</P>
      <P>"The president's visits to Palau and Nauru in early September
have been arranged for some time, " she said, dismissing speculation
that Chen is trying to evade a sit-in to be organized by Shih on the
square in front of the Presidential Office that might start late this
month or early next month.</P>
      <P>Lu also clarified media speculation that she is to make a major
announcement on Sept. 28 -- the 20th anniversary of the DPP's
founding.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, what the ruling DPP needs now is unity at a time
of trouble and contrary to what the report has speculated, she will
not quit the DPP or make any waves in her report.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WARM RESPONSE TO DPP PROPOSAL ON KMT ASSETS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 22 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 11,000 people in southern Tainan
city have signed a proposal initiated by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) to hold a referendum on forcing the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) to return what the DPP calls "ill-gotten"
KMT assets, a spokesman for the DPP's Tainan city branch said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The number has well exceeded the first-phase target of 8,650
people set for Tainan city -- a stronghold of the pro-independence
DPP, the spokesman said, adding that the local branch has submitted
the endorsement to the party's headquarters, which will put forth a
petition endorsed by more than 80,000 people to the Central Election
Commission (CEC) Wednesday for screening.</P>
      <P>After gaining the CEC's approval, a second-phase endorsement
campaign to continue the referendum proposal can kick off in the hope
of collecting endorsements from 830,000 people nationwide so that the
proposal can be put to a public referendum.</P>
      <P>The KMT, once labeled the world's wealthiest political party, is
slated to publish a report on its assets and liabilities Wednesday in
an attempt to explain to the public how it has handled what it claims

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will submit a proposal to the Central Election Commission (CEC)
Wednesday to initiate a national referendum as the first step toward
pressuring the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) to return its
ill-gotten assets to the national coffers.</P>
      <P>DPP legislators Trong Chai, Yen Wen-chang and Chiang Chao-yi made
the announcement at a news conference at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chai said that the proposal will seek speedy legislation
requiring political parties to return ill-gotten party assets so as
to force the KMT and its related organizations to return their
assets, except for party member fees, political donations and
campaign subsidies.</P>
      <P>Chai said the proposal will be sent to the CEC to coincide with
the scheduled publication of the KMT's party assets, which
reportedly will amount to only about NT$6 billion or NT$7 billion when
its NT$80 billion in debts and over NT$40 billion in investment
losses are subtracted. The party's assets reportedly amounted to as
much as NT$140 billion during the period when former President Lee
Teng-hui concurrently served as party chairman.</P>
      <P>Chai expressed the hope that the CEC will review the proposal
quickly so that the DPP can move toward the second stage of a
planned referendum voting. </P>
      <P>Chai recalled that his proposal at a DPP Central Standing
Committee meeting three months ago to use a national referendum to
force the KMT to return its party assets received an enthusiastic
response.</P>
      <P>This, Chai claimed, has put tremendous pressure on KMT Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou, leading to his planned publication of the party assets.</P>
      <P>The DPP lawmaker noted that the first stage of referendum requires
the signatures of 0.5 percent of eligible voters, or around 83,000
voters. The next stage will be to collect the signatures of 5 percent
of the eligible voters, or 830,000 voters, within six months before
it can be put to a referendum vote.</P>
      <P>Chai expressed the hope that the CEC will pass the screening in
one month so that the DPP can launch the second stage signature drive
Sept. 28, when the DPP will celebrate its 20th founding anniversary.</P>
      <P>Chao also warned Ma not to divert public attention by means of
unveiling the party assets, saying that the people are most concerned
about how many assets are left and how they are to be returned to the
people.</P>
      <P>Ma is scheduled to explain Wednesday how the party has handled
its assets, which its rivals claim are "ill-gotten" assets acquired
during the party's five-decade rule of the country before 2000.</P>

      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long
said Tuesday that the ministry will help a Taiwan-U.S. joint venture
aircraft company overcome problems with its operations.</P>
      <P>Chen was referring to difficulties faced by the Sino Swearingen

1995 and headquartered in Texas and in which the Taiwan government
holds a more-than 90 percent stake.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, SSAC's SJ30-2 business aircraft, which
received a "Type Certificate" from the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) last year, faces technical problems with its
wings that might delay mass production, while the company as a whole
suffers from a long-term financial burden.</P>
      <P>Chen said he has instructed MOEA staff and aviation experts to
visit SSAC to better understand the company's problems.</P>
      <P>Last Friday, MOEA agreed that SSAC could lay off 150 workers and
postpone materials purchases.</P>
      <P>Noting that the SSAC has received purchase orders for more than
300 SJ30-2 business jets and has received US$7.5 million in
prepayment, Chen said the government will not abandon the company.</P>
      <P>However, Chen added that the MOEA will also determine who should

President Chen Shui-bian to step down.</P>
      <P>Shih announced the donation campaign Aug. 12 and vowed that a

      <P>According to the campaign organizers, cash contributions from the

Wall Street Journal:Energy Security Is
Hostage to Supply Of Oil Professionals

Mohammed al-Jibouri belongs to Iraq's
premier business fraternity: the geologists,
engineers and finance men who run the
country's vast oil industry.

Through decades of war and trade
sanctions, these professionals kept Iraq
pumping. By last year, Mr. Jibouri, an oil
economist, was a top contender to head the
state Oil Marketing Organization, a
powerful agency that sells Iraq's crude oil
abroad.

But senior Iraqi oil men were getting
caught up in bitter political feuds. Other
senior oil men were being murdered by
insurgents. One of Mr. Jibouri's aides
was gunned down. So instead of lobbying
for the important oil post, the 57-year-
old industry veteran packed up late last
year and moved to Jordan, joining a
legion of elite technocrats fleeing the

    <HEADLINE>FILM ON HSUEHSHAN TUNNEL TO PREMIERE ON DISCOVERY CHANNEL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang urged the public
Tuesday not to miss a documentary on the Hsuehshan tunnel --
described as an "architectural miracle" for the engineering
difficulties its builders had to contend with -- to be shown on
Discovery TV channel Aug. 27.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference to announce the show, Su said the
tunnel, a centerpiece of the newly completed Peiyi freeway linking
Taipei and Yilan County, is the pride of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I hope all of my fellow countrymen can take time out to view the
film to witness our country's progress in engineering and tunnel
construction," Su said.</P>
      <P>Minister of Transportation and Communications Tsai Duei said the
communications system inside the tunnel is the most comprehensive and
advanced in the world. "We'll enjoy a lead in this regard for quite
some time to come," he said.</P>
      <P>Given the special terrain of the mountain under which the tunnel
passes and from which it takes its name, the engineering team
employed the most sophisticated equipment, including the world's
biggest tunnel boring machine (TMB) . It marked the first time that
Taiwan had ever used TMB tunnel construction methods.</P>
      <P>The 55.3-km freeway was opened to traffic in June after the
12.9-km Hsuehshan tunnel was completed after 15 years of painstaking
construction. The freeway's construction cost more than NT$100
billion (US$3.11 billion).</P>
      <P>Of the 25 workers who died during the tunnel's construction, 13
were Taiwanese and 12 were Thai.</P>
      <P>The tunnel set many new records. It is Asia's longest and the
world's fourth-longest highway tunnel, as well as being the world's
longest twin-bore tunnel. The clay and rocks excavated from the
tunnels spanned 5.09 million cubic meters, or twice the volume of the
Egyptian pyramids. The mixed concrete used in building the tunnel was
enough to build seven Taipei 101 towers.</P>
      <P>It has been dubbed the "tunnel beneath troubled waters" because
of the engineering difficulties encountered. MInister Tsai said the
tunnel actually has a third bore which is reserved for use of
ambulances in emergency situation.</P>
      <P>During the excavation of the tunnel, 48 geological accidents
occurred in the main tunnel while the pilot tunnels suffered 42
accidents.</P>
      <P>The documentary will be broadcast in eight languages to 23 Asian
countries with an audience of 114 million. The documentary will be
premiered in Taiwan at 9 p.m. Aug. 27 and in other Asian countries at
9 p.m. Monday. The film will also be broadcast on Discovery global
channel later.</P>

      <P>A local publishing company joined with
Kingstone Bookstores, one of the largest bookstore chains in Taiwan,
to launch a "Turn Off the TV, Turn on Life" campaign Tuesday to
encourage people to read more.</P>
      <P>Booklife Publishing Co. said the campaign has received hearty
support from many local literati, including poet Hsi Mu-jung,
choreographer Lin Hwai-ming and academic Lee Chia-tung.</P>
      <P>A Booklife spokesman said the campaign is aimed at inspiring
people to turn off their TVs for at least an hour a day and devote
the time to reading.</P>
      <P>"At a time when our society is embroiled in noisy and turbulent
political campaigns to depose or support the president, we should not
spend too much time watching TV programs that tend to feature
spiteful barbs between the rival camps, " the spokesman said, adding
that Booklife and Kingston are introducing a myriad of interesting
titles to entice readers.</P>
      <P>Lin Hwai-ming, founder of the world-renowned Cloud Gate Dance

is the best way to enrich an individual's life and regain peace of

vitality and inspiration," Lin said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HOPES TO START FTA TALKS WITH U.S. NEXT SPRING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  22 (CNA)
(By Wennie Chi and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan official expressed the hope
Tuesday that Taiwan and the United States could start negotiations on
the signing of a free trade agreement (FTA) next spring.</P>
      <P>During a seminar held by the Center for National Policy in
Washington D.C., Republic of China deputy representative to the
United States John Deng noted that many Asian countries have sought
to sign bilateral FTAs with other countries.</P>
      <P>For example, Singapore has signed FTAs or engaged in FTA talks
with more than 20 countries, and China has entered talks with members
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Australia and New
Zealand, Deng said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the United States has signed an FTA with Australia and
is holding talks with South Korea, Deng pointed out, adding that
Taiwan, being a major trading partner of the United States, should
not be ignored.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that bilateral trade between Taiwan and the
United States totaled US$58 billion for 2005.</P>
      <P>Deng said the establishment of a Taiwan-U.S. FTA will help expand
bilateral trade, especially exports of beef and automobiles to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, several American academics taking part in the seminar
observed that in light of Washington's diplomatic agenda and the
situation across the Taiwan Strait, the start of Taiwan-U.S. FTA
talks might involve complicated political issues.</P>
      <P>Early this month, Thomas Christensen, newly-appointed U.S. deputy
assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said
that the timing for the signing of an FTA between Taiwan and the
United States has not matured yet.</P>
      <P>Christensen said Taiwan should try harder to improve its free
trade climate so as to create favorable conditions for the signing of
an FTA in the future.</P>

(By Lo Yuan-shao and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An ongoing campaign to unseat President Chen
Shui-bian over a string of alleged corruption scandals attests to
Taiwan's freedom of expression, the country's representative to
France said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Yang Tzu-pao made the remarks in an interview with Radio France
Internationale.</P>
      <P>According to Yang, French government officials are concerned
about the latest political developments in Taiwan, particularly the
campaign launched by a private group led by Shih Ming-teh, a former
chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), to depose
Chen. Radio France's French- and Chinese-language sections have also
interviewed him about the situation.</P>
      <P>Yang said his response tends to focus on three key points. First
of all, the campaign attests to Taiwan's liberal-democratic
advancement which has allowed its people to express their opinions
without fear. Second, its national leader is "not a god or divine
authority." Third, another dimension of liberal-democratic systems is
the rule of law which requires members of the public to respect due
process of law and judicial judgment.</P>
      <P>Yang said European countries generally agree that the peaceful
proceeding of the anti-Chen campaign embodies progress in Taiwan's
democratic development.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China Navy has never
conducted training exercises in other countries' territorial waters,
a military official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Vice Adm. Sun Yi-cheng, director of the political warfare
department at the Navy Command Headquarters, made the remarks in
response to media reports that Okinawa officials have asked the
Japanese central government to push Taiwan to stop naval drills in
waters near Yonaguni, one of Okinawa's outlying islands.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, the ROC Navy announced on the Internet
that it would conduct training exercises in airspace and waters west
of Yonaguni Island Aug. 3, Aug. 8 and Aug. 11. The reports said the
Japanese Foreign Ministry had asked Taiwan through the Japanese
Interchange Association (JIA) to change its military exercise
location. The JIA is a quasi-official body auhtorized to handle
exchanges with Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>The reports said Japanese authorities didn't confirm whether the
ROC Navy conducted another round of exercises in the area on Aug. 15,
Aug.18 and Aug. 22 as scheduled. The reports instead quoted Japanese
Foreign Ministry officials as saying that Taiwan should have informed
Japan in advance of its military training plans near Yonaguni Island.</P>
      <P>In response, Sun said that since the Navy is unlikely to enter
any foreign country's territorial waters, it need not serve a prior
notice to any neighboring country about its military training plans.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Sun said, the Navy has invariably declared its training
schedules and exact locations with sufficient explanations plus
graphics and illustrations. "Questions raised by Japanese authorities
might arise from misreading our vector graphics," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC HEAD TO VISIT D.C. NEXT MONTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  22 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top official in charge of
China policy is scheduled to visit Washington, D.C. early next month
to bolster ties between Taiwan and the United States, diplomatic
sources said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) , is
expected to arrive in Washington in early September to meet with U.S.
officials in charge of Taiwan and China affairs in addition to
delivering a lecture at a think-tank on Sept. 5, according to the
sources.</P>
      <P>Wu is expected to deliver a speech on cross-Taiwan Strait
relations and Taiwan's future prospects at the Washington-based
Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.</P>
      <P>Wu's forthcoming Washington visit is seen as a positive gesture
aimed at mending fences with the United States following a spat over
the issue of President Chen Shui-bian's U.S. stopover location on his
visit to Central America in May, when U.S.-Taiwan bilateral relations
slid to a new low, the sources said.</P>
      <P>U.S.-Taiwan relations have been "warming" again since June after
a visit to Taiwan by American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman
Raymond Burghardt, during which Chen reiterated his resolve to stick
to his "five noes" pledge, the sources said.</P>
      <P>In his 2000 inaugural address, Chen pledged that as long as
Beijing has no intention of using military force against Taiwan, he
will not declare independence, not change Taiwan's name, not add the
state-to-state theory into the Constitution, not promote a referendum
on the issue of independence versus unification, and not scrap the
National Unification Guidelines during his time in office -- known as
the "five noes" doctrine.</P>

      <P>Those who are in charge of foreign labor
management must meet certain criteria, according to amended foreign
labor management regulations which will be put into practice soon.</P>
      <P>Under the amended regulations, those who are in charge of foreign
labor management will have to obtain licenses for professionals. If
the employers have not followed the rules in hiring management staff,
or the management staff have not met certain criteria, then the
employers will have their permission to hire foreign laborers revoked
unless they improve the situation after being notified.</P>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) began working on the amendment
to the foreign labor management regulations after a riot last August
by some Thai laborers working on constructing Kaohsiung City's mass
rapid transit (MRT) system. The riot was triggered by harsh treatment
by a manpower management company commissioned by the Kaohsiung Rapid
Transit Corp. to build the MRT system.</P>
      <P>A CLA team sent to investigate the causes of the riot found that
the living quarters of Thai laborers were too crowded and that the
toilets, restaurants and management staff were substandard.</P>
      <P>According to the amended regulations, the employers will have to
notify local labor authorities to check on their management after
hiring foreign laborers so that the labor authorities will also
contribute to foreign labor management.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former recipients of grants-in-aid engage
more in volunteer work than non-recipients do, according to the
results of a recent poll released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the poll conducted by the Taiwan Fund for Children
and Families (TFCF) last month on 1,000 former beneficiaries of TFCF
grants-in-aid, 42.1 percent of them have consistently or occasionally
engaged in social service volunteer work. These beneficiaries have
completed their college education with the financial aid provided by
the TFCF.</P>
      <P>By comparison, TFCF officials cited tallies compiled by the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) as
indicating that in the most recent year, only 17.09 percent of Taiwan
citizens with college or higher education backgrounds who were not
recipients of grants-in-aid engaged in volunteer work.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 45.4 percent of the former TFCF aid
recipients who are college graduates have made cash donations
regularly or occasionally to social welfare causes during the most
recent year.</P>
      <P>By comparison, only 38.77 percent of non-recipients with college
degrees have made such cash donations during the same period,
according to the DGBAS tallies.</P>
      <P>The TFCF -- the Taiwan version of the U.S. Christian Children's

The beneficiaries received an average of NT$100,325 (US$3,068) in aid

    <HEADLINE>KMT URGED TO CLARIFY QUESTIONS SURROUNDING PARTY ASSETS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  23 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang challenged the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Wednesday to clarify several questions
regarding the party's assets, including how much was obtained from
the national coffers.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks during a weekly Cabinet meeting, in response
to the KMT's plan to release a report on its assets later the same
day.</P>
      <P>Su said the issue of the KMT assets is not an internal affair of
the party but is a serious one that concerns whether transitional
justice can be upheld in the country.</P>
      <P>According to Su, what the people care about is not how much the
KMT has earned or lost or how much it has left. Instead, what they
care about is how much of the KMT's assets were obtained from the
national coffers during its authoritarian control of the country in
the past, as well as where and when they were used, and whether the
KMT intends to return them to the country and the people, Su said.</P>
      <P>Su urged KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou to answer in detail a list of
questions to address the public's doubts.</P>
      <P>The first question is how much in subsidies did the KMT, KMT-run
businesses and KMT-affiliated organizations obtain from government
agencies, he said.</P>
      <P>The second, he continued, is what assets were owned and are still
owned by the KMT, KMT-run businesses and KMT-affiliated
organizations, how many were transferred from the government or
state-owned enterprises, and how were the transfers made and what was
the total value of these assets.</P>
      <P>The third, he said, is how much was earned by the KMT-run
businesses and KMT-affiliated organizations owing to the privileges
they enjoyed in the past, how much was saved in tax deductions or
exemptions granted by the government, how much in retirement pensions
and severance pay for KMT staff was paid out of the national coffers,
and what amount was spent on election campaigns and political
activities.</P>
      <P>Claiming that only if these questions are clarified will Taiwan
be able to establish a sound democratic system, Su instructed related
agencies to look into the national archives to try to find the
answers to the questions.</P>
      <P>After the investigation is completed, a special task force under
the Ministry of Finance will report the results to the public, Su
said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kinmen,   Aug.  23  (CNA)
(By K.Y. Ni and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian confirmed
Wednesday that he will head to Palau, one of Taiwan's diplomatic
allies in the South Pacific, Sept. 3 for a state visit.</P>
      <P>Chen told members of the military during a ceremony held on the
frontline island of Kinmen to mark the anniversary of victory in a
battle against China 48 years ago that he will set out for Palau
Sept. 3 for a three-day visit. While there, he said, he will attend
the first summit meeting between Taiwan and its six South Pacific
diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>The Battle of the Taiwan Strait began with China's shelling of
Kinmen Aug. 23, 1958, in a failed attempt to pound Kinmen into
submission. China lobbed 480,000 shells in a 44-day barrage, leaving
Kinmen pockmarked with craters.</P>
      <P>Chen paid tribute to those who sacrificed their lives in the
battle, saying he admires their selfless patriotism.</P>
      <P>He was accompanied by Defense Minister Lee Jye, Chief of the
General Staff Li Tien-yu, and other senior government and military
officials on the visit to Kinmen, which lies closer to China's Fujian
Province than to Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>It was Chen's third visit to Kinmen this year, following visits
on Jan. 17, during which he announced the naming of a new premier,
and June 22, when he reiterated his authority as commander-in-chief
of the ROC armed forces while embroiled in a string of corruption
allegations against his family and close aides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLAR URGES TAIWAN NEWS MEDIA TO LOOK BEYOND DOMESTIC POLITICS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 23 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A scholar who opposes using street rallies
to depose the president said Wednesday that Taiwan news media are
focusing too much on domestic politics.</P>
      <P>"Look at Taiwan's electronic media and you'll find the same
people discussing the same political issues on the same programs day
after day as if there is nothing left for Taiwan except politics, "
said Lee Chia-tung of National Chi Nan University.</P>
      <P>After he expressed differences with supporters of former
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Shih Ming-teh's campaign
calling on "one million people to depose President Chen Shui-bian in
a mass sit-in," he was criticized as "too high-brow."</P>
      <P>He said Chen indeed should step down to take moral and political
responsibility for leading a government with a poor administrative
record and being embroiled in a spate of corruption scandals, but
"legal channels must be followed to achieve that purpose."</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA, Lee said Taiwan's media have
focused only on Taiwan's politics while Iran's missile test and
nuclear program have caused international tension that might lead to
soaring oil prices from which Taiwan will not be able to escape.</P>
      <P>"But in Taiwan's media, this major international issue is almost
non-existent while our government does not seem to have prepared
itself well for an impact caused by the Iran issue," he said.</P>
      <P>He ridiculed Taiwan's media for adopting an insular world view,
locking their audience to "this small island of Taiwan, particularly
to its domestic politics."</P>
      <P>In fact, he added, there are many more important issues that
warrant in-depth reports by the media, such as education, the
economy, industrial development, and especially the professional
education issue which has been ignored for too long.</P>
      <P>"The world is immense. There are not just political stories
happening. The media here should broaden their horizons," he said.</P>
      <P>Lee, along with another "dissident intellectual" -- writer Lung
Ying-tai -- has been accused by Democratic Action Alliance (DAA)
leaders of living in an ivory tower and not knowing what is causing
great pain to many people.</P>
      <P>Lung, complaining that her views have been taken out of context
by Taiwan's "lazy media," has promised to elaborate on the subject in
an article that she will publish Thursday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP TO FORM 'GRAND ALLIANCE' TO RETRIEVE KMT-STOLEN NATIONAL ASSETS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 23 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Accusing the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) of
selling out its "ill-gotten" party assets that belong to the people
of Taiwan, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) vowed
Wednesday to form a "grand alliance" to retrieve the "stolen"
national assets.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, Vice President Annette Lu and Premier
Su Tseng-chang said the KMT's report on its party assets, made public
for the first time earlier in the day, was but an attempt to inform
the people of how the party has sold out the assets under its name
while other critical information remains in the dark.</P>
      <P>The DPP leaders announced that the party has gathered 100,000
signatures calling for a national referendum to demand that the KMT
return all of its "ill-gotten" assets to the national coffers. A DPP
proposal is expected to be sent to the Executive Yuan in early
September urging it to hold a referendum on the issue.</P>
      <P>Yu said his KMT counterpart, Ma Ying-jeou, chose to publish the
party assets report at this point in time, when a campaign to depose
President Chen Shui-bian is being pushed feverishly, indicating that
he is trying to unload the political baggage associated with the
party's assets.</P>
      <P>Yu said the KMT report does not deal with whether the party's
assets were obtained legally or legitimately, "nor did it give a full
picture of the assets."</P>
      <P>"The issue now is not how much of the suspicious party assets
remains under KMT control. Rather, the party should tell the people
clearly how much of the national assets it obtained illegally, " Yu
said.</P>
      <P>He demanded Ma divulge where the funds from the sale of party
assets are, the amount by which the assets have shrunk since Ma
became party chairman, whether there has been money laundering or
conflict of interests, why he has not made good on his campaign
promise to return the party assets to the state and who has gained
from profits generated by party-owned enterprises.</P>
      <P>He also asked whether the account books of party enterprises
showing net losses have been doctored so the party can make legal
claims.</P>
      <P>He asked how much of its overseas assets have been included in
the report and how much of them have been re-invested or registered
under private names, as are some of the KMT's domestic assets.</P>
      <P>Yu said that as Ma will not respond to these questions in a
positive manner, and because the KMT has sped up the process of
selling its assets -- a total of NT$25 billion-worth recently -- it
has become an urgent task to form a "grand alliance" to demand that
the KMT return its ill-gotten assets to the state.</P>
      <P>Before the campaign to retrieve the KMT assets goes into the
second phase of signature-collecting, Yu urged Ma to stop money
laundering in connection with the sale of party assets, to stop
selling more of its assets and to hand them over to the government.</P>
      <P>The KMT, once described as the richest political party in the
world, claimed in its report that only NT$27.7 billion-worth of the
assets remain in Ma's control.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WATER RESOURCES AGENCY VIEWS DEEP SEA WATER AS 'BLUE GOLD'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Water Resources Agency (WRA) under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs is collaborating with the quasi-official
Industrial Technology Research Institute to help local companies
develop deep sea resources off Taiwan's east coast, resources that
the WRA views as "blue gold."</P>
      <P>So far, at least three companies have been allowed to start
commercial development of Taiwan's deep-sea water resources, which
WRA authorities believe could be transformed into the country's new
"cash cow" using the inexpensive, "always available" resources from
the deep ocean.</P>
      <P>WRA officials believe that commercial development of Taiwan's
deep-sea water resources could generate business worth some NT$18
billion (US$550 million) a year after investment begins to recoup.</P>
      <P>WRA Director Chen Shen-hsien said commercial development of
deep-ocean water resources is considered by the government as one of
the most important plans in terms of water resource development.</P>
      <P>Chen said the WRA is responsible for field research and
investigations into sites chosen for commercial development and will
be the official unit receiving and supervising applications for the
construction of water piping systems.</P>
      <P>Chen said Japan and the United States have begun to develop
deep-ocean water resources, but Taiwan has much better conditions for
such development, given that the country is situated beside the
Continental Shelf, while major Pacific Ocean currents regularly pass
along the island's east coast.</P>
      <P>Chen said the deep-sea regions in Taiwan's exclusive economic
zone off the east coast can be used to cultivate high-value fishery
products by taking advantage of the water cleanliness, low
temperature and richness in minerals and other valuable substances.</P>
      <P>Of the three companies, Chen said, one in the eastern county of
Hualien is expected to become fully operational later this month
after the WRA helped it secure breakthroughs in its operational
bottlenecks.</P>
      <P>The company is expected to put onto the market newly developed
liquors, bottled drinking water, cosmetics and cultured fish and
shellfish using clean and cool deep-sea water by the end of this year
at the earliest.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said, the second facility -- financed and set up
by Taiwan Fertilizer Co. -- will pump up 2,400 tons to 2,600 tons of
ocean water per day from 710 meters below the surface to produce
bottled drinking water.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT ASSETS NOW WORTH NT$27.7 BILLION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  23 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said
Wednesday it has assets valued at NT$27.7 billion (US$0.85 billion) ,
down from NT$80.8 billion in March, 2000 when the party lost power.</P>
      <P>The party made public a "general illustration" report on its
assets, which have long been a point of contention between the former
ruling party and other political parties in Taiwan that have been
demanding that it return its "ill-gotten" assets to the national
coffers.</P>
      <P>During a central standing committee meeting, KMT Vice Chairman
Chang Che-chen said the report was prepared to illustrate the changes
in the party's assets from the authoritarian period of 1950-1988
through the transitional period of 1988-2000 to the democratic period
of 2000 until the present.</P>
      <P>The report shows that in March 1994, when the party registered
itself as a "civic group" with the government, it had assets worth
NT$38.5 billion.</P>
      <P>The assets swelled to a peak of NT$91.8 billion in Dec. 1998,
when investments by its enterprises reached a historic high. The
figure went down to NT$80.8 billion in March 2000, when the KMT lost
ruling power to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and Lien Chan
took over the party chairmanship from Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>In August 2005, when Ma Ying-jeou took over the party helm, the
party's assets were worth NT$31.1 billion. By July 2006, they had
fallen to NT$27.7 billion.</P>
      <P>The NT$3.4 billion difference was caused by the sale of several
party properties, including the former party headquarters building,
funds from which were used to pay for the party's daily operations
over the past year.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the current net value of NT$27.7 billion
includes NT$2.3 billion in real estate and NT$23.3 billion in
businesses that have assets worth NT$44.3 billion and debts totalling
NT$21 billion.</P>
      <P>The party's real estate includes 612 pieces of land worth NT$1.6
billion and 415 housing units valued at NT$700 million.</P>
      <P>The KMT was once described as the richest political party in the
world and the DPP has vowed to form a "grand alliance" to demand that
it hand back all of its "ill-gotten" assets to the state.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian should cancel a
planned visit to Palau and Nauru in early September, in response to
demands that he step down from the presidency, a spokeswoman for a

      <P>Ho De-fen, a professor at Nanhua University in southern Chiayi
County, who serves as spokeswoman for the populist movement led by
former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Shih Ming-teh to
oust scandal-tainted Chen, made the remarks at a news conference.</P>
      <P>Although Chen is perfectly entitled to leave Taiwan at a time
when Shih and supporters are planning to start a sit-in on the square
in front of the Presidential Office to pressure him to resign, Ho
claimed that as head of state, Chen should not "evade the issue."</P>
      <P>"The problem will remain even if Chen escapes Taiwan, " she said,
urging Chen to heed the public's requirements.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the question of when the sit-in to unseat Chen will
kick off, Ho replied that it will be decided in the coming days and
that volunteer workers have been preparing for necessary

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's domestic politics will play no
role in Washington's processing of any requests from Taiwan for
transit stops by its president on U.S. soil, a State Department
official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In response to journalists' questions, the official said the
State Department will process any such requests based on precedent
and will take into account the Taiwan leader's safety, convenience,
comfort and dignity.</P>
      <P>The official said that it has always been Washington's policy not
to get involved in any of Taiwan's domestic political disputes which
he added should be resolved by the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The official dismissed questions by reporters on whether the
United States will allow Chen to make a transit stop in Guam on his
way to Palau early next month, saying that he would comment on Taiwan
newspaper speculation.</P>
      <P>Chen's critics at home are trying to organize a sit in to get rid
of him, and have claimed that his trip -- planned, like most state
visits, months in advance -- was actually planned at the very last
minute to pre-empt the sit-in, which only began to be organized Aug.
12.</P>
      <P>They have also claimed that Chen is mulling whether to travel
aboard a military jet described by the press as "Taiwan's Air Force
One" rather than his more normal use of a civilian aircraft, which
would be a symbol of sovereignty on his trip in order to score
diplomatic points to divert attention away from growing pressure at
home for him to step down over a spate of corruption scandal
allegations involving himself, members of his family and close aides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT WILL  'RESPECT' FORMER DPP CHAIRMAN'S SIT-IN PROTEST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Embattled President Chen Shui-bian said
Wednesday that he will "respect and be tolerant of" an upcoming
protest mobilized by Shih Ming-teh, a former chairman of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>In his first response to Shih's campaign, the president also said
while receiving a German parliamentary group of the Social Democratic
Party at the Presidential Office that Shih's protest will be
protected by law.</P>
      <P>Chen was referring to a planned sit-in protest by Shih in front
of the Presidential Office to pressure him to resign over a series of
corruption and embezzlement allegations implicating himself, his
family members and senior aides.</P>
      <P>Shih called for a "one million people to depose the president"
campaign Aug. 12, asking the public to donate NT$100 (US$3) each to
support his cause. A spokesman for the campaign said the donations
passed the NT$100 million mark Tuesday and that the sit-in protest
will be held sometime between Aug. 27 and Sept. 9.</P>
      <P>The president noted that Shih, a pioneer in Taiwan's democracy
movement who was incarcerated for many years for promoting his ideals,
was politically persecuted in his early days.</P>
      <P>Chen said a letter allegedly written by Shih asking for
forgiveness from the late President Chiang Kai-shek "deserves our
sympathy."</P>
      <P>A DPP legislator displayed the alleged letter Tuesday to
vindicate his claim that Shih is not hero he is portrayed as.
Shih has denied that the letter was penned by him.</P>
      <P>Chen said that anyone who stands up against an authoritarian
government is bound to be persecuted.</P>
      <P>But he added that Taiwan is now fully democratic and that all
"diverse political views and advocacy should be absolutely tolerated,
respected and protected."</P>
      <P>The president gave his assurance that as a leader of a democratic
country, Shih will not be thrown in jail for his sit-in protest.</P>
      <P>Chen rose to prominence after serving as one of the defense
lawyers for the defendants, including Shih, of the Kaohsiung
Incident, a peaceful rally Dec. 25, 1979 to mark World Human Rights
Day that turned violent and was suppressed by the then Kuomintang
government.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Preferential treatment for former premiers
will be canceled at the end of August following a review, Executive
Yuan spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Considering the fact that there is no legal basis for such
preferential treatment and because it is difficult to
institutionalize the practice, the Executive Yuan has decided to
cancel it, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Cheng's remarks came after former Premier Hau Pei-tsun recently
returned his chauffeur to the government, raising questions from the
media and legislators.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the Executive Yuan started to learn about the
attitudes toward preferential treatment for former premiers early
this month and asked the former premiers themselves about their
feelings. All of them said they did not want such treatment.</P>
      <P>At present, former presidents and vice presidents have statutes
governing their preferential treatment after they step down, while
former premiers receive mainly limousines, chauffeurs, free water,
electricity and telephone services. When a former premier dies, the
privileges are revoked.</P>
      <P>Former premiers Lee Huan, Hau Pei-tsun and Vincent Siew, all of
the former ruling Kuomintang, receive preferential treatment, while
Lien Chan, a former premier as well as vice president under the KMT,

    <HEADLINE>FORMER DPP CHAIRMAN'S ANTI-PRESIDENT FUND RAISING ILLEGAL: MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  23 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Interior Minister Lee Yi-yang claimed
Wednesday that as former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman
Shih Ming-teh is not allowed to accept political donations, his
campaign to depose the president violates the political donations
law.</P>
      <P>An estimated 1 million people have donated over NT$100 million to
Shih's campaign calling on "one million people to depose President
Chen Shui-bian" through a mass sit-in protest.</P>
      <P>Lee countered critics who claim Shih's campaign is legal,
claiming that their argument has committed "two great fallacies."</P>
      <P>Campaign supporters have argued that Shih is not a public office
holder and is not running for any public office, so accepting
donations is not something that should be regulated by the political
donations law.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, only political parties, groups or individuals
running for elected office can accept political donations to hold
political activities.</P>
      <P>Shih is not qualified to accept political donations or set up
bank accounts for that purpose, both of which would implicate that he
has broken the law, the minister claimed.</P>
      <P>Campaign organizers have argued that the NT$100 (US$3) donations
will be used to repay donors attending the sit-in in the form of
lunch boxes or bottled water. It can also be seen as a registration
fee for the activity and therefore should not be regulated by the
political donations law, they claimed.</P>
      <P>In response, Lee claimed that all donations in excess of NT$100
are in violation of the law, and that "many people have donated
hundreds, thousands and even tens of thousands of dollars to the
campaign, and these law-violating donations should be investigated by
the Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>As to criticism that the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) has
violated the rule of bureaucratic hierarchy by commanding the Control
Yuan to crack down, Lee said his ministry is in charge of the
political donations law.</P>
      <P>"If we do not call on the government authorities in charge of
enforcing the law to do its job, the MOI could be charged with
negligence," he claimed.</P>
      <P>He also fought back at critics who claim that the MOI has been
trying to play a dominant role in enforcing the march and assembly
law, claiming that these critics have made statements contrary to the
fact.</P>
      <P>"If the MOI was fully in charge of the march and assembly law, we
would not have given permission to stage a 15-day, 24-hour-a-day
sit-in that would affect Taipei citizens' rights to attend school,
visit hospital and live normal lives," Lee said.</P>
      <P>As to how police will handle the sit-in, he said that as a rule,
the city police will take care of order and only when the situation
turns so bad that it is beyond the city police's capacity will the
National Police Administration under the MOI intervene.</P>

Iran responded Tuesday to a set of

In its response, Iran offered "serious

Wall Street Journal:Housing Slump
Proves Painful For Some Owners and Builders

For years, real-estate brokers and home
builders promised that the soaring property
market eventually would glide to a soft
landing. These optimists predicted that
home prices, which had more than doubled
in parts of the country between 2000 and
2005, would continue to rise, but at a more
normal pace of 5% or 6% a year.

It isn't working out that way. The
rapid deterioration of the market over
the past 12 months has caught many
homeowners and builders off guard. Some
are being forced to cut prices far below
what their homes could have fetched a
year ago. It's too early to say how hard
the landing will be, but at a minimum it
will be bumpy for many people who need to
sell homes. And the economy as a whole,
buoyed in recent years by the housing
frenzy, could suffer.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CALLS FOR REINVESTIGATION INTO '319 SHOOTING'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 23 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) called
for a new investigation into the March 19, 2004 shooting of President
Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu Wednesday after a report
released by the second "319 truth commission" a day earlier claimed
that the lone suspect in the incident did not kill himself but was
murdered.</P>
      <P>The 150-page report, released by the 17-member commission formed
in May according to an amended statute to unearth the truth about the
incident, used about 60 pages to present a forensic analysis led by
James Chun-i Lee, a professor at National Taiwan University's
Graduate Institute of Forensic Medicine.</P>
      <P>The report said the only suspect, Chen Yi-hsiung -- whose body,
wrapped in a fishing net, was found in Tainan's Anping harbor 10 days
after the incident -- did not die because he fell into the water and
drowned, and nor did he "commit suicide because he feared
punishment," as claimed by an investigation task force formed mainly
by prosecutors from the Tainan Public Prosecutor's Office.</P>
      <P>"Chen Yi-hsiung's body was dumped into the water after he died,
and it is most likely that he was murdered," according to the
forensic analysis, based on an re-examination of the photos and other
evidence collected from the scene where his body was found.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the new findings, Legislator Tsai Chin-lung, a whip
of the KMT legislative caucus, said the KMT caucus will ask the
legislature to pass a resolution to request that the Supreme
Prosecutor's Office reopen the case.</P>
      <P>Tsai deplored that members of the second "319 truth investigation
commission" met strong resistance from the Cabinet in the past three
months when they asked to go through related documents about the
incident.</P>
      <P>He said that after the next legislative session opens Sept. 19,
the KMT caucus will also ask the legislature to submit the names of
all those uncooperative officials to the Control Yuan -- Taiwan's
highest watchdog body -- for impeachment.</P>
      <P>The March 19 shooting occurred when the president and vice
president were campaigning in a jeep in the southern Taiwan city of
Tainan. The KMT and its ally, the People First Party, believe the
incident generated sympathy votes for Chen and Lu, helping them to
win the election by a mere 29,500 votes.</P>
      <P>The opposition parties also suspect that the incident was staged.
Their demand to form a commission to investigate the shooting met
strong resistance from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and
its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>The first commission formed according to an organic statute
passed by the legislature flopped because the Council of Grand
Justices ruled that some clauses of the statute were
unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>After the opposition-controlled legislature amended the statute
in April, the second commission was established and empowered to ask
any organization to provide documents and evidence for its
examination.</P>
      <P>The commission is required to submit a written report to the
Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan every three months. It is
expected to complete its probe in six months.</P>
      <P>In August last year, the Tainan Public Prosecutor's Office closed
the case after concluding that the lone suspect in the shooting
incident apparently committed suicide.</P>
      <P>Chen Yi-hsiung's wife, who had previously admitted that her
husband carried out the shooting because he was depressed about being
unemployed and blamed the president's policies, told a news
conference in March that she was coerced into giving false testimony
implicating her husband.</P>
      <P>Claiming that her husband was murdered, she presented what she
described as new evidence from a videotape about the "critical 17
seconds" in the "hot zone" of the shooting and asked that the case be
reinvestigated to clear her husband's name.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER TOUTS ADMINISTRATIVE ACHIEVEMENTS IN 1ST HALF YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Wednesday that
the government has achieved major policy goals in the first half of
this year, with the economic growth rate reaching an estimated 4.74
percent.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks at a weekly Cabinet meeting in which the
central government's 2007 budget plan was reviewed and approved. The
draft budget bill will be referred to the Legislative Yuan next week
for approval in the new legislative session set to open in September.</P>
      <P>Also discussed at the meeting was a draft version of the
premier's administrative report to be delivered at the opening
session of the legislature.</P>
      <P>Su said he will give a detailed account of the government's major
achievements in the first half year and its future agenda in his
administrative report to the legislature.</P>
      <P>In the first-half year, Su said, the domestic economy kept
booming, with external trade and export orders continuing fast growth
and industrial production and job openings increasing steadily.
Compared with the same period of last year, nearly 200,000 new jobs
were created while the inflation rate was relatively mild.</P>
      <P>Until May, Su said, the government's economic monitoring index
consistently flashed a green light symbolizing stable growth for 10
months. In June, the index turned "yellow blue" signaling an economic
slowdown because of a combination of factors, including skyrocketing
crude oil prices, a global stock market slump and the domestic
political upheaval over corruption allegations against members of the
first family and the president's close aides.</P>
      <P>Su said the administration should redouble its efforts in the
second half of the year to keep the economy humming along.</P>
      <P>Quoting a report by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting
and Statistics, Su said the domestic economic growth rate reached
4.74 percent in the first half of the year and the growth rate for
the whole year is estimated at 4.28 percent, representing a 0.25
percent increase year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Since the government launched a crime-fighting campaign in March,
Su claimed that public satisfaction about law and order has
rebounded. According to statistics, the number of criminal cases and
violent crimes declined between March and August from the
year-earlier level, while the crime solution rate has been rising
steadily. The number of theft and fraud cases declined by 13.36
percent and 10.79 percent, respectively, during the same period.</P>
      <P>"All these figures point to a marked improvement in law and order
through concerted efforts of police and other government agencies, "
according to Su.</P>
      <P>On the promotion of welfare benefits and services for
disadvantaged groups, Su said the central government has launched a
new aid program for youngsters from impoverished families and
has assisted local governments in hiring more professional social
workers to protect children and juveniles from abuse or maltreatment.</P>
      <P>During the first-half year, Su said, the Executive Yuan also
submitted to the legislature draft packages of revisions to the</P>
      <P>laws governing national health insurance, welfare for the elderly
and employment services.</P>
      <P>In an unprecedented move to boost clean politics, Su said, the
Executive Yuan unveiled early this year a basket of rules requiring
political appointees to put their assets into trust after they assume
office.</P>
      <P>To show its determination to boost political integrity,
accountability and transparency, Su said the Executive Yuan is
drafting revisions to the public functionaries assets disclosure law
to expand the scope of assets subject to mandatory disclosure,
require mandatory entrustment of their assets, introduce a dynamic
assets disclosure mechanism and investigate unaccountable asset
increases.</P>
      <P>"We hope the revision bill can clear the legislature in the near
future to prevent public functionaries from influence peddling or
abusing their power for illegal financial gains as part of the
campaign to wipe out political corruption," Su said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of indigenous youths said Wednesday
they have learned a lot from a 10-day tour that focused on cultural
exchanges and environmental protection and took them from aboriginal
tribal villages to nuclear power plants and Taipei City.</P>
      <P>The tour, which was co-organized by the National Youth Commission
(NYC) and the Taiwan Environmental Protection Union (TEPU), is part
of the NYC's Youth Action Plans initiative.</P>
      <P>Seven of the eight teenagers on the tour come from the Tao tribe,
which resides on Lanyu island, located 76 km off the coast of
southeastern Taiwan. During the trip, they picked up a new partner
from Smangus, a Taiya tribal village in Hsinchu County.</P>
      <P>The youths from Lanyu were especially emotional when they visited
the No. 1 and No. 4 nuclear power plants, TEPU secretary-general Ho
Tsung-hsun said at a press conference Wednesday, as their home is
used by the Taiwan Power Co. as a nuclear waste dump, he said.</P>
      <P>They also visited Smangus, a village that has implemented a
"communist" social system that has been passed down from their
ancestors, to get a feel for the culture of a different tribe.</P>
      <P>Other locations they visited on the tour included Tainan City,
Chiku Lagoon, Sandimen township in Pintung County, and the Taipei
Artist Village.</P>
      <P>The culture experience tour is one of more than 40 programs
organized by NYC in cooperation with non-governmental organizations
to encourage Taiwanese youth participation in local affairs,

      <P>The "e-Learning World, Taipei" exhibition will present the latest
developments in one of the fastest- growing online industries, said
Wu Ming-chi of the Industrial Development Bureau under the Ministry
of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>"The e-learning industry has taken the world by storm. In Taiwan,
it went from a gross market value of NT$700 million in 2002 to NT$10
billion this year. I'm proud to say that Taiwan is doing well
compared to other countries, " Wu said.</P>
      <P>The exhibition is being held against the background of a global

    <HEADLINE>DPP CAUCUS URGES KMT TO RETURN ILL-GOTTEN PARTY ASSETS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  23 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) , which published a report on its party assets, to "spit out"
the assets that belong to the people of Taiwan Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yi-jin, caucus secretary- general, said the KMT's "general
illustration" report on its party assets was trying to hide the fact
that a majority of the assets were obtained through improper means.</P>
      <P>By expressing apology, the KMT actually was not doing anything
about the key point at the heart of the issue -- to return what is
due to the people of Taiwan, she said. </P>
      <P>Deputy Finance Minister Lee Rui-tsang called on the KMT to make
public all of its account books and help pass a statute on political
party assets as a means of showing its sincerity in facing the issue.</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of Finance's Bureau of National
Properties, the KMT has to date returned only 1.29 percent of
state-owned real estate to the government.</P>
      <P>The KMT will only win the people's trust when its helps legislate
a law on political party assets and cooperate with the government in
building a mechanism for political parties to engage in fair
competition, Lee said.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lai Shyh-bao suggested that the KMT focus on
legislating the political party law instead of the party assets law
so that political parties will be obligated to publicize their
finances regularly.</P>
      <P>Lai, also a member of the KMT central standing committee, had the
support of other members and more importantly, that of Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou, for his proposal to enact a political party law.</P>
      <P>Under such a law, Ma said, political parties must abide by rules
when they raise and use political funds and when they hold party
elections, and violators will be disciplined.</P>
      <P>Ma admitted that many of the party's assets were ceded to Taiwan
by the previous Japanese government, which ruled Taiwan from 1895 to
1945, and claimed that the KMT's ownership of these assets is legal
but "morally questionable."</P>
      <P>He said that a political party that owns assets is not violating
any law, but must not manage any profit-making business.</P>
      <P>Based on that principle, he said the KMT's Central Investment
Corp. will be closed by 2008 and all party assets will be put in
trust following an actuary account of regular spending on running the
party.</P>
      <P>He estimated that NT$2 billion is needed per year to pay for a
pension fund for the party's workers, with another NT$900 million
required to pay for retired workers' monthly pensions.</P>
      <P>The party's assets report shows that between 2000 and 2005, the
KMT's assets shrank by NT$49.7 billion mainly because its seven
investment holding companies lost a total of NT$42.7 billion from
investments that were ravaged by the 1998 Asian financial crisis.</P>
      <P>The report said that the KMT used its own funds to help relieve
small- and medium-sized businesses that were in financial trouble, a
decision that it claimed was made in consideration of the nation's
overall economic interest.</P>
      <P>However, if "human factors" were involved in some of the losing
investment projects, a task force will be formed to investigate and
legal action will be taken against possible irregularities, said
Chang Che-chen, the party's vice chairman.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan had 85,183 low-income households at
the end of June this year, accounting for 1.16 percent of the total
number of households, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting
and Statistics (DGBAS) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The number marked an increase of 22,000 households from that
registered in 2001.</P>
      <P>Among them, 4,171 households, with a total of 4,414 members,
could not make a living by themselves and had to wholly rely on
social welfare. Over the past five years, the number of this category
of households remained almost the same but if compared with the 2001
level, the number of family members in the category marked a
3-percent decline.</P>
      <P>A second category of low-income families, which refers to
households that have no more than one-third of members working and
their per capita monthly income falling below the level of NT$7,750,
numbered 22,200 households, with a total of 45,107 family members.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reminded the
public Wednesday that peace can never be built on the basis of an
enemy's goodwill and that robust defense capabilities are the bedrock
for achieving lasting peace.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while presiding over a ceremony on the
outlying island of Kinmen to mark the 48th anniversary of victory in
the Battle of the Taiwan Strait, known locally as the "823 Battle, "
against China in 1958.</P>
      <P>The "823 Battle " began on Kinmen Aug. 23, 1958, with China
shelling the Taiwan-held island. The battle was regarded as the
second-biggest military confrontation to occur in the Taiwan Strait
since 1949.</P>
      <P>On that day, China's People's Liberation Army, in a bid to take
the island, launched an intensive attack and fired heavy artillery at
several islands off Kinmen. In 85 minutes, they had fired more than
30,000 shells.</P>
      <P>The artillery bombardment continued until Jan. 7, 1959 with the
total number of shells fired at Kinmen and the surrounding area
exceeding 480,000.</P>
      <P>The intense artillery assault was eventually repulsed by the
Republic of China troops stationed there, although many soldiers and
civilians were killed or injured.</P>
      <P>Chen said the victory in the "823 Battle" lay a solid basis for
Taiwan's survival and development in the following decades and a
crucial factor for peace in the Taiwan Strait over the past half
century.</P>
      <P>"While commemorating the victory and paying tribute to those who
gave their lives in the operations, we must not forget the historical
lesson that peace cannot be built on the basis of an enemy's

    <HEADLINE>WRITER LUNG NOT AGAINST TAKING TO STREETS AS DEMOCRATIC EXPRESSION: MA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou said Thursday that writer Lung Ying-tai, who has declined
to donate NT$100 in support of a populist campaign to depose
President Chen Shui-bian, is not opposed to the idea of taking to the
streets as a means of "democratic expression" of one's political
views.</P>
      <P>Ma was commenting on a long article written by Lung which
appeared in the Thursday edition of the China Times newspaper, in
which she explained why she has chosen to stick with the
"institutional approach" -- namely using one's vote -- to drive an
unpopular political leader out of office.</P>
      <P>Lung said she agrees with former Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) Chairman Shih Ming-teh, who initiated the campaign calling on
"one million people to depose the president" through a mass sit-in
protest, that Chen should step down to take moral and political
responsibility for a spate of corruption scandals involving his
family members and close aides.</P>
      <P>However, Lung added that she does not agree with Shih's "street
demonstration" approach to unseat a president whose integrity and
credibility are highly in doubt.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan's democratic system, people can demand that their head
of state resign by pushing their representatives in the Legislative
Yuan to recall or impeach him, she said, adding that if those two
constitutional methods do not work, then the people should try to
have the "rules of game" amended, rather than taking to the streets
to make their point.</P>
      <P>Lung, a former cultural bureau director in Ma's Taipei City
government, asked the people of Taiwan to think about "the possible
consequences of trying to depose a president through pressure
expressed on the streets."</P>
      <P>Ma, who doubles as mayor of Taipei, said Lung did not rule out
"taking to the streets" as a means of expressing one's views in a
democratic country.</P>
      <P>"Like professor Lee Chia-tung (of National Chi Nan University) ,
she is just worried that street demonstrations might turn violent and
that Taiwan could become a 'mobocracy,'" he added.</P>
      <P>But taking to the streets does not necessarily mean "mobocracy"
will ensue, Ma said. "There is some misunderstanding in this
respect," he added.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that what Lung was trying to drive home in her
article is that in a democracy, there are different options to force
a politician out of office, including street demonstrations and the
ballot box.</P>
      <P>Ma himself has donated NT$100 in support of Shih's campaign in
his capacity as a private citizen. His party has encouraged party
members to join the upcoming mass sit-in organized by Shih and his
supporters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CATHOLIC CARDINAL WILLING TO MEDIATE RULING-OPPOSITION STANDOFF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, Aug. 24 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cardinal Paul Shan Kuo-hsi said Thursday
he would like to act as a go-between if the ruling and opposition
leaders are willing to have a dialogue, hoping that "things can be
worked out peacefully."</P>
      <P>However, the cardinal said he suspects "the two of them" --
referring to President Chen Shui-bian and opposition Kuomintang
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou -- are "mature enough" to have meaningful
dialogue that could bring harmony to Taiwan society.</P>
      <P>Chen and Ma had a rare dialogue in early April without reaching
any major consensus. Since then, the president has been busy with
"damage control" measures to save his political future as one after
another corruption scandal allegations involving his family and close
aides have arisen.</P>
      <P>Shan, who has recently been diagnosed with pulmonary cancer, said
he is worried by a rising tide of radical calls for the president to
step down and for protecting the "president of Taiwan, " after former
Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Shih Ming-teh launched a
campaign to depose Chen.</P>
      <P>Ma has voiced his support for Shih's campaign and encouraged
party members to join his upcoming sit-in protest, and the DPP has
countered with a national campaign to retrieve the KMT's "ill-gotten"
assets, creating more turmoil in an already tense society.</P>
      <P>Shan said he respects his "good friend" Master Hsing Yun, a
Buddhist leader, for issuing a statement calling on the president to
voluntarily step down to prevent possible social unrest and "maintain
his dignity as a decent national leader."</P>
      <P>However, Shan said he would not wade into politics. "Political
matters should be left to political figures, " he said, urging them
to exercise self-restraint and refrain from radicalism and violence
so as not to "blur the focus" and create "ethnic and political
divisions."</P>
      <P>Shan, whose illness is now under control, said he would like to
dedicate the rest of his life to promoting ethnic harmony and
cross-Taiwan Strait peace.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GUAM STOPOVER A NATURAL CHOICE ON PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO S. PACIFIC: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 24 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It would be very natural for President Chen
Shui-bian to plan to stop over in Guam during his upcoming visit to
the South Pacific, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>MOFA deputy spokesman Wang Chien-yeh noted that the U.S.
territory of Guam would be a convenient choice since it is located in
the region and that the United States has made it clear that it will
take into account factors such as safety, comfort, dignity and
convenience in processing any requests from Taiwan for its president
to stop over on U.S. soil.</P>
      <P>Wang declined to comment on whether Chen is planning to travel to
the South Pacific on a military jet, on the grounds that the issue
does not fall under the authority of the ministry.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to depart Sept. 3 for Palau to attend a leader
summit between Taiwan and its diplomatic allies in the South Pacific
before heading on to Nauru for a visit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT URGED TO ATTACH IMPORTANCE TO ORAL HEALTH OF CHILDREN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By LIlian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should attach more
importance to the oral health of school children given the fact that
the average 12-year-old child in Taiwan has more than three cavities,
the Association for Dental Sciences of the Republic of China said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chang Chin-shun, an association adviser on oral health, cited
statistics as showing that the incidence of cavities in Taiwan
children below the age of five is as high as 89.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 12-year-old children in Taiwan have 3.31 cavities on
average, which he said is quite far from the goal set by the World
Health Organization (WHO) of 90 percent of children under five years
old having no cavities and of 12-year-old children having no more
than two cavities by the year 2010.</P>
      <P>Chang urged the government to pay attention to the worsening oral
health of Taiwan children and to pass the budget for a "five-year
project for oral health" speedily.</P>
      <P>In addition to adding fluorine to water, he also urged the use
of more effective fluorine coating on children to prevent cavity.</P>
      <P>He noted that less than 10 percent of the Taiwan people visit the
dentist at least once a year, making the work of promoting oral care
from an early age even more important.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL RESEARCH TEAM DEVELOPS 'VIRTUAL BIOPSY' METHOD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24 (CNA)
(by Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local medical research team announced
Thursday that they have developed a new cancer diagnosis technique
called "virtual biopsy, " which uses femtosecond laser pulses to scan
the human body without the pain and hazards involved in conventional
needle biopsies.</P>
      <P>The newly developed biopsy method can run 100 million scans per
second, as well as generating up to three images every second,
according to the team.</P>
      <P>The immediate next steps of the team are to increase the scanning
frequency and to combine the technique with endoscopes, in order to
obtain biopsy images deep inside the body.</P>
      <P>The team, led by professor Sun Chi-Kuang at National Taiwan
University's (NTU) Electrical Engineering Department, includes
members from Sun's department, NTU's Institute of Molecular and
Cellular Biology, the Center of Nanoscience and Nonotechnology at
National Chung-hsing University, National Taiwan University Hospital,
and the Institute of Molecular Medicine at National Cheng-kung
University.</P>
      <P>The virtual biopsy project is being funded by the National Health
Research Institute, with a total budget of NT$9 million for the
three-year term.</P>
      <P>The new biopsy method utilizes Cr: forsterite laser to generate
scanning beams at a center wavelength of 1230 nanometers and a pulse
frequency of 100 femtoseconds, or one-ten trillionth of a second, Sun
noted, adding that due to the extremely short duration of laser
penetration, the pulse does not damage the tissue being observed.</P>
      <P>Su explained that when passing through larger cells, laser pulses
will turn into red-light; and while passing through smaller ones, the
light expression will be blue-purple. All the light, received by a
collecting device, can later be translated into biopsy images for
diagnosis.</P>
      <P>When it comes to conventional needle biopsies, Su said, the first
problem is that the pain scares patients, adding that the needle
sometimes brings cancer tissue residuals around, "contaminating"
normal cells and thus accelerating metastasis.</P>
      <P>The team has already tested the virtual biopsy method on mice and
zebra fishes, and it has also made observations on zebra fish's cell
nuclei, cell divisions, and blood capillaries, Su said, adding that
all the animals "came out without a scratch."</P>

      <P>Chen Chu, who like Shih was jailed on charges of sedition under
martial law in the 1979 Kaohsiung Incident and who has since become a
close friend of Shih, voiced her opinion on the matter in an open
letter titled "believe in democracy, there is no single hero."</P>
      <P>Chen wrote that she disagrees with Shih's intent to make the
campaign the final battle of his life as if it is a revolution and
that she believes Shih is as pained as she is by the prospect of the
confrontation and hatred expected to be brought about by the
campaign.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although she has never doubted Shih's ideals, she
wants to remind Shih that "there are only people, and no single
hero, " referring to what she called the media's attempts to paint a
heroic image of Shih.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the president was elected by the people through a
democratic process and that if the people want the president to step
down, there are constitutional methods such as initiating a motion to
recall or impeach the president.</P>
      <P>"The Constitution is not designed to protect Chen but instead to
prevent the loser in a democratic election from using various strange
reasons to try to reverse the results," she said.</P>
      <P>No matter how disappointed Shih is in the president and how
corrupt he believes the president to be, he has no right to use his
personal judgment to negate the choice of the people made at the
ballot box in 2004, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen said that despite her disagreement with Shih's advocacy and
conduct, she respects his right to do so and objects to the personal
attacks made on him recently by some DPP members.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that the fact that Shih has successfully raised
NT$100 million in a short period of time for his campaign indicates
that a large segment of the population is angry with the DPP's rule,
and she urged the DPP to tolerate and take this resentment seriously.</P>
      <P>She said the DPP should tolerate the Shih-led sit-in protest for
as long as it lasts and should stop the party's politicians from
leading another group of people to the scene to counter Shih's
action.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the people have the right to express their anger
at the government, Chen called on the DPP to conduct self-examination
sincerely and face the people's anger squarely.</P>
      <P>She urged the DPP to stop its politicians from resorting to "mud
slinging and provocative moves" that might lead to violence so as to
allow the matter conclude peacefully.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, she urged Shih to try to "resolve hatred with
compassion and transcend conflict through democracy."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR SHARES IDEAS ON BUILDING  HEALTHY CITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou shared his ideas
on building a healthy city Thursday with his counterparts from 27
domestic and foreign cities at an international conference held in
Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Ma spoke of his efforts in improving public restroom facilities,
garbage collection and sewage treatment in Taiwan's capital.</P>
      <P>He noted that since he assumed the mayorship in 1998, he has
promoted improvement of the city's public restrooms, saying that over
70 percent of the approximately 10,000 public toilets in Taipei are
labeled excellent in terms of safety and cleanness.</P>
      <P>He also honored restroom cleaners, saying that they should be
respected for their contribution to the city.</P>
      <P>He also noted that Taipei has implemented a garbage separation
and recycling program during his mayorship, pointing out that the
program has led to a significant reduction in the amount of garbage.
He added that Taipei is expected to reach the goal of "zero burial of
garbage and full recycling of all reusable resources" by 2010.</P>
      <P>Ma also spoke of the improvements made in the city's sewage
treatment system and noted that with the assistance of three local
chiefs, the level of pollution in the Keelung River has been reduced
significantly in recent years.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Pete McHugh, a supervisor in the city of Santa Clara,
Calif., also shared his city's experiences in implementing a green
business program. He said that under the program, private companies
with fewer than 300 employers will join the environmental protection
program so as to cut the city government's costs in environmental
protection monitoring.</P>
      <P>Other participants in the conference talked about various issues,
including developing suitable residential cities, creating pride in
one's city, and good city governance.</P>
      <P>The two-day conference ended Thursday evening, with participants
taking a tour to the famous Shihlin night market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER DPP HEAD'S NEPHEW PAYS UNCLE'S NT$2 MILLION DEBT TO PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 24 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A nephew of former Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Chairman Shih Ming-teh paid NT$2 million (US$60,910) to
President Chen Shui-bian Thursday to help his uncle clear his debt
with the head of state, whom Shih has recently been campaigning to
have deposed.</P>
      <P>Shih Chao-lung visited the Presidential Office with a petition
and a check for NT$2 million. A Presidential Office official accepted
the petition but declined to take the check on the grounds that he
does not have the authority to receive checks or cash on behalf of
the president. Shih then went to a nearby post office to send the
check to the president by registered mail.</P>
      <P>Shih said Chen Shui-bian loaned the money to his uncle to pay for
his daughter's medical bills. "Clearing the debt will be good for
both the president and my uncle," he added.</P>
      <P>Shih pointed out that he and his wife lent NT$6 million at zero
interest to the former DPP chairman to buy a house so that he would
not become a "stray dog," as Koo Kuan-min, a former senior advisor to
the president and a staunch advocate of Taiwan independence, referred
to Shih Ming-teh recently.</P>
      <P>The nephew called on Chen's supporters to stop trying to dig up
dirt from his uncle's past, including posing questions about Shih's
ownership of a house in an expensive neighborhood.</P>
      <P>The nephew also called on the DPP to treat Shih's former wife
Chen Li-chu properly, instead of using her to attack Shih for failing
to treat her and their daughters well while he was imprisoned by the
KMT government at the time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOCTORS NOT INDICTED FOR REVEALING TAICHUNG MAYOR'S MEDICAL RECORDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 24 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung prosecutors decided Thursday not
to indict 12 doctors who were sued by the Taichung mayor over alleged
forgery, defamation, leaking of business secrets, and violation of
the election and recall law in May due to lack of evidence.</P>
      <P>Mayor Jason Hu filed a complaint at the Taichung District
Prosecutors' Office in late May against Legislator Lin Chin-hsing and
11 practicing physicians in the central city after they held a joint
news conference a few days prior to the mayoral election Dec. 3,
2005, to unveil Hu's personal medical records in an attempt to thwart
the re-election bid of the popular mayor from the opposition
Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Lin was also a practicing physician at the time.</P>
      <P>Hu, who once suffered a minor stroke, was then dogged by
questions from supporters of Lin Chia-lung, the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's candidate in the mayoral election, about whether
he was healthy enough to serve another four-year term.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor determined that the medical records unveiled at the
news conference were all genuine and were undoubtedly leaked by
Taichung Veterans General Hospital.</P>
      <P>As none of the 12 doctors had ever personally treated Hu and as
no proof could be found demonstrating that any of them had any
connection with doctors or their assistants at the Taichung hospital,
the prosecutor in charge of the case determined that the accused
should not be indicted on the charge of leaking business secrets.</P>
      <P>As to the defamation charge, the prosector said that because the
accused were found having been active in the promotion of a proposed
bill demanding that administrative leaders publicize their health
records as proof of their administrative capability during the
election campaign last year, it is too difficult to determine whether
their act of revealing Hu's "weak" health condition was aimed at
defaming the popular mayor's name or exposing Hu's "personal
secrets."</P>

      <P>The Presidential Office rebutted Thursday a
cable TV report that the office is prepared to use tanks to crack
down on demonstrators who cross the red lines marked on a road
designed to keep them away from the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office officials discounted as "unfactual and

turn a peaceful sit-in into a mob riot and cross the red lines on

said that Taiwan is a country which upholds the rule of law and that
the Presidential Office fully respects the people's right to

not tolerate any actions aimed at inciting violence.</P>
      <P>Former Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Shih Ming-teh and

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 24 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) unveiled
Thursday a plan aimed at helping school dropouts return to school.</P>
      <P>While the ministry will keep tabs on any schools with more than
15 dropouts and schools with relatively high dropout rates, education
authorities in various counties and cities should prepare charts
comparing the number and ratio of dropouts every month and provide
guidance to the concerned schools whenever necessary, according to
the plan.</P>
      <P>Also, schools should pay extra attention to students who are
absent from school for more than seven days.</P>
      <P>The plan was announced during a meeting of chiefs of education
bureaus held in the southern county of Pingtung.</P>
      <P>MOE tallies show that a total of 7,448 students dropped out of
school during the 2005-2006 academic year.</P>
      <P>As of the end of June this year, 5,491 dropouts had returned to
school, or 73.72 percent of the total number of dropouts.</P>
      <P>While the number of dropouts stood at 4,156 as of the end of July
2005, the number had decreased to 2,981 as of the end of July this
year.</P>
      <P>MOE officials said there are 10 schools with a high number or
ratio of dropouts, with four in Taipei County, three in Taoyuan
County, two in Kaohsiung County and one in Keelung City.</P>
      <P>Common reasons cited for students dropping out of school include
family problems, such as parents going into hiding from their
creditors and single parenthood, as well as personal problems, such
as unhealthy living habits and addiction to hanging out at Internet
cafes, the officials said.</P>

      <P>Judicial Yuan President Weng Yueh-sheng paid
a visit to Taiwan's outlying island of Matsu Thursday to inspect
judicial services that the central government provides to the people
living on the island situated off the coast of China's Fujian
Province.</P>
      <P>After inspecting the Lienchiang District Court on Matsu, Weng,

working on Matsu even though the Lienchiang District Court is the
smallest court in the country with the smallest workforce.</P>
      <P>Weng said he was relieved to see that the Lienchiang District
Court -- which was established in December 2003 under Weng's espousal

Matsu residents, who currently include some 6,000 military personnel
and around 5,000 civilians.</P>
      <P>Weng said he was equally impressed by the environment around

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT SHOULD STEP DOWN: BUDDHIST MASTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An influential Buddhist master urged
embattled President Chen Shui-bian Thursday to heed "the will of the
people" and step down.</P>
      <P>Master Hsing Yun, founder of the Fo Guang Shan International
Buddhist Order, which is headquartered in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan
and supports temples worldwide, made the remarks to elaborate on why
he wrote a letter published prominently in a major local daily that
day.</P>
      <P>The respected monk called for the voluntary resignation of the
president, who is facing an imminent sit-in protest launched
by Shih Ming-teh, a former chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, to pressure his resignation over a string of
corruption and embezzlement allegations against himself, his family
members and senior aides.</P>
      <P>The master said in the letter that both Chen and Shih have had
the experiences of rising up on the stage and stepping down and
should not "take the matter so seriously."</P>
      <P>Hsing Yun said he sent the letter "out of respect for the
president, " adding that he could not bear to read any more news
against him. Chen has visited the Fo Kuang Shan temple and is like a
friend, said Hsing Yun.</P>
      <P>Chen is a civil servant and has served more than six years as
president. When it's time to go, he should not hang onto his post,
the master continued. In fact, Chen's second and last term will
expire in May 2008.</P>
      <P>With mounting public outcry for the president's resignation, if
"he can go resolutely now, it will not only be a plus to the DPP, but
will keep his own dignity," according to Hsing Yun. </P>
      <P>He also lauded Shih, saying that he deserves respect in that he
bears no grudges against anyone despite spending a quarter of a
century behind the bars for his political ideals.</P>
      <P>Although the political ideals of Shih are different from those of
Chen, the unrelenting assault against Shih recently by some DPP
politicians is no good for the party or for Chen and will only
further alienate the people, according to the Buddhist master.</P>
      <P>Hsing Yun is one of the few religious leaders to have expressed a
stance on the current political storm.</P>
      <P>Rev. Kao Chun-ming of the Presbyterian Church said he will
remain neutral but he believes Chen should serve out his term.</P>
      <P>Cardinal Paul Shan Kuo-hsi said Thursday he would like to act as
a go-between if the ruling and opposition leaders are willing to have
a dialogue, hoping that "things can be worked out peacefully, " while
Master Sheng Yen of the Dharma Drum Mountain and Master Cheng Yen of
the Buddhist Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi Foundation refused to

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
accused the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration
Thursday of ignoring the needs of Taiwan's economy after the
Executive Yuan made public the 2007 expenditure budget for the
central government a day earlier.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whip Tsai Chin-lung made the comment while
answering questions from reporters on the issue.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan approved Wednesday the central government's
expenditure and income budget plans of NT$1.66 trillion and NT$1.51
trillion, up by 5.9 percent and 9.2 percent, respectively, year on
year. Budgets for the Ministry of National Defense totaled NT$323.5
billion, an annual increase of 28.1 percent, or about NT$71 billion.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the large growth in budget allocations for
military purposes reflects a lack of concern by the DPP government
for the people's livelihoods.</P>
      <P>Criticizing the government's increased military spending budgets
as turning a deaf ear to the people's call for a better economy, Tsai
urged Premier Su Tseng-chang to pay heed to the public's complaints
about rising product prices and stagnant salaries.</P>
      <P>"The people want a better economy, not an overemphasis on the
military, " he said, adding that the KMT will definitely scrutinize
the government's budget bills in the next legislative session which
will open in mid-September.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 24 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu should distance
herself from scandal-ridden President Chen Shui-bian and be prepared
to take over as president if the "1 million people to depose the
president" campaign succeeds, a former chairman of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference of the Democratic Action Alliance,
Hsu Hsin-liang, who co-founded the DPP in 1986 and served as its
chairman twice from 1991 to 1993 and 1996 to 1998, suggested that Lu
should sever connections with the president bravely.</P>
      <P>"A vice president is not just an assistant to the president but
also a president-in-waiting," Hsu said, adding that Lu's opportunity
is here after serving as vice president for six years.</P>
      <P>Hsu also urged main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou to join the campaign to depose Chen launched by another DPP
chairman, Shih Ming-teh, who has vowed to stage a round-the-clock
sit-in in front of the Presidential Office until Chen agrees to step
down.</P>
      <P>"The campaign is the people's movement against government
corruption and has nothing to do with confrontation between political
parties. KMT leaders and their supporters should not stand aloof from
this campaign," Hsu added.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that holding protest demonstrations to pressure
the president to step down is a right granted by the Constitution.</P>
      <P>"The campaign to depose Chen has become necessary because the
built-in mechanism in the Constitution is not sufficient to make a
corrupt president relinquish his post," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen is facing a grave political crisis because he himself, his
family members and senior aides have been implicated in more than 30
corruption and embezzlement scandals, some of which are being
investigated by public prosecutors.</P>
      <P>The campaign to depose Chen has received more than NT$108 million
(US$3.3 million) from some 1 million people who each donated NT$100.
The sit-in is expected to begin at some point in September.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If the ongoing "1 million people to depose
President Chen Shui-bian" campaign continues to expand, it will have
a great impact on social stability and will affect private investment
in the country, researchers of the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research (TIER) predicted Thursday.</P>
      <P>They further speculated that Taiwan's economic growth in 2006
could further drop from the 4.03 percent of the previous year due to
the anti-Chen campaign and a planned round-the-clock sit-in initiated
by Shih Ming-teh, a former chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, in an attempt to get Chen to resign.</P>
      <P>The researchers claimed that the assessment was conducted "purely
out of economic concerns, " noting that the stock market in Taipei
had dropped over the past few days.</P>
      <P>They said that if the political turmoil resulting from the
public's disappointment over Chen's leadership cannot be settled
quickly, Taiwan could be faced with a downgraded national rating by
independent international rating institutions.</P>
      <P>To an international investor, the political stability of a
country is the first and foremost concern in deciding whether or not
to invest in that country, the economists said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A campaign to force embattled President
Chen Shui-bian to resign will end its donation drive and move to the
next stage -- preparation for a sit-in protest, a spokeswoman for the
campaign said Thursday.</P>
      <P>He Teh-feng made the remarks at a news conference as she
announced that the two bank accounts and one post office account
opened to accept donations for the "1 million people to depose the
president" would close at midnight Thursday.</P>
      <P>Former Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Shih Ming-teh, who
served as party chairman from 1994-1996 before leaving the party in
2000, called for members of the public to donate NT$100 (US$3) each
to support his cause. When the donation reached NT$100 million mark,
it would be time to stage a sit-in protest in front of the
Presidential Office to pressure Chen to resign over a series of
corruption and embezzlement allegations implicating himself, his
family members and senior aides, according to Shih. </P>
      <P>Noting that the donation passed the NT$100 million mark Tuesday,
she said that to avoid diminishing the momentum that has been
building up, Shih, after consulting with campaign officials, decided
to close the three accounts to focus on the preparation for the
sit-in, although anyone wanting to send money can still transfer the
money through ATMs, she said.</P>
      <P>She also said that as of Thursday, the accumulated donations had
come to NT$109,180,809.</P>
      <P>She said the sit-in will probably start Sept. 1 or Sept. 2, prior
to Chen's scheduled departure for an official visit to Palau Sept. 3,
or Sept. 8 and Sept. 9, after his return from the visit.</P>
      <P>Lawyer Wei Chien-feng, a long-term supporter of the president
before joining the campaign, also addressed a call by Rev. Kao
Chun-ming of the Presbyterian Church for Shih to stop his campaign.</P>
      <P>Wei pointed out that the campaign was not launched by Shih, but
was proposed by academics and civic groups irrespective of their
political stripes, and that Shih only is one of many who promote the
campaign.</P>
      <P>On Kao's questioning of Shih's moral standards, Wei also said
that this has "blurred the line between the public and private
domains, " claiming that the campaign has "nothing to do" with the
follow-up action by the opposition parties after they failed to
recall the president in late June.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CARREFOUR BECOMES TAIWAN'S NO. 1 HYPERMART AFTER ACQUIRING TESCO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The French retail group Carrefour SA became
Taiwan's largest discount hypermart Thursday with 44 outlets after
taking over British Tesco Plc's business operations in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Carrefour Taiwan General Manager Loic Dubois announced at a
Carrefour outlet in Taoyuan the merger of all Tesco's six outlets in
Taiwan into Carrefour Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Tesco, the world's third- largest retailer,
withdrew completely from the Taiwan market Thursday after swapping
its Taiwan operations with 15 outlets that Carrefour has until now
operated in Czech Republic and Slovakia.</P>
      <P>Talks about the Carrefour-Tesco swap deal began late last year
and the swap started to take place in March this year after Carrefour
SA -- the largest retailer in Europe and second-largest in the world
-- and Tesco were given the green light by the authorities from the
Czech Republic, Slovakia and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's business giant, Unipresident Enterprises Corp., is a
major partner of Carrefour Taiwan, holding about 30 percent of the
stakes of the Taiwan operations of Carrefour.</P>
      <P>Allan Tien, chief of Carrefour Taiwan's Development Division,
said currently there are 102 hypermart outlets operating around
Taiwan with annual transactions totaling some NT$110 billion (US$3.35
billion). This retailer business, he said, is expected to double to
some NT$240 billion in years to come.</P>

group director Chung Nian-huang, an ex-reporter with a 15-year

In New Method for Stem Cells, Viable Embryos

Biologists have developed a technique for
establishing colonies of human embryonic stem
cells from an early human embryo without
destroying it. This method, if confirmed in
other laboratories, would seem to remove the
principal objection to the research.

It could also redirect and intensify the
emotional political debate over current limits
on federal financing for research on human
embryonic stem cells, which give rise to the
cells and tissues of the body and which
scientists and patient advocate groups see
as a potential source for treatments for
diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's

Wall Street Journal:China's Big Push
To Stoke Economy Rattles Rural Tibet

China is trying to revive poor rural
regions through economic development. In
Tibet, the plan has hit a snag: Ni Ma won't
slaughter his yaks.

Duan Xiangzheng, a Chinese Communist
Party official charged with stimulating the
economy here, is pushing for the systematic
slaughtering of yaks to kick-start a meat-
packing industry. Mr. Duan says exporting
the beefy tasting meat and the animals'
black wool to markets elsewhere in China
makes economic sense and is an "inevitable"

    <HEADLINE>KMT SINCERE ON PARTY ASSETS ISSUE:  CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is
sincere in honoring its promise to return its improperly acquired
assets, and its report on the issue does not mean to target anyone,
KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou claimed Thursday.</P>
      <P>The KMT report on its assets and liabilities made public a day
earlier is not aimed at holding anyone accountable, rather it is a
sincere apology to the public, Ma said, adding that the KMT is
willing to return its ill- gotten assets to the public or the
government.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT report, the KMT recorded a loss of NT$42.7
billion due to 28 money-losing investment cases -- all made during
the 1988-2000 period when former President Lee Teng-hui also served
as head of the party.</P>
      <P>The KMT hopes that the report will verify "historical facts"
regarding the issue and that some of the party's properties, although
acquired through legal means in the past, are also available for
public scrutiny, Ma said, pointing out that he himself also has to be
examined by the public.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Huang Yu-chen told a news conference at the party's
headquarters later in the day that an 11-member panel has been set up
to take charge of responding to comments on the party's assets on
behalf of the party.</P>
      <P>In the future, no other individuals or KMT members are entitled
to make comments on the issue on behalf of the party, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
questioned the motive behind Ma's move in publishing the report.</P>
      <P>TSU legislative caucus whip David Huang described Ma's move as an
attempt to pave the way for his participation in the 2008
presidential election "in the name of reform."</P>
      <P>"Ma not only has failed to return the KMT's illegally acquired
assets to the people, but he is also trying to forge a clean and
reform-minded image prior to the 2008 presidential election, " Huang
said.</P>
      <P>The TSU will continue promoting various "sunshine laws" to demand
that the KMT return all its assets unlawfully obtained during its
authoritarian rule of Taiwan to the people, he said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China's military threat to Taiwan is
serious and if the current situation persists, there are only two
feasible cross-Taiwan Strait scenarios in the future -- the fall of
Taiwan or an armed conflict -- a Japanese professor warned at an
international seminar Thursday.</P>
      <P>For all China has done, a reasonable prediction would be "if
Taiwan does not accept unification on China's terms, China will unify
Taiwan by force in 10-15 years, regardless of Taiwan's government
policy, " said Masako Ikegami, director of the Center for Asia
Pacific Studies at Stockholm University in Sweden.</P>
      <P>Ikegami made the prediction in a lecture titled "Anatomy of
Peaceful Rise: Driving Forces Behind China's Grand Strategy" at the
two-day seminar on the rise of China and Beijing's strategies and
implications for the Asia Pacific, which was organized by Academia
Sinica -- Taiwan's top research institute.</P>
      <P>China wants to be recognized as a world-class power, said
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu in his opening remark,
adding that this is why China "wants some international problems to
be there so that it can play a role in international relations. " Wu
was referring to the Iranian and North Korean issues.</P>
      <P>"We need to encourage China to be more aggressive in living up to
the expectations and responsibilities as a superpower, " Wu said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on China's military threat to Taiwan, Wu said the
priority would be to increase Taiwan's military budget and shore up a
defensive capability to "show China that it can't take Taiwan
quickly."</P>
      <P>On the diplomatic front, there are only 24 allies left for Taiwan
now, he said, which means that working with Australia and Japan is
vital in order to maintain peace and stability in the Asian Pacific
region.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, co-existence with China in a peaceful way is
"a long-term goal for Taiwan, " adding that if China becomes more
democratic, it will be more attractive for Taiwanese people to think
about political or economic integration in the future."</P>
      <P>The seminar will conclude Friday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The newly launched Action Alliance to
Promote Character Education formed by 10 educational organizations
and foundations criticized Taiwan's politicians Thursday for setting
bad examples to the younger generation.</P>
      <P>The domestic political environment has rapidly depraved the
character of Taiwan people, whose moral standards have dropped far
lower than six years ago when the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) was still not in power, executives of the alliance claimed.</P>
      <P>Quoting statistics from a recent survey carried out by the
alliance, they said 73 percent of the respondents agreed that the
character of Taiwan people has been deteriorating over the past six
years, with another 90 percent believing that the conduct of
politicians has a big influence on social mores.</P>
      <P>They blamed this phenomenon of moral regression mainly to the
behavior of politicians whose vulgar language and bad manners offer
"the worst examples" for children in their formative years.</P>
      <P>More recently, the situation was made even worse because of the
series of corruption scandals involving President Chen Shui-bian, his
family members and senior aides.</P>
      <P>They said bluntly that something was "definitely wrong" with the
character education in the first family, and urged that character
education should be a priority in all levels of schools, as well as
in society.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan should begin an immediate overall review of the moral
crisis it is in," the alliance officials said, adding that a
mechanism should be established to strictly monitor cronyism of
politicians.</P>
      <P>The 10 educational organizations and foundations that initiated
the alliance include the Thousand Generation Cultural and Educational
Foundation, Shih Chien University, and Wei Chuan Cultural and

"Depose Chen" after Chen delivered a speech at a ceremony marking the
presentation of awards to top quality products and their producers.</P>
      <P>Ting was immediately subdued by security guards.</P>
      <P>Responding to Ting's behavior, the United Daily News authorities
issued a statement later in the day saying that Ting had severely
violated the principle of journalism and broken the work ethics as a

      <P>In response to a government plan to impose
a visitor quota control to conserve the natural environment of Green
Island off southeastern Taitung County, a group of island residents
expressed opposition Thursday to the idea, claiming that it will not
help improve their livelihoods.</P>
      <P>The residents voiced their disagreement to the plan in a township
meeting after it was reported that the Executive Yuan is considering
whether to limit the number of visitors to the tiny island to under
4,000 per day and that it is also projecting to make the island a
national park to better conserve it.</P>
      <P>Claiming that a quota control will not help effectively resolve
its deteriorating environment, they suggested that the government
consult with local residents -- mainly fishermen and tourism-related
businesses -- to work out complementary measures.</P>
      <P>If tourism controls is imposed on Green Island without advance
auxiliary measures to help local residents, their livelihoods will be
adversely affected, the Green Island township representatives said.</P>
      <P>In addition, they went on, some tourist agency operators have
begun considering to give up organizing tours to the island -- a
development that will lead to losses in other sectors, including
hoteliers and restaurant owners.</P>
      <P>According to the township representatives, it is much more
important to upgrade the quality of travel to Green Island and
to "simultaneously protect local environments with eco-friendly
measures."</P>
      <P>Imposing a quota control on visitor numbers alone will not
resolve the many problems facing the islands, such as overfishing and
backward tourist and fishing facilities.</P>
      <P>What the government should do is help Green Island go
international and make it into a world-class eco-friendly resort
island, they said.</P>
      <P>Until recently a quiet backwater where unregulated tourism has

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKER ASHAMED OF DPP'S INACTION AGAINST ATTACK ON EX-CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An outspoken ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) lawmaker said Thursday he feels utterly ashamed of his
party's connivance over certain party members' scathing attack on a
former party chairman.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Wen-chung made the remarks after some DPP
politicians have continuously castigated former DPP Chairman Shih
Ming-teh over the past few days in retaliation for Shih's launch of a
"1 million people campaign" to depose President Chen Shui-bian over a
string of corruption allegations against himself, members of his
family and staff.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, two of his colleagues even accompanied Shih's
divorced wife Chen Li-chu in unveiling a letter allegedly dictated by
Shih to seek leniency from the authoritarian Kuomintang (KMT)
authorities when he was kept behind bars for his pro-democracy and
pro-independence advocacy.</P>
      <P>Lee said he felt "outrageously embarrassed" by his DPP
colleagues' move and guilty about the DPP headquarters' failure to
stop all the tit-for-tat defamation of Shih, who is described by some
as "Taiwan's Mandela" as he was incarcerated for 25 years as a
prisoner of conscience during Taiwan's infamous martial-law era.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that Shih should be subject to public examination
since he has long been a political figure, Lee said such scrutiny
should be confined to matters related to public interests and
political ethics. The recent attacks on Shih by some DPP politicians
have gone beyond acceptable boundaries and have infringed upon Shih's
privacy, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee said the DPP used to be suppressed and demonized in mass
movements in its long process of fighting against authoritarian rule.
Once in power, he said, the DPP should be magnanimous enough to
tolerate people's right to stage street rallies and demonstrations
against the government.</P>
      <P>The DPP should also not ignore the public discontent and
grivances accumulated over the past six years since its ascent to
power, Lee said, adding that Shih is just a catalytic figure for the
unfolding anti-Chen campaign.</P>
      <P>Lee said he feels those DPP politicians who have exploited Shih's
behavior during the notorious martial-law era to attack him are as
cruel as the former KMT rulers who demonized Shih as a "seditious
devil."</P>
      <P>He further said entire society and the media should also conduct
self-reflection.</P>
      <P>"When society and the media questioned some radicals' defamation
against Shih, they should also think about that over the past six
years, they have acquiesced numerous unfounded accusations against
President Chen that have almost 'destroyed' his character and tainted
his images," Lee said.</P>
      <P>For instance, he said society and the media have never questioned
the style of KMT Legislator Chiu Yi's constant sensational
accusations against the president and the first family.</P>
      <P>While he personally opposes any retaliatory action, Lee said he
still feels that the outrageous "smearing Shih" actions taken b y
some DPP radicals and pro-independence die-hards are related with the
society's and the media's long silence over Chiu's 
frequent indecent acts.</P>

(DPP) has decided to cancel some of the party's planned public
rallies slated for September in Taipei due to an expanding campaign
aimed at pushing President Chen Shui-bian to resign, a DPP official
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Deputy DPP Secretary-General Tsai Huang-liang explained that the
canceled activities were organized as celebrations for the DPP's 20th
founding anniversary and that the party had planned to take advantage
of the events to campaign for its candidates in the year-end Taipei
and Kaohsiung mayor elections.</P>
      <P>Despite the cancellation of the activities after thousands of
people expressed support to the "1 million people to depose President
Chen" initiated by former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh Aug. 12, Tsai
said the DPP will still invite all party founders to a party planned
for Aug. 28 at Taipei's Grand Hotel, where the DPP was established in
1986.</P>
      <P>The founders include President Chen, Premier Su Tseng-chang,
former Premier Frank Hsieh, incumbent DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun,
Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chang Chun-hsiung and National
Security Council Secretary-General Chiu Yi-jen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EX-LAWMAKER'S VIOLENT ACT ON TV SPURS CONDEMNATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24 (CNA)
(By sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Legislator Lin Cheng-chieh became
the focus of an overwhelming outcry after he assaulted a political
commentator with punch and kicks in a television program Thursday
night.</P>
      <P>Lin, an outspoken critic of President Chen Shui-bian, beat Chin
Heng-wei, the editor-in-chief of Contemporary Monthly Magazine, in a
Formosa TV (FTV) talk show emceed by Hu Wan-ling.</P>
      <P>Chin, a longtime supporter of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) , sustained injuries to his nose, forehead and leg. He
reported the case to police after receiving emergency treatment at a
hospital.</P>
      <P>Chin was also once attacked by a China-born veteran for his
support for the pro-independence DPP. Chin, whose parents also came
to Taiwan from China after the Chinese communists took over the
mainland, said he forgave that elderly soldier. But he said he cannot
forgive Lin and will definitely bring him to justice.</P>
      <P>The TV program continued after a brief interruption. Lin
apoligized to the emcee, FTV and its audience, but he showed no sign
of repentance in his hatred of Chin.</P>
      <P>His act of gratuitous violence in brute display shocked society
and immediately spurred vehement condemnation from various social
quarters.</P>
      <P>FTV authorities said their program offers a platform for people
of different political affiliations to air their views, but they
added they cannot tolerate any act of violence.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun paid a visit to Chin to extend his
regards. Yu denounced Lin's violent act and urged Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou to maintain law and order in the city so that everybody can
freely express their opinions without fears.</P>
      <P>Yu also urged all DPP members and supporters to remain calm and
refrain from taking any retaliatory actions to add up to social
unrest ahead of an unprecedented round-the-clock sit-in street
demonstration to force Chen to resign.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Society, a group founded by liberal scholars to
monitor parliamentary and government operations, issued a press
statement condemning Lin's act of violence before TV audience.</P>
      <P>"It seems to us that the brute display of violence symbolizes a
death knell for Taiwan's fledgling democracy, " the statement
lamented, adding that the group frets whether the shocking incident
would herald the start of a bloody conflict stoked by a long-running
feud between the country's two major political camps or even the
start of a "revolution" advocated by some media personalities.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, the statement went on, Lin and an
underworld gang leader have organized a team of bodyguards to protect
former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh, who is leading the "1 million
people to depose Chen" campaign.</P>
      <P>"If the reports are ture, we are worried about the possibility of
the imminent massive sit-in going out of control and leading to
violent confrontation with radical DPP supporters, " the statement
said, adding that law enforcement authorities should investigate the
case and exercise public authority in order to protect personal
safety.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the headquarters of the Shih-led "1 million people"
campaign was quick to distance itself from Lin, stressing that Lin is
not a staff member of the campaign headquarters.</P>
      <P>He Teh-fen, spokeswoman for the Shih-led campaign, said Lin's act
of violence has nothing to do with the campaign.</P>
      <P>"We condemn any act of violence. Any individual intending to take
part in the sit-in protest must abide by our rules and discipline. We
have stepped up peronnel training to maintain order and discipline at
the sit-in site after the protest begins early next month," He said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP URGED TO RESPOND TO ANTI-CHEN CAMPAIGN IN STYLE</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) should respond to former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh's "depose
President Chen Shui-bian" campaign with democratic decency and depth
of historical insight, an academic said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu Nai-teh, a researcher with Academia Sinica -- Taiwan's top
academic institution -- made the call in an open letter issued after
some radical DPP politicians have scathingly attacked Shih for
several days in retaliation for his initiation of the "1 million
people to depose Chen" camapign.</P>
      <P>Shih is described by some as "Taiwan's Mandela" as he was
incarcerated for 25 years as a prisoner of conscience during Taiwan's
infamous martial-law era for his pro-independence and pro-democracy
advocacy.</P>
      <P>Wu said Taiwan's democracy was jointly created by many "ordinary
people" like Shih.</P>
      <P>"In a difficult time of fighting social injustice and government
brutality, many ordinary people have made an extraordinary moral
choice. Even some of them might show occasional weakness, they
deserve our respect as they have contributed to the process of our
country's democratization, " Wu said in his open letter.</P>
      <P>Wu was referring to the exposure Thursday by two radical DPP
lawmakers of a letter allegedly dictated by Shih during his days
behind bars in the 1960s seeking leniency from then-authoritarian
Kuomintang government.</P>
      <P>"The DPP lawmakers' attempt to destroy Shih's heroic image by
exposing the letter, they have not only negated the DPP's previous
fight against the authoritarian regime but have also demolished
important values of Taiwan's democracy," Wu lamented.</P>
      <P>Wu, who himself joined a group of pro-DPP scholars and social
activists in issuing an open letter July 15 urging Chen to resign,
urged the DPP to be more broad-minded and far-sighted in dealing with
the unfolding Shih-led campaign to pressure the president to step
down.</P>

      <P>Kuomintang Legislator Ting Shou-chung, who serves on the

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKER ASHAMED OF DPP'S INACTION AGAINST ATTACK ON EX-CHAIRMAN(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An outspoken ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) lawmaker said Thursday he feels utterly ashamed of his
party's connivance over certain party members' scathing attack on a
former party chairman.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Wen-chung made the remarks after some DPP
politicians have continuously castigated former DPP Chairman Shih
Ming-teh over the past few days in retaliation for Shih's launch of a
"1 million people campaign" to depose President Chen Shui-bian over a
string of corruption allegations against himself, members of his
family and staff.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, two of his colleagues even accompanied Shih's
divorced wife Chen Li-chu in unveiling a letter allegedly dictated by
Shih to seek leniency from the authoritarian Kuomintang (KMT)
authorities when he was kept behind bars for his pro-democracy and
pro-independence advocacy.</P>
      <P>Lee said he felt "outrageously embarrassed" by his DPP
colleagues' move and guilty about the DPP headquarters' failure to
stop all the tit-for-tat defamation of Shih, who is described by some
as "Taiwan's Mandela" as he was incarcerated for 25 years as a
prisoner of conscience during Taiwan's infamous martial-law era.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that Shih should be subject to public examination
since he has long been a political figure, Lee said such scrutiny
should be confined to matters related to public interests and
political ethics. The recent attacks on Shih by some DPP politicians
have gone beyond acceptable boundaries and have infringed upon Shih's
privacy, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee said the DPP used to be suppressed and demonized in mass
movements in its long process of fighting against authoritarian rule.
Once in power, he said, the DPP should be magnanimous enough to
tolerate people's right to stage street rallies and demonstrations
against the government.</P>
      <P>The DPP should also not ignore the public discontent and
grivances accumulated over the past six years since its ascent to
power, Lee said, adding that Shih is just a catalytic figure for the
unfolding anti-Chen campaign.</P>
      <P>Lee said he feels those DPP politicians who have exploited Shih's
behavior during the notorious martial-law era to attack him are as
cruel as the former KMT rulers who demonized Shih as a "seditious
devil."</P>
      <P>He further said entire society and the media should also conduct
self-reflection.</P>
      <P>"When society and the media questioned some radicals' defamation
against Shih, they should also think about that over the past six
years, they have acquiesced numerous unfounded accusations against
President Chen that have almost 'destroyed' his character and tainted
his images," Lee said.</P>
      <P>For instance, he said society and the media have never questioned
the style of KMT Legislator Chiu Yi's constant sensational
accusations against the president and the first family.</P>
      <P>While he personally opposes any retaliatory action, Lee said he
still feels that the outrageous "smearing Shih" actions taken b y
some DPP radicals and pro-independence die-hards are related with the
society's and the media's long silence over Chiu's 
frequent indecent acts.</P>

to shut up" when he was asked to comment on U.S. concerns about
China's military buildup during a BBC radio interview.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said Sha's remarks demonstrate Beijing's arrogance with its
newly gained clout in the international arena as China has subtly
translated its economic prowess into political and military might.</P>
      <P>Hsieh noted that China's 2.3 million People's Liberation Army
troops could be devastating to regional peace in East Asia, which is
facing other security concerns such as North Korea's nuclear program.</P>
      <P>He noted that the fact that the military balance in the Taiwan
Strait has tilted in China's favor can no longer be avoided.</P>
      <P>"A militarily strong China threatens the delicate balance that

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT TO VISIT PALAU, NAURU IN EARLY SEPTEMBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will depart Sept.
3 for an official visit to Palau and Nauru, two diplomatic allies of
the Republic of China in the South Pacific, Liu Shih-fang, deputy
secretary-general of the Presidential Office, announced Friday.</P>
      <P>Liu said the president's visit to Palau will mainly be to attend
a leader summit between Taiwan and its allies in the South Pacific
Sept. 4 with the aim of cementing relations with the allies.</P>
      <P>Liu said the themes of the summit will include medical care,
alternative energy resources, agricultural and fishery cooperation,
digital government, economic partnership, tourism, and Austronesian
culture exchanges.</P>
      <P>The president will sign a declaration with the six heads of state
at the conclusion of the summit, Liu said.</P>
      <P>The president will then proceed to Nauru Sept. 5 for his first
visit to the country since assuming the presidency in 2000.</P>
      <P>While there, the president will deliver a speech at the Nauru
parliament, visit a Taiwan product exhibition as well as attend an
inauguration ceremony for an air carrier before returning to Taiwan
Sept. 6.</P>
      <P>On whether the president has shortened the overseas trip because
of turmoil at home, Liu said the original plan is being followed. The
president is facing an imminent mass sit-in protest being organized
by Shih Ming-teh, a former chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, to pressure him to resign over a string of
corruption and embezzlement allegations against himself, his family
members and senior aides.</P>
      <P>On whether the president will stop over in Guam or any other
countries, Liu said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is still
working out the matter and that it will make an announcement next
week.</P>
      <P>A MOFA official said Thursday that it would be very natural for
President Chen to plan to stop over in Guam during his upcoming visit
to the South Pacific.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) will launch
a program to encourage students to ride bicycles to school to
increase the amount of their exercise, a ministry official said
Friday.</P>
      <P>The program was put forth during a meeting of chiefs of education

      <P>Ho Cho-fei, director-general of the MOE's Department of Physical

bicycle instead of driving a car can help reduce energy consumption
and pollution and thus help slow down global warming and improve the
environment.</P>
      <P>Ho said that through the program, the MOE hopes that all
elementary school students in the country will learn to ride a
bicycle and ride to school.</P>
      <P>After school reopens in September, the MOE will survey how many

    <HEADLINE>NEW GROUP TO BE SET UP TO ACCELERATE CROSS-STRAIT TOURISM EXCHANGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A new group is set to be established
shortly to serve as a counterpart agency to a Chinese organization to
jointly accelerate tourism exchanges across the Taiwan Strait,
Taiwan's top official in charge of China policy said Friday.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that the new group -- expected to be named the Taiwan
Strait Tourism Association (TSTA) -- will immediately serve as a lift
to expedite the opening of Taiwan to all Chinese citizens for
tourism, said Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu at a
news conference.</P>
      <P>It is also hoped that cross-strait negotiations on the issue
regarding Chinese citizens coming to Taiwan for tourism can be
started under the "Macau formula" soon after the TSTA's
establishment, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu note that Hsu Wen-sheng, director general of the Tourism
Bureau under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, will
serve as chairman of the TSTA, which is scheduled to be formally
established Aug. 27.</P>
      <P>The TSTA will serve as a counterpart agency to China's Cross
Strait Tourism Exchange Association (CSTEA) established only this
month by the National Tourism Administration of China, Wu noted.</P>
      <P>The non-profit TSTA will have an organizational structure and
personnel representation similar to those of the CSTEA, Wu added.</P>
      <P>Hsu Wen-sheng, who was also present at the news conference, said
the TSTA will have a nine-member to 11-member board of directors that
will include officials from the Tourism Bureau, the Immigration
Office and the Taiwan Visitors Association, as well as leaders of
travel agency associations.</P>
      <P>Wu said the Republic of China Travel Business Association --
which was established in July last year to serve as a window of
contact with China -- has completed its "segmental missions, " and
the issues that should be discussed in cross-strait tourism
negotiations involve many other important matters including air and
sea transportation, border management, and public order, making it
imperative for the government to establish the TSTA.</P>
      <P>Besides, Wu added, one of the many conclusions reached at the
government-sponsored Conference on Sustaining Taiwan's Economic
Development held last month was that Taiwan should open its doors
completely to Chinese tourists.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DDP CALLS FOR HALT TO PLANNED ANTI-PRESIDENT SIT-IN AFTER TV VIOLENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 25 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
lawmakers urged the party's former chairman Shih Ming-teh Friday to
halt his plan to stage a sit-in aimed at forcing President Chen
Shui-bian to step down.</P>
      <P>The call came after a violent incident the previous evening on a
live TV talk show in which former DPP Legislator Lin Cheng-chieh
punched and kicked pro-DPP commentator Chin Heng-wei, giving him a
bloody nose.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Wang Shih-chien warned that Shih should be held
responsible for the incident and stop his campaign to depose the
president since Lin was a "core member of the campaign headquarters."</P>
      <P>Chin himself said Lin's violence could be blamed on Shih and
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who is also mayor
of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Ho De-fen, spokeswoman for Shih's "one million people to depose
President Chen Shui-bian" campaign, stressed that Lin is not a staff
member of the campaign headquarters.</P>
      <P>"We condemn any act of violence. Any individual intending to take
part in the sit-in protest must abide by our rules and discipline, "
she added.</P>
      <P>Kao Chih-peng, a DPP legislator, said the physical attack during
the talk show is a "major incident" that will not only affect the
perpetrator but also worsen Taiwan's political divisions marked by
the standoff between the "pan-green camp" and the "pan-blue
alliance."</P>
      <P>Pro-independence supporters in Taiwan will soon unite and prepare
to fight back as they will not tolerate being bullied or abused, Kao
said.</P>
      <P>Cheng Yun-peng, another DPP lawmaker, urged the Shih campaign to
"restrain" a violent man like Lin Cheng-chieh. Cheng said he can no
longer remain confident that the campaign will be able to
"effectively control" the sit-in crowd for long.</P>
      <P>In spite of the campaign's denial of any link with Lin, Hsieh
Hsin-ni, a DPP legislator, still accused Lin of being "one of the key
organizers" of the Shih campaign.</P>
      <P>"If they can't stop him from resorting to violence on a televised
TV show, then how can they guarantee there will be no violence during
the sit-in?" she asked.</P>
      <P>"Since Taiwan cannot afford to witness any bloodshed over a
political campaign, the sit-in should be canceled," she added.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, worried that the anti-president
campaign has induced violence and social division, also urged Shih to
stop his campaign. Yu also called on Ma to reconsider his permission
for an overnight sit-in.</P>
      <P>The sit-in "definitely will not be stopped, " Ho claimed, noting
that campaign organizers have even asked the city government to
extend the permit for using Ketagalan Boulevard to Sept. 25, from
Sept. 7.</P>
      <P>The organizers have yet to announce when the sit-in will begin,
saying they will run newspaper ads three days prior to the start
date.</P>
      <P>She said they will also be careful in deciding on a date to end
the sit-in since the crowd will be closely monitored by a "fierce and
well-organized state machine."</P>
      <P>Ho emphasized that the campaign organizers "definitely do not
have any plan to encourage the sit-in participants to step beyond the
red line or swarm into the Presidential Office."</P>
      <P>She reported that the campaign headquarters has been preparing
hand fans printed with the words "love" and "peace" and with a
"thumbs down" sign to help participants stay cool during the warm
summer nights when the sit-in is held.</P>
      <P>She also encouraged interested members of the public to show
their creativity and come up with "works of art" that can be
displayed in "all the corners of Taiwan society" calling on the
president to respect the public's expectation that he step down
gracefully.</P>

      <P>Several overseas Taiwanese groups
criticized former Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Shih Ming-teh
Friday as "leading Taiwan's democratic development backward" for
launching a campaign to depose President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The groups said in a statement that overseas Taiwanese are
extremely surprised and disappointed at the campaign and firmly
opposed to the vicious political struggle.</P>
      <P>They included the North America Taiwanese Women's Association,
the Formosan Association for Human Rights, the Taiwanese Hakka
Association of U.S.A., the Taiwanese Canadian Association of Canada
and a pro-Chen organization in Japan.</P>
      <P>They asked Shih if he has forgotten that he was jailed because of
his pursuit of democracy for Taiwan and why he is now allying himself
with his former persecutors to damage Taiwan's democratic system.</P>
      <P>Arguing that efforts to terminate corruption should be carried
out through enactment of sunshine laws, they said Shih should not
demand that Chen step down based on some "empty moral appeal" when
there is no substantial evidence that Chen has committed any crime or
before judicial authorities have completed their investigations into
related cases.</P>
      <P>They said the alleged irregularities involving Chen's family
members and his close aides have nothing to do with the president
himself and that it is unjustifiable for Shih to force him to step
down over these matters.</P>

an unprecedented round-the-clock sit-in being led by former
Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Shih Ming-teh to oust President
Chen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NCKU RESEARCH TEAM DEVELOPS DISEASE TESTING BIOCHIPS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25 (CNA)
(By Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A research team at National Cheng-kung
University (NCKU) has developed a new series of disease testing
biochips, allowing shorter determination time and less cost per unit,
a spokesman of the National Science Council (NSC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The team, organized by professor Li Gwo-bin at NCKU's Engineering
Science Department, applied the knowledge of microfluidics to
detection biochips, which can now produce results in two to three
hours and can be provided at a cost of NT$100 per unit.</P>
      <P>The research and development of the new biochips has been
conducted for eight years, and it began receiving funding from the
NSC two years ago.</P>
      <P>While making comparisons with conventional tests, Li noted that
the biochemical test for bacteria, although costing as low as NT$50,
requires more than 24 hours or even several days to complete; while
the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA, can complete the
identification process within 30 minutes at a cost of NT$200,
although it can only be utilized in the later stages of disease
development.</P>
      <P>Li added that microfluidic biochips can be used in the early
stages, at an acceptable cost and duration of time.</P>
      <P>Currently, the biochip can be used to detect Streptococcus
pneumoniae, Group A Streptococcus, and dengue fever, and the team is
working on expanding the application range, Li said, adding that the
biochip can be operated in two modes, either one piece for four
persons for a single disease, or one piece for one person for four
diseases.</P>
      <P>The project is expected to be completed by this November
following testing on humans in September at NCKU Hospital's emergency
room. The team will then apply for sales permits in both Taiwan and
the United States.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The group sponsoring a campaign to depose
President Chen Shui-bian distanced itself Friday from a thug activist
who attacked a political commentator during a live TV news talk show
the day before.</P>
      <P>Ho Teh-fen, spokeswoman for the "1 million people campaign to
depose Chen, " condemned former Democratic Progressive Party
Legislator Lin Cheng-chieh's attack on Contemporary Monthly
editor-in-chief Chin Heng-wei during the Formosa Television talk show
"The People Talk" Thursday, saying that the "Depose Chen" group
deplores any kind of violence.</P>
      <P>Ho said Lin is not a staff member of the campaign headquarters,
that his act of violence had nothing to do with the campaign, and
that he will be barred from the sit-in scheduled to be launched in
front of the Presidential Office at the start of next month.</P>
      <P>During the live show, Lin, who supports the "Depose Chen"
campaign initiated by former Democratic Progressive Party Chairman
Shih Ming-teh, suddenly slapped Chin on the face, following up with
punches and kicks after the two exchanged curses.</P>
      <P>Chin, who suffered a bloody nose in the altercation, received
emergency treatment at a hospital, including five stitches to his
nose.</P>
      <P>According to Ho, Lin had suggested that a team of bodyguards be
organized to protect Shih's safety during and before the sit-in. Ho
added that Lin's suggestion was rejected immediately by campaign
organizers.</P>
      <P>"We condemn any act of violence. Any individual intending to take
part in the sit-in protest must abide by our rules and discipline. We
have stepped up personnel training to maintain order and discipline at

    <HEADLINE>DPP LAWMAKERS URGE POWER-HOLDERS TO BECOME 'STABILIZING FORCE'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 25 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) lawmakers and one former DPP lawmaker called on the party
leadership Friday to prove that the party is capable of reflection
and willing to be a "stabilizing force" in Taiwan society.</P>
      <P>Hung Chi-chang, Kuo Cheng-liang, Cheng Yun-peng and former
Legislator Tuan Yi-kang launched a petition urging the party to adopt
a resolution restraining party members who hold public office from
joining or encouraging supporters to join a "counter-Shih Ming-teh"
campaign.</P>
      <P>Shih, a former DPP chairman, is leading a "1 million people
campaign to depose President Chen Shui-bian," angering quite a number
of DPP fanatics who have vowed to organize "counter-Shih campaigns"
to "stare down" Shih and his supporters.</P>
      <P>The four DPP politicians proposed that those who fail to honor
the resolution be disciplined severely. They also urged the party's
top leaders, including Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, Vice President Annette
Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang, as well as Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral
candidates Frank Hsieh and Chen Chu, to sponsor their proposal to
adopt the resolution.</P>
      <P>Social tension worsened the previous evening when Lin
Cheng-chieh, a former DPP legislator, physically assaulted a pro-DPP
commentator when they quarrelled during a live TV talk show.</P>
      <P>Tuan, an outspoken DPP politician, and the three DPP lawmakers
claimed that "reflection starts with tolerance" and that "it's a
natural duty for the ruling party to act as a stabilizing force in
society."</P>
      <P>Tuan said that when Shih, a former DPP chairman, kicked off his
campaign to depose the president, some DPP leaders, instead of trying
to talk to him, were overwhelmed with emotion while the party's top
leader did nothing, allowing the party rank and file to develop a
"wrong attitude" toward a "wrong campaign."</P>
      <P>Tuan added that the TV violence incident is an indication that
irrationality prevails in some sectors of society, and under such
circumstances, the ruling party has an even greater responsibility to
control its supporters -- a position it should make clear long before
the sit-in protest begins.</P>
      <P>Kuo Cheng-liang said Shih has not been reasonable by insisting on
using a street rally to attempt to unseat the president, but neither
has it been constructive for some DPP supporters to assassinate
Shih's character.</P>
      <P>Shih's two former wives have made public statements to discredit
him.</P>
      <P>If the DPP encourages its supporters to wage "counter-Shih"
activities, "we must understand that even the KMT regime in the old
days did not do things like that," Kuo pointed out.</P>
      <P>In short, he said, neither the character assassination of Shih
nor "counter-Shih" campaigns are the right solution to the issue.</P>
      <P>Hung Chi-chang said freedom of expression and freedom of assembly
are part of the "core values" the DPP has fought for and vowed to
protect, so there is no reason for the party to discount them now.</P>
      <P>"At the very least, tolerating a different view is what we should
do now," he added.</P>
      <P>In response to the proposal, Yu said the party knows how to
reflect on itself and does not want to see personal attacks against
Shih.</P>
      <P>Kao Chih-peng, a DPP lawmaker, ridiculed the four's proposal as
"unrealistic" and "standing on too high a moral ground."</P>
      <P>No party rules and regulations ban party members from fighting
back in the face of physical assault, Kao said. "Yes, we could start
our reflection with tolerance, but not tolerance of violence."</P>

    <HEADLINE>REFUSAL TO DIVULGE SOURCE OF JEWELRY SETS `BAD EXAMPLE': LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's refusal to
explain the source of his jewelry assets has set a very bad example
for the public, a lawmaker of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chin-lung, a KMT caucus whip in the legislature, made the
remarks after the Presidential Office said it could not accommodate
the Control Yuan's request to provide the names of relatives and
friends from whom Chen and his wife claim to have borrowed jewelry
because those involved do not want their privacy infringed upon.</P>
      <P>Tsai claimed that Chen, a lawyer-turned-politician, is "playing
with the law."</P>
      <P>He said Chen, under the pretext of borrowing from others and
protecting the privacy of others, has set a bad example in the filing
of assets of public functionaries.</P>
      <P>If other public functionaries follow suit, the Public
Functionaries Asset Disclosure Law will be rendered unenforceable, he
said.</P>
      <P>The first couple sent a corrected version of jewelry assets to
the Control Yuan in early July, listing 15 pieces of jewelry and
luxury watches that they own, with a total value of NT$3.72 million
(US$114,110).</P>
      <P>Legislators from the opposition Kuomintang and People First Party
then produced photos of 31 pieces of jewelry worn by the first lady
on various occasions. The Control Yuan therefore asked for an
explanation of those pieces from the first family within 15 days.</P>
      <P>The first couple replied on the last day of the deadline that
they had acquiesced to the Control Yuan's request by filing reports
on their jewelry but had not reported on jewelry "borrowed from
relatives or friends" because the relatives and friends were not
being audited and should have the privacy of their assets protected.
The Control Yuan then made the request for disclosure of the names of
the relatives and friends.</P>
      <P>According to the Public Functionary Assets Disclosure Law, any
piece of jewelry, including watches, owned by public functionaries
and worth over NT$200,000 should be listed with the
Control Yuan.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25 (CNA)
(By FLor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
demanded the resignation of Minister of National Defense Lee Jye
Friday over a controversy over reports by a military run newspaper
suggesting that military personnel do not endorse a donation campaign
aimed at deposing President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whip Lin Hung-chih issued the call at a
news conference at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Lin accused the Ministry of National Defense (MND) of twisting
the Constitution and law by threatening to punish personnel who make</P>
      <P>donations, under the pretext that doing so is against the
neutrality required by the military under the law.</P>
      <P>The MND has deliberately given a misleading interpretation of the
relevant law and Lee should step down to take responsibility for the
matter, Lin said, pointing out that according to the National Defense
Law, military personnel are perfectly entitled to participate in
political activities after work or on leave.</P>
      <P>In view of the populist campaign led by former Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Shih Ming-teh to unseat
scandal-tainted Chen, the military-run Youth Daily has printed a
series of features in recent days stressing that neutrality must be
maintained in the military.</P>
      <P>Although the MND has not publicly banned military personnel from
donating NT$100 to Shih's campaign, ministry officials said that
those who have done so might be viewed as having violated the
neutrality requirement and might be punished if reported to their
superiors.</P>
      <P>The MND denied that an investigation is under way to find out who
has made donations but MND-affiliated agencies have repeatedly
required personnel to maintain neutrality and professionalism, MND
officials said.</P>
      <P>According to a spokesman for the Air Force, it is not good for
military personnel to take part in political activities.</P>
      <P>The articles recently run by the Youth Daily are aimed at
strengthening personnel's awareness of the need to maintain
neutrality in any politically charged movement, the spokesman sad,
adding that the military has adopted a "business as usual" attitude
in the face of a sit-in protest led by Shih that is expected to kick
off in the coming days.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two-way charter flights between Macau and
Taiwan's outlying island of Kinmen will be inaugurated Sept. 19 in
line with the Kinmen county government's bid to open the island wider
to the rest of the world, a local tourism industry executive said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Kinmen County Tourism Association Chairman Wu Chia-chiang made
the announcement at a news conference in a local hotel.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the decision was made after a delegation
organized by the association headed to Hong Kong and Macau in early
August to inspect the two markets -- a move in line with the Kinmen
county government's efforts to better connect Kinmen with the world
and sell the offshore county to foreign visitors as a tourism
destination.</P>
      <P>The Macau Government Tourist Office responded positively and
reached agreement on opening two-way charter flight services with the
Kinmen tourism promotion association, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu expressed the hope of being able to better promote bilateral
tourism exchanges between Kinmen and Macau and jointly explore
cooperation opportunities with the charter services.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen County Tourism Association hopes that a 194-seat
Airbus A321 jet of Trans Asia Airways can be used to make the Sept.
19 maiden charter flight between Kinmen and Macau.</P>
      <P>The plane is slated to depart from Macau at 6: 10 p. m. that
evening and land on Kinmen at 7: 20 p.m. before returning to Macau at
8:20 p.m., the association said.</P>
      <P>The association is also organizing five-day group tours from
Kinmen to Macau and Hong Kong that will begin with the maiden flight.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the UNI Airways Corp. also inaugurated a charter
flight service from Makung on the outlying island of Penghu to Hong
Kong Thursday, following its launch of similar services to Seoul,
Hanoi and Macau.</P>
      <P>The aviation company used a 152-seat MD-90 airplane for the
round-trip flight that will return from Hong Kong to Macau Aug. 28.</P>
      <P>To celebrate the opening of charter flight services on the
Makung- Hong Kong route, UNI Airways also marketed a tour group
especially designed for families, which will take participants to
Disney World in Hong Kong and to the nearby Shenzhen special economic
zone in China's Guangdong Province.</P>
      <P>Driven by sluggish business in the domestic air travel market,
Taiwan's aviation companies are seeking to expand overseas by

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese investors in China now face a
problem in that their profits made in China cannot flow back freely
to Taiwan due to the government's strict financial regulations,
according to a report released Friday by the Taiwan Institute of
Economic Research (TIER).</P>
      <P>Lee Hui-ping, an assistant researcher at TIER, said that
investment by Taiwanese enterprises in China accounted for 70 percent
of Taiwan's total outbound investment in 2005 and estimated that the
percentage will remain approximately the same this year.</P>
      <P>While the government has been encouraging local businessmen to
remit their profits reaped in China back to Taiwan for the research
and development of more higher-end products, the businessmen are
worried that they might be phased out of the Chinese market if they
do not pour more money into the fierce competition there, Lee noted.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan's strict financial regulations make the
businessmen unwilling to bring their capital here, Lee added.</P>
      <P>Although the investments in China have contributed partially to
Taiwan's prosperous exports in recent years, there is a trend that
Taiwanese entrepreneurs are purchasing more Chinese goods and hiring
more Chinese people, Lee went on.</P>
      <P>He urged the government to relax capital control while planning a
policy to lure more investment to Taiwan. According to Lee, the
policy is aimed at ensuring a more-than 4 percent annual economic
growth for the country.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug.  25  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Communications Commission
(NCC) suggested Friday that television networks in Taiwan should be
equipped with broadcasting delay devices to prevent profanity and
violence in their talk shows from being aired live.</P>
      <P>Liu Zong-de, a deputy chairman of the NCC, made the remarks when
asked to comment on a violent incident that occurred in a Formosa
Television talk show aired live the previous evening.</P>
      <P>In the incident, one of the invited guests -- Lin Cheng-chieh, a
former legislator of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party --
punched another guest, Contemporary monthly's editor-in-chief Chin
Heng-wei, injuring his nose, which required five stitches.</P>
      <P>Liu said the incident has highlighted the need for Taiwan's TV
networks to use broadcast delay systems to guard against broadcasting 
similar incidents in the future.</P>
      <P>A broadcast delay device creates a buffer of up to 20 seconds and
allows the control room of a TV station to delete a profanity or
obscenity before it airs.</P>
      <P>Liu commended the talk show hostess for making the right decision
by requesting that the show be interrupted with commercials
immediately following the assault.</P>
      <P>However, he noted that Formosa Television's subsequent news
programs used the violent footage repeatedly.</P>
      <P>"The NCC is reluctant to impose its own judgment on Formosa
Television because there is room for discussion on whether the
repeated playing of the violent footage might actually spur positive
thinking among the viewers," Liu said.</P>
      <P>He added, however, that the NCC will not tolerate bloody, gory
scenes or indecent exposure in TV programs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOOLS URGED TO STRENGTHEN CHARACTER EDUCATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 25  (CNA)
(By Ada Tsai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The effects and outcomes of character
education will be included in school management evaluation and will
serve as reference when providing grants to local schools, Vice
Education Minister Wu Tsai-shun said Friday.</P>
      <P>The new policy is part of the Ministry of Education's efforts to
encourage elementary and junior high schools to strengthen character
education, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks at a meeting of education bureau chiefs from
city and county governments around the country.</P>
      <P>Noting that character education is an essential mission of
schools, Wu said the goal of character education lies in helping
children develop good dispositions that will enable them to flourish
intellectually, personally and socially.</P>
      <P>Wu further said that character education does not amount to
simply a lesson or course, a quick-fix program, or a slogan posted on
the wall.</P>
      <P>As character education is an integral part of school life, Wu
said, schools should initiate a diversity of programs for character
education, including selection of model students, classroom
discipline rules, boy and girl scout activities, volunteer service,
sports events and daily campus clean-up activities.</P>
      <P>With successful character education, Wu said, schools can become
communities in which virtues such as responsibility, hard work,

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI CITY GOVERNMENT CLARIFIES RUMOR ON GAY MARRIAGE CEREMONY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei city government dispelled a
rumor Friday that it will sponsor a public wedding ceremony for gay
men and women in September, pointing out that same-sex marriages are
not legal in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chung Che-liang, head of the municipal Bureau of Civil Affairs,
made the remarks while answering questions from Taipei City Councilor
Li Keng Kuei-fang during an interpellation session at the Taipei
City Council.</P>
      <P>Li Keng said that the work and living rights of gay men and
women should be fully protected, but she claimed that Taipei is the
only city in the world that would hold a gay activity with public
funds.</P>
      <P>She asked municipal officials to clearly explain whether gay
marriages are lawful in Taipei and what are the city government's
countermeasures to prevent the spread of AIDS and build a healthy
city. She did not elaborate on what she felt was the relationship
between gay marriage and the spread of AIDS.</P>
      <P>The city council woman and various religious representatives
expressed their disagreement with the idea of the Taipei city
government holding a public wedding ceremony for gay couples.</P>
      <P>It had been rumored that some 30 gay couples from home and abroad
had been planning to take part in the public wedding ceremony in
Taipei and that homosexuals and lesbians from other Asian countries
might gather in Taipei, taking advantage of the occasion to make the
city into a prominent "gay heaven."</P>
      <P>Denying that Taipei will hold a collective gay wedding ceremony,
Chung explained that the city government is only planning to sponsor
a seminar on "gay civic movement" with the aim of helping the public
build "a correct concept" toward the gay community and learn how to
respect minority groups.</P>
      <P>According to Chung, gay couples cannot register their marriages
or households with the municipal authorities and are not allowed to
adopt children.</P>
      <P>No matter whether gay men or women are well- accepted in local
society, the public should be lenient with them and help them "come
out, " Wu said, adding that this is the purpose of the city
government's planned seminar.</P>
      <P>According to a claim by municipal Department of Health Director
Sung Yen-jen, gay men are "prone to having AIDS" if they don't take
precautions when having sex. But he admitted that the spread of AIDS
is unrelated to their marriage status.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, gay people should think of their roles on the
social, legal and cultural fronts when living together, urged
municipal Department of Social Affairs Director Hsueh Cherng-tay.</P>

F.D.A. Approves Broader Access to Next-Day
Pill

The Food and Drug Administration on
Thursday approved over-the-counter sales
of the morning-after contraceptive pill to
women 18 and older, resolving one of the
most contentious issues in the agency's
100-year history.

Nationwide over-the-counter sales of
the drug, Plan B, are expected to start

in pharmacies and health clinics only, and
buyers must show proof of age. Anyone
under age 18 will still need a prescription.
Men may also buy Plan B for a partner.

Wall Street Journal: Wine Sales Thrive
As Old Barriers Start to Crumble

The business of wine is breaking free of
one of the world's most archaic and tangled
retail systems. The result: a rise in sales,
and an explosion of new ways to buy wine.

One of wine's new winners is Gary
Vaynerchuk, a 30-year-old Belarus immigrant
who recently dipped his nose into a glass,
inhaled deeply, and stared into a videocamera.
"Bell pepper, green pepper, red pepper," he
declared. "This smells like a salad."

The market is in upheaval because its
many barriers are starting to crumble.
Recently, a Seattle federal court struck
down state rules forcing retailers to buy
through wholesalers at pre-established
prices. Several states are lifting rules
that prevent consumers from buying wine
directly from out-of-state producers and
retailers producers and retailers.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI'S POSITION AS GLOBAL CITY `WORTH CONTEMPLATION:' ACADEMIC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  25  (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei should look at itself and
contemplate how it fits into the global cities network in order to be
a better city, University of Chicago Professor Saskia Sassen said in
an interview with CNA Friday.</P>
      <P>As a "super platform" of global cities has surfaced after the
"merging of major East Asian cities" and the competition between
cities has become history, Taipei should think about it fits in the
network, according to Sassen, a prominent sociologist and economist.</P>
      <P>"The Global City" is a term coined by Sassen in the 1980s to
describe how cities became strategic "transnational spaces in the
global economy" and later "joined forces as a denationalized
network."</P>
      <P>"A global city is a platform for international investors and
foreign professionals, and a partly denationalized space as well. It
is far more oriented to other financial centers of the world rather
than its neighborhood, " she explained.</P>
      <P>Global cities like London, Tokyo and New York are subnational
units that are key structures for a new form of power that
globalization has brought with it, said Sassen, who is considered by
her peers as a "leading scholar of globalization."</P>
      <P>More and more global cities are working together, Sassen said.
Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Madrid -- four of Europe's largest
global cities -- have formed an alliance to "compete" with London,
she added.</P>
      <P>As an East Asian city, Taipei probably should look at the fact
that there are more than 400,000 Taiwanese professionals in China and
that its busiest transnational professional circuits are the
Taipei-Shanghai and Taipei-Guangdong/Hong Kong flights, and think
about its position in the network, Sassen said.</P>

      <P>The spokeswoman for a campaign to depose
President Chen Shui-bian called on the police Friday to ensure safety
for campaign workers as a radical ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) lawmaker has announced he will lead 60 buses of people from the
president's hometown in southern Taiwan to demand that Shih Ming-teh,
who initiated the campaign, pay back what they donated to him years
ago when he was chairman of the DPP.</P>
      <P>Ho De-fen pointed out that DPP Legislator Wang Hsing-nan was
targeting the wrong people, as Shih's campaign to depose Chen has
nothing to do with his private life.</P>
      <P>Wang said Chen's hometown supporters are very angry at Shih's
action and they want their donations to him back. Shih said the
NT$1.8 million he received from Tainan County supporters was donated
to a family support center in Tainan.</P>
      <P>The 60 buses, carrying an estimated 2,400 people, are scheduled
to arrive in Taipei Saturday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Ho said the campaign office will be closed for the weekend and
that no press conference will be held, but some volunteer workers
might still work at the office. She said she has asked them to be
careful and ignore the protesters from Tainan.</P>
      <P>She urged the police to provide protection to the campaign

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As of Thursday evening, when three
designated bank and postal accounts were closed, the campaign to
depose the president had received NT$110,291,563 (US$3.34 million)
from more than 1 million donors, the campaign headquarters announced
Friday.</P>
      <P>The campaign was initiated by former Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) Chairman Shih Ming-teh, who called on members of the public to
contribute NT$100 each for him to organize a mass sit-in calling on
President Chen Shui-bian to step down.</P>
      <P>The campaign headquarters said it would hold a training session
Sunday on Ketagalan Boulevard facing the Presidential Office for
1,000 "security and order volunteers." It had not yet decided when to
begin the sit-in.</P>
      <P>The campaign will ensure that the sit-in remains non-violent to
underscore its theme of "love, peace and reason, " according to the
organizers.</P>
      <P>It said it welcomes donations of food and water, but because the
office space is limited, donors are asked to send them directly to
the sit-in site after it begins.</P>
      <P>A "Forrest Gump Youth Corps" and an "abien886" blog are
cooperating with the campaign office in launching an unprecedented

    <HEADLINE>TV TALK SHOW HOSTESS TO FILE COUNTER-LAWSUIT AGAINST PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 25 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Renowned television talk show hostess Sisy
Chen said Friday that she will file a counter-lawsuit against
President Chen Shui-bian for defaming her with a false and malicious
accusation if Chen sues her for slander over remarks she made on a TV
program Thursday.</P>
      <P>She told a press conference at the Legislative Yuan that the
president, being a lawyer himself, must know that if he intends to
sue someone, he must have good reason.</P>
      <P>She said the threat to sue her is apparently a "political action"
indicating that the Presidential Office is at its wit's end in its
attempts to defend the president.</P>
      <P>She claimed that what she said in her show must be viewed "in a
broader context" instead of being compressed into "a single brief
claim" that the president plans to take advantage of his upcoming
South Pacific visit to ship his valuables overseas by traveling on
Air Force One -- a short-range jet plane -- that will take off from
Taipei's domestic Sungshan Airport.</P>
      <P>The TV hostess questioned the motive of the president in choosing
Air Force One for his visit to Palau and noted that the president's
2005 visit to Palau used a chartered flight of China Airlines.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that all of the president's 10 overseas visits in
the past six years have relied on either Eva Airways or China
Airlines flights.</P>
      <P>Giving four possible reasons for the change, she said either the
scandal-ridden president might be concerned about his own safety
because CAL's air crew might not be so obedient as he wants, or he
could be worried about being embarrassed by protesting crowds along
the way if he has to go to Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in
Taoyuan County for departure.</P>
      <P>The third possibility, according to her, would be that by taking
off from Sungshan Airport on a military plane, the president could
avoid customs inspections and could easily ship his wife's
questionable valuables abroad.</P>
      <P>Another possibility would be that the president might want to
help his son-in-law, Chao Chien-ming -- a defendant in an insider
trading case -- to flee abroad.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office said in a statement earlier Friday that
her "malicious" defamation is "totally unfactual" and has seriously
damaged the president's reputation, and that the president will file
a slander suit against her.</P>
      <P>President Chen is under enormous pressure from the people who
want him to step down because of a series of corruption scandals
surrounding the first family and senior aides of the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>Amid angry cris that he should stay in Taiwan to listen to the
people's complaints, the president announced he will depart Sept. 3
for Palau to attend a leaders' summit between Taiwan and its
diplomatic allies in the South Pacific before heading on to Nauru for

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT TALKS ON TOURIST OPENING SLATED FOR MID-SEPTEMBER</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait will
begin talks in mid-September on terms under which Chinese citizens
can make sightseeing trips to Taiwan, a senior official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Wen-sheng, director-general of the Tourism Bureau under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications, said the talks will
pave the way for Taiwan opening to Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>The agenda will focus on non-political technical issues,
including verification of Chinese tourist identities, the
repatriation formula for absconding tourists and treatment of travel
disputes, said Hsu.</P>
      <P>Hsu has been designated to concurrently head a quasi-official
travel association to deal with its Chinese counterpart, the China
Tourism Association, on issues regarding Chinese tourists coming to
Taiwan. The association is scheduled to hold its first board meeting
Sunday.</P>
      <P>It remains uncertain whether the talks will follow the format
adopted in previous cross-strait talks on opening direct charter
flights during traditional festivals or for special purposes, known
locally as the "Macau formula."</P>
      <P>Hsu said only that Tourism Bureau Deputy Director-General Lai
Se-chen will represent Taiwan, while Zhang Xichin, deputy director of
China's National Tourism Administration, will be the top Chinese
negotiator.</P>
      <P>As China refuses any official contact with Taiwan, the two sides
have to set up quasi-official travel associations to negotiate and
manage the issue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ROC Travel Agent Association, which has been
responsible for laying the groundwork for tourist opening, said it
has completed its "trailblazing" function. Hereafter, the association
said, it will play a supporting role, taking charge of delivering
travel papers, allocation of travel quotas, management of the
absconding prevention deposits and discipline of travel agents.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan's plan, a maximum of 1,000 Chinese tourists
will be allowed to enter Taiwan per day for a maximum 10-day stay.
Chinese tourists are required to "enter and leave in group, " and the
host Taiwan travel agency will be fined NT$200,000 for each absconded
Chinese tourist.</P>
      <P>To ensure travel quality, travel agencies must sign up a
discupline agreement. Any travel agency that violates the minimum
daily travel expenses of US$80-to-US$100 will have its tourist quota
allocation suspended for one month.</P>

      <P>Hsu has been designated to concurrently head a quasi-official
travel association to deal with its Chinese counterpart, the China
Tourism Association, on issues regarding Chinese tourists coming to
Taiwan. The association is scheduled to hold its first board meeting
Sunday.</P>
      <P>It remains uncertain whether the talks will follow the format
adopted in previous cross-strait talks on opening direct charter
flights during traditional festivals or for special purposes, known
locally as the "Macau formula."</P>
      <P>Hsu said only that Tourism Bureau Deputy Director-General Lai
Se-chen will represent Taiwan, while Zhang Xichin, deputy director of
China's National Tourism Administration, will be the top Chinese
negotiator.</P>
      <P>As China refuses any official contact with Taiwan, the two sides
have to set up quasi-official travel associations to negotiate and
manage the issue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ROC Travel Agent Association, which has been
responsible for laying the groundwork for tourist opening, said it
has completed its "trailblazing" function. Hereafter, the association
said, it will play a supporting role, taking charge of delivering
travel papers, allocation of travel quotas, management of the
absconding prevention deposits and discipline of travel agents.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan's plan, a maximum of 1,000 Chinese tourists
will be allowed to enter Taiwan per day for a maximum 10-day stay.
Chinese tourists are required to "enter and leave in group, " and the
host Taiwan travel agency will be fined NT$200,000 for each absconded
Chinese tourist.</P>
      <P>To ensure travel quality, travel agencies must sign up a
discupline agreement. Any travel agency that violates the minimum
daily travel expenses of US$80-to-US$100 will have its tourist quota
allocation suspended for one month.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
denied Friday that it has demanded military personnel stay away from
an imminent round-the-clock sit-in protest to force President Chen
Shui-bian to step down.</P>
      <P>MND spokesman Wu Chi-fang made the denial after opposition
lawmakers accused the ministry of not keeping a neutral stance toward
the "1 million people to depose Chen" campaign by demanding military
servicemen sign a document promising not to take part in any
anti-Chen acitvities, including making cash donations or taking part
in sit-in.</P>
      <P>Wu said the military has just stepped up education programs to
enhance military personnel's awareness of the virtures of delinking
the military from politics and the necessity for the military to
maintain administrative neutrality.</P>
      <P>He also denied media reports that Defense Minister Lee Jye went
to the maximum-guarded Hengshan command center Thursday to instruct
all service members not to take part in the upcoming anti-Chen sit-in

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will launch an emergency
relief program targeting the portion of the population deemed to be
"near-poverty" and "newly poor" in September, a Cabinet official said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Citing tallies from the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting
and Statistics, Minister without Portfolio Lin Wan-yi noted that
there is a group of people who earn NT$7,500 per month or less on
average but who are not qualified for subsidies for low-income
households because they own fixed assets and therefore described as
being "near poverty."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, there is another group of people who might downgrade
from the middle-class to the near-poverty class at any time owing to
the trend of globalization, knowledge-based economy and
transformation of the industrial structure, who are known as the
"newly poor," Lin pointed out.</P>
      <P>These two groups of people received little social relief in the
past and will be the priority targets of the program, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Under the program, the government will launch a service hotline
for those needing help and establish a system for the reporting and
transfer of such cases.</P>
      <P>While local governments will evaluate these cases and work out a
plan to assist them after receiving reports, they will also track the
conditions of the relief recipients on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>The emergency relief includes cash, shelter, medical subsidies,
medical treatment for those with mental diseases, employment
assistance, schooling aid, legal aid, physical safety and property
protection, care for children, elderly and physically or mentally
challenged from these families, and services helping the "newly poor"
population start their own businesses.</P>
      <P>Lin said the relief will be provided for three months in each
case and can be extended for another three months if necessary.</P>
      <P>The program will continue until the government amends the social
relief law to include the "near poverty" and the "newly poor" by the
end of 2008, Lin said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SALE OF DESTROYERS AN EXAMPLE OF U.S. COMMITMENT TO TAIWAN: PENTAGON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  25 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The sale of Kidd-class destroyers to
Taiwan marks a perfect example of the U.S. commitment to helping the
country maintain sufficient self-defense capability as set forth in
the Taiwan Relations Act, a Pentagon official said Friday.</P>
      <P>John Toolan, principal director of the Asian-Pacific Affairs
Office of the U.S. Secretary of Defense, made the remarks during the
departure ceremony for two Kidd-class destroyers sold to Taiwan. Two
other Kidd-class destroyers have previously been delivered to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Toolan said it is no coincidence that Taiwan has enjoyed peace
and stability for the past 50 years.</P>
      <P>"The strength of Taiwan's military has kept the threat at bay,
which has allowed the democratic transformation and economic
development to take place," he said.</P>
      <P>He said the foundation of the United States' lasting relationship
with Taiwan is much deeper than the provision of defense articles and
services as it is based upon shared values and common principles.</P>
      <P>"We are both peace-loving peoples, nurturing our respective
democracies, committed to the rule of law, and dedicated to our
shared commitment to human rights. We also share in an understanding
that our values and principles are best secured through strength, "
he said.</P>
      <P>Toolan said the U.S. government's decision to sell the warships
to Taiwan is an investment in the continuation of peace and stability
in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Toolan reiterated that the United States opposes unilateral
changes by either side to the cross-strait status quo and the use of
force or coercion by Beijing to compel a resolution to the
cross-strait dispute and does not support Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>He urged Beijing to open a dialogue with the elected leadership
of Taiwan and to demonstrate more transparency in describing the
purpose of its military buildup.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he called on Taipei to work harder to ensure continued
stability in the Taiwan Strait, pointing out that Taiwan's defense
modernization efforts have been hampered by domestic politics and
that the country is losing its traditional technological edge over
China.</P>
      <P>"Leaders in power and in the opposition shoulder a collective
burden of providing for the security of Taiwan's 23 million people, "
he said.</P>
      <P>Toolan said the U.S. government encourages Taiwan to address in a
balanced way both immediate needs and long-lead future capabilities.</P>
      <P>"In doing so, millions more across East Asia will be safer from
the horrors of war, because Taiwan will be preparing responsibly to
preserve the peace," he said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 26 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has
been making aggressive efforts to organize presentations around the
country as part of what it calls its "Safeguarding Taiwan with No
Corruption" campaign since its failure to promote a legislative
motion to recall President Chen Shui-bian in late June.</P>
      <P>The KMT has planned a total of 1,500 presentations, with the last
activity to be held in mid-September in the central city of Taichung,
according to the KMT headquarters.</P>
      <P>In the Taichung presentation, KMT Chairman Ma Ying-yeou will give
a report on the party's efforts to oust Chen because of the spate of
corruption scandals involving the president, members of his family
and close aides.</P>
      <P>Commenting on an ongoing "anti-Chen" movement and a planned
sit-in initiated by Shih Ming-teh, a former chairman of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), KMT spokesman Huang Yu-chen said
Saturday that the KMT encourages its party members to join the sit-in
in person but that the party itself will not be involved.</P>
      <P>The KMT will keep its distance from the sit-in in order to
prevent DPP supporters from twisting the "anti-Chen" campaign into a
conflict between the DPP-led "pan-green camp" and the opposition
"pan-blue alliance," Huang explained.</P>
      <P>The organization of the KMT-initiated "Safeguarding Taiwan with
No Corruption" campaign presentations is the second phrase of the
opposition party's efforts to depose Chen following a failed recall
motion at the Legislative Yuan June 27, according to the KMT.</P>
      <P>The second-phrase of efforts aimed at pushing Chen to step down
are scheduled to be completed before Sept. 19, when the Legislative
Yuan will open after its summer recess, the KMT said, noting that
after that day, the party will begin the third phrase of its
campaign.</P>
      <P>So far, the KMT has not yet planned any moves for the third
phrase, KMT Director of Organization Affairs Huang Chung-hsien said.</P>

(By Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A decade-long survey has discovered 56 new
kinds of fungi in Taiwan, according to a statement issued Saturday by
the Council of Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>The Endemic Species Research Institute (ESRI) under the COA has
conducted the islandwide fungus survey since July 1992, discovering
seven entirely new species of fungus and 49 species not previously
recorded in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the ESRI, the new species are sinoboletus fuscus,
sinoboletus magnisporus, boletus tubulus, sinotermitomyces
taiwanensis, xerocomus taiwanensis, an as-yet unnamed one in the
amanita family and another in the agaricus family still under
taxonomic review.</P>
      <P>To date, the institute has observed and collected 91 kinds of
boletus in Taiwan, an ESRI researcher said, adding that although most
tropical boletus species are found in low-altitude areas, while most
temperate ones exist in mid- and high- altitude zones, they found
surprisingly that there are eight tropical ones found in areas above
1500 meters, which is an extremely rare phenomenon.</P>
      <P>The researcher noted that the institute has also made some
progress in the survey of the amanita family and has recorded one new
species, three not previously recorded in Taiwan and seven without
available taxonomical reference.</P>
      <P>As for the new one in the agaricus family, the researcher said it
was found in the area between Chiuchiushan and Chunghsing village in
the central county of Nantou. The institute will later apply
confirmation from international scientific journals on the newly

      <P>Taipei City is Taiwan's top city in terms

Taichung and Tainan cities, according to the results of poll released
Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Common Health magazine conducted the survey based on physical

residents' responses to environmental protection, city and county
government efforts in upgrading public health, as well as promotion
of environmental protection by city and county governments.</P>
      <P>In terms of physical health, Taipei City tops the list, followed
by Kaohsiung and Taichung cities. On the ratio of obese residents as
well as the prevalence of betel nut chewing, Taipei City is at the
bottom and is second in terms of the amount of vegetables eaten.</P>
      <P>On tobacco use prevention, Taipei City is top, followed by Tainan

they do not like to have smokers around when they eat out.</P>
      <P>In terms of environmental protection, residents in Yunlin, Nantou

conditioners (either not using them or setting them above 26 degrees
celcius), while residents in Taipei city and county were found to be
the most unrestrained.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that more and more Taiwan people have LOHS
sense, citing as examples that 77 percent are in favor of banning
smoking in restaurants, 61 percent will report environmental problems
and 43 percent will buy more expensive dishwashing detergent if it is
environmentally friendly.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO PROHIBIT LIVE POULTRY TRADE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 26 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan is planning to prohibit
live poultry trade and slaughtering in traditional markets around
Taiwan by 2008 to prevent possible avian flu outbreaks, a government
official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet will present a series of accompanying measures in
this regard in September. Once the policy is implemented, Taiwan will
become the second Asian country to have carried out such policy,
following Singapore.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong also plans to follow suit by 2008.</P>
      <P>The H5N1 strain of avian influenza began to hit Vietnam, Thailand
and Cambodia in 2004 before spreading to Europe, Africa and other
parts of the world more recently.</P>
      <P>To ensure Taiwan's protection from avian flu, the government has
put the anti-avian flu task on the list of affairs related to
national security.</P>
      <P>At a national security meeting on avian flu in March, President
Chen Shui-bian instructed related agencies to study the possibility
of prohibiting live poultry slaughter in traditional markets to
prevent avian flu being transmitted from poultry to humans.</P>
      <P>An interministerial ad hoc group was then formed by the Executive
Yuan, which will present a series of measures next month to prevent
an avian flu outbreak in Taiwan, including an increase of qualified
electrical slaughterhouses around the island and educating poultry
vendors and the public how to prevent the disease.</P>
      <P>Some academics believe that the popularity of live poultry
slaughter in Asia's traditional markets causes the transmission of
avian flu.</P>
      <P>Many poultry vendors opposed the policy at the beginning due to
fear that they will lose customers who prefer to buy newly killed
poultry, Taipei city government officials said.</P>
      <P>However, they are now more willing to accept the policy since
they believe that it will attract more clients in the long run, the
official added.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, there are some 400 poultry vendors
selling newly slaughtered poultry in Taipei.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  26 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A poor education system, in addition to
economic factors, has dissuaded many Taiwan people from bearing
children, according to the results of a recent survey released
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kan-lin, an assistant professor at the National Cheng Kung
University's College of Medicine, conducted the survey on Taiwan
people's attitudes toward bearing and raising children.</P>
      <P>According to the results of the telephone survey conducted among
1,033 adults around the country aged between 25 and 44, the three
major factors that dissuade people from bearing children are economic
factors, a confusing education system and deteriorating living
quality.</P>
      <P>Most of the respondents said they believe improving the education
system is the best way to increase the birthrate, followed by
improving social order and the economy, and offering birth subsidies
and child-care services.</P>
      <P>Two kids is still the ideal for most respondents. When asked why
they want to have children, the respondents named several reasons,
such as strengthening the marriage and having a son to carry the
family name.</P>
      <P>Thirty seven percent of the respondents said they plan to marry
at the age of between 30 and 34, with more than half of them wishing
to bear children two or three years after marriage.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TV VIOLENCE RESULT OF DELIBERATE INSTIGATION OF HATRED: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday
that it was a deliberate instigation of hatred that led to a violent
incident that occurred in a live TV talk show Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen was referring to Lin Cheng-chieh, one of the invited guests
and a former legislator of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), who launched a frenzied physical attack on political
commentator Chin Heng-wei after a heated debate on a campaign to
depose President on a Formosa Television talk show. Chin required
five stitches to his face as a result of the assault.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while attending the inauguration ceremony
of the Taiwan Herald Society, a civic group established by
pro-independence Taiwan Society Head Wu Shu-ming. The Taiwan Herald
Society boasts of its Taiwan identity and media professionalism, in
contrast to the mainstream media, which it claims, under the facade
of press freedom, spreads unfounded speculation, tramples the
judicial dignity and creates social rivalry and disturbance.</P>
      <P>Chen greeted Chin, a member of the society, before delivering his
speech.</P>
      <P>The president said he was "saddened" to learn that Chin was
attacked because of his views.</P>
      <P>"This is not purely an issue of suppressing the freedom of speech
of an individual, " Chen said, but is the "result of deliberate
instigation of hatred, confrontation and violence and the expansion
and spreading of such sentiment."</P>
      <P>Chen is facing the prospect of an imminent mass sit-in launched
by Shih Ming-teh, a former chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, to pressure him to step down over a series of
corruption allegations implicating himself, his family members and
senior aides.</P>
      <P>"When politicians, through a passionate incitement of
revolutionary ideas, attempt to force a popularly elected president
to step down and upset constitutional order by using outside
institutional means, a mentality of promoting only those who comply
with one's views and suppressing those who are opposed to one's views
will be naturally formed," he said.</P>
      <P>He said that "to promote a revolution during democratic
constitutional rule is tantamount to a complete denial and slighting
of democracy."</P>
      <P>"To resort to violence and threats under a democracy is to
trample and challenge basic human rights and government authority, "
he added.</P>

he cannot accept the incessant smearing and sensationalist

      <P>The embattled president, who is embroiled in a political storm

journalistic professionalism in contrast to the mainstream media.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that after the peaceful transfer of political power in
2000, misgivings have always outweighed tolerance and rivalry and
confrontation have always outweighed mutual trust.</P>
      <P>"The persistence of these negative sentiments can be attributed
to the difficulty of the ruling and opposition parties in adjusting to
the new political situation, but it is also due to the incessant
instigation of the media, which has replaced differentiation
between right and wrong with its preset stance, and
journalistic professionalism with sensationalist allegations."</P>
      <P>The president said that he cannot accept the incessant smearing

      <P>Chinese tourists are expected to contribute
NT$16 billion per year to Taiwan's private sector spending after
travel restrictions for Chinese citizens are lifted, Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Chairman Hu Sheng-cheng said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>This will mean an increase of 0.1 percentage points in Taiwan's
gross domestic product, Hu said.</P>
      <P>The estimate is based on the assumption that there will be
365,000 Chinese tourist arrivals per year, with each tourist staying
7.61 days on average and spending an average of NT$5,600 per day, Hu
said.</P>
      <P>Hu said that with hotels in Taiwan providing a total of only
21,000 rooms, the government will allow visits by only 1,000 Chinese
tourists per day.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has since 2002 allowed Chinese citizens meeting certain

      <P>DPP politicians and leading pro-independence activists took turns

(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Government planning and support is a
critical role in e-Learning industry development, experts from Japan,
Korea and Taiwan agreed on in an e-Learning international forum
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Korean government offered more help to the e-Learning industry
and the investment showed promising result, as Korea was ranked fifth
-- top in Asian countries -- globally in a 2003 e-Learning world
ranking released by Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Japan were ranked 16th and 23rd, respectively.</P>
      <P>Starting in 1999, Korea's Ministry of Labor offered an 80%
subsidy for workers' e-Learning expenditure, said Kim Young-soon,
President of Korea e-Learning Industry Association. The program
prompted an e-Learning fever among workers.</P>
      <P>"It's the key reason why on-line learning surpassed traditional
learning for the first time in 2004, " said Kim.</P>
      <P>Korea's Ministry of Education also launched "cyber university"
programs in 17 universities in 2000 to encourage e-Learning. There
are more than 55,000 graduates already up to this year, Kim said.</P>
      <P>In Japan, the government also set up and funded e-Learning
programs in selected universities, said Toshio Okamoto, a professor
at University of Electro-Communication.</P>
      <P>More than 86.1% of Japanese corporates with more than 5,000
employees set up e-Learning programs, according to Japan's e-Learning
white paper. "However, Japanese government should do more, compared
to Korea and Taiwan, " admitted Hidekuni Komatsu, President of Japan
e-Learning Consortium.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan, the government also should do more, and it will, said
Lin Li-chieh, Director of Taiwan's e-Park Development Center. A
five-year plan is expected to be launched in 2008 to follow up the
work of National Science and Technology Program for e-Learning.
Taiwan's e-Learning program will focus on bigger corporates, public
servants and teachers and try to bring up the percentage of on-line
learning from 4% to 30% in the future, Lin said.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian lamented Taiwan
media disorder and urged self discipline against irresponsible
journalism from "The Fourth Estate" in the founding ceremony of a
media watch group Saturday.</P>
      <P>"Media is not above the law. And self discipline is better than
other discipline, " Chen addressed the crowd in the founding ceremony
of a media watch group, which has not been given its English name.</P>
      <P>Commenting on his views of how journalism should be and the
current status of Taiwan media, Chen cited the cases of former CBS
anchor Dan Rather and Taiwanese Major League pitcher Wang Chien-ming
and expressed his concerns.</P>
      <P>Rather resigned from his post after citing forged documents to
question U.S. President George W. Bush's military service. Wang
Chien-ming announced two weeks ago that he would not be interviewed
by all Taiwan media thereafter, claiming the media seriously invaded
his parents' privacy.</P>
      <P>With the media nowadays replaces right and wrong with positions,
there is more hatred than tolerance, more confrontation than trust in
Taiwan society, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Many people have called for media regulation, Chen said, but he
always believes that "media control is the beginning of the autarchy"
and the freedom of speech should be respected first and foremost.</P>
      <P>"Maybe I was wrong. And that's why I'm a victim, " he added.</P>
      <P>Chen, referring to the incident that former Legislator Lin
Cheng-chieh assaulted Chin Heng-wei in a Formosa TV political talk
show Wednesday, also described the incident as "a challenge to basic
human rights and public power."</P>
      <P>The president concluded his speech encouraging the media for

    <HEADLINE>DAA'S CAMPAIGN TO OUSTER PRESIDENT TO BEGIN SEPT. 1</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  27  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Democratic Action Alliance (DAA)
announced Sunday that its campaign to drive the scandal-ridden
president, Chen Shui-bian, out of office will officially begin at 7
p.m. on Sept. 1.</P>
      <P>DAA convener Huang Kuang-kuo, a psychology professor at National
Taiwan University, told a press conference at the Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial that the campaign will begin by resuming a round-the-clock
"democracy night market" at the memorial.</P>
      <P>Huang said a ceremony will be held Sept. 2 to "bid farewell to a
god of plague," hoping that Chen would never come back to Taiwan if
he insists on departing Sept. 3 for a visit to Palau and Nauru.</P>
      <P>He said it is "extremely irresponsible" that Chen has decided to
go abroad when he should stay in Taipei to explain to the people what
he intends to do about the long series of corruption and embezzlement
scandals implicating himself, his family and senior aides.</P>
      <P>Huang warned the president that he will be a "destined loser" if
the people of Taiwan take their campaign into the streets.</P>
      <P>"Actually he has already become a loser, with the majority of the
people giving the thumbs down on him," he said.</P>
      <P>Huang urged former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman
Shih Ming-teh, leader of the "One million citizens to depose
President Chen" campaign, to announce as soon as possible when its
followers will begin a round-the-clock sit-in in front of the
Presidential Office, so that the two campaigns can reinforce each
other.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the press conference, Hsu Hsin-liang, another
former DPP chairman, said that Taiwan is not yet a mature democracy,
which is why the people are unable to use a built-in mechanism in the
Constitution to force Chen to resign.</P>
      <P>"Democracy in Taiwan will be strengthened and become more mature
with the success of the campaign to ouster the president," he said.</P>
      <P>Hsu pointed out that the campaign to depose Chen is not a
stand-off between the DPP as a ruling party and the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First Party,
because when Chen steps down, his successor will be Vice President
Annette Lu, meaning the DPP will remain in power.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEADERS OF CAMPAIGN TO DEPOSE CHEN DISAPPOINTED AT PRESIDENT'S REMARKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug.  27 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Leaders of the "1 million citizens to
depose President Chen Shui-bian" campaign said Sunday they now
despair that the president will respond to their call for a clean
government after Chen claimed he was the "victim" of a "smear
campaign" and "irresponsible journalism" a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Ho De-fen, spokeswoman for the campaign, deplored that instead of
explaining what he intended to do with the long series of corruption
and embezzlement scandals surrounding himself, his family and senior
aides, Chen complained in his speech at the inauguration of a civic
organization that the news media's sensationalist allegations and
incessant incitement were to blame for the current crisis he is
facing.</P>
      <P>Ho also expressed regret that the president's remarks Saturday
further alienated Taiwan's society by deepening the confrontation
between ruling and opposition parties.</P>
      <P>She disclosed that campaign leader Shih Ming-teh, a former
chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), and senior staff
will reach a decision before Sept. 6 as to when the campaign to oust
Chen will formally begin.</P>
      <P>Noting that the campaign was originally scheduled to begin Sept.
9, she assured that the new date will not be later than that and
asked supporters of the campaign to be patient.</P>
      <P>The campaign has planned to stage a round-the-clock sit-in Sept.
11-23 in front of the Presidential Office, but local police
authorities have only allowed the protesters to use the streets from
9 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sept. 12-15.</P>
      <P>Campaign organizers said they will appeal that decision and ask
authorities to reconsider their application.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Q2 IC INDUSTRY OUTPUT UP 33.6% FROM 1 YEAR AGO; Q3 PROSPECTS GOOD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  27 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's IC industry production reached
NT$337.1 billion (US$10.25 billion) in the second quarter of this
year, up 33.6 percent over the same period last year and 9.8 percent
from the previous quarter, according to a government think tank.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs' Industrial Technology Research
Institute (ITRI) forecast that third-quarter output will grow to
NT$350.8 billion and annual output will top NT$1,363.3 billion
(US$41.44 billion) in 2006, an increase of 22 percent from 2005.</P>
      <P>According to Peng Mao-jung, an ITRI analyst, since the second
quarter is traditionally a slack season for IC designing and is
affected by a slower market demand for TFT displays and an oversupply
of LCD-driven ICs, most IC-designing companies did not register a
strong performance during the season.</P>
      <P>However, small LCD-driven IC-designing companies were little
affected, recording better sales than during the previous season, he
pointed out.</P>
      <P>Sales of consumer electronic products turned brisk in May, with
IC makers also enjoying good business, enabling IC designers to score
a production value of NT$77.5 billion in the second quarter, an
increase of 6.5 percent from the previous quarter and 19.8 percent
over the same time last year, Peng said.</P>
      <P>IC manufacturing faced a similar situation, churning out an
output in the second quarter -- traditionally a slack season -- that
was 12.5 percent higher than the previous quarter. Contract
chip-making accounted for 5.5 percent of IC manufacturing output.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (TSMC) , the world's
largest contract-chip maker, reported a 5.5 percent growth in the
second quarter over the first, and a yearly growth of 36.9 percent.</P>
      <P>United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) , another of the world's
leading contract-chip makers, scored similar seasonal and yearly
growths for the second quarter -- 5.6 percent and 32.4 percent,
respectively. Profit margins improved and the utilization of its
production capability rose to 80 percent, up slightly from the first
quarter, according to ITRI.</P>
      <P>DRAM business has been the main driving force behind the
substantive growth in Taiwan's IC manufacturing industry in the
second quarter of 2006, Peng said.</P>
      <P>He attributed this to improved production capability and yield of
the DRAM business's 12-inch wafer plants, as well as their improved
production technologies.</P>
      <P>Internationally, major DRAM makers switched some of their
production facilities to producing NAND Flash, bringing down the
supply of DRAM chips and raising DDR and DDR2 prices, according to
the analyst.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's IC manufacturers produced a total of NT$183.9
billion in products during the second quarter of 2006, a whopping
growth of 40.8 percent from the same period in 2005.</P>
      <P>As for the testing and packaging business, he said the second
quarter output registered only single-digit growth from the first
quarter, influenced by the slow recovery in the personal computer
(PC) market. Still, the output figure represented a double-digit
growth from the same time last year, he added.</P>
      <P>The less impressive performance of Taiwan's testing and packaging
business was also due to Microsoft Corp.'s decision to delay
marketing of the new Vista operating system which affected sales of
PCs and peripherals. Slow sales of low-end cellphones also cooled the
demand in testing and packaging of low-end communications chips.</P>
      <P>As a whole, the utilization of the testing and packaging
business's capabilities went down to 80 percent in the second
quarter, but is expected to pick up in the third quarter as PC sales
are anticipated to rise when the academic semester begins in
September.</P>
      <P>For the second quarter, Taiwan's IC-packaging business registered
an output of NT$52.3 billion, up 6.7 percent from the previous
quarter and 27.6 percent year-on-year, with the IC-testing business
registering an output of NT$23.4 billion for a quarterly and yearly
growth of 7.8 percent and 45.3 percent.</P>
      <P>The ITRI forecast that Taiwan's overall IC industry output will
reach NT$350.8 billion in the third quarter, up 4.1 percent from the
second, and that 2006 output will reach NT$1,363.3 billion -- a
22-percent increase over 2005.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP REAFFIRMS 'NO CONFRONTATION' PRINCIPLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will abide by the principles of "no mobilization, no
confrontation" toward an unfolding movement to force President Chen
Shui-bian to step down, an influential lawmaker said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Yeh Yi-jin, who concurrently serves as chief secretary
of the DPP's legislative caucus, made the remarks after two of her
colleagues staged two separate rallies in Taipei the day before to
support the beleaguered president and oppose Shih Ming-teh, a former
DPP chairman who is spearheading a campaign asking for a million
people to each donate NT$100 toward Chen's ouster.</P>
      <P>Yeh said all the rallies in support of Chen were spontaneous
activities that were unrelated to the DPP's legislative caucus or
party headquarters.</P>
      <P>"As the legislature is in summer recess, the DPP caucus has not
been involved in any pro-Chen activities, " Yeh said, adding that she
personally thought it "would not be too bad" if DPP supporters vented
some anger over what they consider to be a rampant
opposition-engineered smear campaign against the president over the
past several months.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Yeh said the DPP's legislative caucus has
invariably refrained from stoking irrational emotions among party
supporters against the opposition's frenzied involvement in the
anti-Chen campaign.</P>
      <P>"Congruent with the DPP headquarters' 'no mobilization, no
confrontation' directive, the DPP caucus is hopeful that both Chen's
supporters and detracters can remain rational, exercise
self-restraint and avoid personal attacks for the sake of social
harmony and national well-being," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>President Chen has been under fire from the opposition and some
former allies for more than four months over allegations that members
of his family and inner circle exploited their proximity to the
executive for illegal financial gain.</P>
      <P>Shih recently announced he will hold a round-the-clock sit-in
near the Presidential Office building early next month to force Chen
to bear political and moral responsibility and to resign over all the
alleged corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>Shih's "one million to depose Chen" campaign has raised passions
and stirred fears of violence, especially after a Shih supporter
kicked and slapped a rival political commentator on a live TV talk
show Thursday.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Wang Shih-chien, who joined with some independence
activists in organizing a pro-Chen rally at 228 Peace Memorial Park
in downtown Taipei near the Presidential Office Saturday, said the
rally was designed for Chen's proponents to express support for the
president.</P>
      <P>"The rally proceeded and ended peacefully. We want Taiwan to grow
with stability and order. We just want Shih to exercise similar
self-restraint and refrain from inciting resentment and social unrest
to rock national stability," Wang said.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Wang Hsing-nan also took more than a thousand
supporters to Shih's office in Taipei Saturday, saying they had
demanded a refund for political donations they made toward Shih's
campaign to become a lawmaker in the 1990s.</P>
      <P>The demonstrators mocked Shih for his claims that he has
collected money from 1 million donors for his current campaign to
depose Chen. Protesters stayed at the site for about an hour and then
left peacefully.</P>
      <P>Also Saturday morning, in Chen's hometown of Kuantien in southern
Tainan County, about 500 supporters gathered in front of a temple,
waving banners of green -- the DPP color -- to voice support for the
embattled president.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAMPAIGN TO DEPOSE PRESIDENT NEEDS SUPPORT OF DPP LAWMAKERS: KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  27  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The success of a campaign to oust
scandal-ridden President Chen Shui-bian will require the support of
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators of conscience and
principle, the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) indicated Sunday.</P>
      <P>Noting that two civic movements aimed at forcing Chen out of
office are set to begin in early September, Legislator Tsai
Chin-lung, a KMT legislative caucus whip, told news media that Chen
is unlikely to buckle under pressure and step down.</P>
      <P>Claiming the DPP as a ruling party lacks the capacity for
self-examination, Tsai said if the campaign to oust the president and
create a clean government is to succeed, it must have the support of
those DPP legislators still in possession of a conscience.</P>
      <P>In response to the Democratic Action Alliance's call on the KMT
and other opposition parties to join the campaign and provide
material support, Tsai said the KMT had in fact begun its own
campaign to oust Chen in June when it proposed a motion in the
legislature to recall the president.</P>
      <P>The recall motion failed to pass a high threshold requiring the
support of a two-thirds majority among all legislators before the
issue could be determined through a national referendum.</P>
      <P>The main opposition KMT and its "pan-blue alliance" ally, the
People First Party, maintain only a slight majority in the 221-seat
legislature.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the KMT has already held more than 1,000 discussion
sessions throughout Taiwan over the past several months, based on the
need to replace Chen's administration with a clean government.</P>
      <P>He added that after the legislature reconvenes Sept. 19, the KMT
will consider a series of strategies to force Chen to step down,
including introducing a legislative motion to topple the Cabinet
through a no-confidence vote, renewing a motion in the legislature to
recall the president and asking the Council of Grand Justices to
impeach him.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EX-PRESIDENT EARNED NT$200 BILLION FOR KMT: TSU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  27 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lee
Teng-hui helped the party earn more than NT$200 billion (US$6.08
billion), the legislative caucus of the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
claimed Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lee Hsien-jen, the caucus' office director, said the main
opposition KMT's recent report on the party's assets had unfairly
stated the former chairman had presided over huge losses on the part
of party-owned enterprises.</P>
      <P>The KMT report "purposely ignored" the fact that during Lee's
term, when he was also president of the country from 1988-2000, huge
sums of money had to be spent on the party's daily operations and its
nominees for various elections, Lee Hsien-jen said.</P>
      <P>He estimated that during that time, more than NT$8 billion was
required annually to keep the party running. Without mentioning where
the funds had come from, the KMT report "intentionally failed" to
mention that Lee had helped the party turn a profit of at least
NT$200 billion, he added.</P>
      <P>He criticized KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's plan to use party
assets -- now standing at NT$27.7 billion -- to pay for party
workers' retirement pensions.</P>
      <P>"If these assets had been obtained through improper means, how
can he make use of them in such a way?" he asked.</P>
      <P>Sources for the party's finances should be limited to membership
dues, government subsidies, political donations and generated from
interest, "and all of the other assets should be seen as
questionable," Lee said.</P>
      <P>He said his party, which considers Lee Teng-hui as its spiritual
leader, has long called for legislation to regulate how political
parties manage their assets.</P>
      <P>The KMT itself should certainly be blamed for boycotting such
legislation, he said, adding that the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party -- which beat the KMT in 2000 -- was also to blame for not
having worked hard enough to pass the bill in the legislature.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO RIVAL CANDIDATES FOR TAIPEI MAYOR SET OUT ON OVERSEAS TRIPS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  27  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two rival candidates running in the
year-end Taipei mayoral election -- Frank Hsieh of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and Hau Lung-pin of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) -- set out on overseas trips Sunday.</P>
      <P>Both Hsieh and Hau said their travel plans were scheduled long
ago and neither agreed with speculation that they are deliberately
going abroad to avoid a looming political storm that may arise from
the launch of a campaign of "one million to depose" President Chen
Shui-bian, spearheaded by former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, a lawyer-turned-politician who previously served as
legislator, Kaohsiung mayor and premier, said prior to his departure
for New York that his U.S. tour is mainly to attend the inauguration
of a Taiwanese expatriate group in support of his bid for Taipei
mayor.</P>
      <P>If possible, Hsieh said. he would like to take time out of his
busy schedule in the U.S. to watch a New York Yankees baseball match
that will be started by Taiwan-born pitcher Wang Chien-ming who has
quickly emerged as a new star in the U.S. Major League, with 15 wins
so far this season.</P>
      <P>Touching on Chinese officials' seizure of Republic of China flags
from two of Taipei's delegates at a children's international sports
tournament in Thailand the day before, Hsieh said he considered it a
very serious incident.</P>
      <P>"Such an act of violence should not be accepted. We should lodge
a solemn protest. We hope the Taipei city government can properly deal
with the incident," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>According to reports from Bangkok, Chinese sports officials
seized ROC flags from two Taipei swimming champions attending the
International Children's Games in Bangkok after they wrapped them
around their shoulders and walked toward a stage to collect their
gold medals Saturday.</P>
      <P>Shortly after Hsieh's departure for the U.S., Hau, former head of
the Environmental Protection Administration, arrived at Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport to check in for a flight to Japan for
a three-day visit.</P>
      <P>Hau said he will visit two Japanese metropolises -- Tokyo and
Yokohama -- to learn from their major urban development projects and
administrative reforms.</P>
      <P>"The findings of my trip will serve as reference for my platform
for the year-end mayoral camapign," Hau said.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he would take part in Shih's upcoming
round-the-clock sit-in near the Presidential Office building to force
the embattled president to resign over corruption allegations against
members of his family and staff, Hau said he personally supports the

    <HEADLINE>NCU SEEKING ENTRANCE TO PAN-STARRS PROJECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 27 (CNA)
(By Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's astronomers are currently seeking a
chance to cooperate with the Pan-Starrs Project based in Hawaii, 
National Central University (NCU) Vice President Ip Wing-huen said 
Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Pan-Starrs project -- Panoramic Survey Telescope &amp; Rapid 
Response System -- aims at spotting large "near-Earth objects" (NEOs),
such as asteroids and comets, that may have perilous consequences if 
they are moving toward Earth. </P>
      <P>In the past, the definition of "large NEOs" meant rocks with a
diameter greater than one kilometer; however, after more careful
calculations, the standard has now been lowered to a diameter larger
than 140 meters -- a size determined as great enough to bring
catastrophe.</P>
      <P>The project has been in operation at the University of Hawaii's
Institute for Astronomy since it obtained congressional funding in
1998. The project's first telescope has been deployed June this year,
and all four telescopes should be operational by 2010.</P>
      <P>Ip said NCU astronomers have found great success in spotting
asteroids, and that if they are accepted as a partner in the
Pan-Starr project, the NCU would be helpful in finding "killer
asteroids" -- a term sometimes used to describe rocks in space
racing towards Earth.</P>
      <P>According to Ip, the university launched Lulin Sky Survey (LUSS)
in March this year, under which the team at Lulin Observatory at Jade
Mountain -- the highest peak in East Asia -- has already discovered
101 NEOs since the beginning of the search -- approximately 15 to 20
new ones per month.</P>

It is against the law to trade on inside

But an analysis of the nation's biggest

      <P>Taiwan strongly criticized China Sunday for
"possessing not even one iota of democratic culture" after Chinese
team officials seized national flags from Taiwanese teenagers
preparing to accept medals at the 2006 International Children's Games
in Thailand Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese athletes had draped Republic of China (ROC) flags
around their shoulders for the award ceremony, but officials from the
Chinese team forcefully yanked the flags from the athletes and even
out of the hands of audience members, according to Chin Fu-tsung, the
deputy mayor of Taipei and leader of the Chinese Taipei delegation to
the sporting event in Bangkok, Thailand.</P>
      <P>Chin has lodged a protest with games organizers and Taipei Mayor
Ma Ying-jeou described it as a "shocking and regrettable" incident
over which he said Taiwan should vehemently protest.</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-tsan, the Executive Yuan's government information
minister, said China is a country that does not know what
sportsmanship is and without "even one iota of democratic culture, "
as it regarded a sporting activity purely from a political
perspective and violated the principle of sportsmanship in a
civilized society.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that China has always adopted a two-pronged strategy
toward Taiwan -- on one hand, it "wears a smiling face" but on the
other it takes fierce, unrelenting steps toward stifling Taiwan's
breathing space in the international community.</P>
      <P>"Now everyone in Taiwan has clearly witnessed China's barbarous
act," he said, urging Taiwan's athletes and sports officials to help
maintain national dignity.</P>
      <P>During a telephone interview with CNA, Chin said when he asked
the Chinese team staff why they had used violence against the
Taiwanese children, a staff member told him, "We have no
alternatives."</P>
      <P>Chin said he had quoted the Chinese team member in his written
protest to the Olympic organizing committee.</P>
      <P>Another Taipei City government official quoted the Chinese team

    <HEADLINE>57% SKEPTICAL ABOUT KMT ASSET REPORT: DPP POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than half of respondents in an opinion
survey are skeptical about the veracity of a party asset report
released by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), a ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lo Cheng-fang, deputy chief executive of the DPP's policy
coordination committee, made the remarks at a seminar on issues
related to rectifying past injustices and huge party assets believed
to have been illegally or improperly amassed by the KMT during its
55-year rule of Taiwan ending in May 2000.</P>
      <P>The DPP conducted the survey from Aug. 21-22 on randomly chosen
adults. A total of 1,073 valid samples were collected, with a margin
of error of 3 percent.</P>
      <P>Nearly 57 percent said they were skeptical about the contents of
a KMT asset report released earlier this month, which claims the
party's assets now stand at NT$27.7 billion.</P>
      <P>Only 20.7 percent said they thought the KMT asset report was
convincing, Lo said, adding that even among the KMT's traditional
supporters, skeptics slightly outnumbered proponents.</P>
      <P>More than 60 percent said they disagreed with the KMT's piecemeal
sale of its estates and other assets, and up to 78 percent said the
KMT should return its ill-gotten party assets to the nation's
coffers.</P>
      <P>Lo noted the KMT and its "pan-blue" ally the People First Party
have blocked a bill aimed at regulating political party assets from
being added to the legislative agenda on a total of 77 occasions.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Lo said the DPP has decided to give
priority to pushing for early completion of the long-overdue
ill-gotten party assets treatment legislation during the new
legislative session set to begin in mid-September.</P>
      <P>To force the KMT to return its ill-gotten party assets to the
nation and the people, Lo said the DPP cannot but initiate a national
referendum on the issue.</P>
      <P>A DPP-led alliance to realize that end will be formed Sept. 4, Lo
said, adding that the alliance will present a proposal to the
Executive Yuan to push for the initiation of a referendum on the

citizens to qualify for holding a referendum in 2007, he added.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the same occasion, Deputy Finance Minister Lee
Jui-chang said the KMT should unveil a comprehensive report detailing
its party assets, liabilities and working capitals to shed light on
changes and flows of its wealth since it moved its seat to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the KMT was not as sinsere and honest as it
claimed in releasing its asset report. The KMT just answered part of
questions previously posed by the watchdog Control Yuan and the
National Property Bureau under the Ministry of Finance, Lee noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VOLUNTEERS PREPARE TO KEEP THE PEACE IN CAMPAIGN TO DEPOSE CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 27 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 100 volunteer peacekeepers braved
heavy rain Sunday afternoon to take part in simulated clashes between
riot police and protesters during the forthcoming round-the-clock
sit-in aimed at driving scandal-ridden President Chen Shui-bian out
of office.</P>
      <P>Conspicuous among the the peacekeepers were a number of Buddhist
nuns, who volunteered to help maintain peace and order during the
sit-in, which begins in early September in front of the Presidential
Office on Ketagalan Boulevard.</P>
      <P>They acknowledged to reporters that they wanted to help the
campaign to depose Chen because they were "disgruntled with the
corruption in the Democratic Progressive Party [DPP] government and
because it lacks the ability for self-examination."</P>
      <P>In a nearly one-hour drill, the volunteer peacekeepers practiced
how to join hands and form a human shield separating protesters from
challengers trying to provoke a fight, as well as how to react if
police use water cannons in an attempt to disperse demonstrators.</P>
      <P>Wang Li-ping, chief coordinator of the campaign of "one million
to oust President Chen," estimated that some 200,000 protesters will
join the sit-in on weekends, and is expected to draw between 8,000
and 10,000 people on weekdays.</P>
      <P>A spokeswoman for the campaign indicated earlier Sunday the
sit-in is expected to formally begin no later than Sept. 9.</P>
      <P>Former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh, who initiated the campaign,
has vowed that he and his supporters will not cease their sit-in
until the president agrees to step down.</P>
      <P>According to an unofficial count kept by television commentators,
the embattled president, his family and senior aides are embroiled in
32 corruption and embezzlement scandals, some of which are being
investigated by public prosecutors.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FLAG-SEIZING BEIJING OFFICIALS PETTY-MINDED: TAIPEI OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The "petty-minded" act of Chinese
delegation officials who seized Republic of China national flags from
teen-aged Taiwan athletes at the International Children's Games (ICG)
in Thailand has damaged sportsmanship and demonstrated their rudeness
and barbarity, Deputy Taipei Mayor Chin Fu-tsung said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chin made his remarks upon arriving back from Bangkok, Thailand
where he witnessed Chinese team officials seizing the national flags
from Taiwan athletes preparing to accept medals.</P>
      <P>After he protested with games organizers, they decided that all
winners must not carry their national flags when they receive medals.</P>
      <P>Chin said the ICG charter does not prohibit winners from draping
their national flags around their shoulders when they step on the
podium to accept medals.</P>
      <P>The Chinese officials' small-minded behavior on the international
occasion was disgusting as it served only to spoil the peaceful
atmosphere in which teen-agers from different countries and cultural
backgrounds were making friends with each other by competing in
sports events, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's young athletes, who had won four golds, one silver and
two bronzes, were not affected by the unhappy incident as they
continued to have pleasant exchanges with athletes from other
countries, he reported.</P>
      <P>He estimated that Taiwan athletes could win two more gold medals
at the games Monday. The games are held for people aged between 13
and 15.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT TRAVEL GROUP FORMED TO PAVE WAY FOR TOURIST OPENING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The long way toward the goal of allowing
Chinese citizens to make sightseeing trips to Taiwan took a crucial
step forward Sunday with the creation of a quasi-official travel
association to handle relevant negotiations with China.</P>
      <P>The new organization -- the Taiwan Strait Tourism Association
(TSTA) -- will be in charge of talks with its Chinese counterpart --
the Baijing-based China Tourism Association -- on technical details
regarding Taiwan's opening to Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>The TSTA will have a paid-in capital of NT$1 million, with the
government contributing NT$500,000 and five major travel services
associations investing NT$100,000 each.</P>
      <P>A donors meeting was held Sunday, during which nine board
directors were elected, with four from government agencies and five
from the private sector. The board members then elected from among
themselves Hsu Wen-sheng, director-general of the Tourism Bureau
under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, to
concurrently serve as TSTA chairman of the board.</P>
      <P>All of the four board directors representing the government are
officials in charge of tourism and travel matters -- Hsu, Tourism
Bureau Deputy Director Lai Se-chen, Wu Chao-yen, a Tourism Bureau
division chief, and Wu Hsueh-yen, deputy director of the Immigration
Bureau under the National Police Agency.</P>
      <P>No official from the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) , which charts Taiwan's policy on China affairs, will seat on
the TSTA board of directors.</P>
      <P>Hsu said after the donors' meeting that the new organization, to
be housed in the Tourism Bureau building, will be formally
inaugurated after completing registration with the Ministry of the
Interior in the near future.</P>
      <P>"The TSTA will contact its Chinese counterpart immediately after
its inauguration on the schedule for bilateral negotiations on the
tourist opening measures, " Hsu said, adding that the chief delegate
to the talks will be determined depending on the topics to be
addressed.</P>
      <P>Hsu said he personally hopes that all relevant talks can be
finalized by the end of this year. He was quoted as having said
previously that the first-round talks could start in mid-September
and his deputy Lai Se-chen may represent Taiwna in the talks. But the
MAC later denied such reports, stressing that the timing and the
chief delegate for the tourism opening talks have yet to be decided.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the new association will be responsible for tourist
exhcnage talks only and is not authorized to touch on issues
regarding the opening of direct cross-strait charter flights.</P>
      <P>As China refuses any official contact with Taiwan, the two sides
have to set up quasi-official travel associations to negotiate and
manage the issue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ROC Travel Agent Association (TAA), which has been
responsible for laying the groundwork for tourist opening, said it
has completed its "trailblazing" function. Hereafter, the association
said, it will play a supporting role, taking charge of delivering
travel papers, allocation of travel quotas, management of the
absconding prevention deposits and discipline of travel agents. The
TAA head is among the five TSTA board directors representing the
private travel sector.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan's plan, a maximum of 1,000 Chinese tourists
will be allowed to enter Taiwan per day for a maximum 10-day stay.
Chinese tourists are required to "enter and leave in group, " and the
host Taiwan travel agency will be fined NT$200,000 for each absconded
Chinese tourist.</P>
      <P>To ensure travel quality, travel agencies must sign up a
discupline agreement. Any travel agency that violates the minimum
daily travel expenses of US$80-to-US$100 will have its tourist quota
allocation suspended for one month.</P>

      <P>Between 2007 and 2009, Cheng said, the "flagship initiatives"

      <P>During the visit, some foreign spouses complained that they have

one thing, they said they have to wait for a long period of time --
eight years for those from China and three years for those from

to produce financial statements proving they have a deposit of at

      <P>In response, Chen said all countries, including the United

    <DATELINE>New York, Aug. 27 (CNA)
(By Huang Jaw-pyng and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China has been the only obstacle blocking
Taiwan from becoming a member of the United Nations and from
expanding its relations with the international community, a Taiwan
diplomat posted in New York said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, however, has not been daunted by China's diplomatic
suppression and has always believed that if a consensus is reached in
the international community on Taiwan's cause, then the country's bid
to join the U.N. will be successful, said Andrew Hsia, director of
the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New York.</P>
      <P>Hsia made the remarks in a speech to a gathering of Taiwan
community leaders in the greater New York area hosted by the Global
Alliance for Democracy and Peace.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's bid to enter the U.N., which has failed each year since
1993, has, however, drawn increasing attention from the international
community, Hsia said, adding that Taiwan will submit two proposals
this year as it did last year.</P>
      <P>In its failed bid in 2005, Taiwan called for the U.N. to help
maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait and for the international body to
pay attention to the representation of Taiwan's 23 million people at
the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Citing recent public opinion polls as indicating that some 70
percent of the Taiwan people are in favor of the government bidding
to gain U.N. membership under the name of "Taiwan," Hsia said he will
press with this bid, using whatever name determined by the Taipei
authorities.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has used the title "the Republic of China" in its U.N.
bids for the past 13 years. All attempts have failed due to the
intervention and opposition of Beijing.</P>
      <P>The ROC has been shut out of the United Nations since 1971, when
U.N. Resolution No. 2758 gave the China seat to Beijing at Taiwan's
expense. While Resolution No. 2758 resolved the issue regarding
China's U.N. representation, it did not address the representation of
Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>Hsia said Taiwan is a sovereign state which has the right to ask
that the United Nations face squarely the fact of Taiwan's existence
and the basic rights of its people.</P>
      <P>"In terms of the principle of universality prescribed in the U.N.
charter, the U.N. cannot ignore the issue regarding peace in the
Taiwan Strait as well as the voice of the Taiwan people, " he
asserted.</P>
      <P>Hsia, who has been playing a major role as Taiwan's voice in its
U.N. bid, is scheduled to be interviewed on the "Asian America"
program on the N.Y. television station WNYE-TV Monday to talk about
the progress of Taiwan's "U.N. movement."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Monday that Taiwan's diplomatic allies in South Pacific have not
caved in to Chinese pressure and that President Chen Shui-bian will
visit two of the allies in the region Sept. 3-6 as scheduled.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Michel Lu made the remarks while attending a news
conference held by the Government Information Office on the publicity
drive of Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Lu was responding to reports that quoted diplomatic sources as
saying that with China actively soliciting Taiwan's allies in the
South Pacific, the ministry has been watching the situation
closely to avoid a repetition of Chad incident, referring to Taiwan's
severance of diplomatic ties with Chad on the eve of Premier Su
Tseng-chang's scheduled visit in early August after learning that the
African country was about to establish diplomatic ties with China.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that Taiwan's six allies in the South Pacific have not
caved in as the report said and that the president will depart as
scheduled on Sept. 3 for Palau for a summit meeting with the heads of
state of the allies the next day.</P>
      <P>The president will then proceed to Nauru Sept. 5 before returning
to Taiwan Sept. 6, he said.</P>
      <P>However, Lu also urged the public not to expect goodwill from
China, especially in the diplomatic arena.</P>
      <P>China has always been relentless in scuttling Taiwan's relations
with its allies, Lu said, adding that the ministry will do everything
possible to try to cement its relations with its allies.</P>
      <P>Asked which of Taiwan's South Pacific diplomatic allies Beijing
has been targeting, Lu said China's obstruction efforts have not been
confined to the South Pacific alone and have been directed at all of
Taiwan's 24 allies around the world.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China has stepped up its efforts to win the
hearts and minds of Taiwanese youth, Huang Wei-feng, vice chairman of
the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), said Monday.</P>
      <P>Huang said China regards Taiwan youths as a major factor in
dictating the island's future direction, and it has therefore made
"wooing Taiwan youths" as one of its major tasks.</P>
      <P>He noted that Beijing authorities have stepped up their efforts
through various channels over the past several years. They have used
China's emerging economic power to offer subsidies in hosting Taiwan
students visiting the country for various exchanges with their
mainland counterparts, he said.</P>
      <P>The exchange activities have included visits to scenic spots,
famous universities and the hometowns of the Taiwan youths'
ancestors, as well as activities related to the 2008 Olympic Games,
Huang said.</P>
      <P>"China hopes to lure Taiwan students to study in China and to
promote a sense of identification with China among Taiwan students, "
he pointed out.</P>
      <P>He said that China has a series of policies, such as promoting
exchanges, recruiting Taiwan students and providing job
opportunities, that have a long-term political aim.</P>
      <P>He noted that several thousand Taiwan youths have visited China
to take part in such exchange programs this summer, and the sponsors
have covered civic groups affiliated with the Communist Party of
China and the Chinese government.</P>
      <P>"This shows that China has mobilized every organization to
promote its efforts to woo Taiwan youths," Huang added.</P>
      <P>Faced with China's systematic offensive targeting Taiwan youths,
Huang said Taiwan will address the question by nurturing the concept
of Taiwan's separate identity from China through its educational
system.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan will also encourage more Chinese students to come to
Taiwan for exchanges so that they will learn more about the island's
academic freedom, political democratization and pluralistic society,"
he said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should strive to join the Convention
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women
(CEDAW) adopted in 1979 by the U.N. General Assembly, a women's group
said Monday.</P>
      <P>It's a pity that Taiwan -- which boasts the highest gender
development index (GDI) in Asia and ranks high in the world in terms
of gender empowerment measure (GEM) -- has not joined CEDAW, which
has been signed by national women's groups from 183 countries around
the world, said Chen Man-li, chairwoman of the National Union of
Taiwan Women's Associations (NUTWA).</P>
      <P>Chen urged the government to enable Taiwan's women as a whole to
join the CEDAW as a state party in the convention, which is often
described as an international bill of rights for women.</P>
      <P>She said that although Taiwan has formidable political barriers
to cross to accede to a U.N. organization, it is the government's
duty to enable Taiwan to ratify CEDAW, which accepts non-U.N. member
countries in a category known as "state parties."</P>
      <P>Chen made the call during a NUTWA-sponsored international
workshop on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against
women.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the workshop, Minister of the Interior Lee
Yi-yang said that although Taiwan's accession to CEDAW might also be
obstructed by Beijing, it is the right of the Taiwan people to voice
their expectations to the international community.</P>
      <P>Lee said it is the administration's responsibility to enable
NUTWA to accede to CEDAW to reflect the people's basic rights.</P>
      <P>He promised that until CEDAW accession is achieved, the Ministry
of the Interior will strive to eliminate all forms of discrimination
against Taiwan's women in accordance with the CEDAW criteria.</P>
      <P>During the two-day CEDAW workshop, several experts from abroad,
including Denise Scotto, vice chairwoman of the NGO Committee on the
Status of Women, and Nancy E. Wallance, an expert in international
advocacy in mental health, will share their experiences in promoting
CEDAW efforts with their Taiwan audience, according to Chen.</P>

(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's devotion and success in promoting
women's rights is obvious, and this is why Taiwan should be accepted
as a party to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all
forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) , a women's group said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan ranks in the top 30 among 177 countries in two of the most
important women's rights indexes -- 24th in the Gender Development
Index (GDI) and 19th in the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM) , said
Mary Chen, chairwoman of National Alliance of Taiwan Women's
Associations (NATWA).</P>
      <P>"The success and hard work has been ignored as Taiwan is not yet
a member state of CEDAW, which has been signed by 183 countries,
because of political factors," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government has made its move. Premier Su Tseng-tsang
approved a proposal for Taiwan to seek to join the CEDAW in July, and
the proposal will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan in the next
session for ratification, Interior Minister Lee Yi-yang has said.</P>
      <P>According to a NATWA release, the CEDAW is one of three U.N.
conventions that accept non-U.N. members, which means it's possible
for Taiwan to become a party of the convention barring political
interference by China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's ratification of the convention, in the meantime, shows
that the government has the ability and determination to fulfill its
duties in the international community -- even if it is not a U.N.
member yet, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The CEDAW, adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 1979, is often
described as an international bill of rights for women. The
convention defines what constitutes discrimination against women and
sets up an agenda for national action to end such discrimination.</P>
      <P>To promote understanding of the convention, NATWA is conducting a
two-day international conference from Aug. 28-29. Denise Scotto, vice
chairwoman of the U.N.'s NGOCSW (Committee of the Status on Women) ,
and Nancy Wallace, main representative of World Federation for Mental
Health at the U.N. headquarters, have been invited as speakers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) filed a lawsuit against National Police Agency (NPA)
Director-General Hou You-yi and three Tainan prosecutors Monday,
charging them with dereliction of duty and destroying evidence in
connection with the March 19, 2004 shooting of President Chen
Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chin-lung, caucus secretary-general, said the charges were
based on a report of the legislature's special committee
investigating the shooting, a case that the government had closed
after blaming it on a lone alleged shooter named Chen Yi-hsiung.</P>
      <P>Chen was found dead 10 days after the incident in Tainan, the
city where the incident took place. His family has raised questions
concerning his death and has accused police investigators of forcing
them to give false testimonies.</P>
      <P>Lawyer Sun Yu-hui, acting on behalf of the KMT caucus, quoted the
special committee's report, which was published Aug. 22, as raising
four major points of suspicion concerning the police probe and
prosecution of the case:</P>
      <P>-- The National Security Bureau (NSB) on March 18, 2004 had
information that an attempt to assassinate the president might be in
the offing, information that security officers like Hou knew and yet
failed to pursue.</P>
      <P>-- The bullets found in the jeep in which the president and the
vice president were shot at and those found at Chi Mei Hospital where
the two were treated were of different caliber and therefore could
not be determined to have been fired from the same pistol.</P>
      <P>-- The pants and underwear that the president wore on that day
did not have any gunshot holes or bloodstains, but Hou and the
investigators he led ignored and hid this critical piece of evidence,
a move that can be seen as "misleading the direction" of the
investigation.</P>
      <P>-- Hou and his investigative team deliberately adopted the
strategy of using the bullets to trace the gun and using the gun to
trace its owner, without ever attempting to find evidence to prove
that the shooting could have been a "self-directed" drama, concluding
that Chen Yi-hsiung was the only suspect and closing the case based
on this sloppy conclusion.</P>
      <P>In fact, Sun quoted the report as pointing out, many questions
remain with regard to Chen's death, further indicating that Hou and
his team did not try to seek the truth about the shooting.</P>
      <P>Hou at the time was the criminal police chief. He was later
promoted to his current position.</P>
      <P>Also being sued are Tainan District Prosecutor's Office Chief
Prosecutor Liu Wei-tzung, as well as prosecutors Wang Sen-jung and
Kuo Chen-ni, who was spokeswoman for the special investigative team.</P>
      <P>Sun said these four officials are suspected of having committed
the offenses of malfeasance and destroying evidence. Under the
criminal code, they could be sentenced heavily if found guilty, Sun
added.</P>
      <P>Hou would not respond to the accusation except to say he had
asked the Criminal Investigation Bureau to give "professional"
answers to the legislative committee's questions.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Regulation of the law is the last line of
defense in terms of gender equity and respect is the key word in
solving issues like sexual crime, sexual harassment and employment
discrimination, a women's rights advocate said Monday.</P>
      <P>"In that sense, gender equity education may be the most important
task for us, although women also need the protection of the law at
all times, " said Ku Yen-lin, Director of the Taipei Public Service
Institute, on the sidelines of an international conference of U.N.
Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against
Women (CEDAW.)</P>
      <P>Since the establishment of the Committee for Promotion of Women's
Rights under the Executive Yuan in 1997, Yen said, the passage of
bills such as the Sexual Harassment Prevention Law, Sexual Crime Law,
Domestic Violence Prevention Law and Gender Equity Education Act has
provided more protection than before for women.</P>
      <P>But those bills focus on details and punishments, she
said.</P>
      <P>"Do we really need a law to tell us which parts of a woman's body
a man can and cannot touch or what a man should and should not say to
a woman? " she asked, adding that there have been many problems
regarding the implementation of the laws.</P>
      <P>Integration of the law should be done as well, Yen said. For
example, it is sometimes confusing that the issue of sexual
harassment is regulated by three different bills.</P>
      <P>"Government policy should be goal-oriented and priorities should
be established, " she said, adding that the protection of "new

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is
"seriously considering" pushing for Taiwan's entry into the United

      <P>Responding to a reporter's question at a news conference as to
whether Taiwan is bidding to gain U.N. membership under the name of
"Taiwan" this year, Michel Lu, the MOFA secretary-general who doubles

the options in this effort.</P>
      <P>Lu added that this "Taiwan option" was proposed by MOFA after
conducting strenuous discussions with academics and U.N.
representatives of Taiwan's allies and has been approved by the
Executive Yuan for implementation.</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-tsang, Executive Yuan spokesman, claimed at the news

bids for the past 13 years and all attempts at entry have failed due

      <P>The ROC has been shut out of the United Nations since 1971, when
U.N. Resolution No. 2758 gave the China seat to Beijing at Taiwan's
expense. While Resolution No. 2758 resolved the issue regarding

    <HEADLINE>DPP LAWMAKER WANTS 'MEANS WITHIN INSTITUTION' FOR OUSTING PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A lawmaker of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) reiterated Monday his opposition to a
campaign launched by Shih Ming-teh, a former DPP chairman, to depose
President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lee Wen-chung was referring to an imminent mass
sit-in on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office to
pressure the embattled president to resign over a spate of corruption
and embezzlement allegations implicating himself, his family members
and senior aides.</P>
      <P>Lee noted at a news conference in the Legislative Yuan that there
are ways within the institution to oust the president so that a
democracy will not fall prey to frenzied passion.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that democracy relies on regular elections and that
only such institutional means as a recall or impeachment can force
the president to step down, adding that the design of such is to
ensure the stability of constitutional democracy.</P>
      <P>"Only when constitutional or legal means cannot function is it
necessary to use channels outside the institution," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen survived an opposition-initiated recall vote in the
legislature June 27 because it failed to gather the endorsement of
two-thirds of the legislators to put it to a national referendum.
Opposition parties have complained that the threshold for recalling a
president is too high, noting that Chen won the 2004 presidential
election by only slightly more than 50 percent of the votes.</P>
      <P>Lee continued that when the "anti-Chen" sentiment is gathering
momentum to the level of being big enough to unsettle, if not unseat,
Chen, it is very likely that serious confrontation will erupt.</P>
      <P>On grounds of constitutional provisions and social price, Lee
said he is opposed to Shih's "depose Chen" campaign.</P>
      <P>But he also said that instead of attacking Shih, as some DPP
politicians have done, the DPP's best response to Shih's drive would
be to remain quiet so that society will see that the DPP
has begun genuine self-reflection. The party's popularity has
plummeted following a series of high-profile corruption cases
that came to light early this year.</P>
      <P>Lee also said that as a ruling party, it should provide the
maximum convenience for the participants for the mass sit-in so that
it can end peacefully without confrontation.</P>

      <P>August's consumer confidence dropped to the
lowest level since December 2001, with the confidence in the economic
prospects for the next six months suffering the greatest loss from
the previous month, according to the results of a survey released
Monday.</P>
      <P>The consumer confidence index (CCI) fell to 67.67 in August, a
drop of 0.26 from July, according to the Research Center for Taiwan
Economic Development of the National Central University.</P>
      <P>Of the six major indicators, it said, only the interest to buy
durable goods over the next six months rose slightly, by 0.3 points,
to 117.30 from last month, while all other indicators fell.</P>
      <P>The confidence in the next half-year's economic prospects fell
0.7 from July to 52.05 points, the biggest retreat, which was
followed by confidence in employment, which dropped 0.65 points to
74.95.</P>
      <P>The indicator of the coming six months' family economic situation
went down 0.3 points to 55, while that of domestic consumer prices
was down 0.15 points to 39.4. Consumer confidence in the stock market
declined 0.1 points to 67.3 points.</P>
      <P>Of the six indicators, those on the family economy and domestic
consumer prices fell to the lowest levels since January 2001, when
the center began the monthly survey.</P>
      <P>The CCI index and the indicator on the economic prospects were
the lowest since December 2001, an indication that the public is not
confident in the nation's economic prospect while international oil
and commodity prices remain high.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted Aug. 18-21 among 2,689 people aged 20 or

      <P>Social welfare officials in Taoyuan County,
northern Taiwan took a toddler away from a single father Monday who
left her at home alone.</P>
      <P>The two-year-old was taken in by a foster family, officials said.</P>

will be allowed to visit her daughter weekly but will only be allowed
to take her home again after he is capable of taking good care of
her, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The toddler was found living in a second-floor apartment with her
father, who is a truck driver and spends most of his time working. He
supplied food and water to his daughter using a crude pulley
arrangement when he happened to pass by.</P>
      <P>The father said he used the pulley arrangement because he was
"too busy" to enter the apartment and if he went in, his daughter
"would not let him out again."
The toddler's plight was discovered Sunday by a neighbor who heard

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Monday she
respects the media as the "fourth estate" in a democratic society,
but added her hopes that Taiwan's media will stop being "mirrors of
distortion" in which truth is distorted.</P>
      <P>Speaking to the media after visiting Miaoli officials at the
Miaoli county government's headquarters, Lu said she would not shut
herself away from dailies and television since she is very concerned
about things happening at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, she called for the media not to downgrade
themselves into "mirrors of distortion" or "magic mirrors, " in which
no truth is reflected and she urged the media to exercise
self-discipline when reporting news to truly reflect society and
people's mindsets.</P>
      <P>When asked about former Democratic Progressive Party Chairman
Shih Ming-teh's initiation of a "1 million people campaign to depose
President Chen Shui-bian " to be staged early next month, Lu said she

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A spokeswoman for a campaign to depose
President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that the campaigners will not be
"intimidated" after a device they suspected might be a bomb was found
outside the campaign headquarters in downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>He Teh-feng said the staff of the headquarters found a black
computer bag outside the headquarters and reported it to the police
as suspicious. Police later confirmed that the bag contained no
suspicious substances.</P>
      <P>The spokeswoman claimed that the placing of an unidentified
object outside the headquarters was aimed at obstructing the
campaign's upcoming sit-in in front of the Presidential Office to
pressure President Chen to resign over a spate of corruption and
embezzlement allegations implicating himself, his family members and
senior aides.</P>
      <P>The act was also aimed at creating the possibility of violent
clashes, according to the spokeswoman. Shih has repeatedly said that
the sit-in will be peaceful.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a DPP official questioned the incident, saying it
could have been "staged" by Shih's headquarters.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-liang, deputy secretary-general of the DPP, said a
"forgotten bag" had been exaggerated to the point of being a
suspected explosive device. The calling out of a police bomb squad by
police and airing the incident on TV were a tremendous waste of
money, he added.</P>
      <P>Tsai alleged that Shih's headquarters had a two-fold purpose in
staging the event -- to put the blame on the DPP to further smear the
party and to build up momentum for the sit-in scheduled for Sept.
9.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, police questioned a man surnamed Tsai, who was
identified via CCTV as the person who placed the object in the early
hours of the morning, to find out his motives in placing the bag at

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A survey found that both political and
economic confidence indexes have fallen for three months in a row,
with public confidence in domestic political stability declining by a
substantive margin, probably owing to high-level corruption scandals
and campaigns to depose the president.</P>
      <P>The Global View Monthly magazine published its August survey on
the Taiwan Public Mood Index (TPMI) Monday, which showed that both
the political confidence index (PCI) and the economic confidence
index (ECI) have fallen for three consecutive months, to 36.3 and
31.5 respectively.</P>
      <P>The PCI dropped 3.2 points from the previous month and the ECI
shed 0.9 points for a composite TPMI fall of 2.1 points to 33.9
points, indicating that politics have played a greater role than
economics in souring the public mood in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In terms of PCI, people's trust in the ruling party or Ruling
Side Trust Index (RSTI) fell to 35.2 while political optimism index
(POI) fell to 38.1, signifying the public's low confidence in the
ruling party's performance.</P>
      <P>The indicator on their expectations of next month's domestic
political stability (or outlook index) declined 4.4 points to 26.1,
as they turned increasingly pessimistic about Taiwan's political
future.</P>
      <P>In terms of ECI, the economic optimism index (EOI) of 37.4 is
higher than the current economic situation index (CESI) of 25.6, but
both remained in negative territory -- under 50.</P>
      <P>The current personal finance index (34.2) is higher than the
current domestic economy index (16.9) . Again, both are in the
negative territory. And the personal financial improvement index
(40.6) is higher than the domestic economic improvement index (34.1),
as both received negative evaluations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EDUCATION OFFICIAL EXPLAINS MEASURE OF DISSOLVING MINI SCHOOLS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 28 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) explained
Monday a controversial measure to dissolve "mini elementary schools"
-- schools with a total number of students less than 100 -- in order
to increase class sizes, which ministry officials claimed are "more
helpful" for interactive learning.</P>
      <P>The explanation was made in a response to an article published in
the September edition of the Global Views Monthly, a general-interest
current affairs magazine.</P>
      <P>The article, titled "My School Disappears; So Difficult to Have A
School To Study, " revealed the results of a survey showing that
since 1999, the government has dissolved more than 100 public
elementary schools due to lack of students.</P>
      <P>Because of the closures, some students are forced to travel long
distances to another school, while some have to reside far from home
to get an education, the article said.</P>
      <P>The article claimed that abolishing mini schools not only affects
the will of the students to learn, but also leads to a gradual
disappearance of the culture of remote communities that have to send
their children to bigger towns for schooling.</P>
      <P>It will become more and more difficult for children living in
remote areas to be well educated, the article claimed, urging the
MOE to stop the measure which it claimed was formed to reduce
spending and ease financial pressure on local governments.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Education Wu Tsai-shun denied the reason for
abolishing small primary schools is to save money.</P>
      <P>Wu claimed that the measure was carried out based on the concern
that young students need to have "interaction with classmates" and a
stimulation of different cultures" to achieve better learning.</P>
      <P>To the school kids who have to travel long to reach a school, the
government offers accommodation and travel subsidies for children
forced to go to school away from their homes and families, he added.</P>
      <P>According to official statistics, there were 566 mini elementary
schools in Taiwan in 2005. Students of these schools totalled 36,377,
the tallies show.</P>
      <P>The schools are faced with a destiny of disbandment under the MOE
existing policy of breaking up mini schools. </P>
      <P>The measure, however, will not apply to small schools that are
the only ones in a town or village, the only ones serving indigenous
populations, or ones located in areas where there are major travel
problems, such as mudslide-prone areas, Wu said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Eden Social Welfare Foundation and
Global Views Monthly magazine have jointly set up a venture capital
fund to save "mini elementary schools" in Taiwan's remote areas
from being dissolved because of financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>The two private organizations announced Monday the establishment
of a charitable venture fund aimed at generating at least NT$10
million -- an amount sufficient to support the operations of four to
10 small, remote primary schools, whose students number less than
100.</P>
      <P>Yang Ma-li, editor-in-chief of the Taipei-based magazine,
indicated that the bid to save the schools was triggered by the
government's attempt to close them.</P>
      <P>Under the measure, 35 elementary schools would no longer exist as
of the new semester in September, Yang cited a magazine survey as
saying, noting some schools would be directly dissolved and others
downgraded into a branch facility of other schools.</P>
      <P>Since 1999, 144 elementary schools have been disbanded because of
the lack of students, Yang said, arguing the measure has "deprived
children in remote areas of their right to an education" because "it
is so difficult for them to go to school."</P>
      <P>When their schools close, most students are forced to travel long
distances to another school, while others must live far from home to
pursue an education, according to an article published in the
magazine's September edition.</P>
      <P>As a result, some students whose schools are disbanded would
rather give up schooling than leave home, said the article, entitled
"My School Disappears; So Difficult to Have a School to Study."</P>
      <P>Members of the public are urged to donate toward the fund to
support the "mini schools."</P>

With the economy beginning to slow, the

      <P>According to recent opinion surveys, the president's approval
ratings have plunged to about 18 percent, mainly because Chen, his
wife, son-in-law and senior aides have been embroiled in more than 30
corruption and embezzlement scandals, some of which have entered
legal proceedings.</P>
      <P>Shih noted that the campaign of "one million people to depose
Chen" has already collected more than NT$110 million in only seven
days, with more than 1 million people each donating NT$100 (US$3).</P>
      <P>"The people of Taiwan have demonstrated their determination to
fight against corruption; this will provide the force necessary to
help Taiwan rebuild a clean government," he said.</P>
      <P>Shih urged the campaign's supporters not to bring any national or
party flags to the sit-in for fear they may distort the campaign's
primary objectives: public opposition to corruption and calling for
the president to step down.</P>
      <P>He explained that the presence of such flags at the sit-in may
give those in power grounds for leveling false accusations against
the campaign by claiming the demonstration is a showdown between
rival political parties or between pro-independence and
pro-unification groups.</P>
      <P>Commenting on verbal abuse and insults heaped upon him by DPP
legislators and supporters, Shih said no such assaults would bring
him down -- only make him more determined to carry on with the
campaign.</P>
      <P>The former DPP chairman, who was imprisoned twice between 1962
and 1989 -- for a total of 25 years under the Kuomintang's (KMT)
previous authoritarian regime -- called on KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
to not just sit idly by and wait for the campaign's labor to bear
fruit, but to actively support it.</P>
      <P>Ma, who doubles as Taipei mayor, and his police chiefs have the
authority to approve or deny Shih's application to use Ketegalan
Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office as the site of the
sit-in.</P>
      <P>In April 2004, Ma ordered police to disperse anti-Chen protesters
from Ma's own party and the KMT's ally -- the People First Party --
because they had overstayed the allowed period of time. It is unclear
whether he will do the same again this time toward Shih's campaign.</P>
      <P>Shih and Ma appear to be on a collision course, as Shih has vowed
repeatedly that his round-the-clock sit-in from Sept. 9 will persist
until the president resigns, while local police authorities have only
allowed campaign organizers to use the streets in front of the
Presidential Office from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sept. 12-15.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HIGH-SPEED RAIL TO HIRE 52 FOREIGN TRAIN CONDUCTORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.   28  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs gave
permission to Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) Monday to hire 52
train conductors and 18 technical advisers from abroad for a period
of no more than two years.</P>
      <P>A CLA spokesman said the permission was granted after THSRC
indicated in an application that it does not have enough locally
trained conductors to operate the trains, now that the high-speed
rail service is set to begin by the end of October.</P>
      <P>The foreign train conductors will undergo a brief training
enabling them to obtain a license from the Ministry of Transportation
and Communication before they are authorized by the CLA to begin
working.</P>
      <P>THSRC has agreed to pay each conductor about NT$100,000 per
month, well above the minimum monthly wage required by law of
NT$48,000 for white-collar foreign workers.</P>
      <P>The CLA spokesman pointed out that THSRC will be required to
phase out foreign train conductors in two years as locally trained
conductors take over the positions in stages.</P>
      <P>He said the first group of Taiwanese train conductors are
expected to complete training and receive licenses in eight months.</P>
      <P>The 345-km railway linking Taipei and Kaohsiung will reduce
travel time between Taiwan's two largest cities to about 90 minutes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA URGED TO BE MORE PRAGMATIC TOWARD CROSS-STRAIT TRADE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China should be more pragmatic toward
commercial exchanges across the Taiwan Strait for mutual benefits,
Premier Su Tseng-chang said Monday.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks while meeting with senior executives of the
European Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT), who suggested that Taiwan
further ease restrictions on cross-strait economic exchanges,
including opening its market wider to Chinese products.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is willing to hold trade consultations with
China under the World Trade Organization (WTO) framework to pave way
for Taiwan's further opening to imports from China, Su said China has
stubbornly refused to sit down to talks with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Su said, China has continued to try to suppress Taiwan
diplomatically, politically and economically. Against this backdrop,
Su said the ROC government has been compelled to impose some
restrictions on China-bound investments. "Our measures have not gone
beyond normal limits, " he added. </P>
      <P>Given the facts that China has deployed hundreds of missiles
targeting Taiwan and that 70 percent of Taiwan's overseas investments
is in China, Su said cannot afford to adopt a laissez -faire attitude
toward China-bound investments.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, ECCT executives questioned fairness of the
ROC government's procurement bidding. Su said the government has
consistently followed the "fair and reciprocal" principles in
handling its major procurement projects.</P>
      <P>ECCT Chairman Ralf Scheller said European countries are
interested in Taiwan's service industry development and also intend
to further expand their market shares in Taiwan and to expand into
other neighboring Asian countries.</P>
      <P>The two sides also exchanged views on implementation of Taiwan's
WTO entry terms, perceived import barriers and upgrading of Taiwan's
competitive edges in the financial service market.</P>
      <P>Su directed the Council for Economic Planning and Development to
keep close contact with the ECCT to boost mutual understanding and
cooperation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEARLY 800 MISSILES DEPLOYED BY CHINA AGAINST TAIWAN: MND REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China had deployed 784 Dongfeng-series
short-range ballistic missiles against Taiwan as of the end of 2005,
with the number increasing by between 75 and 100 every year, the
Ministry of National Defense (MND) said in its annual national
defense report released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the missiles are capable of reaching
Taiwan proper about seven minutes after launch.</P>
      <P>The MND estimates that China's military buildup has focused on
upgrading the precision of its guided and cruise missiles so as to be
able to make precise attacks on specific political and military
targets in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The report noted that China has in recent years actively
introduced advanced weaponry systems and technology, including Sukhoi
high-performance fighters, AWAC planes, large transportation planes,
Kilo-class submarines, and Sovremennyy-class destroyers.</P>
      <P>These, coupled with upgraded ballistic and cruise missiles as
well as domestically-designed weaponry systems, have gradually
shifted the military balance in the Taiwan Strait in China's favor,
the report said.</P>
      <P>The report also estimated that if China launches an attack
on Taiwan in or around the year 2008, it will probably use
intimidation strategy. Between 2008 and 2010, if the military
balance in the Taiwan Strait continues to tilt toward China, then it
will be favorable for China to combine "intimidation, paralysis and
invasion" strategies together, according to the report.</P>

    <HEADLINE>40% CEILING ON INVESTMENT IN CHINA NOT TOO HARSH: ECONOMICS MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  29 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Chen Ruey-long
said Tuesday that the current 40-percent ceiling on investment in
China by domestic companies is not too harsh.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a speech delivered to members of the
Chinese International Economic Cooperation Association in Taipei, in
which he introduced the current situation concerning Taiwan's
outbound investment and the Ministry of Economic Affairs' (MOEA's)
efforts in helping local business people expand their investment
abroad.</P>
      <P>Noting that nearly 70 percent of overseas investment by Taiwan
businesses in recent months has gone to China, Chen stressed that
concentrating too much investment in one country is very risky.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the regulation preventing domestic enterprises
from investing more than 40 percent of their net assets in China is
aimed at preventing too much concentration of capital in certain
countries and fields and thus protecting investors. "Even the United
States has similar regulations," he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in response to criticism from some business tycoons
that the 40-percent ceiling has hindered their development there,
Chen said that the policy has been in place for a long time and that
businesses cannot break the rules first and then complain about the
government's policy later.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that the amount of capital the companies can
invest in China will naturally increase if the net assets of their
enterprises grow.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 29 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) has
set aside a budget for purchasing F-16 jet fighters from the United
States next year, a senior defense official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Deputy Defense Minister Kao Kuang-yi made the remarks as reports
from Washington, D.C. indicated that the White House's National
Security Council and the State Department had recommended that the
Bush administration reject the sale of 66 F-16C/D fighters to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Defense Minister Lee Jye said he met with a few U.S.
representatives Monday to exchange views on Taiwan's plan to purchase
more jet fighters.</P>
      <P>He added that before things become clearer, the MND will keep
working on the procurement plan.</P>
      <P>According to Kao, the ministry's budget proposal for fiscal 2007,
which begins Jan. 1 of next year, includes funds for the procurement
of three major weapons systems that has been stalled in the
legislature.</P>
      <P>The government's proposal to purchase anti-missile batteries,
submarines and anti-submarine aircraft has not cleared the
legislative floor mainly because of opposition from the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and People First Party.</P>
      <P>Lee visited legislative speaker Wang Jin-pyng Tuesday to again
seek his support, and he called for the opposition lawmakers to
approve the proposal which they have blocked over 40 times over the
past three years.</P>
      <P>Lee said the U.S. agreed that Taiwan needs the three major
weapons systems to beef up its defense capability, adding that he
hopes the lawmakers will rise above their political differences to
help boost the nation's defense in the face of the growing military
threat from China.</P>
      <P>Kao said this year's defense budget was NT$71 billion (US$2.16
billion) more than last year. As the government's total spending was
up by NT$90 billion, increased defense spending has not affected the
budgets of other government departments, he noted.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the additional funds were mainly used in
military investment and the ministry's daily operations. More than
NT$20 billion was used to buy precision bombs and improve ammunition
depots, he added.</P>

remaining neutral regarding political events.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks in response to media inquiries concerning
the military's stance prior to the start of a sit-in organized by
Shih Ming-teh, a former chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive

      <P>Lee said that according to his ministry's regulations, military

straight to a sit-in after getting off duty and taking of his
uniform?"</P>
      <P>Lee denied a rumor that the Ministry of National Defense has
demanded that all officers and soldiers sign a statement that they
will not join the "anti-Chen" sit-in.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the military is required to strictly follow the
rules of administrative neutrality and respect for the Constitution.
No political party or government can demand that the military do
anything that goes against the principle of following and
safeguarding the Constitution, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 30 percent of pharmacies in
Taiwan sell sleeping pills unlawfully to consumers without a
prescription, with 10 percent even selling fake sleeping pills
containing potentially harmful substances, according to the results
of an inspection released Tuesday by the Department of Health (DOH).</P>
      <P>The inspection was conducted by the DOH's National Bureau of
Controlled Drugs (NBCD) in July on 103 pharmacies in 10 counties and
cities in northern, central and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It was found that 33 of the pharmacies inspected had sold
sleeping pills to consumers who did not have a prescription.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, sleeping pills sold at 11 of the pharmacies were
unlicensed products of unknown origin, and tests on the drugs
indicated that they contained potentially harmful or addictive
substances such as nimetazepam, zolpidem and haloperidol, the
inspection showed.</P>
      <P>According to Lin Chieh-liang, a toxicologist at Chang Gung
Memorial Hospital, nimetazepam is a commonly abused sedative which
can inhibit breathing and lead to coma, shock or death if overdosed.</P>
      <P>Haloperidol is an antipsychotic drug which can cause side effects
such as muscle-stiffness and tremors if used over a long period of
time, Lin noted.</P>
      <P>NBCD officials said pharmacists involved in the unlawful acts
could face imprisonment of up to seven years and a fine of up to NT$5
million.</P>
      <P>They advised people with anxiety or sleep problems to seek
medical treatment and take medication according to their doctors'

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of motorbike thefts in Taiwan
has decreased considerably since police began a free service in March
to mark vehicle identification numbers on components of motorcycles
and scooters, the National Police Agency said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>An NPA spokesman said police have imprinted etched vehicle serial
numbers on 1.17 million motorbikes since March 15 to deter theft by
making it more difficult for thieves to sell their loot.</P>
      <P>As a result, thefts of motorbikes in Taiwan dropped 21 percent in
the past five months, he said.</P>
      <P>He urged those motorcyclists who have not made use of the free
service to bring their motorbikes along with their driver's licenses
and other relevant documents to an imprinting station.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that there are more than 11 million motorcycles
and scooters in Taiwan. Approximately 700,000 new motorbikes are sold
on the domestic market each year.</P>
      <P>An average of 200,000 motorbikes are stolen in Taiwan each year.
Most of the stolen bikes are taken apart, with the parts being sold
in China, the Philippines and West African countries, including
Nigeria.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMICS MINISTER URGES MORE INVESTMENT IN CENTRAL, SOUTH AMERICA</HEADLINE>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Chen Ruey-long
said Tuesday that the government can invest in enterprises that
Taiwanese business people set up in Central and South America to help
those companies in their operations there.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in a speech to members of the Taipei-based
Chinese International Economic Cooperation Association.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the government's Development Fund can invest
up to 49 percent in the operations of the enterprises established by
Taiwanese business people in Central and South America. The capital
will be withdrawn after a business is deemed well established to
operate independently, he said.</P>
      <P>The policy is aimed at giving those companies a free hand in
their operations in the region, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan business people have focused much of their
investment in China and South East Asian countries, Chen suggested
that they now set their sights on Central and South America by
strengthening relations with countries in the region.</P>
      <P>In addition, these Central and South American countries have all
signed free trade agreements (FTAs) with the United States, which
Chen stressed will be conducive to strengthening Taiwan-U.S. trade
ties.</P>
      <P>Chen revealed that the Ministry of Economic Affairs, which is
seeking Taiwanese enterprises to invest in an industrial park
built by the Taiwan government in El Salvador, plans to draw
companies in the fields of information services, research and
development, food-processing, textiles and logistic services.</P>
      <P>Describing Salvadorans as "the most diligent people in Central
America," Chen urged local business people to invest more there.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'TRIAL' SIT-IN TO PRESSURE PRESIDENT TO STEP DOWN TO BEGIN SEPT. 1</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 29 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A sit-in protest slated for Sept. 9 to push
for President Chen Shui-bian's resignation will be preceded by a
"trial" sit-in beginning sept. 1, a spokesman for the campaign said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Fan Ke-chin said the trial sit-in with 230 participants for the
"one million people against corruption" campaign initiated by former
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Shih Ming-teh will be held every
night between 6 p.m. until midnight in front of the Presidential
Office Sept. 1-7.</P>
      <P>Fan said the sit-in time for each participant will be one hour on
a rotational basis, pointing out that those taking part "are not
doing so to fight the natural elements but instead to fight against
corruption."</P>
      <P>He estimated that the number of people taking part in the sit-in
could reach 1 million in one week at the earliest.</P>
      <P>When the sit-in formally begins Sept. 9, there will be 2,300
seats to signify the 23 million people on the island, Fan said. He
expressed the hope that all the Taiwan people will come out and that
they will become "the last straw that breaks the back of President
Chen."</P>
      <P>He said the venue of the "trial" sit-in will move to the Chiang
Kai-shek Memorial Hall Sept. 8 to prepare for the official mass
sit-in in front of the Presidential Office the following day.</P>
      <P>People can register online starting Sept. 1 for one of the 2,000
seats available each day during the official sit-in, with the
remaining 300 seats being left open for those who want to register at
the sit-in venue.</P>
      <P>Fan said that Shih will be at the sit-in area around the
clock. There will be two zones in the sit-in area, with a series of
activities being held in one zone and sun-screening facilities in the
other zone so that children or elders can also take part.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the name of the campaign, which was originally
"one million people to depose Chen, " has been changed to its present
one in order to clearly define the significance of the campaign.</P>
      <P>"The campaign is not about Shih Ming-teh versus President Chen
Shui-bian, " Fan said, adding that "it is about making a corrupt
government step down, and not about overthrowing the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party."</P>
      <P>President Chen has dogged in recent months by a spate corruption
and embezzlement allegations implicating himself, his family members
and senior aides.</P>
      <P>"Depose Chen" can give rise to a "support Chen" force, but
"anti-corruption" will not lead to a "support corruption" call, Fan
added.

    <HEADLINE>MORE CHINESE MILITARY AIRCRAFT CROSSING MIDDLE LINE OF TAIWAN STRAIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 29 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A large number of Chinese military aircraft
and frigates have been detected crossing the middle line of the
Taiwan Strait or trespassing into Taiwan's exclusive economic zone
over the past decade, according to a report released Tuesday by the
Ministry of National Defense.</P>
      <P>The 2006 National Defense Report said that the Chinese military
has been expanding the scope of its activity since Taiwan held its
first popular presidential election in 1996.</P>
      <P>While Chinese military aircraft crossed the middle line of the
Taiwan Strait on 1,100 occasions in 1999, the frequency increased to
1,200 in 2000 and further to 1,500 in 2001, the report said.</P>
      <P>The frequency dropped to 1,300 in 2002 and further to 940 in 2004
but soared to 1,700 in 2005, the report said.</P>
      <P>It said that over the last three years, Chinese scientific
research vessels have been increasing their activity in the Taiwan
Strait, with more than 20 such cruises recorded per year on average,
including many in which they trespassed into Taiwan's territorial
waters.</P>
      <P>Chinese military frigates have appeared frequently in the Taiwan
Strait to gather sea and air intelligence and test the response time
of the ROC Navy and Air Force, the report said.</P>
      <P>Over the past several years, China has repeatedly sent
oceanographic survey ships to Japan's exclusive economic zone for
hydrographic study, with 30 such cruises recorded in 2003, the report
said.</P>
      <P>In November 2003, a Chinese Ming-class submarine was found
surfacing near Japan's Kyushu Island, and in November 2004, a Chinese
Han-class nuclear-powered submarine was discovered in Japan's
territorial waters, the report said.</P>
      <P>From April to September 2005, Japan's Air Force intercepted 30
Chinese planes trying to enter the country's air space, according to
the report.</P>
      <P>The report reasoned that the Chinese Navy has been increasing its
intelligence-gathering activities in the East China Sea in a bid to
ensure sea and air dominance to prevent intervention by the United
States or Japan in the event of a war in the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Public prosecutors at the Tainan District
Court indicted 21 members of a ring Tuesday that had been selling
tainted meat from dead and diseased cattle since 2002 and recommended
prison terms varying from four months to four years and six months.</P>
      <P>According to the prosecution, law enforcement agents in Yunlin
County found in May that beef butcher Chang Mao-hsiung and his wife
Tsai Kui-wei were selling meat from dead and sick cattle that should
have been either destroyed or turned into animal feed.</P>
      <P>Further investigation led to the discovery that since 2002 the
couple had worked with Chiu Szu-chien and Lien Jung-chi to buy dead
and diseased cattle at low prices from farms in Yunlin, Chiayi and
Tainan counties.</P>
      <P>They ignored health concerns and sold the questionable beef,
knowing that the meat would be processed for resale and human
consumption.</P>
      <P>The prosecution recommended a prison term of four years and six

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 29 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Koo Kuan-min, a former senior adviser to
President Chen Shui-bian and a staunch advocate of Taiwan
independence, responded Tuesday to former Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Chairman Shih Ming-teh who a day earlier called him
"Taiwan's Quisling."</P>
      <P>Shih quoted historian Shih Ming's "Four Hundred Years of History
of the Taiwan People" as stating that in 1972, Koo, leader of the
Taiwan independence movement in Japan, sneaked back to Taiwan to
surrender to the Chiang Kai-shek government.</P>
      <P>Shih Ming-teh said he has always looked down on independence
"advocates" who pursue the goal with mere slogans, adding that some
people have praised the "quisling of Taiwan" as "a senior leader of
the Taiwan independence movement."</P>
      <P>Koo, who was scheduled to return to Taiwan from Japan Wednesday,
issued a statement to explain that part of history.</P>
      <P>In 1971, before the Republic of China was expelled from the
United Nations, Koo said, he wrote a letter to Chiang Ching-kuo, son
of Chiang Kai-shek, urging the government to "seriously consider" the
impact of withdrawing from the U.N.</P>
      <P>Chiang Ching-kuo twice invited him back to Taiwan to discuss
"national affairs, " so he returned to meet with Chiang after
receiving his official invitation, Koo said.</P>
      <P>When they met, he added, he suggested that Chiang resolve the
issue of "provinces as birth places" and allow the establishment of
opposition parties.</P>
      <P>But when he returned to Japan, his "comrades" in the independence
movement would not forgive him, so he withdrew from the Taiwan
Independence League, Koo said.</P>
      <P>He said Shih complained that he was "smeared" and his personality
"assassinated, " "but isn't he using the same method to smear others
and assassinate their characters?"</P>
      <P>Koo said since Shih is determined to use a non-institutional
method to topple Taiwan's democratic system and its democratically
elected president, he must receive "the harshest scrutiny" from all
sectors of society.</P>
      <P>He challenged Shih to pledge to quit politics if his current
attempt to depose President Chen Shui-bian fails. "Otherwise, Shih
will become an irresponsible campaign leader who looks at toppling a
popularly elected president as a childish game," Koo said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NUMBER OF DENGUE FEVER CASES THIS SUMMER INCREASING AT ALARMING RATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of indigenous dengue fever cases
has reached 116 so far this summer, or 29 times the figure for the
same period last year, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the
Department of Health said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The officials said that since the fist indigenous dengue fever
was detected in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan June 26, the number has
increased rapidly.</P>
      <P>Among the 116 reported cases, 88 are in Kaohsiung City, 26 in
Kaohsiung County, and one each in Pingtung County and Tainan
County. The 116 cases compared with only four cases in Chihchin,
Kaohsiung City during the summer of 2005.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that this summer, dengue fever has spread
rapidly from Chiencheng, Kaohsiung to other districts of the
port city and has even spread to the counties of Kaohsiung and
Pingtung as well as the city of Tainan.</P>
      <P>CDC officials expressed worries about the rapid spread,
saying they are concerned that an outbreak similar to that of four
years ago will occur.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director Lin Ting said that during the last dengue
fever outbreak in 2002, 5,336 people were infected, and there
were 242 dengue hemorrhagic fever cases, leading to the death of
21 people.</P>
      <P>Lin expressed concerns that with the rapid increase in the number
of dengue fever cases, more serious cases or deaths will come soon.</P>
      <P>To stem the spread of dengue fever, the CDC has targeted
Chiencheng district for an environmental cleanup campaign. Those who
fail to keep the environment around their homes or businesses clean
will face fines of between NT$3,000 (US$92) and
NT$15,000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OTOP LOCAL CULTURE INDUSTRY PROGRAM TOUTED AT INT'L CONFERENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  29 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"One Town, One Product" (OTOP) , an
initiative which was born in Japan 28 years ago, has now become a
global concept in developing local cultural industries, especially in
Asia, representatives from Asian countries said in an international
conference said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The OTOP initiative was the brainchild of Morihiko Hiramatsu,
former Governor of Japan's Oita Prefecture. Hiramatsu started the
campaign in order to raise incomes in local communities in the
prefecture and make citizens feel proud of their hometown.</P>
      <P>In Hiramatsu's own words, the initiative was aimed at boosting
GNP (gross national product) as well as "GNS (gross national
satisfaction)."</P>
      <P>The success of the campaign in Oita Prefecture led other
countries, including Taiwan, Thailand, Korea and China, to follow the
model. Similiar programs have been implemented in more than a dozen
countries to date.</P>
      <P>Taiwan started its OTOP project in 1989 under the supervision of
the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and it now has over 110 towns
with developed cultural products or events which helps local tourism
as well.</P>
      <P>According to a report by Global Vision magazine, "the Yilan
International Children's Folklore and Folkgame Festival", "the
Pingtung Black Tuna Season, " and "Yilan Green Fair" are the three
most successful culture tourism seasons in the country.</P>
      <P>The project is also an integral part of small- and medium-size
businesses (SMEs) promotion in Thailand, which launched its "One
Tambon (Town) , One Product" project in 2001, said Nitnirun
Suwannagate, deputy director general of the Thailand Office of SMEs
Promotion.</P>
      <P>"The Thai government is now using the OTOP as the new tourism
promotion, " she said, adding that by the end of this year, 60 OTOP
villages will be developed and promoted as tourism villages.</P>
      <P>The project has been transformed into different names and slogans
in various countries, such as "One Company, One Village" in Korea,
"One Village, One Treasure" in China, and "One Parish, One Product"
in the U.S. state of Louisiana.</P>
      <P>As successful as the OTOP was in Oita Prefecture 28 years ago,
the worldwide OTOP phenomenon has definitely been well beyond
Hiramatsu's expectations, said Kimoto Shoji, planning director of
Oita's OTOP International Exchange Promotion Committee.</P>

      <P>The project was initiated by Taiwan in APEC's Small and Medium
Enterprises (SMEs) working group last year, receiving endorsement
of the other member countries.</P>
      <P>The initiative looks to enhance the capacity of SMEs and
micro-enterprises in the local cultural industries, build a platform
for local cultural industries in demonstration of their products to
all APEC economies, and strengthen cross-border cooperation in the
APEC region in promotion of the development of overseas markets for
local cultural industries, Minister of Economic Affairs Chen
Ruey-long said in the opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the project helps retain cultural heritage and create
more employment in remote areas for every country, Chen said.</P>
      <P> During the two-day forum, more than a dozen
speakers from Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, Papua New Guinea, the United
States, Peru, Chile and Mexico will deliver topical speeches in
five sessions of wide-ranging discussions. The topics include
economic implication, policy environment, marketing strategy, market
access and case study of market development of local cultural

Islamic Revival Led by Women Tests Syria's
Secularism

Enas al-Kaldi stops in the hallway of
her Islamic school for girls and coaxes her
6-year-old schoolmate through a short
recitation from the Koran.

In other corners of Damascus, women
who identify one another by the distinctive
way they tie their head scarves gather for
meetings of an exclusive and secret Islamic
women's society known as the Qubaisiate.

These are the two faces of an Islamic
revival for women in Syria, one that could
add up to a potent challenge to this
determinedly secular state. Though
government officials vociferously deny it,
Syria is becoming increasingly religious
and its national identity is weakening. If
Islam replaces that identity, it may
undermine the unity of a society that is
ruled by a Muslim religious minority,
the Alawites, and includes many religious
groups.

Kids Don't Want Their MTV Online

MTV, which has long stayed on top of
its fickle and elusive teen audience,
finds that its Web sites are being whipped
by rivals such as MySpace, the new home of
the MTV generation.

This time, the kids didn't follow.
"MTV Overdrive," a free video Web site
featuring music videos, news and MTV's hit
programming, attracts fewer than four
million unique visitors a month, a small
fraction of MTV's 82 million monthly U.S.
television viewers. More worrisome: MTV's
Web sites are being whipped by rivals
such as MySpace, the new home of the MTV
generation. MySpace gets nearly 55 million

    <HEADLINE>COMMITTEE RULES CHINA'S TOWEL DUMPING HURTS TAIWAN BUSINESSES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  29 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A trade investigative committee of the
Ministry of Economic Affairs ruled Tuesday that imports of cheap
Chinese towels has caused real damage to Taiwan's towel industry.</P>
      <P>The ruling will be sent to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) , which
has 10 days to decide whether or not to levy anti-dumping duties on
the imports.</P>
      <P>The government has since March been investigating the towel issue
after receiving complaints from domestic towel manufacturers about
their market being flooded with cheap Chinese imports. The trade
investigative committee confirmed earlier findings that China had
been dumping its towels on the Taiwan market, causing substantive
losses to local manufacturers.</P>
      <P>The committee said imports of Chinese towels began in 2002 and
that by 2003, China had become Taiwan's main source of supply. By
2005, Chinese imports had taken a 70 percent share of Taiwan's towel
market, causing "evident and adverse impact" on the domestic towel
industry.</P>
      <P>The Chinese towels are much cheaper than Taiwan towels and
quickly replaced Taiwan products, forcing domestic manufacturers to
compete in higher-priced markets.</P>
      <P>The committee also said that between 2002 and 2003, the prices of
Taiwan towels were suppressed, while from 2004 to 2005, the prices of
Taiwan-made towels did not reflect the rise in manufacturing costs,
further indicating that Taiwan producers could not raise their prices
because of Chinese imports.</P>
      <P>The committee reported that orders for Taiwan towels began to
decrease after Chinese products entered the market, while domestic
production kept falling.</P>
      <P>Even though Taiwan manufacturers tried to find new outlets for
their products in higher-priced markets, they could not compete with
the Chinese imports, and sales of their products in the domestic
market shrank, with little prospects for them to improve.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 29 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is continuing its efforts to
downsize the armed forces, with a target of cutting the number of
troops to 275,000 by 2008, Defense Minister Lee Jye announced
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee made the announcement as he presided over a meeting to
publish the 2006 national defense report, which reaffirms the
nation's main defense policy goals of war prevention, homeland
defense and anti-terrorism.</P>
      <P>Wu Chi-fang, spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense,
explained that the armed forces started to downsize in 1997, cutting
the number of troops from 450,000 to 380,000 within three years.</P>
      <P>After that, a new program was put in place with a schedule to
reduce the troops to fewer than 300,000 by 2009, but now the minister
has moved that schedule forward again, he noted.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the ministry is also reforming its
recruiting system, aiming to change its current conscription system
so that by 2008, 60 percent of the service men and women will be
voluntary, with the other 40 percent conscripted.</P>
      <P>The term of conscription has also been shortened, so that from
January this year, drafted service personnel who have served one year
and four months will be discharged. Formerly, the service period was
one year and 10 months.</P>
      <P>Another reform of the armed forces is to lower the age from 40 to
35 whereupon discharged members then become reservists. The measure
will bring down the number of reservists.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ONLINE 'SUPPORT TAIWAN'S U.N. BID' PETITION KICKS OFF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los Angeles,  Aug.  29 (CNA)
(By Chu Lu-sheng and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A global online petition supporting
Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations was launched by Taiwan
diplomatic officials in Los Angeles Tuesday.</P>
      <P>All people around the world are encouraged to sign the petition,
which urges the United Nations to consider the right of the 23
million people of Taiwan to be represented in the world body.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China on Taiwan has been shut out of the United
Nations since 1971, when U.N. Resolution No. 2758 gave the China seat
to Beijing at Taiwan's expense. While Resolution No. 2758 resolved
the issue of China's U.N. representation, it did not address the
issue of the representation of Taiwan's people, officials from the
Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) in L.A. said.</P>
      <P>The petition also urges the U.N. to help maintain peace in the
Taiwan Strait as this year is the 10th anniversary of China's launch
of missile tests in the Taiwan Strait in 1996 and as China continues
to increase its missile deployment against Taiwan, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>China's passage of its "Anti-Secession Law" in March 2005 has
been widely viewed as a move to provide a legal pretext for the use
of force against Taiwan, the officials said, adding that the law
endangers peace and stability in the East Asia region. They further
said that the U.N. has to facilitate measures to secure peace across
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The U.N.'s exclusion of Taiwan violates the principles and spirit
of the U.N. Charter, in particular the fundamental principle of
universality, as well as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>They called for people around the globe to pay attention to
Taiwan's plight and to support its bid to gain U.N. membership.</P>
      <P>In order to help people around America to voice their support for
Taiwan via the online petition, the TECO in L.A. has also distributed
bookmarks with the words "Support Taiwan's U.N. Bid" and a Web site
address at meetings, speeches and other related events.</P>
      <P>Those interested in signing the petition can do so by visiting
the GoPetition Web site at http://gopetition.com, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They added that the "Suport Taiwan" online petition activity will
continue until Taiwan gains U.N. membership.</P>

plane.</P>
      <P>Lu, however, said that the foreign ministry is still making
last-minute efforts to arrange for the president's stopover plan and
engaging in negotiations with a "concerned party" over a possible
transit stop in Guam and the type of aircraft that is going to carry
Chen and his entourage for the upcoming trip.</P>
      <P>The daily also speculated that the U.S. authorities have asked
Taiwan to have Chen fly aboard a civilian aircraft instead of the
"Air Force One" military plane if he plans to make a transit stop in
Guam.</P>
      <P>A MOFA official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that the
U.S. government previously had no particular opinion about the
president's planned stopover in Guam on his way home from Nauru Sept.
6 but that the U.S. officials have changed their attitude in recent
days as the campaign to unseat Chen has escalated in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The official said the United States is concerned about appearing
to "endorse" President Chen by allowing him to make a transit stop in
Guam aboard a military aircraft amid the volatile political situation
in Taiwan where a "Depose Chen" campaign is kicking into high gear.</P>
      <P>President Chen is scheduled to depart Sept. 3 for Palau to attend
a leaders summit between Taiwan and its diplomatic allies in the
South Pacific before heading on to Nauru Sept. 5 for a visit,
according to Lu.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is preparing to grant
permission for 20,000 foreign workers from abroad this year to work
in Taiwan's industrial sector, particularly in the "3K" industries --
referring to those sectors where work is "dirty, " "dangerous, " or
demands "hard labor."</P>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) already granted approval for
12,425 foreign workers earlier this year to work in "3K"
manufacturing industries around Taiwan and permission for 7,575 other
foreign workers is expected to be given later this year, beginning
Sept. 1, CAL officials said.</P>
      <P>The 7,575 prospective foreign workers will be allowed to work in
20 "3K" sectors, including mold manufacturing, manufacturing of
fire-retardant materials, the food refrigeration industry, organic
fertilizer processing, papermaking, garment manufacturing and the
stone carving and processing industry, CLA officials said.</P>
      <P>Applications can be filed between Sept. 1-30 and screening of the
applications is expected to be completed by the CLA by the end of
this year, paving the way for the foreign workers to begin work from
early next year, CLA officials said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has not allowed new foreign workers into the country's
manufacturing industries for the past several years in a bid to
protect the interests of domestic workers.</P>
      <P>Following a request from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, CLA
Chairman Lee Ying-yuan said last August that 20,000 foreign workers
would be allowed into Taiwan in 2006 for certain manufacturing jobs
in 19 industries to help boost Taiwan industries' international
competitiveness. He added that the 20,000 quota would be allocated in
two phases at a ratio of two foreign workers for every three domestic
workers in the "3K" industries.</P>

better connect with the rest of the world by setting up air links
between Kinmen and overseas destinations.</P>
      <P>Lee issued the call during a meeting with two executives of Far
East Air Transport Corp. (FEAT) , one of whom is being promoted to a
position at the company's office at Chiang Kai-shek International

government officials in charge of tourism and economic development
were also present.</P>
      <P>In addition to expressing his hope that carriers can step up air

to help Kinmen develop local tourism by opening more international

officials suggested Wednesday that the main opposition Kuomintang

to the people of Taiwan, according to Lee Hsien-jen, director of the

estimated NT$27.7 billion -- apart from those made up of membership
dues, government subsidies to the party, political donations and
interest generated from the party's own funds.</P>
      <P>He said KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou should stop selling his party's
assets as this is not just a financial issue but a political one,
because when the KMT claims all of its assets were obtained legally,
it is referring to laws legislated by itself as the ruling party.</P>

party workers' retirement pensions, they will not feel ease of mind

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO BAN LIVE POULTRY TRADE AT TRADITIONAL MART FROM 2008</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 30 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan announced Wednesday that
it will ban live poultry trade and the slaughter of chickens in
traditional markets around Taiwan from April 2008 in an effort to
prevent avian flu outbreaks.</P>
      <P>Council of Agriculture (COA) Vice Minister Hu Fu-hsiung made the
announcement at a press conference that was also attended by Vice
Economics Minister Shih Yen-shiang, National Science Council Minister
Chen Chien-jen -- who is also convener of the Cabinet-level
anti-avian flu ad hoc group -- and Council of Labor Affairs Minister
Lee Ying-yuan.</P>
      <P>According to Hu, those involved in the live poultry trade and
slaughter will have a six-month grace period from April 2008 to
October of the same year. Violators of the policy will then face
fines of up to NT$500,000 (US$15,198), and will have any slaughtered
poultry destroyed.</P>
      <P>Asked if the government was overreacting, Chen pointed out that
when an avian influenza outbreak erupted in Hong Kong in 1997, most
of those infected were poultry slaughterers. There is already no live
poultry slaughtering in traditional markets in Japan and Singapore,
and Hong Kong will also follow suit by 2008, Chen added.</P>
      <P>In comparison with Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia, where the
World Health Organization has confirmed human cases of avian flu,
Taiwan has a denser population and higher ratio of traditional
markets, and therefore should adopt more strict measures to prevent
avian flu outbreaks, Chen said.</P>
      <P>To allow customers to continue to enjoy fresh poultry, the COA
has approved a project to construct 20 new electrical slaughterhouses
around Taiwan, in addition to the current 23, and will also encourage
and offer subsidies for the construction of more small-scale
electrical slaughterhouses, according to Hu.</P>
      <P>Shih said poultry vendors can also apply for subsidies for the

    <HEADLINE>CENTRALIZED BURNING OF GHOST MONEY GETS BEST RESULTS IN TAIPEI COUNTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 30 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei County residents had a total of 950
tonnes of ghost money burned at environmentally friendly centralized
facilities in the seventh lunar month of this year, officials said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The amount was 50 tonnes higher than the same month -- known as
ghost month in Chinese tradition -- of last year and nine times
higher than three years ago, according to officials at the county's
Environmental Protection Bureau.</P>
      <P>This is the third consecutive year that Taipei County has burned
more ghost money through this method than other counties and cities,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>They estimated that burning the ghost money through centralized
facilities instead of doing so outdoors has prevented the release
into the open air of 109 tonnes of pollutants, which are tantamount
to the total load of five articulated trucks.</P>
      <P>However, the officials stressed that the centralized burning
service is not aimed at encouraging the public to burn ghost money
but to raise their environmental awareness.</P>
      <P>They said it would be best if the public could avoid burning
ghost money altogether because the substances released upon burning
can be harmful to the health.</P>
      <P>A survey conducted by the Consumer's Foundation last year shows
that ghost money and incense release hazardous substances such as
benzene, methyl benzene and ethyl benzene upon burning.</P>
      <P>Environmental protection authorities in various counties and
cities have offered the centralized burning service during specific
festivals, including Ghost Festival, for the last three years, with
the amount of ghost money burnt in this manner having increased from
260 tonnes to 1,800 tonnes over the past three years, according to
the Environmental Protection Administration.</P>

(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The governments of Peru and Chile are
working hard to promote their local cultural industries and help
boost their economies, Peruvian and Chilean officials said in a
two-day international forum that concluded in Taipei Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The two South American countries, both of which have rich
histories and cultural heritages, are working through government
initiatives to promote the development of their local cultural
industries, Chilean official Javier Chamas and Peruvian official
Madeleine Burns said during the APEC Local Cultural Industry Market
Development Forum.</P>
      <P>In 2003, the Chilean government established the National Council
of Culture and Arts (NCAC), which started financing cultural projects
with a US$17 million annual budget, said NCAC Secretary-General
Chamas.</P>
      <P>"The projects are selected on a competitive basis, by means of
public contests, " he said, adding that approximately 20 percent of
all submitted projects are annually financed.</P>
      <P>NCAC's biggest challenge will be moving from financial aid into
the promotion and broadcasting of local cultural goods, while trying
to promote Chile's cultural industry in foreign markets.</P>
      <P>The Peruvian government has also launched a campaign of
establishing CITES -- technological innovation centers of handicrafts
and tourism -- as the regional integrator.</P>
      <P>"Peruvian crafts are very important, involving at least 2 million
people located in rural and suburban areas and bringing women and
young people into productive activity, " according to the director of
the Peruvian Ministry of Foreign Trade and Tourism.</P>
      <P>There are 100,000 registered workshops and 12 CITES that have
been approved or are under evaluation in Peru, she said.</P>
      <P>To provide easier access to markets, the Peruvian government also
helps the local cultural industry to establish Web sites and produce
digital catalogues to promote the development of exportable offers,
she explained.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET CLAIMS BUDGET PROPOSAL DOES NOT CONTRADICT POLICY GOALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 30 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet department in charge of budget
claimed Wednesday that its budget proposal for fiscal 2007 did not
contradict its own four major policy goals and that the goal of
collecting NT$1,171.1 billion (US$35.6 billion) in tax revenue is not
over-optimistic.</P>
      <P>The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS) made the statement in response to a United Daily News
editorial that criticized the government for putting forth a budget
proposal that is "deceiving and self-deluding" and unlikely to win
the legislature's support.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS said that although the revenue is 11.9 percent higher
than the fiscal 2006 budget, it is only 4.6 percent higher than the
real income for fiscal 2005 for an average annual increase of 2.3
percent -- lower than the 4.4 percent average economic growth rate.</P>
      <P>The 2007 figure is a realistic projection in light of the fact
that from January to July this year, the national coffers took in 3.5
percent more revenue than they did in the same period of last year,
it noted.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet proposal to spend NT$1,663.8 billion next year
represents a 5.9 percent increase over this year, with increases
focusing on defense spending, which will go up 29.5 percent from the
current fiscal year, according to the DGBAS.</P>
      <P>For economic development, which tops the Cabinet's administrative
goals, the Cabinet has earmarked NT$534.2 billion in regular and
special budgets, up NT$9.8 billion from the current fiscal year,
including a special budget for flood control and infrastructure
improvement projects.</P>
      <P>Of that total, NT$261 billion will be used to make fixed
investments through profit-making and non-profit making government
funds, it noted.</P>
      <P>It pointed out that an NT$86 billion budget has been set aside to
help boost the nation's science and technological development as part
of the government plan to use its "budget tool" to develop the
economy.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS said the budget outlays do not contradict the Cabinet's
four major policy goals of economic development, improving social
order, taking care of the less privileged, and leading a clean
government.</P>

Wall Street Journal: Desk Job, Consumer
Demand and Growth In Laptops Leave Dell Behind

Dell, the world's largest personal-computer 
maker, is facing its worst crisis in years,
due to the change of buying behavior in the
PC world. For years, Dell -- famous for selling
products directly over the phone and the
Internet -- was a dynamo thanks to bulk sales
to corporations, mostly of desktop computers.
Its direct-sales business model made the Round
Rock, Texas, company a widely admired paragon of
efficiency. But in the past few years, buying
behavior in the PC world has changed. Much of
the growth has come from consumer demand
rather than the business market on which Dell
focused. Dell has missed sales or earnings
projections three times in the past five
quarters. Dell's stock is down more than 60
percent from its peak closing price of US$58.13
on March 22, 2000.</TEXT>

second-hand smoke in the workplace in Taiwan, half of non-smoking
women said they continue to be threatened by the hazard of second-hand
smoke, according to the results of a survey released Wednesday by the
Bureau of Health Promotion.</P>
      <P>The survey conducted between 2003 and 2005 showed that the rate
of second-hand smoke exposure in the workplace declined year on year.</P>
      <P>While the ratio of personal offices with the problem fell from
37.6 percent in 2003 to 25.3 percent in 2005, the ratio of shared
offices with the problem also slid from 38.1 percent in 2003 to 25.7
percent in 2005, the survey indicated.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, at workplaces where smoking is banned, 15.2 percent

of these non-smoking women complained that they were constantly
exposed to second-hand smoke.</P>
      <P>Also, the survey showed that the problem of second-hand smoke was
more severe in smaller workplaces.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years, workers at more than 30 percent of
workplace with fewer than 30 staff were exposed to second-hand smoke,
compared with 20 percent among workplaces with 100 to 299 staff.</P>

      <P>A serial rapist known locally as the
"Huakang Wolf" because most of the crimes he committed in the
mid-1990s were at Huakang, Chinese Culture University's campus in
suburban Taipei, has applied for parole for the seventh time, an
official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Justice Lee Chin-yung said the Taipei Prison has
tentatively approved the application and referred the case to the
Ministry of Justice (MOJ) for endorsement.</P>
      <P>"The ministry will screen the case with great prudence based on
the results of the inmate's correctional education and the chances of
his repeating the crime," Lee said.</P>
      <P>The inmate, identified only by his family name of Yang, was
sentenced on more than 30 counts of sexual assault and robbery. He
has served more than half of his 16-year prison term and qualifies
for parole application.</P>
      <P>Yang, now in his 30s, made headlines five years ago when he
passed exams to enter prestigious National Taiwan University, but was
later denied admission because the MOJ turned down his parole
application amid social misgivings about the chances of recidivism.</P>
      <P>Even if the MOJ finally gives the green light to Yang's parole
application, Vice Minister Lee said, he will be subject to stricter
surveillance measures, such as being required to wear an electronic
tag or being subject to polygraph tests.</P>

economy, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will be examining
ways to lure back Taiwanese businessmen operating in China, known
locally as "taishang, " Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-lung
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the MOEA, Chen said that the ministry will begin
assessing workable measures to attract "taishang" to invest at home,
as Chinese authorities are likely to soon halt incentives to some
Taiwan companies and because Beijing is weighing a new round of
measures to cool the economy.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, Chen said, China-based Taiwan companies are
facing increased labor shortages, materials and power supply
difficulties and an appreciating Chinese yuan.</P>
      <P>It is known that some of the China-based Taiwan enterprises are

      <P>Chao was referring to Chen's recent remarks that he was "leading
a happy life" without watching TV or reading newspapers full of
negative reports about him and his family.</P>
      <P>Chen has also poked fun at Shih, saying Shih "need not fear being
put in prison" for leading a sit-in against the president, or have to
write a beseeching letter to the president begging for Chen's
leniency.</P>
      <P>In response to Chao, Tan Sun Chen, secretary-general to the
president, said Chen made the emotional remarks because he felt he
had been smeared by Taiwan's media.</P>
      <P>Urging DPP leaders to "understand" the president's feelings, Chen
said he would forward Chao's message to the president.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu agreed that recent media reports have
been "unfriendly" toward Chen, but added that whatever remarks are
made by DPP leadership will be broadcast to the general public, so
"we have to be very careful in what we say and be psychologically
prepared for the consequences."</P>
      <P>Lu's remarks were interpreted as targeting DPP Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun, who claimed that Shih at one time "begged for a job" from
the president, a claim that Shih has vehemently denied.</P>
      <P>Other DPP central standing committee members did not buy into
calls for caution and self-restraint. Chen Sheng-hung and Wu
Ping-jui, for example, said if no attempt is made to fight back
against Shih, his campaign may gain greater momentum.</P>
      <P>Tan Sun Chen expressed hope that Shih's anti-Chen campaign will
end soon, because if it continues for long social chaos may erupt and
foreign investors will not dare invest in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CHANGES STRATEGIES TOWARD 'CAMPAIGN TO DEPOSE CHEN'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  30  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A task force formed by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to handle a crisis triggered by
the "campaign of one million people against corruption" decided
Wednesday that party members should minimize confrontation with the
group.</P>
      <P>According to DPP sources who declined to be named, the task force
decided at a meeting that DPP members should instead stress to the
public how the campaign's planned round-the-clock sit-in in front of
the Presidential Office will affect social order and harm the
nation's economy.</P>
      <P>The sources quoted insiders as saying the DPP should also take
advantage of contradictions between the campaign's initiator --
former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh -- and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou,
who doubles as chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Members of the DPP task force learned during the Wednesday
meeting that according to the DPP's latest poll, Ma's approval rating
dropped from 55 percent in July to the present 49 percent -- the
lowest this year -- after Shih severely criticized him for hampering
the campaign by not allowing protesters to use the street facing the
Presidential Office on a 24-hour basis.</P>
      <P>At the same time, public satisfaction with the KMT also plunged
from 41 percent to 31 percent, while the DPP's approval rating
remained unchanged at around 18 percent.</P>
      <P>Leaders of the campaign to depose scandal-ridden President Chen
Shui-bian have decided to change the campaign's name to "one million
people against corruption" for fear the mass movement may lose its
focus.</P>
      <P>Shih has vowed that the round-the-clock sit-in, scheduled to
begin Sept. 9, will continue until Chen agrees to step down to take
responsibility for the corruption and embezzlement scandals
surrounding himself, his wife, son-in-law and senior aides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LENOVO HEAD SPEAKS ON CORPORATE CULTURE, OPTIMISTIC ABOUT FUTURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 30 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lenovo Group Chairman Yang Yuanqing spoke
on the successful integration of Lenovo and IBM corporate cultures
Wednesday, almost 20 months after Lenovo purchased IBM's personal
computer (PC) division, and said he was optimistic about the
company's future.</P>
      <P>Regarding Lenovo's transition period following the US$1.25 billion
acquisition in December 2004, the 42-year-old Yang said "On a scale of
1 to 100, I think I'll hand out a score of 90," after his lecture in
Taipei, which was organized by Global Views Monthly magazine.</P>
      <P>The deal made Lenovo Group, China's largest PC giant, the world's
third-largest PC manufacturer behind Dell and Hewlett-Peckard.</P>
      <P>But the integration has not been easy, "Especially because we're
in a case of a Chinese company acquiring a Western company," said
Yang, who asked everyone at Lenovo to call him by his first name
instead of Chairman Yang or Mister Yang.</P>
      <P>The first priority after the deal, Yang said, was to redefine the
company's core values. a surprisingly easy task since two companies
share the same core values, such as satisfaction-guaranteed service
and integrity.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, he tried to change some of IBM's "old ways,"
replacing them with basic must-haves in the fast-paced PC
industry -- speed, efficiency, aggressiveness in seeking change and
discipline.</P>
      <P>Basically, Lenovo tried to preserve the strengths of both sides,
Yang said, as Westerners are more aggressive and outgoing while
Easterners are better at execution.</P>
      <P>"The mix of Chinese and international staff helps everyone to
adjust, respect and learn from others, which is good for Lenovo's
development," Yang said.</P>
      <P>Yang reiterated that the integration is "a cultural fusion of two
corporations," not "a war of the East and the West."</P>
      <P>The deal that has been described as "a snake eating an elephant"
has shown optimistic results, as Lenovo's revenues have increased in
the past 20 months, reversing a trend in previous merger cases
that saw dramatic losses in the first two years following a merger.</P>
      <P>Yang also expected an increase in Lenovo's cooperation with
Taiwanese high-tech companies in future because "the IT supply
chain is concentrated in the Greater China region. Our cooperation
with Taiwanese corporations is natural and obvious."</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday
that Taiwan looks forward to boosting substantive cooperation with
Canada in various fields, including health and legal affairs.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with a visiting Canadian
parliamentary delegation.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Chen said Taiwanese made 100,000 visits to
Canada last year and that Taiwan was the seventh largest source of
Canada's foreign students, indicating that civilian exchanges between
the two countries are cordial and robust.</P>
      <P>Chen urged the Canadian government to follow Japan's example of
granting visa-free treatment for Taiwanese tourists to facilitate
further growth in bilateral tourist exchanges.</P>
      <P>In response to Canadian parliamentarians' questions about an
ongoing campaign to unseat him, Chen said any citizen can criticize
the government or the national leader now that Taiwan has evolved
from an authoritarian rule to a liberal democracy. But Chen stressed
that using non-peaceful or violent means to sabotage the country's
constitutional system and order is impermissible.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHOULD SEEK OWN WAY AS CHINA KEEPS SUPPRESSING IT: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  Aug. 30 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top envoy to France said Wednesday
that if China keeps suppressing Taiwan internationally, Taiwan should
find its own way to promote "substantive diplomacy."</P>
      <P>Yang Tzu-pao, who will assume the post of vice foreign minister
in Taipei Sept. 15, said that in order to carry out substantive
diplomacy, he would prioritize national security and development over
national dignity.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview with CNA, Yang said that whenever
Taiwan tries to participate in an international activity that
involves "national" status, China will try to block the island
country.</P>
      <P>"We should pursue overall diplomacy, and not limit ourselves to
engaging in political activities. Rather, we could try to interact
with other countries in educational, scientific, cultural and other
areas," he said.</P>
      <P>He continued that in all these domains, Taiwan's participation
will help the world community better understand Taiwan and to
interact more effectively with it. Through this process Taiwan can
make its own contributions to the world.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, the government can encourage the academic
and business sectors to participate in international conferences or
hearings that do not involve state-to-state relations.</P>
      <P>For the business community, they could use the international
context to expand their business opportunities; academics can raise
their profiles as they make professional contributions to the
international community, he said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Yang added, "I think both the businesspeople and
academics would like to join non-governmental international forums."</P>
      <P>The engineer-turned-politician said Taiwan will not be excluded
from international forums on environmental protection, sustainable
development and information technology -- issues regarded as
important in this era of globilization -- if it seeks to participate.</P>
      <P>Even though China spares no effort to obstruct Taiwan's
participation in international activities, "it won't be able to block
all roads. If it keeps opposing us, we will keep finding a new way
out. This is the Taiwan spirit," Yang said.</P>
      <P>To demonstrate its flexibility, he suggested Taiwan give up its
old principle of sending Cabinet-level officials to sign pacts on
scientific and technological cooperation with countries like France
by sending lower-ranking officials.</P>
      <P>Taiwan could also send representatives with the official
delegations of its diplomatic allies to international conferences to
demonstrate that it attaches more importance to "substantive
participation" rather than "formal or official participation, " he
added.</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations, a task undertaken
every September when the U.N. General Assembly convenes in New York,
Yang said "since this is a major national goal, it will be reached
eventually."</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET UNVEILS POLICY REPORT FOR 2007</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 31 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet sent its policy report for 2007
to the Legislative Yuan Wednesday, in which it emphasized that
national security, social harmony and economic development are
essential to ensuring the country's sustainable development.</P>
      <P>The report said the core values of the government's national
security policy are to protect the country and its people and that to
do so, Taiwan needs to strengthen its defense capabilities to
effectively address the cross-Taiwan Strait military imbalance that
is tilting in China's favor.</P>
      <P>To help develop a popular consensus on national identity, the
country needs to stick to focusing on "Taiwanese consciousness, "
standing firm on its position and moving forward pragmatically, the
report said.</P>
      <P>Regarding cross-strait relations, the government will follow the
principles of "sovereignty, democracy, peace, equality" and promote
cross-strait economic and trade exchanges and cooperation based on
the principle of "active management, effective opening, " the report
said.</P>
      <P>On social peace, the Cabinet will prioritize improving law
enforcement, attacking crime at its roots and enhancing public order,
the report said.</P>
      <P>As for economic development, achieving prosperity and wealth
equity will be the government's main objectives, the report said.</P>
      <P>It said the Cabinet will implement an economic development
strategy encouraging businesses to deepen their foundations in Taiwan
and to map out a global strategy to expand their business network.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet will lead the country toward developing a high
value-added knowledge-based economy, promote various economic reforms
and assist local industries to transform or upgrade themselves in
order to sustain Taiwan's competitiveness, the report said.</P>
      <P>It said while promoting economic development, the government must
uphold social fairness and justice to enhance its care and protection
of disadvantaged groups.</P>
      <P>It noted that the government has enacted a law on minimum tax
rates to address the unfairness in tax burdens and will continue to
review any outdated taxation measures to broaden the taxation base,
achieve taxation fairness and protect the disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, with the greying of Taiwan's society and decline in
the country's fertility rate, the protection and care of the
middle-aged and elderly populations will be an important issue in the
government's policy, the report said.</P>
      <P>It said the government will continue to provide subsidies for
elderly farmers and senior citizens, promote a new retirement pension
scheme for workers, improve the National Health Insurance system,
plan a complete social security network, strengthen the care and
protection of the disadvantaged, integrate existing retirement
systems and speed up the launch of a national pension program.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) announced
Wednesday that it has completed a draft amendment to the Act on
Property-Declaration by Public Servants which would increase the
penalty for offenders.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Justice Lee Chin-yung said the draft will be

legislature.</P>
      <P>He said the draft amendment was completed after the MOJ consulted
with experts and scholars, leading to the conclusion that offenders
should be subject to increased fines instead of criminal charges.</P>
      <P>Citing an example, Lee said if those public officeholders who are
required by law to declare their assets try to hide them and
deliberately ignore the law, they could face a maximum fine of NT$4
million (US$121,710).</P>
      <P>He also said the scope of the law's application will be broadened
to add some 10,000 public officeholders to the present list.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In view of the fact that China may
implement a new round of austerity measures to cool off its red-hot
economy, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will be examining
ways to lure back Taiwanese businessmen operating in China, known
locally as "taishang, " Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-lung
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the MOEA, Chen said that the ministry will begin
assessing workable measures to attract "taishang" to invest at home,
as Chinese authorities are likely to soon halt incentives to some
Taiwan companies and because Beijing is weighing a new round of
measures to cool the economy.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, Chen said, China-based Taiwan companies are
facing increased labor shortages, materials and power supply
difficulties and an appreciating Chinese yuan.</P>
      <P>It is known that some of the China-based Taiwan enterprises are
prepared to shift operations to other countries, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>To take advantage of China's changing investment climate, the
MOEA will revamp its policies and offer more attractive and effective
incentives to encourage Taiwan companies to return home and make
investments here, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The MOEA is poised to conduct a survey to gauge Taiwan companies'
willingness to invest in the domestic market, and to disseminate
information on government investment incentives such as assistance in
land, capital and labor acquisition and special loans from a NT$20
billion fund, he said.</P>

Wednesday to serve as a spokesman for a 2007 calendar featuring 12
physically or mentally challenged individuals, hailing their
perseverance and courage.</P>

vigor and experience.</P>
      <P>Ma also greeted the audience in sign language and posed with the
12 men and women for a photo session.</P>
      <P>To aid the hearing impaired, six years ago the Taipei City
Government began offering a cable news reporting program in sign
language, and it has been training municipal officials to assist both
physically and mentally challenged citizens, Ma said, adding that he
himself is still learning sign language.</P>
      <P>It is important to fairly treat people with physical and mental
disabilitie because their work and human rights are fully protected
by the Constitution, Ma said, adding that they deserve equal
treatment and respect for their perseverance.</P>
      <P>Ma said the municipal team has been routinely defeated every year
in races on the day of the Dragon Boat Festival by a team composed of
physically and mentally challenged citizens -- proof the disabled are
not necessarily weaker than others.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of fraud cases has been on the
decline since the government launched an all-out crackdown and set up
an anti-fraud hotline, Vice Minister of the Interior Lin Chung-sen
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks at a public hearing called by the

country's law and order situation.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the hearing, Tsai Chin-lung, a KMT legislative caucus

telephone-related fraud on the domestic front, claiming that Taiwan
may have become a "republic of cheating."</P>
      <P>In response, Lin said such an accusation was untrue and unfair.
Since a toll-free anti-fraud hotline "165" was created in 2005, Lin
said, more than 1.04 million calls reporting telephone-related fraud
have been received, indicating the public is now aware of the hotline
as a means to report fraud.</P>

      <P>As a campaign to unseat President Chen
Shui-bian gears up for sit-in protests, some Democratic Progressive
Party heavyweights recommended Wednesday that Chen make fewer remarks
against the campaign's leader, former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh.</P>
      <P>During a DPP central standing committee meeting, Legislator Chao

      <P>Urging DPP leaders to "understand" the president's feelings, Chen
said he would forward Chao's message to the president.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu agreed that recent media reports have
been "unfriendly" toward Chen, but added that whatever remarks are
made by DPP leadership will be broadcast to the general public, so
"we have to be very careful in what we say and be psychologically
prepared for the consequences."</P>
      <P>Lu's remarks were interpreted as targeting DPP Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun, who claimed that Shih at one time "begged for a job" from
the president, a claim that Shih has vehemently denied.</P>
      <P>Other DPP central standing committee members did not buy into
calls for caution and self-restraint. Chen Sheng-hung and Wu
Ping-jui, for example, said if no attempt is made to fight back
against Shih, his campaign may gain greater momentum.</P>
      <P>Tan Sun Chen expressed hope that Shih's anti-Chen campaign will
end soon, because if it continues for long social chaos may erupt and
foreign investors will not dare invest in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LENOVO HEAD SPEAKS ON CORPORATE CULTURE, OPTIMISTIC ABOUT FUTURE(Repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 30 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lenovo Group Chairman Yang Yuanqing spoke
on the successful integration of Lenovo and IBM corporate cultures
Wednesday, almost 20 months after Lenovo purchased IBM's personal
computer (PC) division, and said he was optimistic about the
company's future.</P>
      <P>Regarding Lenovo's transition period following the US$1.25 billion
acquisition in December 2004, the 42-year-old Yang said "On a scale of
1 to 100, I think I'll hand out a score of 90," after his lecture in
Taipei, which was organized by Global Views Monthly magazine.</P>
      <P>The deal made Lenovo Group, China's largest PC giant, the world's
third-largest PC manufacturer behind Dell and Hewlett-Peckard.</P>
      <P>But the integration has not been easy, "Especially because we're
in a case of a Chinese company acquiring a Western company," said
Yang, who asked everyone at Lenovo to call him by his first name
instead of Chairman Yang or Mister Yang.</P>
      <P>The first priority after the deal, Yang said, was to redefine the
company's core values. a surprisingly easy task since two companies
share the same core values, such as satisfaction-guaranteed service
and integrity.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, he tried to change some of IBM's "old ways,"
replacing them with basic must-haves in the fast-paced PC
industry -- speed, efficiency, aggressiveness in seeking change and
discipline.</P>
      <P>Basically, Lenovo tried to preserve the strengths of both sides,
Yang said, as Westerners are more aggressive and outgoing while
Easterners are better at execution.</P>
      <P>"The mix of Chinese and international staff helps everyone to
adjust, respect and learn from others, which is good for Lenovo's
development," Yang said.</P>
      <P>Yang reiterated that the integration is "a cultural fusion of two
corporations," not "a war of the East and the West."</P>
      <P>The deal that has been described as "a snake eating an elephant"
has shown optimistic results, as Lenovo's revenues have increased in
the past 20 months, reversing a trend in previous merger cases
that saw dramatic losses in the first two years following a merger.</P>
      <P>Yang also expected an increase in Lenovo's cooperation with
Taiwanese high-tech companies in future because "the IT supply
chain is concentrated in the Greater China region. Our cooperation
with Taiwanese corporations is natural and obvious."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday
that Taiwan looks forward to boosting substantive cooperation with
Canada in various fields, including health and legal affairs.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with a visiting Canadian
parliamentary delegation.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Chen said Taiwanese made 100,000 visits to
Canada last year and that Taiwan was the seventh largest source of
Canada's foreign students, indicating that civilian exchanges between
the two countries are cordial and robust.</P>
      <P>Chen urged the Canadian government to follow Japan's example of
granting visa-free treatment for Taiwanese tourists to facilitate
further growth in bilateral tourist exchanges.</P>
      <P>In response to Canadian parliamentarians' questions about an
ongoing campaign to unseat him, Chen said any citizen can criticize
the government or the national leader now that Taiwan has evolved
from an authoritarian rule to a liberal democracy. But Chen stressed
that using non-peaceful or violent means to sabotage the country's
constitutional system and order is impermissible.</P>

    <HEADLINE>84% OF TAIWAN'S REPORTERS WANT TO CHANGE JOBS: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Sensing a deterioration in the media
environment, as many as 84 percent of Taiwan's journalists want to
leave their jobs, up from 64 percent just two years ago, according to
a poll whose results were released Thursday.</P>
      <P>The 1111 Jobs Bank made a survey of Taiwanese journalists Aug.
14-28 as Reporters Day falls on Sept. 1. Out of 376 valid samples, 91
percent of TV reporters said they wanted to leave their jobs,
compared with 87 percent of magazine reporters and 72 percent working
for Internet media.</P>
      <P>The survey said 85 percent of female reporters are considering
switching jobs, compared to 81 percent of male reporters.</P>
      <P>Why are they so fed up? A little over 44 percent of journalists
said they were most troubled by "not being able to make an
appointment with an interviewee, " while 31.38 percent felt the
profession held no future.</P>
      <P>Almost one-third of reporters said when their stories are
published they are not as objective as they would like. For example,
TV executives demand that reporters come up with a story within the
shortest possible time, making it difficult for reporters to schedule
interviews with a source. The time pressure is unbearable, they said.</P>
      <P>A fair majority of reporters thus feel they cannot choose
journalism as a lifetime career. A substantial number of reporters
were also irked that corporate "positions" influence how their
stories are presented and what subjects are assigned.</P>
      <P>Asked about their views on "rampant" paparazzi or muckraking
culture, few responded that it was a positive situation. Over 39
percent lamented that it indicates the "low quality" of Taiwan's
media; 19.15 percent acknowledged that prying into others' privacy
destroys social mores; and 17.02 percent said such practices
compromise the ethical standards and integrity of the profession.</P>
      <P>What are the advantages of being a reporter? The Jobs Bank found
journalists do appreciate certain aspects of their work. Over 74
percent said it increases their knowledge, 55.32 percent said it
helps widen their connections, and 35.64 percent said they have a
better grasp of current events and the "pulse of society" than other
office workers.</P>
      <P>However, these advantages are not enough to keep them on the job,
as only 16.49 percent of reporters surveyed said they have not
thought about hopping to a new one, whereas a whopping 83.51 percent
said they want to switch. In 2004, the same survey found 64 percent
wanted to do so.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
Thursday denied reports that President Chen Shui-bian plans to stop
over in the Philippines during his upcoming South Pacific visit.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Michel Lu said the ministry is still negotiating

in Guam, and that the ministry will report to the public as soon as
the two sides come to an agreement.</P>

opinions in that process of communication.</P>
      <P>Lu acknowledged that China has exerted great pressure on the

      <P>Chen is scheduled to depart Sept. 3 for Palau to attend a

Pacific before heading to Nauru for a visit Sept. 5. On his return
trip home Sept. 6, the president is reportedly planning to make a

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Financial Supervisory Commission
(FSC) Chairman Kong Jaw-sheng was indicted Thursday on charges of
breach of trust and conflict of interest, offenses the prosecution
said he committed while chairman of a state-owned enterprise.</P>
      <P>The prosecution charged that as Taiwan Sugar Corp. chairman from
January to June 2004, Kong violated the government procurement law by
dividing a NT$13 million procurement project into more than a dozen
smaller plans -- each worth less than NT$1 million -- to avoid the
legally required bidding process.</P>
      <P>The project was intended for Taisugar to add a new line of
business by setting up "orchid coffee" chain stores that sell coffee
at NT$500 per cup as well as orchids grown by the company.</P>
      <P>The law explicitly stipulates that government organizations
should not avoid the application of this law by dividing a major
procurement plan into smaller, less than NT$1 million projects.</P>
      <P>Kong was also charged for conflict of interest during the bidding
process involving a cosmetic product, and in the employment of his
wife's sister as an adviser to the orchid coffee shops.</P>
      <P>Reports have said that Ling Mei-chen, the sister of Kong's wife,
received a monthly salary of NT$100,000 without providing any service
to the coffee shops.</P>
      <P>The prosecution suggested that Kong be sentenced to seven years
behind bars for breach of trust and conflict of interest.</P>
      <P>When Kong was investigated in May, Premier Su Tseng-chang
suggested that he step aside as FSC chairman but Kong refused. Su
then suspended Kong from the job, and yet he still refused to tender
his resignation.</P>
      <P>During his tenure as FSC chairman, the "stock vultures" scandal
erupted involving his key staff, Financial Examination Bureau
Director Lee Chin-cheng, who now stands accused of leaking
information and other offenses that prosecutors said are punishable
by an eight-year jail term.</P>

      <P>Convicted rapists who are released on
parole will be subject to electronic surveillance to pevent
recidivism and the monitoring devices are expected to be in place by
the end of November, the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The ministry commissioned a high-tech company late last year to
develop an electronic surveillance system to track rapists on parole
and the first-phase testing on the system was completed in March this
year, MOJ officials said.</P>
      <P>The second-phase testing is scheduled to begin in mid-September,
the officials said, adding that if all goes smoothly the monitoring
system will be formally launched at the end of November.</P>
      <P>Under the new system, those released on parole after being
convicted of a sexual crime will be required to wear the electronic
monitors 24 hours a day in order to prevent recidivism.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the officials said, the MOJ has also purchased three
computerized polygraph sets for testing parolees. The ministry has
drafted training plans under which selected staff members will be
trained in operating a polygraph -- a device which measures and
records several physiological variables such as blood pressure, heart
rate, respiration and skin conductivity while a series of questions
is being asked, in an attempt to detect lies.</P>
      <P>The MOJ will install lie-detector panels in northern, central and

behavior, the officials said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
the government will continue encouraging businesses to engage in
research and development, with the goal of turning Taiwan into an
international R&amp;D headquarters.</P>
      <P>Chen said invention and creation are strongly related to a
country's economic growth and competitiveness and that Taiwan has
always enjoyed the reputation of being the "kingdom of invention,"
with the number of patents filed by Taiwanese ranking fourth in the
world.</P>
      <P>The government is actively encouraging multinational enterprises
to set up their regional R&amp;D bases in Taiwan, hoping the
introduction of foreign talent, technology, resources and systems
into Taiwan will complement that of domestic businesses, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said the government is also encouraging domestic businesses to
work toward innovation and establishing their R&amp;D centers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while addressing the opening of the 2006
Taipei International Invention Show and Technomart, which brings
together exhibitors from 11 countries including Taiwan, the United
States, Japan, the United Kingdom, Hungary, Israel and South Korea.</P>
      <P>Organizers estimated that at least 25 technology transactions
worth more than NT$200 million in total will be wrapped up during
this year's exhibition, which lasts until Sept. 3 at the
Taipei World Trade Center.</P>
      <P>Last year's exhibition attracted 42,000 visitors and facilitated

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An anti-corruption campaign on Thursday
urged one million people to write letters to judicial authorities,
pressing them to have courage and to impartially handle the
corruption scandals allegedly implicating President Chen Shui-bian's
family members and close aides.</P>
      <P>Jerry Fan, spokesman of the anti-corruption campaign, said at a
press conference that they are emulating the experience of South
Koreans, who wrote tens of thousands of letters to the Seoul district
court, urging it to investigate corruption cases involving the
country's former presidents -- Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo.</P>
      <P>The two ex-South Korean presidents were convicted of treason,
mutiny and corruption in 1996, and were then imprisoned, which Wei
Chien-feng, a lawyer in the campaign, attributed to the power of the
people.</P>
      <P>The campaign has been planning a massive sit-in in front of the
Presidential Office in September to press Chen to step down for the
corruption scandals allegedly involving his family members and close
aides.</P>
      <P>Fan, who made a series of commercials for Chen in the 2000
presidential election, stressed that if prosecutors can handle with
impartiality corruption cases implicating the first family, the
public would not have to hit the streets, which he said would exhaust
much of society's resources.</P>
      <P>Fan urged one million people to each write a letter to the Public
Prosecutors' Office of the Taiwan High Court as a prelude to the

    <TEXT>
      <P>A collection of prize-winning "soccer
robots" is being displayed at the 2006 Taipei International Invention
Show and Technomart which opened at the Taipei World Trade Center
Thursday. </P>
      <P>The collection was created by students and researchers at Tamkang
University's (TKU) Department of Electrical Engineering under a sport
android development project, led by TKU professor Wong Ching-Chang.</P>
      <P>The project, funded by the National Science Council, is dedicated
to creating robots possessing global vision and the capacity to move
in all directions.</P>
      <P>The TKU creations captured a golden medal and a bronze in this
year's robot-soccer world cup, held in Germany from June 30 through
July 3 by the Federation of International Robot-soccer Association
(FIRA).</P>
      <P>One famous objective of FIRA is to create a robot soccer team
that can beat the human world cup champions by 2050.</P>
      <P>While explaining how the soccer-playing robots work, Wong said
they are being equipped with 360-degree motion capturing cameras,
allowing them to receive and analyze visual input. Based on this
information, the robots calculate the best responses and use their
moving ability to shoot the ball. If the ball is missed, then the
process will restart again until the goal is made, added Wong.</P>
      <P>Wong said that previously, the individual robot could only work
as an "individual, " which means that it reacts only to create the
best situation for itself; however, the current communication
technology enables a team of robots to function like a team, which
can make the best move for the team.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ENT DOCTOR MAKES 'BLOWFISH' WITH BONES RECOVERED FROM PATIENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An ENT physician from Chiayi, southern
Taiwan, has built a blowfish with fishbones he recovered from his
patients' throats.</P>
      <P>Dr. Chang Wen-yuan from St. Martin De Porres Hospital has
recently spent two days building a blowfish with nearly 400 fishbones
that he "unearthed" from throats or noses over the past six years
during emergency operations he has performed on patients.</P>
      <P>Chang then hanged the objet d'art in his office, where the
balloon-like "fish" serves as a reminder to patients that they must
be extremely careful when they eat fish.</P>
      <P>Chang called on the public to be conscious of the fact that after
fishbones are stuck in the throat, forcible swallowing of water, rice
or noodles in an attempt to remove the fishbones from throats may be
dangerous. The best way to handle the mishap is to see an ENT doctor
immediately, who will in turn remove the bones professionally, he
added.</P>
      <P>"Being an ENT doctor, you never know what you might find in
patients' bodies, " Chang said, adding that over the past six years,
he has technically found everything in people's ears, noses and
throats -- ranging from a moth, a cockroach, beetles, a mosquito,
fries, spiders, bees to tiny crabs, small wall geckos, a leech, coins
and steel balls.</P>
      <P>He said accidentally getting a stuck fishbone in the throat might
not only be dangerous to one's health, it could also be financially
costly.</P>
      <P>He marveled that the blowfish he built is actually worth about
NT$400,000 since each emergency treatment for fishbones stuck in the
throat costs about NT$1,000, which includes emergency registration
fees, fees for diagnosis and costs of medication.</P>

expected to draw 6,000 participants, organizers said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Weng Jung-yi, main opposition Kuomintang's caucus whip in the

is organized by the caucus, its purpose is purely to fight corruption

      <P>Vietnam provides the most stable investment
environment in Southeast Asia for Taiwanese businesses, especially
the personal computer sector, an analyst said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Although Vietnam is still a communist country, it provides the
most stable investment environment compared to other Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, most of which are
experiencing political unrest, said Linda Lin, a researcher at the
Market Intelligence Center of the Institute for Information
Industry.</P>
      <P>Vietnam also boasts one of the best growth rates in gross
domestic product and gross national income among the ASEAN nations.</P>
      <P>"With the announcement of a new foreign investment policy in 2000
and the 2006-2010 national development plan in 2005, Vietnam is now a
new 'hotbed' for foreign investment, " she said. And Taiwan is
already the largest foreign investor in Vietnam.</P>
      <P>Government agencies will be the driving force behind the Vietnam
market, she said, as the Vietnamese government will be engaged in an
upgrading period with projects such as e-government to embrace its
"open door policy."</P>
      <P>This is why northern Vietnam, where the capital city of Hanoi is
located, will be a niche market for Taiwanese PC businesses, Lin
predicted.</P>
      <P>With Vietnam's membership in the World Trade Organization in

equipment is also expected to provide another niche factor for
Taiwanese PC businesses, Lin said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FINANCE MINISTER'S PLAN TO LEVY ENERGY TAX COMES UNDER FIRE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug.  31 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A plan by Finance Minister Ho Chih-chin to
levy an energy tax from July 1 2007 came under heavy fire Thursday
from opposition lawmakers who described him as "unfit for the job"
and criticized him for being "callous" to the suffering of the Taiwan
people.</P>
      <P>Legislators of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) told a press
conference at the Legislative Yuan that Ho seems interested only in
extracting money from the people, as his tax reform plan will levy an
energy tax on all forms of energy from July next year until 2016.</P>
      <P>"The finance minister should not treat the people as the
government's automatic teller machine, " said Legislator Tsai
Chin-lung, a whip of the KMT legislative caucus.</P>
      <P>Tsai estimated that the energy tax levy would translate into an
extra burden of some NT$3,000 per year to the average household,
which would in turn affect the manufacturing industries and cause
many small- and medium-sized businesses to collapse.</P>
      <P>The government should not be indifferent to the people's
suffering, reflected by successive suicides by whole families who
have chosen death rather than face up to their dire financial
straits, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Fei Hung-tai pointed out that the people's real
income has been decreasing over the past few years. He estimated that
Ho's plan to levy an energy tax will cause average personal incomes
in real terms to drop another 3 percent.</P>
      <P>Yang Chiung-ying, another KMT legislator, said the finance
minister should encourage enterprises to invest more instead of
increasing their financial burdens and adding to their difficulties.</P>
      <P>Ho is a former National Taiwan University economics professor who
replaced Joseph Lyu as finance minister July 4.</P>
      <P>He returned to Taiwan three years ago after serving in senior
posts in the United States Department of Justice and the U.S.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Fueled by Taiwan's "Go South" policy and
growing uncertainty in the China market, interest on the part of
Taiwanese corporations when it comes to investing in India has
increased vastly. Help from Taiwan's government will be vital for
corporate access to India's market, forum participants said Thursday
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>There is so much the government of Taiwan can do to help
corporations that are interested in -- but having difficulty --
investing in India, Sean Kao of the Market Intelligence Center (MIC)
said in a forum that discussed boosting bilateral investments between
Taiwan and India.</P>
      <P>For Taiwanese corporations, investing in India is a problem of
great complexity because there are different regulations and tax rates
in 28 states and the language barrier issue, said Lin Shih-chia,
Deputy Secretary-General of Taiwan-India Cooperation Council (TICC)
-- the forum's organizer.</P>
      <P>"The government can be a great help [for corporations], from
setting up a one-stop service, shortening customs clearance to
establishing a Taiwanese industrial park, " Kao said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is also keen on a free trade agreement (FTA) with India,
said Eric Wu, General Manager of iSuppli Taiwan. Once accomplished,
the FTA will also help Taiwanese businesses in India.</P>
      <P>As Taiwanese businesses are more curious than ever about India,
they should also deal with it cautiously, warned Kung Ming-yi, Vice
President of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research.</P>
      <P>"The situation in India has been a little bit confusing for
Taiwanese businesses. Because they see niches and difficulties at the
same time, " Kung said.</P>
      <P>"It is why I encourage all businesses that want to invest in
India should take a good hard look in the mirror and ask themselves
what they really want. Are you going there for Indian technology
talents, making money in India market, or try to establish a base of
production there? " Kung said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The World Health Organization (WHO) has
recently published a road safety manual citing Taiwan as a model
because of the government's success in implementing helmet laws for
motorcyclists.</P>
      <P>In the brochure titled: A Road Safety Manual for Decision-makers
and Practitioners published Aug. 29, WHO experts said wearing a
helmet is the single most effective way of reducing head injuries and
fatalities resulting from motorcycle and bicycle crashes.</P>
      <P>About 3 million people in Taiwan ride motorcycles to work every
morning and the first thing that these motorcyclists do before riding
off is to put on their helmets, an action that was extremely uncommon
prior to 2000, when the authorities made wearing a helmet mandatory
for motorcyclists and scooter riders.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is now considered a "model country" in terms of reducing
injuries and fatalities from road crashes, according to the WHO
manual.</P>
      <P>The brochure quoted an article authored by Chiu Wen-dah,
president of Taipei's Wanfang Hospital, and published in the U.S.
magazine Public Health in 2001 as indicating that after motorcyclists
were required to wear helmets, head injuries resulting from motorcycle
crashes were reduced by 33 percent from seven years ago, while the
average number of days spent in hospital as a result of road accidents
has also fallen significantly.</P>
      <P>Noting that motorcyclists who do not wear helmets are at a much
higher risk of sustaining head injuries and of dying from these
injuries, the brochure quoted Taiwan statistics as proving that
wearing helmet can reduce injuries by 70 percent and fatalities by 40
percent.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is the only country in Asia cited by the WHO as
illustrating that wearing a helmet is the single most effective way
of reducing head injuries and fatalities resulting from motorcycle
crashes.</P>
      <P>According to Chang Wu-hsiu, director-general of the Bureau of
International Cooperation under the Cabinet-level Department of
Health, the WHO brochure is being distributed worldwide to be used by
the authorities "in every country in the world" to bolster road
safety.</P>
      <P>The WHO authorities also urged governments around the world,
particularly poor or less-developed countries, to work out national
plans to implement helmet laws, Chang said.</P>

California's political leaders announced an

man-made causes of climate change despite
resistance in Washington. The deal between the

controls on the largest industrial sectors,
including utilities, oil refineries and cement

With conservative Felipe Calderon now all

he faces a critical issue that will determine
the success of his six-year term: How to prevent
growing political confrontation from undermining
the country's transition to democracy and free
markets. Calderon's narrow July 2 defeat of
his leftist opponent Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador
landed in a court, which this week rejected
Lopez Obrador's contention that the balloting

Lin's former secretaries, to 12 years in prison for taking bribes and
leaking confidential government information other than national
defense secrets during the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications' bidding process to select a company to operate the
ETC systems on Taiwan's freeways.</P>
      <P>Soong will also be deprived of his civil rights for eight years.
He was accused of accepting more than NT$700,000 (US$21,590) in
bribes and leaking secret MOTC documents to the contractor, Far
Eastern Electronic Toll Collection Co., before the ETC bidding took
place.</P>
      <P>The court also sentenced former Chingyeh Co. assistant manager
Tsai Chin-hung to two years and six months' imprisonment for offering
bribes to Soong, plus stripping him of his civil rights for one year.</P>
      <P>Soong indicated after the sentencing that he will appeal to the
Taiwan High Court. Tsai could not be reached for comment.</P>
      <P>According to the ruling by the Taipei District Court, Tsai, who
feared that public opinion was not favorable to Far Eastern's
outdated infrared system at the time, suggested to Lin and Soong that
they ask the MOTC's Institute of Transportation to put out a report
recommending that the infrared system be adopted.</P>
      <P>Lin and Soong accepted Tsai's proposal and then had the
requirements of the bidding process tailored according to Tsai's
request to favor Far Eastern. They also provided the names of the
members serving on the screening committee, along with other
confidential information about the MOTC's procurement plans.</P>
      <P>In early August, the Administrative Supreme Court upheld the
Administrative High Court's ruling that declared the government's
partnership with Far Eastern void because the firm was unfairly
favored during the bidding process for the project.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the sentence, opposition People First Party
legislators Lee Hung-chun and Liu Wen-hsiung said the MOTC should
immediately revoke Far Eastern's rights to operate the ETC system --
not only because the bidding process was rigged but because the
infrared-activated ETC system has a high failure rate and is far
below required standards.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SMEARING PRESIDENTIAL FUNCTION `AN INSULT TO PEOPLE:' PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
smearing his official function is tantamount to insulting and holding
the Taiwan people in contempt because performing his official duties
"symbolizes the common will of all fellow countrymen."</P>
      <P>While attending an informal gathering with local journalists on
the eve of Sept. 1 Reporters Day, Chen said the most vicious
rumormongering and mudslinging against him in recent days is a rumor
that he "will be fleeing abroad with a stash of jewelry and gold
bricks" when he sets out for a two-leg South Pacific official visit
this Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen, who has been dogged by a slew of corruption allegations
against himself, members of his family and staff, said he can endure
all sorts of attacks and curses at him.</P>
      <P>But smearing the presidential functions or mocking his
performance of his official duties authorized by the Constitution is
impermissible and can never be condoned, Chen said.</P>
      <P>In the face of China's perennial and ubiquitous diplomatic
suppression of Taiwan, Chen said his administration cannot afford to
watch as China is gearing up to lure away the country's diplomatic
allies.</P>
      <P>Noting that each of his overseas trips requires laborious
arrangements and preparations, Chen said his upcoming South Pacific
visit is no exception. "It is a solemn mission that should not be a
target of mockery out of base intent," he contended.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to depart for Palau Sunday to attend a
leader's summit with Taiwan's six South Pacific allies. He will also
visit Nauru and make a transit stop in the U.S. territory of Guam
before returning to Taipei Sept. 6.</P>
      <P>The embattled president also took the occasion to tout Taiwan's
progress in press freedom, saying that Taiwan has advanced nine
notches to 35th in the 2006 world rating of press freedom released by
the U.S. Freedom House.</P>
      <P>"Moreover, Taiwan ties with Japan for the first time this year at
the top of Asian countries in terms of the Freedom House global
rating, " Chen said. "All of us should treasure this hard-won
achievement."</P>
      <P>Chen's upcoming transit stop in Gum will be the first time he has
set foot on U.S. territory since he refused to make a transit stop i
n Alaska on a trip to Latin America in May.</P>
      <P>Chen will fly his official plane, known in Taiwan as "Air Force
One," for the first leg of his trip to Palau Sept. 3. However, for
the rest of his trip to Nauru and Guam, he will use commercial
airlines.</P>
      <P>Taiwan media have speculated that the U.S. objected to Chen's
official airplane landing in Guam, because the plane is perceived as
a symbol of state sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Liu Shih-fang said
the speculation was meaningless because the government took the
initiative to withdraw its original plan for Chen to fly to Guam via
his official plane.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WVT CALLS FOR MORE FAMILIES TO JOIN FOSTER CARE SERVICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The World Vision Taiwan (WVT) charity
organization said Thursday that it looks forward to seeing more local
families participate in its foster care program for abused children
and juveniles.</P>
      <P>According to WVT tallies, the number of reported abused
youngsters has been on a steady rise. In Taipei City alone, WVT, a
Christian charity dedicated to helping disadvantaged people at home
and abroad, have handled a total of 4,343 child abuse cases in the
past four years.</P>
      <P>Noting that an abused child represents a family in need of aid
and help, a WVT executive said abuse, neglect or desertion tends to
leave a heavy stain and burden on youngsters' psyches. "They not only
need therapy but also a healthy family life to heal their
pyschological wounds," the executive said.</P>
      <P>WVT has been commissioned by the Taipei city government's Social
Affairs Bureau to handle foster care for abused children and
juveniles since 1990.</P>
      <P>As of July this year, the executive said Taipei now has 131
families that offer foster care for 200 abused youngsters.</P>
      <P>With the number of abused and neglected children increasing
steadily, the executive said WVT hopes to recruit more qualified
families to join its foster care program to offer temporary shelter
for maltreated children.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER TRANSPORT MINISTER DISPUTES COURT RULING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Minister of Transportation and
Communications Lin Ling-san disputed a Taipei District Court ruling
Thursday that listed him as a suspect instead of a witness in the
case of the electronic toll collection (ETC) scandal.</P>
      <P>Lin claimed that the court ruling that he would have known his
former secretary Sung Nai-wu's decision about the ETC case is wrong.</P>
      <P>Lin told the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC)
that he plans to give a news conference the following afternoon
during which he said he would explain the ETC decision-making process
in detail.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taipei Prosecutor's Office said it is still
investigating the ETC case and that it will refer to the court ruling
in investigating Lin's role in the case.</P>
      <P>In the same ruling, the court sentenced Sung Nai-wu, one of Lin's
former secretaries, to 12 years in prison for taking bribes and
leaking confidential government information other than national
