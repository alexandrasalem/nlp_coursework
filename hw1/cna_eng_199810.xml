    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE ECONOMY SEEN SHRINKING IN THIRD QUARTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's economy is estimated to have
shrunk 2.5 percent in the third quarter, the first of four to five
likely quarters of contraction, the Business Times cited economists
as saying.</P>
      <P>Due to positive figures recorded for the first two quarters,
economic growth will likely hit 0.4 percent for the year but no
recovery is expected until the fourth quarter of 1999.</P>
      <P>Forecasts for next year range from minus 1.5 percent to 0.6
percent, while the London-based Consensus Economics earlier predicted
Singapore's economy would grow by 0.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Economists cited continued deterioration in regional economies,
moderation in the OECD demand growth, Japan's recession, and the
likelihood of further "crisis contagion" as reasons for the negative
outlook.</P>
      <P>As a result, both Singapore's manufacturing and services sectors
have come under stress, they said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THE PUPPETMASTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>He magically held time in his hands and
brought history to life on stage. His legendary life was immortalized
in the award-winning film "The Puppetmaster" by local avant-garde
director Hou Hsiao-hsien.</P>
      <P>During his life Lee Tien-lu was saluted as a living national
treasure, won international accolades, and received a level of
respect no other native Taiwan folklore artists could ever imagine
having.</P>
      <P>When he recently died at the age of 90, he had led a full and
interesting life with virtually no regrets. Lee had even embarked on
an acting career at the age of 75 when he began to play himself in
films.</P>
      <P>At his funeral, President Lee Teng-hui paid his personal respects
to the master puppeteer and granted him an official citation.</P>
      <P>The puppet master had also considered Bill Clinton as one of his
friends. Lee Tien-lu performed "The Magic Monkey" in 1985 for the
then governor of Arkansas during a goodwill trip to the United
States.</P>
      <P>According to legend, "The Magic Monkey" was one of the three
disciples of high priest Hsuan Tzang, who traveled to and from India
to acquire valued Buddhist scriptures during the Tang Dynasty.</P>
      <P>Clinton had confided to Lee that it was not easy for a southerner
to be elected president. Lee then told Clinton the story of the
mythical monkey's ascent to the throne of the empire after a long
quest fraught with difficulty, and wished him success on his own
quest of becoming host of the White House someday. Magically, in the
Year of the Monkey, Clinton realized his wish.</P>
      <P>Having built a career with his two hands, the puppet master was
saluted as one of the nation's living national treasures of the art
world at 80.</P>
      <P>Lee received the Time-Life Dedication to Arts Award presented in
a ceremony at the Lincoln Center in New York in 1991. He also
received Taiwan's highest cultural honor -- the Cultural Medal -- in
1991 for meritorious contribution to the development of Chinese
culture.</P>
      <P>Lee, born in 1909 in Taipei, started puppeteering at the age of 8
as an apprentice to his father. He first won fame in 1922 playing the
lead role in several acclaimed dramas.</P>
      <P>In 1931, Lee formed the Yi Wan Jan Puppetry Company. The
company's shows often drew crowds of over 10,000. "The Seven Swords
and 13 Knights," one of his masterpieces, was such a smash hit that
it was the talk of the island for many years.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA, Lee once recalled that as all the
shows were staged in open-air fields, his stage looked tiny and
remote in front of the enormous crowds. His characters, he said,
could be identified by the spectators only by the colors of their
wardrobes.</P>
      <P>It was in front of such expansive audiences 45 years ago that Lee
began having to use amplifiers. He was once told that even blind
people were attracted to his shows and they had "heard" every play he
put on and became just as enthralled by the performances as his other
fans.</P>
      <P>All of Lee's plays were based on stories about ancient Chinese
heroes or characters that inspired and enlightened the audience with
familiar folklore themes and cultural truths. During the show, while
his two hands were busy manipulating puppet figures, he also provided
the vocalization.</P>
      <P>Lee's mind was a storehouse of lines and lyrics comprising the
personas of all the characters in the dramas he performed. Even at
the age of 83, Lee could instantly conjure the image of a young
country bride on the eve of her wedding feast, or a northern horseman
sweeping into battle with sword drawn.</P>
      <P>He was especially popular for his innovative martial arts
sequences, acrobatic stunts, and use of modern slang mixed with
classical Chinese.

    <HEADLINE>PUPPETMASTER 2</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An optimistic and confident man, Lee never hesitated in trying
new things. At the age of 75, Lee ventured into movies. He played
himself in director Hou Hsiao-hsien's movie "The Puppetmaster." Lee
needed no script for the role as he was the drama and story.</P>
      <P>"The Puppetmaster" was Lee's third movie. He performed in two of
Hou's other films -- "Dust in the Wind," and "City of Sadness." The
latter was a Golden Lion Award winner in the Venice Film Festival of
1990.</P>
      <P>People's interest in puppet theater waned as time went on, and
although Lee's puppet shows continued to make headlines, they earned
little money.</P>
      <P>In 1978, Yi Wan Jan dropped its curtains for the last time.</P>
      <P>Lee turned his stage into a school, teaching puppetry to students
from countries all over the world. Lee said his students from France
got the highest grades because they performed regularly in a festival
of international performing arts every three years in Paris.</P>
      <P>One Australian student, a woman born in Taiwan, was in Lee's eyes
"the most respectable." She and her son gave three teaching puppet
shows for charity and in international cultural events promoting
Chinese cultural arts.</P>
      <P>Asked what attributes a foreigner should possess to become his
student, Lee responded they must have "a bit of the child inside,"
and "he must know Chinese."</P>
      <P>Lee did not know a single word in any foreign language, but he
had no difficulty in his frequent travels around the world with his
students alongside to help him.</P>
      <P>It seemed that Lee should have become complacent -- he had the
presidents of the Republic of China and the United States as his
friends, his sons to continue his lifelong career, a movie telling
his life story, fame and a bit of fortune (he was on the government's
payroll with a salary equivalent to that of a college professor).</P>
      <P>He had only one regret, that puppetry was a dying art in Taiwan,
and with it, a host of other local art forms were losing the type of
nurturing environment needed for their survival.</P>
      <P>To keep puppetry from becoming an endangered species on the
island, Lee and his sons gave free shows and lessons to children in
grade schools in Taipei. To Lee, children in Taiwan seemed to be
doing only two things -- studying and playing video games -- with
adults seemingly unconcerned about changing the situation.</P>
      <P>"If the trend continues," he said, "Chinese will someday have to
go abroad to see what Chinese puppetry is all about."</P>
      <P>Regretting that there was not a place for preserving and
cultivating new talent for local traditional performing arts,
including Taiwanese opera or the Ko Tsai Hsi, Peikuan Tsu-Ti opera,
and aboriginal music and dance, Lee once said there is an urgent need
for the establishment of a museum and a performance hall for local
traditional arts.</P>
      <P>He even envisioned a place near Teng-hui Boulevard in Tamsui as
an ideal site for the art center. Lee dreamed of a school for all the
arts, with resident artists and halls of various sizes established
for all kinds of performances, and a hotel with more than 500 rooms
to accommodate foreign performers and spectators.</P>
      <P>"I've sent my message to President Lee Teng-hui and he feels the
way I do," Lee told the CNA reporter.</P>
      <P>Through his strenuous efforts Taiwan's first puppet museum, the
Lee Tien-lu Museum, opened in Sanchih in Taipei's outskirts late last
year. The master's lifelong treasures, including a portable stage he
crafted by hand and six 100-year-old puppets adorned in ancient
wardrobes, are on display at the museum.</P>
      <P>The museum, offering year-round workshops for the training of
young puppeteers, actually serves as a time-space continuum of the
master's puppetry.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U-LAND AIRLINES SUSPENDS ALL FLIGHTS THURSDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Unable to shield itself from its group's
financial difficulties, U-Land Airlines announced a one-day
suspension of operations Thursday, resulting in the cancellation of
all its 14 daily domestic flights.</P>
      <P>U-Land Air Lines, a U-Land Group affiliate, was forced to suspend
services after checks worth NT$90 million (US$2.6 million) from the
group reportedly bounced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Other companies within the group include King Textile (formerly
known as Hwang Dih Lon Textile), U-Land Development and a travel
agency.</P>
      <P>According to reports, the group's textile and land development
companies are facing severe financial crises.</P>
      <P>U-Land Airlines, known for having offered NT$1 fares on flights
from Taipei to Kaohsiung when it started offering domestic flight
services in 1995, asked the public to bear with the company for the
next seven days while it attempts to sort out its troubles.</P>
      <P>No advance notice was given before the service suspension,
reportedly enraging would-be passengers. The airline offers daily
flights from Taipei to Kaohsiung, Taipei to Kinmen and Kaohsiung to
Kinmen.</P>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) on Thursday called on
the airline to draft a plan to improve its operations, and CAA
sources said the airline may be punished for the suspension.</P>
      <P>U-Land Group Chairman Chou Chi-jui, 40, was not available for
comment on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Before entering Taiwan's domestic air service market, the
Taichung-based group was known mainly for its construction and
real-estate development interests.</P>
      <P>The group entered the air service market after buying out a small
local airline and merging with one in the Philippines. Since then the
group has also pushed into textiles manufacturing, with investments
in Vietnam, and tourism, by acquiring a travel agency in Hong Kong.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FRUIT BAN SPOILS SOME TRAVELERS' RETURNS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Travelers returning to Taiwan were forced to
dump whatever fruit they may have been carrying as a ban on bringing
fruit from abroad into Taiwan went into effect on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Customs official said a number of passengers aboard an early
morning Cathay Pacific flight from South Korea had brought cartons of
pears and apples with them.</P>
      <P>After being informed of the new regulations by customs officials,
the passengers had to dump the fruit into one of several disposal
bins reluctantly.</P>
      <P>Peng Tzou-kuei, chairman of the Council of Agriculture (COA),
went to the airport to inspect the situation.</P>
      <P>As tourism has increased over the past decade, travelers bringing
fruits into Taiwan have unwittingly brought pests and plant diseases
as well, Peng said.</P>
      <P>He urged the public not to bring in fruit from overseas to ensure
a safe growing environment for domestic animals and plants.</P>
      <P>Peng said anyone attempting to bring fruit into Taiwan will be
advised to throw it away. Those who refuse to do so will face fines
ranging between NT$30,000 and NT$150,000 (US$867 and US$4,335).</P>
      <P>Noting that the ban was imposed after a three-month campaign to
make the public aware of the new regulation, customs officials urged
the public to observe the ban and not to endanger Taiwan's
agricultural environment.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that most other nations have similar bans in
place. Taiwan previously allowed people to bring in up to two
kilograms of fruit, but this was found to be insufficient in
preventing the introduction of diseases and pests.</P>
      <P>Taiwan travelers most often bring back pears from Japan, durian
from Thailand, and apples and grapes from the United States.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>One Nation leader Pauline Hanson has run
up a bill of about A$110,000 (US$68,700) to protect her from
protesters and media during the federal election campaign,
Queenland's Police Minister Tom Barton said.</P>
      <P>Hanson has often clashed with journalists who have asked tough
questions which she refused to answer. She has instead resorted to
calling the police to evict reporters from news conferences or party
functions, Barton said.</P>
      <P>Barton said he was "disappointed" One Nation had called police to
evict journalists from the party's campaign launch on Tuesday in
Brisbane.</P>
      <P>Queensland Premier Peter Beattie was even blunter, saying: "They
(One Nation) should not compromise the police by inviting them to
sort out this stupid political game."</P>
      <P>"If you're in an election campaign and you release a document to
the media and then you try to throw them out, well that's just
frankly ridiculous. In a democracy, while the media can be a pain
from time to time ... they have a very important role to play in our
society in terms of informing the community and keeping the
politicians on their toes," he said.</P>
      <P>Hanson has refused any news coverage this week because she
regarded the coverage as harassment to her election campaign.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OZONE HOLE IN SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE SAID GROWING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The hole in the Southern Hemisphere's
ozone layer has grown to a record size this year, according to
Australian and US scientists</P>
      <P>They said the hole of over 26 million square kilometers leaves
the earth temporarily unprotected from the sun's harmful ultra-violet
rays, the largest since 1994 when it measured 24 million square
kilometers.</P>
      <P>Dr. Roger Atkinson, the leader of the ozone research unit at the
Meteorology Cooperative Research Center in Melbourne, said the 1998
peak occurred during the past fortnight.</P>
      <P>In most other years, the hole has been between 20 and 22 million
square kilometers while 1998 may turn out to be an anomalous year
because of growing fear that global warming may be worsening the
chemical reactions that destroy ozone in the stratosphere.</P>
      <P>"The very chemicals causing ozone depletion are also very strong
greenhouse gases," Atkinson said.</P>
      <P>"Ozone itself is very important in the climate balance and so if
we interfere with stratospheric ozone we may well be interfering with
the radiator balance of the atmosphere," he said. "Perhaps we are
seeing the first evidence that the two phenomenon -- ozone depletion
and climate change -- may be interacting."</P>
      <P>Speaking at the ozone meeting in Melbourne, Dr. Susan Soloman of
the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said volcanic
eruptions were also impacting on the ozone hole.</P>

the religion's 2,000th anniversary in mainland China.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Beijing, the Sydney Morning Herald's

      <P>There are now reportedly between 200,000 and 300,000 monks and
nuns and up to 300 million people who are influenced by Buddhism,
making it the most popular religion on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Temples, monasteries and holy sites were desecrated and closed
during the Cultural Revolution. However, people are now seeking
spiritual solace in Buddhism and other religions including
Christianity after years of chasing materialism, the report said.</P>
      <P>All religions in mainland China, including the official and

      <P>Chinese authorities still suppress religious activity outside the

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE SYMPOSIUM HERALDS ARRIVAL OF CUSTOMIZED MEDICINE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The day is not far off when patients will
be prescribed medicine suited to their unique genetic make-up.</P>
      <P>This means that two people with similar ailments and symptoms
will not necessary be given the same treatment. Researchers in the
United States are confident that such customized treatment will be
possible by 2010.</P>
      <P>Professor John Wooley, who has been involved in what is called
the genome project since it started in the 1980s, said it will help
doctors better treat diseases such as cancer.</P>
      <P>Wooley, associate director of the US Department of Energy, was
one of two keynote speakers on Thursday at a symposium at the
National University of Singapore on biomedical informatics, a field
that combines medicine and information technology.</P>
      <P>Wooley told The Straits Times that researchers expect to discover
and study close to a million genes by the year 2005, while by 2010
they hope to have obtained samples from more than 50,000 people.</P>
      <P>With this databank in place, doctors would have the means to
administer what Wooley called "individualized medicine."</P>
      <P>"Humans are very much alike in terms of their genetic, but each
individual is also unique in his or her own right," he said.</P>
      <P>"This, for example, explains why some people can eat more dessert
and not put on weight, and why others are able to consume more
alcohol and not get drunk."</P>
      <P>"It also means that treatment which works for one person may not
necessary work for the next," he said.</P>
      <P>Citing his own experience, he said: "I was first diagnosed with
cancer about 20 years ago, but the tumor disappeared when I responded
positively to the treatment. But I also saw others dying because they
did not."</P>

    <HEADLINE>4 MORE ALLIES VOICE SUPPORT FOR ROC'S UN BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Sept.  30  (CNA)
(By K.C. Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Four more allies of the Republic of
China -- the Commonwealth of Dominica, Saint Christopher and Nevis,
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Senegal -- voiced their staunch
support for the ROC's bid to rejoin the United Nations on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Addressing a general debate session of the 53rd UN General
Assembly, Dominica Prime Minister Edison James said the 21.5 million
people of Taiwan aspire to be represented in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>"They have a legitimate expectation that their country, a
founding member of the United Nations, should have its membership
restored. We cannot but lend them our support," James said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the UN policy must be a policy of "inclusion," James
said, "In all our deliberations and actions, as indeed in every
aspect of human endeavor, the aspirations and the legitimate
expectations of the people must be central."</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Saint Christopher Prime Minister
Denzil Douglas said he believes that the time has come for the
voice of the millions of Chinese people in Taiwan to be heard and
factored into the international agenda.</P>
      <P>"We believe that adequate, urgent and practical mechanisms must
be developed to allow them to participate in the work of all
nations," Douglas added.</P>
      <P>He urged the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to conduct
negotiation and adopt confidence-building measures as a way forward
to improve cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Douglas further said the United Nations is obligated to work
with and encourage the Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait to support the progress made to date, so that the advancement
of the human condition transcends politics.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Saint Vincent Foreign Minister Chiefton Allan
Cruickshank called on all UN member states to remember the rights of
the 21.5 million people on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The Republic of China, both prosperous and democratic, deserves
to be re-admitted as a member of the United Nations, even as it
pursues the goal of reunification," Cruickshank said, adding that it
is necessary that the United Nations offers the forum for discussion
that will provide the framework for the peaceful reunification of
both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Senegal Foreign Minister Jacques Baudin said Senegal supports
the ROC's accession to the United Nations and its affiliated
organizations based on the principle of membership universality.</P>
      <P>Baudin said his country has joined with other ROC allies in
presenting a motion asking the UN to re-examine its 1971 Resolution
No. 2758 which admitted mainland China at the expense of the ROC.</P>
      <P>Senior leaders from 14 other countries have also voiced explicit
or indirect support for the ROC's UN bid since the general debate
session of the 53rd General Assembly opened on Sept. 21. They
were: Burkina Faso; Latvia; Costa Rica; Paraguay; Nicaragua; the
Dominican Republic; the Czech Republic; Honduras; El Salvador;
Swaziland; Liberia; Belize; the Gambia; and Fiji.</P>
      <P>Latvia, the Czech Republic, and Fiji do not maintain formal
diplomatic ties with the ROC. More countries are expected to follow
suit before the general debate session closes on Oct. 2.</P>
      <P>The UN Steering Committee rejected earlier this month the
inclusion into this year's General Assembly agenda a motion presented
by 15 of the ROC's allies urging the UN to review its 1971 Resolution
No. 2758, which expelled the ROC to make way for mainland China.</P>
      <P>This is the sixth consecutive year that the ROC has spearheaded
its UN campaign through its diplomatic allies. Even though the bid,
like previous ones, failed to make the annual General Assembly
agenda, the ROC government has vowed to continue its efforts in this
regard.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING URGED TO EXPLAIN PURPOSE OF CRUISE MISSILE TEST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China should clarify a press report
that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) was scheduled to test-fire
cruise missiles in the East China Sea on Thursday afternoon, a senior
Republic of China official said.</P>
      <P>"In order to demonstrate Beijing's good intentions towards
cross-strait relations, the mainland should explain its motives and
goals of test-firing cruise missiles at this moment," said Lin
Chong-pin, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC).</P>
      <P>Lin said the report had not yet been confirmed. "If the report is
true, mainland China should take the initiative to promote military
transparency by making public its purpose in test-firing cruise
missiles," the scholar-turned-technocrat said.</P>
      <P>Lin, a specialist on mainland China's military development, said
the PLA began to develop medium-range cruise missiles long ago, and
managed to produce a prototype in 1996 which had a maximum effective
range of 1,800 kilometers.</P>
      <P>"The mainland military has since developed an improved version of
the cruise missile, but the modified model has not yet operated very
successfully," Lin said, adding that a recent test-firing failed.</P>
      <P>Lin said the cruise missile can fly at low altitude and is guided
by its own computer. "The missile, usually armed with a nuclear
warhead, can not only fly on a pre-set route but can also alter
course in mid-flight," he explained.</P>
      <P>He noted that the cruise missile is far more sophisticated than
the M-class missiles that the PLA test-fired in the Taiwan Strait in
the run-up to the ROC's first-ever direct presidential election in
March 1996 to intimidate Taiwan voters.</P>
      <P>Lin said he could not believe that Beijing's test-firing of the
cruise missiles at this moment, if confirmed, could possibly be
described as a sign of good intent, especially as Taiwan's top
negotiator with the mainland is scheduled to make an ice-breaking
visit to Beijing and Shanghai next month.</P>
      <P>"We sincerely hope that Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
Chairman C.F. Koo's Oct. 14-19 mainland visit can produce concrete
results to help resolve some practical issues related to the
interests and well-being of the people on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait," Lin added.</P>
      <P>SEF is a quasi-official intermediary body authorized by the ROC
government to handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence of
official ties.</P>
      <P>Lin went on to say that mainland China is developing new military
strategies for use against Taiwan, including an "asymmetrical warfare
strategy" under which mainland China will use ballistic missiles to
attack Taiwan's major cities and military bases.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he said, mainland China is also developing
laser-directed energy weapons and electromagnetic pulse bombs. "These
highly advanced weaponry systems will pose a serious threat to
Taiwan's security," he warned.</P>
      <P>As for a proposed visit to the mainland by ROC President Lee
Teng-hui, Lin said the realization of the proposal will hinge on
mainland China's attitude and practical actions.</P>
      <P>"It will depend on whether Beijing can show goodwill toward
Taiwan on the diplomatic and military fronts," Lin stressed, adding
that the title under which Lee visits the mainland is only a minor
problem.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA TO FACE STRUCTURAL CHANGES NEXT YEAR: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior mainland affairs official
predicted on Thursday that mainland China will undergo
significant structural changes next year.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Lin Chong-pin
said he made the forecast not out of any ill motivations.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, Lin said, the Republic of China does not
like to see any turmoil in mainland China because an unstable
mainland will also adversely affect Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lin said, the government is obligated to study and
evaluate the mainland situation and inform local people of possible
developments there.</P>
      <P>Lin attributed his forecast to three factors: Mainland China has
consistently undergone structural changes once every 10 years over
the past decades; mainland China is simultaneously undertaking many
major reform programs, which will add to uncertainty and risks;
mainland China has faced many unexpected challenges since last year,
including the Asian financial crisis, serious flooding and
deflation.</P>
      <P>From political, economic and social angles, Lin said, mainland
China is on a downward streak. For instance, its economic growth has
slowed; its credit crunch has shown no signs of abating; and the
value of the mainland currency is declining in the black market.</P>
      <P>Quoting a study released recently by the US-based George
Washington University, Lin further said mainland China is at a
critical juncture of significant changes and faces an uncertain,
unstable future.</P>
      <P>Lin went on to say that the time is still not right for ROC
President Lee Teng-hui to meet his mainland counterpart, Jiang
Zemin.</P>
      <P>He further said mainland China is very likely to launch a new
diplomatic offensive against Taiwan after Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) Chairman C. F. Koo's ice-breaking visit to the
mainland in mid-October.</P>
      <P>Lin said the ROC sincerely hopes that Koo's Oct. 14-19 mainland
visit will produce positive results to help resume institutionalized
cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>During his mainland visit, Koo will meet with Wang Daohan,
chairman of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS), to discuss matters of mutual concern. Koo
will also meet with mainland President Jiang and Vice Premier Qian
Qichen.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are semi-official intermediary bodies authorized
by their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in
the absence of official ties.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two committees of the Legislative Yuan on
Thursday approved a government plan to donate US$14.85 million for
the Asian Development Bank's seventh Asian Development Fund (ADF).</P>
      <P>The total development fund amounts to US$6.3 billion, and will be
loaned to less-developed countries between 1997 and 2000.</P>
      <P>Of this figure, US$2.7 billion will come from compulsory
donations by the ADB's 24 member countries. Taiwan is required to
donate US$14.85 million, payable in four installments, between
November 1997 and the end of 2000.</P>
      <P>After hearing a report from Perng Fai-nan, governor of the
Central Bank of China, the Finance Committee and the Foreign and
Overseas Chinese Committee under the Legislative Yuan approved the
government's plan to begin compiling a budget for the donation from
fiscal 1999.</P>
      <P>The development fund was first initiated by the ADB in 1973 to
help finance projects in less-developed countries. The ROC began
making donations to the fund in 1983, when it contributed US$2
million. In 1992, the ROC donated US$15 million to the sixth ADF.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEPD CLARIFIES WIRE SERVICE'S REPORT OF TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC GROWTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) under the Executive Yuan said Thursday that a
foreign wire service probably made a mistake in a report on Taiwan's
expected economic growth next year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's news media Thursday cited a foreign wire service as
reporting that the latest economic forecast from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) called for Taiwan's economy to grow by 4 percent
this year and 2 percent next year. Despite the decline, Taiwan would
remain the only so-called "Asian Dragon" to achieve positive economic
growth during the two-year period.</P>
      <P>Responding to the reports, the CEPD said the wire service may
have mistaken the growth rate of Australia for that of Taiwan.
Figures for the two countries lay close together on a table of
statistics in the IMF forecast. It is Australia, not Taiwan, that is
expected to see economic growth of only 2 percent next year,
officials said.</P>
      <P>The IMF report predicts economic growth of 4 percent for Taiwan
next year, but CEPD officials said the figure was too low, noting
that even conservative estimates call for growth next year of between
5.3 percent and 5.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The 4 percent figure predicted by the IMF is the most pessimistic
one to date.</P>
      <P>Thomas M. F. Yeh, director of the Economic Research Department
under the CEPD, remarked that even before Asia's financial turmoil
developed into a worldwide crisis Taiwan had adopted a policy of
expanding domestic demand by expanding public construction projects
and promoting private investment.</P>
      <P>According to data issued in August by the Directorate General of
Budget, Account and Statistics, economic growth (including the
contribution of expanding domestic demand projects) will amount to
5.3 percent in 1998 and 5.75 percent for the upper half of 1999. A
September forecast by the CEPD called for growth of 5.11 percent this
year and 5.32 percent in 1999.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Chung-Hua Institute for Economic Research forecast
in July growth of 5.2 percent for 1998 and 6.18 percent for 1999,
while the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research forecast economic
growth this year of 5.5 percent.</P>
      <P>As for predictions from foreign organizations, reports issued in
June by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) put Taiwan's annual economic growth this year and next are 5.9
percent and 6.2 percent, while the Wharton Econometric Forecasting
Association estimated Taiwan's economy would grow by an annual rate
of 5.2 percent and 5.3 percent, respectively, during the same
two-year period.</P>

      <P>Lee listed four objectives the government will strive to realize:</P>

government-implemented remodeling projects, the establishment of
liberalized and internationalized economic and trade systems, the

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING WOULD WELCOME VISIT BY LEE IN `APPROPRIATE CAPACITY'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung and Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tang Shubei, vice chairman of Beijing's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS)
reiterated on Thursday that Beijing would welcome a visit from ROC
President Lee Teng-hui, under the correct circumstances.</P>
      <P>In an interview with Beijing-based Central TV Station which was
replayed by Hong Kong's Asia TV on Thursday, Tang said that mainland
Chinese President Jiang Zemin would like to make a trip to Taiwan,
and that "Taiwan's leader," as he referred to Lee, would be welcome
to visit mainland China in an "appropriate capacity."</P>
      <P>He did not elaborate on what would constitute an appropriate
capacity, saying only that the matter should be resolved before any
such visit could take place.</P>
      <P>Tang said any exchange of visits by the two leaders would be
"political-charged moves, rather than ordinary trips."</P>
      <P>He called for the two sides to open political dialogue which,
instead of being limited to specific issues, should cover any ideas
conducive to the reunification of Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Political talks can start only after consensus on their agenda
has been reached through the loosely-organized dialogue, said Tang.</P>
      <P>In a gesture seen as an olive branch to Beijing, President Lee
Teng-hui offered in his inaugural speech of 1996 to make a "trip for
peace" to Beijing. Remote as the chance for such a trip might be, the
issue was raised again by the media now that Taipei and Beijing are
set to resume high-level contacts through their respective frontmen
in October, after a five-year hiatus.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan has made it clear that Lee will visit Beijing
only if he can travel as president of the Republic of China, a demand
Beijing refuses to accept, because it does not recognize the ROC.</P>
      <P>In Washington on Tuesday, Beijing's Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan
ruled out the possibility that Beijing would allow Lee to visit as
ROC president. He also warned US Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright not to let the Taiwan issue become a sticking point in their
bilateral relations by flirting with the island.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's population growth is expected to
hit zero in 30 to 40 years if the island's divorce rate and low birth
rate continue at the current pace, according to a report carried by
the Liberty Times in its Thursday edition.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics released by the Taiwan Provincial Family
Planning Research Center (TPFPRC) at a seminar, the report said a
continued declining population growth will exacerbate the current
labor shortage and greatly hinder the country's economic development.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Taiwan's men and women marry for the
first time at the age of 31 and 28, respectively. Of every 1,000
married couples 1.7 will divorce, while each woman of child-bearing
age only gives birth to an average 1.67 babies.</P>
      <P>Marriage at an older age and rising divorce rates are the two
major factors that will keep Taiwan's birth rate at a low level, the
report noted. The TPFPRC suggested that the government work out
measures to provide sufficient child-care services and assistance to
mothers as a way of helping to lift the island's falling birth rate.</P>
      <P>The TPFPRC also found that the birth rate among women under the
age of 20 has risen from 39 percent in 1965 to the present level of
77.2 percent, while babies born to women over 35 currently account
for about 6.6 percent of the annual total, up from the 2.8 percent
registered in 1988, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The TPFPRC was quoted as saying that lowering the birth rate
among teenagers and elderly child-bearing women, while increasing the
birth rate for women in their child-bearing prime, is one of the
biggest challenges it will have to face in the future.</P>
      <P>The figures put forward by the TPFPRC reportedly aroused grave
concern of Chan Chi-shean, director-general of the Cabinet-level
Department of Health (DOH), and many of the other experts who took
part in the seminar.</P>
      <P>Chan said the DOH, in conjunction with relevant government
agencies, will hammer out a new population policy for the new
millennium to tackle the coming demographic changes and labor force
demands, the report said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SAVE BABY DWARF SPERM WHALE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Pingtung,  southern  Taiwan,  Oct.  2  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Veterinarians at a
southern Taiwan center for stranded cetaceans have been dispatching
e-mail messages around the world since Thursday night in an attempt
to save the life of a baby dwarf sperm whale critically injured in a
shark attack.</P>
      <P>The veterinarians are giving the whale glucose and medicine
intravenously, while soaking it in an antibiotics-filled solution.
They are, however, unsure what to feed it, as they have never before
encountered a baby dwarf sperm whale.</P>
      <P>The whale, one meter long and most likely several months old, and
its mother were found Thursday morning on the shore of Kaohsiung's
Hsitzuwan Beach. The whales had scrambled there to escape a school of
sharks. Both whales had sustained multiple wounds. The mother, which
measured about 2.5 meters in length, died around noon after being
moved fully ashore.</P>
      <P>The baby whale was taken from Kaohsiung to the center in
Pingtung, and center veterinarian Chien Chao-hua said he is glad the
whale seems to be responding to treatment.</P>
      <P>The mother's body, meanwhile, has been sent to National Sun
Yat-sen University's Institute of Marine Sciences in Kaohsiung for
analysis.</P>
      <P>Among the species of whale, the dwarf sperm whale is relatively
small, as are the size of the groups in which it travels. In
temperament, the dwarf sperm whale is generally timid and nervous,
Chien said.</P>
      <P>Sperm whales and baleen whales are the species most often seen in
Taiwan, although beaked whales, killer whales and dwarf sperm whales
are sometimes spotted as well, according to Professor Chou
Lien-hsiang of National Taiwan University.</P>
      <P>The dwarf sperm whale is similar in size to the dolphin, to which
it is closely related. Dolphins, whales and porpoises are all
cetaceans, an order of fish-like mammals that lack external hind
limbs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REGULATIONS GOVERNING MAINLAND SPOUSES STAY IN TAIWAN TO BE EASED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  2  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will ease regulations
governing the stay of mainland spouses of Taiwan residents in Taiwan
who have children aged 6 years or under, an official of the Ministry
of the Interior said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Tseng Wen-chang, commissioner of the Bureau of Entry and Exit,
said that under the new regulations, mainland spouses who have to
take care of children 6 or under can apply to stay in Taiwan for six
months and can apply to return to Taiwan as soon as they leave the
island.</P>
      <P>Currently, the government allows mainland spouses who have young
children but lack permanent residency to stay for three months, after
which they may receive an additional three-month extension. Mainland
spouses can stay for a maximum of six months every year.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that out of humanitarian considerations, mainland
spouses will be allowed to apply to come as often as they want,
although each stay will be limited to six months at most.</P>
      <P>The number of marriages between people from opposite sides of the
Taiwan Strait has jumped since Taiwan liberalized civilian exchanges
with mainland China in 1988. The government began to allow mainland
spouses to reside in Taiwan in 1992, with a quota set at 240. By last
year, that quota had been raised to 1,800.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that mainland spouses who apply to reside in
Taiwan to take care of their children aged under 6 years will have to
wait three years and seven months before they receive approval under
current regulations.</P>
      <P>The new regulations will be sent to the Executive Yuan for
approval soon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT REAFFIRMS TIES WITH ROC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Costa Rican President Miguel Angel
Rodriguez said here on Thursday that his country will maintain its
formal diplomatic relations with the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Rodriguez added that Costa Rica is interested in
developing trade and economic ties with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Rodriguez, who arrived in Washington, D.C. Wednesday for an
official visit, made the statements in response to inquiries
from a group of Taiwan journalists stationed here.</P>
      <P>Costa Rican Foreign Minister Roberto Rojas Lopez met with his
mainland Chinese counterpart, Tang Jiaxuan, at the United Nations
headquarters in New York on Sept. 22. The move has caused Taipei's
concern.</P>
      <P>Rodriguez told Taiwan reporters that the Rojas-Tang meeting
mainly focused on trade and economic affairs. "We believe that
forging commercial ties with mainland China will in no way
affect our diplomatic relationship with the ROC," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Rodriguez went on to say that Rojas had discussed the issue with
ROC Foreign Minister Jason Hu and that both sides have reached an
understanding on the issue.</P>
      <P>The Costa Rican head of state further said Costa Rica currently
has no plans to change its longstanding relationship with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Asked about the possibility of Costa Rica exchanging
representative offices with mainland China, Rodriguez said Costa
Rican authorities have not yet made a final decision on the matter.</P>
      <P>Costa Rica has maintained cordial relations with the ROC. But it
has been unable to shun engagement with mainland China since it
became a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council
(UNSC) in January 1997.</P>
      <P>Beijing has consistently attempted to take advantage of its
status as a UNSC permanent member to sabotage ROC's relations with
its diplomatic allies and even lure away all of them. For example,
it has through its private companies purchased bananas from Costa
Rica with unreasonably high prices.</P>
      <P>Because of its status as a UNSC non-permanent member, Costa Rica
didn't sign a motion asking the United Nations to re-examined its
1971 Resolution N0. 2758, which admitted mainland China into the
world body at the expense of the ROC. The motion was presented by 15
of the ROC's diplomatic allies in July.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, Costa Rican Foreign Minister Rojas still took
advantage of his speech at a UN General Assembly debate session last
week to throw support behind the ROC's UN bid. Rojas said he looks
forward to seeing all countries around the world represented in the
UN without any exception in the near future.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, a senior Foreign Ministry official said ROC-Costa
Rican relations remain firm and solid.</P>
      <P>"Many cooperative programs between our two countries have
proceeded smoothly," said Chen Ming-cheng, deputy director of the
ministry's Information and Cultural Affairs.</P>
      <P>Chen said Costa Rica has on many occasions assured the ROC that
it has no intention of forging official ties with Beijing and
that its economic exchanges with mainland China are confined to
dealings between private enterprises.</P>
      <P>"We are confident of Costa Rica's commitment to our country,"
Chen said, adding that the Foreign Ministry has also reminded Costa
Rica of Beijing's political motivations behind its purchases of Costa
Rican bananas.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN LEADERS STAKE VICTORY ON TAX REFORM, JOBS (1)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,   Oct.   2   (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Prime Minister John Howard of
Australia's Liberal Party hopes that his tax reform package will get
him re-elected for a second term, while his rival, Labor leader Kim
Beazley, believes jobs will be the issue that puts the Labor Party
back in power.</P>
      <P>Analysts say the ruling coalition, comprising the Liberal and
National parties, is running neck and neck with Labor.</P>
      <P>The key issue of Howard's re-election campaign is tax reform, and
to that end the prime minister has proposed a 10 percent goods and
services tax (GST). The tax would enable the government to lower
taxes on businesses, which Howard has said will lead to growth in
exports.</P>
      <P>Beazley, meanwhile, has focused on unemployment, vowing to trim
the nation's unemployment rate, currently at 8.2 percent, to 5
percent within six years.</P>
      <P>He said his government would create 500,000 jobs during his first
three-year term through more training and through economic incentives
for more investment.</P>
      <P>To achieve his target, economists said Beazley must create a
total of 1.3 million jobs. This will be difficult, as the global
economy is edging toward recession, they said.</P>
      <P>Howard described Beazley's target as "unthinkable and
ridiculous."</P>
      <P>Howard succeeded Paul Keating as prime minister in March 1996
after a landslide victory for his party in federal elections.</P>
      <P>His settlement of native title legislation engendered significant
and lingering opposition to his leadership, while his introduction of
gun control legislation has enraged many gun owners, particularly
farmers and hunters.</P>
      <P>Businesses, especially large companies, are supporting Howard's
tax reform plan, particularly the proposed GST, as Howard has
promised to lower business tax rates from 33 percent to 30 percent
after the GST is introduced.</P>
      <P>According to analysts, low-income earners and rural Australians
worry that the tax will be damaging in the long term, as the
government may raise the GST rate to finance its expenditures.</P>
      <P>Beazley warned Australian voters, especially low-income earners,
against electing Howard, saying Australia should "never, ever" adopt
a GST. Howard too promised not to implement a GST when he was named
prime minister in 1996.</P>
      <P>Beazley said it would be impossible for any future government to
repeal or even amend it to exclude food once it had been introduced
by the Howard government.</P>
      <P>Rather than introduce a GST, the Labor Party would spur economic
growth by providing job opportunities to low- and middle-income
earners, Beazley said.

    <TEXT>
      <P>In Australia, there are 761,000 people out of work.</P>
      <P>The focus on jobs is a gamble for the 50-year-old Beazley, who
became a full-time federal Member of Parliament at the age of 32.</P>
      <P>Economists have said Beazley's plan to create jobs would be easy
to enact if the global economy were in better shape. But the
currently ailing global economy may require two to three years to
recover.</P>
      <P>"This makes it quite difficult for Beazley to create 500,000 jobs
in the first three years if he wins the Saturday election," one
economist said.</P>
      <P>Analysts said a loss for the 59-year-old Howard would bring to
an end a political career that has spanned more than 20 years.</P>
      <P>If Beazley were to lose, though, the opposition leader could
still stage a comeback in the next round of federal elections, as it
appears unlikely that he will be unseated as the leader of the Labor
Party.</P>
      <P>In all, 148 seats in the House of Representatives and 38 seats
in the Senate are up for grabs in Saturday's election.</P>
      <P>"This could be the closest race between the Liberal Party and
the Labor Party in Australia," one election analyst said.</P>

      <P>Many ethnic Chinese, Vietnamese and
Koreans in New South Wales are expected to vote against Prime
Minister John Howard and his Liberal Party in Saturday's election.</P>
      <P>In a survey, the Australian Financial Review quoted Helen
Sham-Ho, member of the New South Wales Parliament, as saying that she
was convinced that the Chinese community in Sydney and other cities
in New South Wales are preparing to send a message that will threaten
to rock John Howard in his own ethnically diverse electorate.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong-born Sham-Ho warned that most of the Chinese and
Hong Kong-born Australians in the seat of Bennelong, about 5.4
percent of the total electorate, are voting against Howard and his
Liberal candidates.</P>
      <P>Instead, they will support candidates from the Labor Party and
the newly formed Unity Party, she said.</P>
      <P>"Racism to them is the primary thing they think about. They see
it (the government's position on Australia's One Nation Party) as
Howard more or less pandering to One Nation, giving it tacit
approval," she said.</P>
      <P>Sham-Ho resigned from the Liberal Party in July because of her
disappointment with Howard's leadership.</P>
      <P>In 1996 there were 340,000 Australians of Chinese origin,
according to census figures. It is believed that figure may now stand
at about 400,000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MILITARY DRILLS END EARLIER THAN SCHEDULED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hengchun,  southern  Taiwan, Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Gen. Tang Fei, chief of
the general staff of the ROC Ministry of National Defense, announced
an early conclusion to this year's combined forces military drills
Friday in what he called "consideration of cross-strait relations."</P>
      <P>Tang presided over a drill involving all three branches of the
ROC military Friday. Toward the end of the exercise, Tang said
further drills, scheduled to begin on Oct. 7 and Oct. 12, would be
canceled in an effort to foster goodwill and prevent possible
misunderstandings across the strait.</P>
      <P>More precisely, Tang said, the Ministry of National Defense
decided to conclude the annual military exercises early to prevent it
from affecting an upcoming meeting between Taiwan's top negotiator,
Koo Chen-fu, and his mainland Chinese counterpart, Wang Daohan.</P>
      <P>Koo, chairman of Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation, is
scheduled to make a fence-mending visit to Shanghai and Beijing in
mid-October.</P>
      <P>Tang urged the Beijing authorities to reciprocate Taipei's show
of goodwill by exercising restraint in their military activities.
News reports have said that the People's Liberation Army is scheduled
to test fire cruise missiles into the East China Sea on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Some in Taiwan have questioned the mainland's motives behind the
exercise, especially at a time when cross-strait relations appear to
be warming.</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan's decision to cancel additional exercises, Tang
said that while the drills are annual events, they should not be
scheduled too closely to events affecting cross-strait relations. The
October drills were planned several months ago, but Koo's trip and
meeting with Wang were announced only recently, he said.</P>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui agreed with the decision to conclude the
drills ahead of schedule, Tang said.</P>
      <P>Tang called Friday's exercise, in which the military tested
advanced weaponry and conducted combat readiness maneuvers, "a great
success." The exercise took place in and around the southernmost
county of Hengchun.</P>
      <P>Nearly 6,000 troops from the navy, air force and army
participated in the drill, together with 82 jet fighters and other
aircraft, 28 warships and vessels, 128 tanks and armored vehicles and
38 pieces of artillery.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,   Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US-based Wharton Econometric
Forecasting Association (WEFA) on Thursday said the International
Monetary Foundation's (IMF) 4 percent assessment for Taiwan's 1999
economic growth is too conservative to reflect the actual economic
development of the island.</P>
      <P>The WEFA has estimated Taiwan's economic growth for next year at
5.4 percent, as it says the island's economy will suffer no more
damage from the Asian financial meltdown, a WEFA analyst said.</P>
      <P>He mentioned that WEFA in July lowered an earlier forecast of
Taiwan's 1998 economic increase to 5.2 percent after taking into
consideration the island's worsening economic performance, including
the drops in foreign trade and consumer confidence.</P>
      <P>Chang Ching, an economist of Chinese descent who is in charge of
WEFA's forecast for the "Greater Chinese Economy," stressed that the
IMF's key function is helping build a global financial order, rather
than predicting world economic growth, a task for which WEFA is
better suited.</P>
      <P>Chang also criticized the IMF's prediction of 5.5 percent
economic growth for mainland China next year, saying such a figure
will be impossible unless the renminbi greatly depreciates or the
Hong Kong economy collapses.</P>
      <P>He explained that Beijing has been sparing no efforts to boost
public investment, while Taiwan has also committed itself to
encouraging domestic consumption.</P>
      <P>According to the latest WEFA forecast, mainland China's 1999
economic growth will be at least 8 percent.</P>
      <P>Beijing has recently announced that the country enjoyed 7 percent
economic growth in the first half of this year.</P>
      <P>The WEFA forecast also points out that the global economic growth
for this year will slip to 2.1 percent, while that for 1999 is
expected to move up a little to 2.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Dragged down by Japan's serious recession, the 1999 economic
growth for the Group of Seven industrialized nations as a whole is
expected to drop to 1.9 percent, according to the forecast.</P>
      <P>WEFA, founded in 1963, is regarded as one of the world's leading
private economic forecasting institutes. It employs more than 200
economists and releases their predictions annually. These are widely
used as references by private enterprises and governments around the
world.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FIVE MORE ALLIES SPEAK IN FAVOR OF ROC'S UN BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York, Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By K.C. Huang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Five more allies of the Republic of China
on Thursday voiced their support for the ROC's bid to enter the
United Nations at the general debate session of the 53rd UN General
Assembly, which will close on Friday.</P>
      <P>With the five new voices -- Chad, Malawi, Guatemala, Grenada and
Solomon Islands -- the countries which have provided their support
has increased to 23, compared with 22 nations last year.</P>
      <P>Chad Foreign Minister Mahamat Saleh Annadif said he supported the
proposal that says considering the changes in the international
situation, and the fact that both governments co-exist simultaneously
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, it is necessary to review UN
resolution No. 2758, which admitted the mainland China at the expanse
of the ROC in 1971.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Malawi Foreign Minister Mapopa
Chipeta said that based on the principles of universally and equal
respect for national sovereignty, the UN should consider the issue of
the ROC's lack of UN representation.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the ROC's participation in international
community would be an important factor in international peace,
stability and cooperation.</P>
      <P>Guatemalan Foreign Minister Eduardo Stein pointed out that it is
inappropriate for the 21 million people of Taiwan to have no
representation in the UN.</P>
      <P>Stein said that the aim of the UN is to protect world peace, and
that its major function is to promote co-existence among all nations
based on mutual respect. He lamented the fact that 53 years after the
establishment of the UN, there are still people in certain lands who
have no representation in the world forum.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that all people in the world can be free
from exclusion and discrimination, that all can be represented in the
UN, and that disputes between states can be solved through peaceful
dialogues.</P>
      <P>Stein gave high marks to the ROC for its sound economic
fundamentals amid the regional financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Grenada's representative to the UN, Robert Millete, stressed the
legitimacy of the ROC's bid to enter the UN and other international
organizations, saying that denying the 21 million people of Taiwan UN
representation is a violation of human rights.</P>
      <P>He urged the UN to provide membership to the ROC, and to allow
the nation's entry into the World Health Organization, the World
Trade Organization, and the Caribbean Development Bank.</P>
      <P>Solomon Islands Justice Minister Edmund Andresen also urged that
the ROC be allowed to join the UN and its affiliated organizations.</P>
      <P>He said that the UN Steering Committee earlier this month
rejected putting the issue on the General Assembly agenda, which
denies Taiwan's people the rights stipulated in the UN Charter.</P>
      <P>He lauded the ROC as a politically stable, economically
prosperous, and hi-tech country, which has made contributions to the
region and the world.</P>
      <P>Andresen also urged the mainland to forsake its entrenched
position if it wants to complete peaceful reunification, adding that
the Solomon Islands will continue to urge the UN to think seriously
about the ROC's UN bid and recognize that it should have
representation in the world forum.</P>
      <P>This is the sixth consecutive year that the ROC has spearheaded
its UN campaign through its diplomatic allies. Even though the bid,
like previous ones, failed to make the annual General Assembly
agenda, the ROC government has vowed to continue its efforts in this
regard.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MACAU DRUG TRAFFICKER NABBED; 5.51 KG OF HEROIN SEIZED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taoyuan,  northern  Taiwan,  Oct.  2  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A resident of the
Portuguese colony of Macau was arrested at Chiang Kai-shek (CKS)
International Airport late on Thursday for attempting to smuggle a
large amount of heroin into Taiwan, airport police reported on
Friday.</P>
      <P>The drug trafficker, identified as Jou Ion Chau, arrived at CKS
Airport from Bangkok on a Thai Airways International flight at around
midnight, police said.</P>
      <P>Security officials found Jou to be behaving in suspicious manner,
so they joined forces with customs inspectors to detain and search
him, whereupon they discovered that Jou, 23, was carrying 17 packages
of high-grade heroin, weighing a total of 5,511 grams. It was the
largest heroin seizure in recent years, police said.</P>
      <P>The 17 small packs of heroin were attached to Jou's waist and
legs, and hidden in his shoes.</P>
      <P>Jou confessed to police that he was commissioned by a Thai man,
nicknamed Polo, to smuggle the contraband drugs into Taiwan. "Polo
gave me 120,000 Portuguese escudo (about US$710) for my services. I
needed the money because I had lost a lot of money gambling," Jou
told police.</P>
      <P>According to Jou, Polo told him to stay at a hotel in downtown
Taipei, where there would be people to contact him to pick up the
drugs.</P>
      <P>Police officers lay in wait at the hotel until Friday morning,
but nobody showed up.</P>
      <P>It was the fifth time in the past month that CKS airport police
have intercepted residents of Hong Kong and Macau attempting to
smuggle narcotics into Taiwan, police said, adding that they will
tighten inspections to curb such criminal operations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, police warned local people not to visit casinos when
they travel to Macau to avoid falling prey to international drug
trafficking rings which reportedly have targeted people who lose
money gambling, in order to tempt them into smuggling contraband
drugs into Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASIAN CRISIS TO HIT WESTERN EUROPEAN EXPORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Oct.  2  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Asia's financial crisis is set to reduce
western Europe's total net exports by US$55 billion per year, the
biggest drop suffered by any of the world's trading regions, an
influential newspaper reported on Friday.</P>
      <P>The crisis is expected to add US$43 billion to the US trade
deficit, and US$47 billion if mainland China makes a modest
revaluation of the renminbi, the Financial Times said.</P>
      <P>The shift, caused more by falling US exports than by a rise in
the dollar value of imports, is likely to produce trade tensions with
Asian countries -- but not a full-scale US retreat into
protectionism, the newspaper said.</P>
      <P>The overall economic impact of the changes in trade patterns on
the US and western Europe is expected to be limited, because falls in
their exports are likely to be offset by an expansion of non-tradable
activities equivalent to as much as 1 percent of gross domestic
product.</P>
      <P>The expansion will be caused by an improvement in industrialized
countries' terms of trade and increased capital inflows, which would
lead to lower interest rates.</P>
      <P>A study by the Washington-based Institute for International
Economics estimates that currency devaluations in the rest of Asia
will cost mainland China about US$12 billion in exports, and says a
renminbi depreciation of about 6 percent would be enough to restore
their competitiveness to the level before the region's financial
crisis erupted.</P>
      <P>Although currency devaluations in Asia will reduce exports to the
rest of the region by Singapore, Taiwan and Japan, the three
countries are likely to increase their overall trade surpluses,
making it harder for neighboring economies to adjust, it says.</P>

      <P>Results of a recent survey show that 57.7
percent of Taiwan residents are satisfied with the government's
national health insurance system, and regard it as a welfare system
for old people.</P>
      <P>Of 1,534 persons polled on the government's senior citizen

    <HEADLINE>LEAF BLIGHT AFFLICTS TAIWAN'S ANTHURIUM FARMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Anthurium plants grown on many Taiwan farms
have fallen victim to a soil-born disease never before seen on the
island, the Council of Agriculture (COA) reported on Friday.</P>
      <P>The bacteria which causes the ailment known as leaf blight has
spread quickly throughout the island's anthurium farms, COA officials
said, adding that a total of 70 hectares of farmland have been
affected by the epidemic so far.</P>
      <P>To prevent any further spread of the contagion, the COA has
ordered the destruction of all sick anthurium, which are grown as
ornamentals for their attractive leaves and their showy, often red
spathes.</P>
      <P>About 3.1 million infected plants have been destroyed to date,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently has 331 anthurium farming families scattered
throughout 12 cities and counties, and 138 of them have seen their
crops infected with the disease.</P>
      <P>It is the first time that this form of leaf blight has been found
in Taiwan. Symptoms of the disease include leaf yellowing and
withering, and it also curtails flowering.</P>
      <P>The disease has so far only infected anthurium. "We have ordered
the destruction of all infected plants for fear that the disease, if
not controlled, may spread to other floral plants here," said a COA
official.</P>
      <P>He said the bacteria that cause the disease may have entered
Taiwan through seedlings imported from the United States and the
Netherlands.</P>
      <P>Quarantine officials and anthurium farmers here have limited
experience in coping with this type of epidemic. COA officials said
they are helping local growers to treat plants that have been only
mildly infected.</P>
      <P>In addition to using pesticides and medicine to treat sick
plants, the officials said the COA is also planning to sterilize the
soil by steaming at high temperatures.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING MAKING CROSS-STRAIT NEGOTIATIONS COMPLICATED: DISSIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong Kong, Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung and Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's demands for procedural talks to
precede political negotiations are simply complicating cross-strait
negotiations, prominent mainland Chinese dissident Yan Jiaqi said in
an article published on Thursday.</P>
      <P>In the article, which appeared in the Hong Kong Economic Journal,
Yan commented that when Beijing and Washington ended their long-term
hostility, no procedural talks were held.</P>
      <P>According to the Beijing authorities, the procedural talks are
needed to resolve issues concerning the agenda of future talks, the
scope of the representatives' authority, and the way negotiations
should take place.</P>
      <P>Although the issue of relations across the Taiwan Strait is
regarded by Beijing as an internal affair, and a far cry from the
situation which existed between Beijing and Washington, former US
President Richard Nixon's mainland China visit in 1972 still serves
as a revelation today, Yan analyzed.</P>
      <P>The willingness of Taipei and Beijing to reach rapprochement is
far more important than the sophistication of the procedures
themselves, said Yan, adding that any procedural talks will be void
if there is no recognition of political reality, or willingness to
reunify.</P>
      <P>The article called on the Beijing authorities to recognize the
fact that Taiwan is a separate political entity, and added that a
peace agreement is necessary to end the state of hostility between
Taipei and Beijing. At present, cross-strait economic and cultural
exchanges continue to develop; however, a friendly political
relationship has remained out of reach.</P>
      <P>Yan expressed his belief that it will take time to build friendly
political relations between the two sides, and that these relations
will also hinge on the political and economic conditions which
develop on either side of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The article further said the groundwork for a friendly
cross-strait political relationship can be laid, so long as Beijing
renounces the use of force against Taiwan and moves ahead on the road
to democracy.</P>
      <P>In response to the upcoming visit to mainland China by Koo
Chen-fu, Taipei's top negotiator with mainland China and chairman of
the Straits Exchange Foundation, the prominent dissident said that
should Beijing miss the opportunity to forge a meeting between
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin and his Taiwan counterpart Lee
Teng-hui, it will only highlight a lack of political wisdom on the
part of Jiang or the mainland's officials responsible for Taiwan
affairs.</P>
      <P>It is widely regarded that a Jiang-Lee meeting would be conducive
to the signing of a cross-strait peace agreement.</P>

      <P>Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore, at
the head of a high-profile official delegation, is scheduled to
arrive in Taipei on Oct. 8 for a 10-day visit, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) announced on Friday.</P>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui will preside over a military honor guard
to welcome Compaore on Oct. 8 at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall
plaza, said Timothy C. T. Yang, director of the MOFA's African
Affairs Department.</P>
      <P>In addition to attending the celebration of the Republic of
China's national day on Oct. 10, Compaore and Lee will discuss
international politics and issues of mutual concern. They are also
expected to sign a joint communique to further strengthen bilateral
ties.</P>
      <P>Compaore will also meet ranking government officials and opinion
leaders, including Premier Vincent Siew, Foreign Affairs Minister
Jason Hu, and National Assembly Speaker Fredrick Chien.</P>
      <P>The Burkina Faso president and his entourage will travel to
southern Taiwan to visit cultural and economic establishments.
Meanwhile, Hu and his Burkina Faso counterpart, Ablasse Ouedraogo,
will ink an investment guarantee agreement to boost two-way
investment and trade.</P>
      <P>This will be Compaore's third visit to Taiwan since the two
countries resumed full diplomatic relations in Feb. 1994.</P>
      <P>Members of Compaore's entourage will include Minister of State,
Environment and Water Salif Diallo, Minister of Trade, Industry and
Handicraft, Idrissa Zampalegre.</P>
      <P>Compaore is a much respected political leader in Africa because
of his long-standing support of peace, democracy and freedom in that
part of the world, Yang said. The Burkina Faso president also took
the lead in backing the ROC's bid to join the United Nations at the
world body's general assembly on Sept. 21, Yang noted.</P>
      <P>Compaore is slated to proceed to Japan on Oct. 17, where he will

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Governor James Soong
on Friday lambasted the passing of a revised provisional draft on the
downsizing of the Taiwan Provincial Government (TPG) in the
Legislative Yuan on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The revised draft overturned a version adopted by the Cabinet and
the ruling Kuomintang Party, stripping 13 TPG sectors of powers
overseeing the autonomous affairs of counties and cities.</P>
      <P>Governor Soong, who returned from a 10-day three-country trip on
Thursday, told the media he could not understand the party's handling
of the draft.</P>
      <P>First, the KMT holds a majority of seats in the legislature, he
said, yet the party's legislative caucus was unwilling to support the
version adopted by the KMT and the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Second, the interior minister did not support the draft version
adopted by the Cabinet, he added.</P>
      <P>The revised version was drafted through negotiations between the
caucuses of the KMT and the Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Now that the draft has passed the first reading, the second
reading is slated for Oct. 8.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan hopes to see the draft become law by the
middle of October so lawmakers can return to their constituencies
early to prepare for their reelection campaigns for the year-end
elections.</P>
      <P>However, the passing of the new draft met with resistance from
provincial government employees. A self-salvation organization formed
by TPG employees plans to mobilize 10,000 members to lodge their
protest to the Legislative Yuan on Oct. 8.</P>
      <P>The organization held a meeting on Friday and decided to toss
eggs and "ghost money" when the employees present their appeals to
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Some KMT members will also go to the KMT Central Committee to
burn their party ID cards to show their anger over the KMT's failure

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Beijing government should grant its
people freedom of association in accordance with the United Nations
convenant on civil and political rights, the Beijing Preparatory
Committee of the China Democracy Party (CDP) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The committee pointed out in an open letter that certain mainland
Chinese laws and regulations are inconsistent with the convenant,
which Beijing has promised to sign later this year. The letter was
made public by the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights
and Democratic Movement in China.</P>
      <P>The committee said one of the regulations governing the
registration and administration of civil organizations in mainland
China is in violation of the convenant, because it stipulates that no
civil organization can become operational before its registration
with the authorities concerned.</P>
      <P>Under the regulation, the authorities can prevent all dissident
civil organizations from coming into being, it pointed out. The
Beijing preparatory committee of the CDP itself is still
non-existent, because Beijing authorities have rejected the
application for its registration.</P>
      <P>Beijing should abolish all laws and regulations that are
inconsistent with the convenant, if it will sign the document, the
committee said.</P>
      <P>The committee also pointed out that article 13 of the mainland
Chinese law governing trade unions and article 16 of the regulations
governing the administration of civil organizations are also
inconsistent with the international convenant, because the former
stipulates that the establishment of all local trade unions must be
approved by their supervising trade unions, and the latter says that
in any administrative district only one civil organization of
its kind is permitted.</P>

      <P>After maneuvers were held in Hengchung, southern Taiwan, on
Friday morning, Gen. Tang Fei, chief of the general staff, announced
that two additional exercises slated for Oct. 7 and 12 had been
called off to foster goodwill with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Some observers had speculated that the United States may have
pressured Taiwan to cancel the military drills.</P>
      <P>However, the Foreign Ministry spokesman told the Central News
Agency that such speculation was incorrect as the cancellation "had
completely nothing to do with the United States."</P>
      <P>The main reason for suspending the military exercises was to
avoid any misunderstanding as the island's chief negotiator on
cross-strait affairs, Koo Chen-fu, prepares to travel to mainland
China. Koo is expected to meet with his mainland counterpart Wang
Daohan and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin in mid-October.</P>
      <P>Chairman of the Cabinet's Mainland Affairs Council, Chang
King-yuh, held a special meeting on Friday to discuss Koo's schedule
for his forthcoming trip.</P>
      <P>Officials participating in the meeting included those from the
Straits Exchange Foundation, the Foreign Ministry and the Government
Information Office. Details of the meeting were not made public.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U-LAND FLIGHTS RETURN TO NORMAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After a one-day suspension, U-Land Airlines
announced that it will immediately resume all domestic flights on
Friday.</P>
      <P>U-Land Airlines General Manager Lee Chien-feng said in a news
conference at the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) that the
carrier will never again cancel flights without prior warning.</P>
      <P>Lee said U-Land's 14 daily flights on three domestic routes --
Taipei-Kaohsiung, Taipei-Kinmen, and Kaohsiung-Kinmen -- will return
to normal as of Friday.</P>
      <P>In a surprise move, U-Land Airlines halted all its domestic
flights on Thursday after checks totaling NT$170 million (about US$6
million) issued by a textile company and a construction firm
belonging to U-Land's parent company -- U-Land Group -- bounced on
Thursday and Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The incident dealt a heavy blow to the widely-diversified group.
Its headquarters in central Taichung City remain closed on Friday.</P>
      <P>Admitting that the carrier is not in good shape financially
because it purchased six airplanes over the past three years, Lee
said the aviation company will continue to operate in line with its
current policy. The airline will also continue with its plan to
acquire Air Philippines, he added.</P>
      <P>Lee went on to say that he is confident the group can find a
resolution to its financial crisis, which was reportedly caused by
over expansion.</P>
      <P>Another U-Land Airlines executive said now is not the right time
to sell the carrier as it is still operating in the red. The airline,
which owns six MD-82 airplanes, has posted losses of NT$2.3 billion
since it began operating in Dec. 1995.</P>
      <P>Kuo Nan-hua, a U-Land pilot and representative of the carrier's
staff and crew, assured the public of the airline's flight safety.</P>
      <P>He said all U-Land workers have adopted a "business as usual"
attitude toward the whole incident and that all problems appear to
have solutions.</P>
      <P>Although U-Land has announced the resumption of all its flights,
CAA Deputy Director Chang Kuo-chen said the administration demands
that the airline put forward a concrete plan detailing its
operations. The carrier originally said it would reopen partial
operations from Friday through Monday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Kaohsiung-based Ever Fortune Group categorically
denied speculation that it may take over the troubled U-Land Group.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Ever Fortune does not maintain any type of
business relations with U-Land, a high-level executive with Ever
Fortune said the group has no additional resources to acquire U-Land
since it has poured in about NT$150 billion in three
build-operate-transfer projects.</P>
      <P>Against such a background, Ever Fortune has not made any
assessment to take over U-Land, he stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REACTIONS MIXED TO ABRUPT CANCELLATION OF WAR GAMES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  2  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The decision to call off the Republic of
China's military exercises prompted mixed reactions along party lines
at the legislature on Friday.</P>
      <P>Gen. Tang Fei, chief of the general staff, announced the
cancellation of two military drills -- a rehearsal on Oct. 7 and a
live fire drill on Oct. 12 -- to foster goodwill with Beijing in the
run-up to a long-awaited meeting between the top negotiators on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The cancellation came amid reports that Beijing held cruise
missile tests off its eastern coast on Thursday, which are seen as a
response to Taiwan's planned drills. Taiwan held the first of a
planned series of military exercises on Friday morning.</P>
      <P>Gen. Tang's announcement was hailed by legislators from the
ruling Kuomintang and the opposition New Party. Both parties support
the eventual reunification of Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lee Ming-kao, convenor of the legislature's
National Defense Committee, said the move underlined the importance
the government attached to the scheduled meeting between Koo Chen-fu,
chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation, and his mainland
counterpart Wang Daohan.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the military exercises, which are to be a showcase
for the new generation of the armed forces' combat skills, has
already been fulfilled in the rehearsal staged on Friday, Lee said.
He dismissed the significance of the remaining two drills saying that
there are other ways to highlight military strength. He added that
the general public should not make a fuss of the cancellation.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator and member of the National Defense Committee Ting
Shou-chung credited the decision to Tang's "political sensitivity."
High-profile military exercises could poison the atmosphere in the
Koo-Wang meeting and make Taiwan seem aggressive in the eyes of other
countries, he said.</P>
      <P>"National security is the top priority of our national defense
policy, and saber rattling, if it cannot deter military action from a
potential enemy, should be scraped," said Ting.</P>
      <P>New Party Legislator Lin Yu-fang hailed the decision as a move
which was sensitive to the public's desire to ease tensions with
Beijing and is conducive to cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>Noting that President Lee Teng-hui was behind the decision, Lin
predicted it will earn votes for the KMT in the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislator Parris Chang, a member of the
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), ridiculed the
decision as a misguided move which would not gain any goodwill from
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chang doubted that Beijing would match the act with a similar
one.</P>
      <P>However, the official response from the DPP is more cautious. DPP
Director for China Affairs Yen Wan-chin said the party would support
the decision provided that the cancellation of the military exercises
does not in any way relax the armed forces' training and readiness.</P>
      <P>Given that the drills are more a demonstration of the military's
newly acquired weaponry than a war game in nature, the DPP will not
take issue with the military's decision to cut short the rehearsal
provided that the island's security is not damaged, said Yen.</P>
      <P>Yen cautioned that the government's bid to create a friendly
atmosphere should not compromise the armed forces' readiness for any
unexpected act of aggression and regular war drills should not be
seen as provoking Beijing.</P>
      <P>Criticizing the cancellation of Vice President Lien Chan's
European trip for fear of irking Beijing as an unnecessary
self-imposed condition, Yen said the DPP opposed cozying up to
Beijing but would support any move which will reduce the possibility
of military conflict with mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING URGED TO TAKE BACK ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC's top mainland policy planner on
Saturday urged Beijing to take back illegal mainland Chinese
immigrants detained in Taiwan as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Chang King-yuh, chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC), made the appeal during a visit to the Hsinchu
Detention Center for illegal mainland immigrants, some 60 kilometers
south of Taipei.</P>
      <P>He expressed concern for the detainees, and directed the
detention center management to open special telephone lines so they
can contact their families on the mainland before the Mid-Autumn
Festival, which this year falls on Monday.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's reluctance to cooperate with Taipei, there
are still 1,096 illegal mainland immigrants in various detention
centers around the island, 390 of whom have been incarcerated for
more than six months.</P>
      <P>"We hope the mainland authorities will take back the mainland
stowaways as early as possible in accordance with the Kinmen
Agreement signed by the Red Cross Societies on the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang hailed the Ministry of National Defense's
decision to cancel massive live-fire war games as a sign of goodwill
to Beijing ahead of a planned visit by Taiwan's top political envoy
to mainland China.</P>
      <P>"The military's decision illustrates our sincerity in wishing to
improve cross-strait relations," Chang stressed.</P>
      <P>At the end of a rehearsal on Friday of the planned war games,
Gen. Tang Fei, chief of the general staff, announced that in order
not to adversely affect the atmosphere of the upcoming trip, the
military has decided to cancel the Oct. 12 maneuvers -- involving the
army, air force and navy in a deployment of the island's most
sophisticated weaponry -- as well as a further rehearsal set for Oct.
7.</P>
      <P>Taipei's top political envoy, C.F. Koo, a senior adviser to
President Lee Teng-hui and head of the quasi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation, is scheduled to meet his mainland counterpart,
Wang Daohan of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait, during his landmark Oct. 14-19 mainland visit.</P>
      <P>"At a time when cross-strait relations are becoming warmer, we
hope our two sides can reach certain consensus for the well-being of
all Chinese people," Chang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US REACTS CAUTIOUSLY TO CALL FOR TAIWAN TMD STUDY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  October  2  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US administration on Friday
reacted cautiously to a Congressional demand for a study on missile
defenses for Taiwan, saying Taiwan's interest in the system "appears
to be primarily informational."</P>
      <P>In the administration's first official reaction to the call for
the study, the State Department also reaffirmed US commitment to the
security of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The administration remains firmly committed to fulfilling the
security and arms transfer provisions of the Taiwan Relations Act,"
it said in a prepared statement.</P>
      <P>The State Department said that the United States would "continue
to assist Taiwan in meeting its legitimate defense needs" in
accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act and the 1982 joint
communique with mainland China.</P>
      <P>On the question of Theater Missile Defense (TMD), part of a
multi-billion dollar missile defense program still under development
in the United States, the State Department said that Taiwan has been
briefed on the concept.</P>
      <P>It went on to say, however, that Taiwan is currently addressing
its own capabilities and needs. "At this point, their interest in TMD
appears to be primarily informational."</P>
      <P>Taiwan military sources confirmed to the CNA that Taiwan has
asked for information on the development of TMD, but remains
non-committal on whether or not it will participate in the program.</P>
      <P>While adopting the 1999 National Defense Authorization Bill
during the past week, the US Congress authorized the Pentagon to
study architectural requirements for the establishment and operation
of TMD in the Asia-Pacific region in order to protect the country's
"key allies" -- Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Department of Defense has also been asked to report its
findings to Congress by Jan. 1, 1999.</P>
      <P>The Congressional demand came despite Beijing's objection to the
deployment of any missile defense systems in the Far East, and
despite the administration's concerns about a possible backlash from
Beijing if Taiwan, in particular, decides to participate in the
program.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's Labor Party (ALP) came from
behind to surge ahead of the Coalition of the Liberal and National
Parties in a dramatic last-minute rise of support from voters,
according to public polls.</P>
      <P>The poll, which was released on the eve of the general election,
shows ALP leading the coalition under Prime Minister John Howard on
44 to 40 percentage points in primary votes.</P>
      <P>The poll shows the coalition struggling to defend its 40-seat
majority, a worrying sign for the Howard government because of the
surging last-minute opposition to his 10 percent goods and services
tax (GST).</P>
      <P>Under the GST, everything except education and health will be
subject to a 10 percent tax.</P>
      <P>In the State of Victoria, where a recent gas explosion caused
most of its 3.3 million population to be unable to have hot water,
many voters are angry with the Howard government because it did
nothing until a last-minute announcement by Howard that the Federal
Government will provide a A$100 (US$62.5) million emergency gas
crisis fund.</P>
      <P>The explosion has caused tens of thousands of workers to remain
idle, and has hit many key industries, leading economists to estimate
that the crisis could slash Australia's economic growth by up to one
percentage point. Victorian voters are expected to show their anger
in Saturday's election, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>The polls also show support for Pauline Hanson's One Nation at 7
percent, and support for the Democratic Party at 5 percent, with the

      <P>Since August 30, Liberal Prime Minister John Howard and his
rival, opposition leader Kim Beazley of the Australian Labor Party,
have campaigned vigorously.</P>
      <P>On Friday, the last day of campaigning, Howard said: "My final
message to them (Australians) is that this change is good for the
country. This change is also good for you. Your personal tax will be
lower." Howard was referring to his tax reforms, including the
introduction of a 10 percent goods and services tax (GST), with which
he hopes to win the election.</P>
      <P>Beazley, on the other hand, is relying on jobs and security, with
a promise to substantially reduce the current unemployment rate of
8.2 percent to 5 percent in six years if he wins the election.</P>
      <P>His eve-of-poll message was: "We've got a big task mathematically
to achieve. But I think we have campaigned well. I think we're there
with a good fighting chance. I urge people to vote for the Labor
Party. While all political parties other than the Liberals have
expressed reservations about a goods and services tax, only the Labor
Party in the end is reliable."</P>

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE  MINISTER HAS  MIXED VIEWS ON AUSTRALIAN PM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  3 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's senior minister Lee Kuan Yew
has mixed views on Australia's Prime Minister John Howard, praising
him for his financial help to Asian nations during the economic
crisis, but criticizing him for his slow initial response to the rise
of Pauline Hanson and her One Nation party.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview with the Australian newspaper on the
eve of Australia's federal election on Saturday, Lee said that One
Nation and Hanson had caused damage to Australia's image
internationally due to Howard's slow reaction.</P>
      <P>"When she first appeared on the scene, she was bad for Australia,
made worse because there was no official stand taken by the
Australian government. Now, both government and opposition have taken
their stands against racism. That's helped to clear things up," Lee
said.</P>
      <P>However, Lee also praised Howard for his financial help to
Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea during the Asian financial
crisis.</P>
      <P>"You went out of your way to help Indonesia, as we did. There
simply weren't the resources in the IMF to support President
Suharto's economic policies. I am disappointed with what has happened
in Indonesia. It could have been avoided," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee also gave the Howard government a modest passing grade on
economic reform. "That Australian government has gone as far as the
Australian public will allow it to go. Prime Minister John Howard
tried to get Australian unions to become more productivity-conscious.
But the dock workers in Melbourne got more public support than the
government in the recent industrial dispute," Lee noted.</P>
      <P>Lee described the relations between Australia and Singapore as
"good, trouble-free."</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLICY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MAIN AUSTRALIAN PARTIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  3  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main differences in the policies of
Australian Prime Minister John Howard and opposition leader Kim
Beazley are in four main areas, according to a survey by the
Australian Financial Review.</P>
      <P>They differ on economic management, health, industrial policy and
telecommunications, employment and industrial relations.</P>
      <P>The coalition is optimistic about Australia's economic growth,
despite the impact of the Asian financial crisis, but the Australian
Labor Party (ALP) under Beazley is more pessimistic about the
economic growth over the next few years and has dismissed the
coalition's growth forecast of 3.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The coalition plan includes big personal income tax cuts to
sweeten a goods and services tax of 10 percent. It also intends to
reduce business income tax to 30 percent from the current 33 percent,
while the ALP has proposed minimum changes to the tax system, placing
its electoral hopes on a big-ticket tax credit plan aimed at squarely
at those on low incomes.</P>
      <P>On health, the coalition has promised a 30 percent rebate on
private health insurance premiums, while Labor has committed a A$500
(US$312) million funding boost to public hospitals as the key
features of its health policy.</P>
      <P>The coalition is planning to renew efforts to deregulate the
labor market by using more private mediators to settle industrial
disputes, while the ALP is running a centralist platform to be
achieved through the revival of the award system and arbitration.</P>
      <P>Labor has also promised new measures to allow Australian workers
to take legal action against their employers if companies use
bankruptcy as a means of refusing to pay accrued entitlements.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOST TAIWAN PEOPLE BACK POSSESSION OF MILITARY FORCE: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of local people support the
development of Taiwan's military force, according to the results of
a recent public opinion poll released on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey of 1,090 adult residents throughout the
island, conducted by the Chinese Euro-Asia Society on Sept. 25-26,
found that 84.7 percent of the respondents do not think that
maintaining a deterrent force to protect Taiwan's security will
adversely affect relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Poll results also showed that 70.9 percent of those interviewed
believe that Taiwan's armed forces should continue combat
preparedness under the current circumstances.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 70.9 percent threw their support behind the proposal
that President Lee Teng-hui make a "journey of peace" to mainland
China to forge cross-strait rapprochement.</P>
      <P>An overwhelming majority of 86 percent said they look forward to
seeing President Lee and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin meet
in an international setting.</P>
      <P>Nearly 55 percent said mainland China's military maneuvers in
the Taiwan Strait in recent years would only provoke sentiments for
military confrontation.</P>
      <P>As many as 83.1 percent of the respondents said they believe if
mainland China renounces the use of force against Taiwan, it will
contribute to positive development of cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Sixty-three percent said they feel that Beijing's unfriendly
attitude toward Taiwan in the past few years has cooled local
people's willingness to help relieve flood victims on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Slightly more than 64 percent said they think if the government
were to open direct cross-strait air- and shipping-links right now,
Taiwan's security would be adversely affected.</P>
      <P>Eighty-four percent said they don't think that mainland China is
entitled to determine Taiwan's future destiny which they said should
be decided by the 21 million residents here.</P>
      <P>More than 90 percent gave a thumbs-up to the proposal that
Taiwan should continue seeking to join international organizations
and upgrade international profile.</P>
      <P>Eighty-five percent said even if expanding external ties will
strain cross-strait relations, Taiwan should not hesitate to forge
diplomatic relations with other countries.</P>
      <P>Moreover, 78.9 percent said Beijing's consistent attempts to
block Taiwan's presence in the international arena have hurt Taiwan
people's feelings.</P>
      <P>Survey results also showed that 36.7 percent of the respondents
perceive themselves as Taiwanese; 14.6 percent insist themselves as
Chinese; and 46.7 percent identify themselves as both Taiwanese and
Chinese.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the poll findings, Vice Chairman Lin Chong-pin of the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council said the survey substantiates
a MAC long-held view that if Beijing softens its attitude toward
Taiwan, the percentage of local people who identify themselves as
Taiwanese will decrease, and vice versa.</P>
      <P>Lin said the results of similar MAC surveys found that the ratio
of local people who perceive themselves as Taiwanese declined after
Jan Jyh-horng, deputy secretary-general of the quasi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), made a visit to the mainland in April, but
the percentage surged after US President Bill Clinton announced the
so-called "three noes" against Taiwan in Shanghai in late June.</P>
      <P>"And the ratio rose even further after Lin Ti-chuan, a Kaohsiung
City councilwoman from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party,
was kidnapped and murdered on the mainland in late July," Lin said,
adding that the percentage fell again after SEF Vice Chairman Shi
Hwei-yow made a visit to Beijing last month to set the stage for a
high-level cross-strait meeting in mid-October.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US DOES NOT INTEND TO INVITE TAIWAN TO JOIN `NAB' EMERGENCY FUND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States has no plans to invite
Taiwan to join the international emergency rescue fund that was
initiated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last year, US
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The IMF proposed the establishment of the New Arrangements to
Borrow (NAB) program in May 1996 in an effort to bail out Mexico from
its economic crisis.</P>
      <P>The program officially came into being in January 1997 as an
international emergency rescue fund to help countries battered by
economic woes. So far, it has 25 contributor members, including the
Group of Seven, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Malaysia and
Thailand.</P>
      <P>Funds pledged by the 25 member economies so far total US$46
billion.</P>
      <P>During a press conference at the Department of the Treasury,
Rubin said the invitations for the 25 members to join were
"appropriate." So far, the United States lags behind the other
members, as it has not yet materialized its pledged funds to the
program, Rubin noted.</P>
      <P>Asked about whether Washington supports the idea of inviting
other newly developed economies, such as Taiwan, to join the NAB,
Rubin said only that the purpose of the press conference was not to
discuss NAB expansion.</P>
      <P>Rubin was clarifying US President Bill Clinton's recent proposal
which called for a new IMF mechanism to help shield countries from
economic difficulties elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Only when the United States provides adequate funds to initiate
such a new mechanism -- depending on Congress approval of the
allocation -- will other countries and areas follow suit, Rubin said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's cancellation of military exercises
is a catalyst for friendlier ties across the Taiwan Strait and will
pressure Beijing to follow suit, a mainland affairs official said on
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council,
lauded the decision to cut short a series of military exercises,
adding that the move creates an amicable atmosphere as the two sides
prepare to meet for the first time in five years.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, director of Mainland Affairs Research Department
under the Kuomintang said the military's decision should be
interpreted as an expression of goodwill rather than a surrender.</P>
      <P>He refused to speculate about Beijing's possible response to the
cancellation, but said it will pressure Beijing to follow suit and
perhaps cancel some of its military exercises.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile Yen Wan-ching, director of the China Affairs Department
under the Democratic Progressive Party, doubted the move would invoke
a friendly response from Beijing.</P>
      <P>Noting that Beijing has not renounced the possible use of force
against Taiwan, Yen ridiculed the military's move as nothing but
casting pearls before swine.</P>
      <P>Chief of the General Staff Gen. Tang Fei announced the
cancellation of drills slated for Oct. 7 and Oct. 12 after a
rehearsal for the exercises was held on Friday.</P>
      <P>The exercises were to showcase the armed forces' newly-acquired
weaponry, which was adequately displayed in the exercises, Lin said.
The cancellation of the remaining drills will in no way affect the

      <P>An official with the Republic of China's

      <P>R.T. Yang, director of the Foreign Ministry's European Affairs

      <P>As Asia's financial difficulties appear to be deepening, Taiwan

Asia, Yang said. Therefore, the government has attached much
importance to the visit by the Hungarian mission.</P>
      <P>The seven-member mission is scheduled to arrive on Oct. 12 and
will depart on Oct. 15.</P>
      <P>Among the organizations sponsoring the visit are the Hungarian

      <P>During their stay in Taiwan, members of the Hungarian mission

    <TEXT>
      <P>The China External Trade Development Council
(CETRA) shifted Taiwan's stronghold of trade from Vienna, Austria to
Poland's capital of Warsaw, leading the island's businessmen to
Central and Eastern European markets.</P>
      <P>The opening of the Taiwan Trade Center in Warsaw was celebrated
in a ceremony held on Sept. 30, said R. T. Yang, director of the
department of European Affairs under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

      <P>The ceremony was presided over by Lin Chen-kuo, chairman of the

Poland's Foreign Affairs Ministry, and officials from Poland's
Finance Ministry were among the guests at the gathering, said the
MOFA official.</P>
      <P>All of the trade office's units available for lease have been
reserved, Yang noted, adding that this fact alone indicated Taiwan
merchants' confidence in doing business in Eastern Europe.</P>

      <P>Judging from the types of items seized by

      <P>In September, when garlic's prices surged around the island,
garlic made up the bulk of the smuggled trade, followed by pig offal,

      <P>Other, more exotic items were also found, such animals classified
as protected species. These included 17 ostriches, 580 chestnut mice,
80 squirrels, and 160 lizards, CGC officials said.</P>
      <P>Smuggling is not limited to commercial goods. In various

      <P>The New Taiwan dollar continued gain ground
against the weakening greenback in Taipei Saturday, rising NT$0.288

      <P>The interbank US dollar trading hit US$324 million, the largest

33.93 and 33.685.</P>
      <P>The NT dollar found favor among buyers and is expected get
stronger against the greenback, which recently dropped to its
20-month low against the deutsche mark and is seen entering a bearish
phase in the international currency market, dealers said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's currency will likely surge to NT$33 against the US
dollar by the end of the year, dealers predicted.</P>
      <P>Central Bank of China (CBC) Deputy Governor Hsu Chia-tung said
Saturday that he was glad to see the unit appreciate. He added that
the current international currency trend -- such as the US cutting

      <P>The local unit depreciated by 15 percent to 20 percent since last
July when Asian currencies underwent a meltdown.</P>
      <P>Hsu also said he is not concerned that the NT dollar's
appreciation would harm Taiwan's exports as the currency is still
essentially under-valued, a situation which gives Taiwan competitive
edge on export.</P>
      <P>If the NT dollar appreciates, the currencies in Japan and South
Korea, the island's major trade competitors, will also go up in line
with the global trend. Therefore, their foreign trade will never
threaten local exporters, the financial expert stated.</P>
      <P>The banker further said that despite the currency fluctuations,
the CBC will remain consistent in sparing no effort to preserve
financial stability and economic growth in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although the CBC is now imposing a loose currency policy, the

    <HEADLINE>RECORD NUMBER OF CHINESE COMPETING IN AUSTRALIAN ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  3  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A record number of Chinese Australian
candidates took part in Saturday's federal election since the
Commonwealth of Australia was proclaimed in 1901.</P>
      <P>Of the 72 candidates from the newly-established Unity Party
competing for seats in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and
Western Australia in both the House of Representatives and Senate, 17
are of Chinese descent, according to party president Peter Wong.</P>
      <P>Among the 17 candidates of Chinese origin, three are from
mainland China and the remainder are either from Hong Kong or were
born in Australia and have parents from the former British colony.</P>
      <P>The three candidates from China are Chen Bin, Tan Lin and Gao
Nining. Others are Jason Li, Andrew Su, Chris Wong, Henry Pong,
Matthew Wong, Tong Sumrith Somchai and Penny Tong Sunrith, all of
whom are competing in New South Wales.</P>
      <P>Contesting in Victoria are Huynh Toah, Chua Ka-sing, Geoffrey
Teng, and Wellington Lee. May-yie Leung is competing in Western
Australia while Henry Fong and Chris Toogood are vying in Queensland,
Wong said.</P>
      <P>"This is the first time such a (high) number of candidates from
Chinese communities in Australia are contesting the seats in
Parliament," Wong said in an interview with the CNA on Saturday.</P>
      <P>He said the United Party was not established only for Chinese and
Asian migrants, but it is also for other migrants from Italy, Greece,
India, Israel, Arabian countries, and other white and non-white
people.</P>
      <P>"The purpose of our party is to unite all the migrants together,
including white migrants. We have no racial discrimination to any
race, colors, religion and cultures," he said.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the Unity Party came after the wide showing
of the One Nation party in the recent Queensland elections. One
Nation, headed by Pauline Hanson, backs anti-Asian immigration and
anti-Aborigine policies.</P>
      <P>"We Chinese migrants want to show the major parties and One
Nation that we have our own strength and racism will have no place in
Australia," Wong said.</P>
      <P>He admitted that the chances for victory among Unity Party
candidates are slim, but he is confident that one of the Chinese
candidates -- Jason Li, who was born in New South Wales after his
parents emigrated from Hong Kong -- has the best chance to win a seat
in the Senate.</P>
      <P>Li, 26, is a lawyer in Sydney who formerly worked as a judge's
associate at the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for
the Yugoslavia as an international law consultant to the
International Commission of Jurists in Geneva.</P>
      <P>"Even if we win one seat, we can (show) major parties (that we
have) strength so they will not ignore our existence in the future,"
Wong said. He said a 5 percent showing in the election will be enough
to ring alarm bells in major parties.</P>
      <P>Disappointed by Prime Minister John Howard's weak response to
Hanson's anti-Asian comments, Wong quit the Liberal Party in July and

    <HEADLINE>ROC APPRECIATES SUPPORT FOR ITS UN BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  2  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on
Saturday expressed its gratitude for the 25 countries which threw
support behind Taiwan's bid to rejoin the United Nations at the
general debate session of the 53rd UN General Assembly.</P>
      <P>"We appreciate these countries for their coming forward to
appeal for world attention to our reasonable demand for
representation in the United Nations," said Andrew L.Y. Hsia,
director of the MOFA's Department of International Organizations.</P>
      <P>During the Sept. 21-Oct. 2 general debate session, senior
leaders from the 25 countries voiced either explicit or indirect
support for Taipei's UN bid from various angles, ranging from the
principle of membership universality, Taiwan's capabilities to
contribute to the world society, legitimate rights to regional
security.</P>
      <P>"Through their eloquent, rational debate, we believe the
international community has come to a better understanding of the
unreasonableness and outdatedness of the 1971 UN Resolution No.
2758, which admitted mainland China into the world body at the
expense of the Republic of China," Hsia explained.</P>
      <P>Stressing that rejoining the UN is a common aspiration of all
ROC nationals, Hsia said MOFA will continue to campaign for Taiwan's
UN representation with patience, pragmatism and nimble strategy that
reflects the general international trends and circumstance.</P>
      <P>Hsia also renewed his call on mainland China to drop its
hegemonic, bullying mentality toward Taiwan and to cease its efforts
to block Taiwan's UN accession.</P>
      <P>"We believe the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should respect
each other and cooperate in the international arena. Only by so
doing can we forge mutual trust, narrow differences and create a
climate favorable to eventual reunification," Hsia said.</P>
      <P>This was the sixth consecutive year that the ROC had spearheaded
its UN campaign through its diplomatic allies. Hsia said even though
the bid, like previous ones, failed to make the annual General
Assembly agenda, the ROC government will continue the annual campaign
to enlist global support for its cause.</P>
      <P>Hsia said MOFA has reviewed its promotional strategy annually.
Local observers are watching whether MOFA will adjust its tactics
after an ice-breaking visit to the mainland by Taiwan's top
negotiator with Beijing, Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman C. F.
Koo, from Oct. 14 through Oct. 19.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a CNA report from New York quoted Teng Shen-sheng,
head of the ROC representative office in New York, as saying on
Friday that the United Nations should play a more active role in
resolving the Taiwan Strait issue.</P>
      <P>Noting that maintaining peace is the UN's top mission, Teng said
the UN should understand that preventive diplomacy is the best way
to prevent outbreak of military confrontation.</P>
      <P>"If both sides of the Taiwan Strait are seated in major
international organizations, including the UN, on an equal footing,
they will be able to forge good will and mutual trust to pave the
way for eventual peaceful reunification under freedom and democracy,"
Teng explained.</P>
      <P>The 25 countries that spoke for the ROC's UN bid this year were:
Burkina Faso; Latvia; Costa Rica; Paraguay; Nicaragua; the Dominican
Republic; the Czech Republic; Honduras; El Salvador; Swaziland;
Liberia; Belize; the Gambia; Fiji; the Commonwealth of
Dominica; Saint Christopher and Nevis; Saint Vincent and the
Grenadines; Senegal; Chad; Malawi; Guatemala; Grenada; the Solomon
Islands; Haiti; and Sao Tome and Principe.</P>
      <P>Latvia, the Czech Republic, and Fiji do not maintain formal
diplomatic ties with the ROC. Panama was the only ROC ally in the
United Nations that didn't voice support for the bid at this year's
general debate session. Nevertheless, Panama was the 15 ROC allies
that signed this year's motion asking the UN to re-examine Resolution
No. 2758, which expelled the ROC to make way for mainland China. The
motion was presented in July.</P>
      <P>The UN Steering Committee rejected in September the inclusion of
the motion into this year's General Assembly agenda.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LIEN SPEAKS ON IMPROVING PUBLIC WELFARE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan on Saturday urged
everyone in Taiwan to participate in efforts to improve the public
welfare so that "an enormous social transformation" can be achieved.</P>
      <P>Lien made the appeal at the opening of a symposium on public
welfare sponsored by the National Development Research Cultural and
Educational Foundation at the Grand Hotel.</P>
      <P>The improvement of public welfare is in line with the people's
wishes and is a globally accepted goal.</P>
      <P>Lien, who is expected to run in the 2000 presidential elections,
defined public welfare as the realization of people's happiness and
sense of contentment.</P>
      <P>He said there were four guarantees in the improvement of public
welfare. They are to secure people's property from being damaged by
disaster, disease and theft; protect the environment from improper
destruction; ensure continued economic openness allowing people to
enjoy sufficient investment and employment opportunities; and to
share the fruits of these endeavors equally extending assistance to
the old, weak, women and children.</P>
      <P>As to how to put these four guarantees into practice, Lien said
it is important to maintain balance -- the balance between private
property and public property, the balance between production and
environmental protection, the balance between efficiency and
fairness.</P>
      <P>The vice president urged the public to join hands in dealing with
the common problems facing society and to contribute to the success
of a social transformation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>3 NABBED FOR ATTEMPTING TO SMUGGLE HEROIN INTO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three ROC nationals were arrested late on
Friday for attempting to smuggle a large amount of heroin into Taiwan
from mainland China, airport police said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Security officials at Chiang Kai-shek (CKS) International Airport
first spotted an 18-year-old man, identified as Tsai Tze-yuan, acting
suspiciously upon his arrival on a China Airlines flight from Hong
Kong at around midnight.</P>
      <P>Security officers then joined forces with customs inspectors to
detain Tsai and search his luggage. Through an extensive search, they
discovered eight heroin bricks, weighing a total of 2,810 grams,
under a wooden plank in his baggage.</P>
      <P>Tsai told police that his boss, Tsai Chin-hsing, who arrived on
the same flight, owned the drugs and managed to escape via a taxi
after authorities detained Tsai Tze-yuan.</P>
      <P>Airport police alerted highway police which intensified road
patrols in search of the culprit. They managed to intercept the taxi
carrying Tsai Chin-hsing, 38. Another accomplice, Chou-Huang Wen-pin,
41, who was also in the taxi, was arrested.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chin-hsing told police that he was commissioned by a
mainland man, nicknamed Qiyu, to smuggle the drugs from the southern
mainland province of Guangdong to Taiwan via Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The three drug traffickers have been transferred to the Taoyuan
Prosecutor's Office for further questioning. Police said they will
further investigate and bring to justice any other accomplice who
may be involved in the case.</P>
      <P>CKS Airport police also arrested a Macau resident, identified as
Jou Ion Chau, at midnight on Thursday for attempting to smuggle 5.51
kilograms of high-grade heroin into Taiwan from Thailand.</P>
      <P>It was the fifth time in the past month that CKS Airport police
have intercepted residents of Hong Kong and Macau attempting to
smuggle narcotics into Taiwan, police said, adding that they will
tighten inspections to curb such criminal operations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, police warned local residents not to visit casinos
when in Macau to avoid falling prey to international drug trafficking
rings which reportedly target people who lose money while gambling to
tempt them into smuggling contraband drugs into Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui said here Saturday
that Taiwan will try to promote democratization, modernize its
financial system, streamline its government structures, and improve
its administrative efficiency to welcome the coming of the 21st
century.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks when addressing an annual meeting of "youth
career building models" from Taiwan and abroad sponsored by the
Youth Career Development Association in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Lee said Taiwan has been able to create the so-called economic
miracle in the past half century mainly because it has abundant
creative and diligent manpower. Taiwan is able to weather the Asian
financial storm, because it has worked hard to improve its economic
fundamentals for many years.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan has virtually no foreign debts. The businessmen of
Taiwan are able to run their businesses faithfully and steadily.
Taiwan's small and medium enterprises are versatile and flexible in
doing business. The government's transparent financial policies have
contributed to their success, he added.</P>
      <P>Forty-four entrepreneurs, including President Stan Shih of the
Acer Group, were cited in the meeting for their outstanding
achievements in career building.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Vincent Siew said at the meeting that there 
will be bountiful business opportunities in the next century, when
competition in the business world will be very keen. The best way
the private enterprises can do to survive the competition is to
always try to overtake themselves, he added.</P>
      <P>All successful enterprises in the next century must be creative,
flexible, and fast in doing business, he said, adding that "the
future world will belong to those who dare to dream and are able to
create bravely."</P>

      <P>Taipei police seized several thousand FM2
pills, sometimes referred to as the date rape drug, during a pair of
pub raids early Sunday morning.</P>
      <P>Police, posing as patrons at popular teenage hangouts, seized
more than 2,200 FM2 pills at one Roosevelt Road pub. At another pub
on Nanking East Road, they seized 20 MDMA pills and a bag of

    <HEADLINE>THREE TARGETS CITED FOR KOO-WANG MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  4 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The major purpose of the upcoming visit by
C. F. Koo, Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland China, is to reopen
constructive dialogue with the mainland, said a ranking official with
the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The other two prime purposes of Koo's mainland trip are to
improve bilateral relations and to rebuild the mechanism of two-way
institutionalized talks through constructive dialogue, SEF Deputy
Secretary-General Wu Hsin-hsing said at a seminar sponsored by Nanhua
Management College.</P>
      <P>Koo, who is the chairman of the foundation, is scheduled to begin
a six-day visit to mainland China on Oct. 14.</P>
      <P>Koo will tour Beijing and Shanghai and meet with his mainland
Chinese counterpart, Wang Daohan, chairman of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are semi-official intermediary bodies authorized by
Taipei and Beijing, respectively, to deal with bilateral exchanges in
the absence of official contact.</P>
      <P>As to the question of whether the planned Koo-Wang meeting would
pave the way for a summit between President Lee Teng-hui and mainland
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Wu said it is too early to speculate.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is open, however, to all sorts of bilateral negotiations
with mainland China on equal footing if Beijing respects the
existence of the Republic of China, he said.</P>
      <P>Beijing's attitude toward Taiwan after the planned Koo-Wang
meeting next week will serve as the major barometer of future
cross-strait ties, the SEF official explained. Should Beijing
continue bullying Taipei in the international community, it will be
hard for the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to improve relations, he
claimed.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Chiu Yi-jen, secretary-general of
the major opposition Democratic Progressive Party, said he was
doubtful that the Koo-Wang meeting would help bring about a Lee-Jiang
summit.</P>
      <P>As Koo's upcoming mainland trip has been defined as a "visit and
tour to meet and chat with friends," Chiu predicted that the Koo-Wang
meeting will not produce any concrete results, let alone clear the
way for a Lee-Jiang summit.</P>
      <P>The Koo-Wang meeting, he said, will only help the two sides to
release a message that they are willing to resolve their differences
through peaceful means.</P>
      <P>While Taipei wishes to use the Koo-Wang meeting to push for the
resumption of regular SEF-ARATS negotiations, Beijing's attempt to
use it to clear the way for bilateral political talks will be a
gargantuan task, he opined.</P>
      <P>Chiu also said it is hard for Taiwan to ward off mainland China's
"one China" offensive. He suggested the government play the
"democracy card" to counter Beijing's strategy.</P>

      <P>U-Land Airlines, a member of the financially
stricken U-Land enterprise group, filed a medium- and long-term
operation program with the Civil Aeronautics Administration on
Saturday, in which it is eyeing future expansion into the Southeast
Asian market.</P>
      <P>After discussing the matter with high-ranking U-Land Airlines
officials, U-Land Group Chairman Chow Chi-jui has decided the airline
will continue to operate.</P>
      <P>To improve its financial situation, U-Land Airlines plans to sell
three MD-82 carriers and then lease them back.</P>
      <P>The airline estimated its turnover this year will reach NT$1.2
billion, up 20 percent from last year. U-Land Airlines will likely
discontinue its Taipei-Kinmen and Kaohsiung-Kinmen services, as
flights on both routes had average occupancy rates ranging from 50
percent to 60 percent. The airline plans to continue, however, its
Taipei-Kaohsiung service.</P>
      <P>Eyeing expansion into the Southeast Asian market in the future,
U-Land Airlines now owns a 40 percent stake in Air Philippines and a
30 percent stake in Vietnamese Pacific Airlines.</P>
      <P>U-Land plans to expand its plane flotilla by purchasing Boeing

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chou Chi-jui, president of the financially
troubled U-Land Group, announced late Saturday that the group will
fully resume operations next week.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at U-Land's headquarters in central
Taichung City, Chou said all the group's affiliates will resume
normal operations starting on Wednesday and that he will call a press
conference then to make public the group's future plans.</P>
      <P>Chou's remarks came after local newspapers reported over the
weekend that U-Land members suspended operations on Friday after
checks totaling about NT$170 million (about US$5 million) issued by a
textile and a construction firm belonging to the group bounced on
Wednesday and Thursday.</P>
      <P>Apologizing for the damage caused by the incident, Chou vowed
that "all U-Land staff and workers are committed to fully resolving
the problems" and made assurances that he himself will assume
responsibility to the end and will never "escape."</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that not everything has been settled, Chou said
U-Land's structure is sound and that many business groups have shown
keen interest in the group. A banking consortium has also agreed in
principle to extend support to the group, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, sources familiar with the banking sector revealed that
U-Land was able to resolve its financial crisis so quickly because
the group had won the backing of a business group based in southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Two or three business groups have shown interest in taking over
U-Land's operations since the group was reported to have been saddled
with financial difficulties, the sources said, though they refused to

    <TEXT>
      <P>None of the 72 candidates of the Unity
Party, including 17 Chinese Australians, were elected to Parliament,
but the newly established political group performed quite well in
some key electorates.</P>
      <P>In a press release faxed to CNA on Sunday, Unity Chairman Peter
Wong said: "These results show that in only 14 weeks, the people who
have suffered under racism and the fear of Pauline Hanson and One
Nation have stood up and been counted."</P>
      <P>He said in a number of key seats in New South Wales, Unity has
fared better than One Nation, and in many seats it fared better than
the Democrats and Greens parties.</P>
      <P>The fielding of 17 Australian Chinese candidates, who are either
migrants from mainland China and Hong Kong or born of parents of
Chinese descent, was the largest ever in terms of number since the
Commonwealth of Australia was proclaimed in 1901, he said.</P>
      <P>Wong said the election results had proved the Unity Party would
no longer be overlooked by either the country's major parties or its
media.</P>
      <P>"This is proof that if you speak out strongly and loudly against
racism, it will have an effect on the population. I challenge the
major parties to speak out now, and denounce the results of One
Nation in this election," Wong said.</P>
      <P>He said: "One Nation has received continued coverage by the
mainstream press for the past two years, yet with only coverage in
the ethnic and some local press, Unity has in 14 weeks outpolled One
Nation in key seats."</P>
      <P>In a speech to his supporters in Sydney on Saturday night, Prime
Minister John Howard said: "I want to dedicate my government to the
maintenance of traditional Australian values ... including the values
of tolerance and treating people decently and not discriminating
against people according to their races and ethnic backgrounds."</P>
      <P>"We are a nation of many parts and origins and we should never
forget that. And we should see that is a tremendous asset," he added.</P>
      <P>Political analysts said Howard had learned a lesson from the
racial backlash resulting from his unwillingness to initially condemn
Pauline Hanson when she made a speech in 1996 that was characterized
as racist, anti-Asian, anti-multiculturalism and anti-foreign
investment.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, Unity media adviser John Hawker
revealed that the next step for the Unity Party would be to take part
in the New South Wales (NSW) election on March 27, 1999.</P>
      <P>He said the Unity did not anticipate winning any seats in
Saturday's elections, as the party was formed less than three months
ago. But the party performed quite impressively in the elections, he
said.</P>
      <P>"However, we are confident from the experience in this
just-concluded election, we could win one to two seats at the NSW
election next year," he said.</P>
      <P>The Unity Party has now a membership of more than 4,000 people
throughout Australia and Hawker said the number will continue to rise
in the coming months and years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SENIOR LABOR LEADER SAID TO BE READY TO QUIT POLITICS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  4  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China will soon lose a
good friend in Australian politics, as Gareth Evans, former foreign
minister under the Labor government and now deputy leader of the
Labor Party, has said he will soon quit politics, saying it is time
to move on to something different.</P>
      <P>He told Australian Broadcasting Corp. Saturday night, "I won't be
running for the deputy leadership of the party, probably won't be
running for the front bench and I'll probably be leaving the
Parliament."</P>
      <P>Evans, who retained the Victorian lower house seat of Holt, was
philosophical and gracious when he made his decision. He refused to
concede defeat in the Oct. 3 election but said the odds were
dramatically stacked against the Australian Labor Party (ALP).</P>
      <P>The ALP on Saturday grabbed at least 17 additional seats in the
House of Representatives, boosting its number from 49 to between 68
and 70.</P>
      <P>But the Labor Party has failed to win a majority, losing to the
coalition of the Liberal and National parties under Prime Minister
John Howard. The coalition maintained control, winning about 77 seats
in the 148-seat House of Representatives.</P>
      <P>"Obviously I haven't been thinking about this at all closely
because we've been living in hope that we'd bring home the bacon.
That doesn't seem likely now," Evans said.</P>
      <P>"I've been in Parliament now for 20 years and I think I've had a
pretty good experience, longest-serving Labor minister, along with
Ralph Willis, Cabinet minister, in the country's history. I think
I've had a pretty good innings," he said.</P>
      <P>Evans was sympathetic toward Taiwan because the Republic of China
is a democratic country with a highly developed economy, according to
Associate Professor C. L. Chiou.</P>
      <P>He was the only senior opposition leader to meet Premier Vincent
Siew when the latter made an overnight stopover in Brisbane in July.</P>
      <P>"The departure of Evans from politics will be a loss to the ROC
on Taiwan," Chiou said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ONE NATION LEADER LOSES SEAT IN AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Controversial Member of Federal Parliament
Pauline Hanson's dream of becoming a new political force in Australia
turned into a nightmare as she lost her bid for a second term in
Saturday's elections.</P>
      <P>Hanson became a household name overnight after making a speech at
the Parliament in September 1996 in which she demanded the government
halt Asian immigration, abolish multiculturalism, stop foreign
investment and substantially reduce subsidies to Aboriginal people.</P>
      <P>Her divisive comments in Australia resulted in nationwide racial
debates, which received widespread coverage not only in Australia but
also in Taiwan, Hong Kong, mainland China and Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>She founded One Nation Party in April 1997, and the party managed
to win 11 seats in Queensland's Parliament in state elections on June
13.</P>
      <P>In Saturday's elections, however, the party won only one seat.
Hanson had earlier predicted that One Nation might win as many as 12
or 13.</P>
      <P>National Party Senator leader Ron Boswell said One Nation was all
but finished as a political force.</P>
      <P>"(Hanson) had her chance to make the big time here and she has
failed," Boswell said.</P>
      <P>Regarding the election results, Hanson told Australian media on
Sunday: "I was extremely disappointed." She added, however, that the
party would go on.</P>
      <P>David Oldfield, Hanson's senior adviser, also lost his bid to
capture the Senate's New South Wales seat.</P>
      <P>Analysts said that if the party does not tone down its rhetoric,
it may face political extinction. "Unless they learn from the
embarrassing election result and act rationally and reasonably in the
future and try to refrain from inciting racist sentiment and instead
mapping out good policies for the interests of Australians, the party
will be abandoned by the people," one analyst said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BUSINESSMEN SUFFER LOSSES IN RECENT RIOTS IN LESOTHO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is estimated that Taiwan businessmen lost
100 million rand (about US$22 million) during recent riots in
Lesotho, an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Timothy Yang, MOFA's director of the Department of African
Affairs, noted that riots broke out when clashes between
anti-government protesters and Lesotho troops turned violent on Sept.
22. Two of Lesotho's neighbors, South Africa and Botswana, had sent
troops into the country to maintain peace and stability.</P>
      <P>Yang said that after the riots, the ROC's offices in South Africa
had coordinated to evacuate all Taiwan businessmen to a town near the
Lesotho-South African boarder except for members of 14 Taiwanese
households located within safer industrial zones.</P>
      <P>Yang said that Du Ling, representative of the Taipei Liaison
Office in the Republic of South Africa, traveled to the town to meet
with the ROC nationals and provided them with 50,000 rand on behalf
of the government for emergency use.</P>
      <P>Yang said that the government is watching closely developments in
Lesotho and will take whatever measures are necessary.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the head of the South African coordination office of
Taiwan's largest charity organization said that on the morning of
Sept. 22, the rioters began to burn and loot buildings and shops in
the capital, Maseru.</P>
      <P>Shih Hung-chi of the Buddhist Compassionate Relief Tzu-chih
Foundation, said that more than 95 percent of the shops in Maseru
were destroyed and that goods in the shops were plundered. Only a few
factories, under the protection of the army, were spared, he added.</P>
      <P>About 50 Taiwan-run shops and 300 mainland Chinese-run shops were
burned and looted during the riots. A Taiwanese businessman surnamed
Chen suffered losses of NT$60 million (US$1.76 million).</P>
      <P>Shih said that Tzu-Chi members in Lesotho and South Africa had
helped mainland Chinese in the region seek safety.</P>
      <P>Shih said that about 500 mainlanders temporarily lived in the
homes of Taiwan businessmen, while about 90 people lived in church
shelters and about 40 lived in Chinese schools.</P>
      <P>He said that after taking care of the Taiwanese and mainlanders,
Tzu-Chi members visited a refugee camp, of which nearly 90 percent of
the camp occupants were women and children. The group donated three
tons of maize powder, 300 kilograms of cabbages and potatoes to the
camp.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A British official in charge of foreign
investment is scheduled to visit Taipei at the end of this month to
seek further investment from Taiwan and strengthen bilateral economic
relations.</P>
      <P>Official statistics indicate that Taiwan's investment in Britain
has continued to grow at a time when other Asian countries are
reducing investments there amid financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based China External Trade Development Council (CETRA)
said that a computer assembly plant built in Scotland by Taiwan's Hon
Hai Precision Industry Co. will start operating soon.</P>
      <P>The US$24 million plant occupies some 110,000 square meters, and
the number of local people who will be employed there is expected to
increase from 300 to 560 over the next three years.</P>
      <P>The new plant, Hon Hai's second in Scotland, will not only become
a major production center but will also serve as the headquarters of
Hon Hai's European operations.</P>
      <P>The Hon Hai group also maintains production plants in mainland
China and the United States.</P>
      <P>While Japan and South Korea has invested more in Britain in
recent years than Taiwan has, the financial crisis that started last
year has seen both Japan and South Korea curb investment in Britain,
while the amount invested by Taiwan has grown.</P>
      <P>As of last December, Taiwan had invested in a total of 91
projects in Britain, of which 53 involved electronics, nine involved
financial services and eight involved transportation.</P>
      <P>Besides the forthcoming visit by the British investment official
at the end of October, the development bureau of London will set up
its first overseas representative office in Taipei on Oct. 7.</P>
      <P>An ROC-UK business council will also be inaugurated at the end of

    <DATELINE>Kuala Lumpur, Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By Y. P. Chen and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan investment in Malaysia is still
growing this year despite the fact that this Southeast Asian country
has been hard hit by an ongoing financial crisis in the region, Paul
J. K. Tso, ROC representative to Malaysia, said on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Citing Malaysian government tallies, Tso said Taiwan investment
in Malaysia totaled US$1.5 billion in the first seven months of this
year, up 89 percent from the corresponding period of 1997.</P>
      <P>As of this July, more than 1,500 Taiwan firms have poured in
about US$8.5 billion worth of investment to Malaysia, making the
island Malaysia's second-largest foreign investor after Japan, said
Tso while addressing the opening ceremony of the eighth conference of
Taiwan businessmen in Malaysia.</P>
      <P>Two-way Taiwan-Malaysia trade hit US$7.25 billion in 1997, with
Malaysia enjoying a trade surplus of US$1.2 billion. Taiwan is
Malaysia's fourth-largest trading partner, while Malaysia ranks seven
for Taiwan, according to Tso.</P>
      <P>Answering questions from reporters, Tso said he believes that the
currency controls imposed recently by Kuala Lumpur will greatly help
export-oriented Taiwan businesses with operations here.</P>
      <P>Judging from relevant statistics, Malaysia, rather than Thailand,
is still the most popular investment destination in Southeast Asia
among Taiwan businesses, he noted.</P>
      <P>According to Tso, Taiwan investment in Malaysia is quite
diversified, ranging from electronics to chemicals and farming.
Nevertheless, some Taiwan firms based in the country are being
affected by an increasing shortage of labor.</P>
      <P>Malaysia also enjoys an advantage over Taiwan in tourism
exchanges, he pointed out. In 1997, around 246,000 Taiwan people
visited Malaysia, up from 222,000 in 1996, while about 164,000 Taiwan
residents visited Malaysia in the first eight months of this year.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, 54,000 Malaysian people have traveled to
Taiwan so far in 1998, down from 56,000 in 1997. Only 31,000
Malaysian travelers visited Taiwan between January and August of this
year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Indonesia's Chinese conglomerates,
stripped of their political links, may soon be only bit players in
the new economic landscape as they are forced to liquidate assets to
pay off huge debts to the government, which has decided to accept
only cash, according to Singapore-based The Business Times.</P>
      <P>The situation presents the authorities with an opportunity to
break the hold these conglomerates have over the economy in one fell
swoop.</P>
      <P>Following in the footsteps of the Salim and Gajah Tunggal Groups
-- which recently pledged to transfer assets of US$7 billion to the
Indonesian government -- more than half of the country's biggest
conglomerates could face the same fate, the newspaper said.</P>
      <P>Owing billions of dollars to Bank Indonesia (BI) -- the central
bank that injected more than 150 trillion rupiah (US$13.7 billion)
into banks owned by these conglomerates to keep them afloat -- their
owners are finding it next to impossible to honor commitments to
repay the central bank with cash, analysts told The Business Times.</P>
      <P>Having been unable to meet an earlier deadline of Sept. 21 to
repay the liquidity credits granted by BI, the owners have now been
given one year to raise the necessary cash.</P>
      <P>"None of the owners has the cash to repay BI so they will have to
make up by selling assets including property," said Harvey Goldstein,
president director of PT Harvest International.</P>
      <P>Ray Anthony Gerungan, deputy head of research at GK Goh
Ometracto, agreed, noting that many of these conglomerates will be

(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A record one billion people -- a third of
the global workforce -- are unemployed or underemployed, the
Geneva-based International Labor Organization (ILO) said in its 1998
World Employment Report Sunday.</P>
      <P>"Growing unemployment would bring more poverty and inequality
across the world," the ILO report warned.</P>
      <P>The ILO report pointed out that the East Asian financial crisis
would increase joblessness by 10 million directly and up to 20
million indirectly this year, bringing the total of those formally
unemployed, mainly in industrialized countries, to 150 million, from
120 million in the mid-1990s.</P>
      <P>Add to that about 900 million estimated to be "underemployed" --
those who want to work more or are unable to earn a living wage --
and the ILO arrives at its one billion figure. Prospects have
worsened substantially, the ILO said, since its last employment
report two years ago.</P>
      <P>The East Asian crisis, which was revealing the "dark and
unacceptable face of globalization," has boosted Indonesia's
unemployment rate from 4 percent to 12 percent and increased the
numbers of Indonesians in poverty from about 22 million to 80
million.</P>
      <P>In South Korea, unemployment has jumped from 2.6 percent to 7
percent, while in Thailand the jobless rate is expected to reach 6
percent this year, compared with between 1 percent and 2 percent two
years ago.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, about 3.5 million workers are expected to be laid off

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian corporate borrowers are facing
a credit crunch because the current global financial crisis has
closed US bond markets to foreign companies, analysts said.</P>
      <P>Top Australian companies such as Broken Hill Proprietary Ltd.,
Lend Lease, Hoyts, Star City and Citipower have tried to raise funds
through syndicated bank loans, but they were shocked to find banks
are insisting on borrowing margins between 45 percent and 90 percent
higher than those of one year ago, analysts said.</P>
      <P>Bankers revealed the margin they offered is between 60 and 65
basis points (one-hundredth of 1 percent) above bank bills -- half as
much again as the 40 basis points or so above the benchmark paid on a
similar, expired loan.</P>
      <P>"Basically what we're seeing now is a very accelerated
contraction in bank liquidity and with that, we're seeing a rather
dramatic increase in pricing," one unnamed corporate treasurer told
the Australian Financial Review.</P>
      <P>He said the situation has been made worse for Australian
borrowers because they have nowhere else to turn.</P>
      <P>Until recently, many companies could look to US bond markets for
help in debt financing, but the global financial crisis has closed
the US bond markets to foreign companies, including those in
Australia, the treasurer said.</P>

(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 32nd annual conference of the
International Iron and Steel Institute (IISI) opened in Taipei on
Monday. ROC President Lee Teng-hui sent a written message to the
conference to offer his congratulations.</P>
      <P>Lee lauded the IISI's contributions to the promotion of
international cooperation, information exchanges and operating
environment improvements.</P>
      <P>He said the steel industry will continue to play an important
role in Taiwan's future development and said the IISI was welcomed to
hold its annual meeting in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The three-day conference opened at the Taipei International
Conference Hall, with the participation of delegates from 53 member
countries and more than 200 steel companies, steel associations and
related research institutions.</P>
      <P>IISI Secretary-General Lenhard J. Holschuh told the meeting on
Monday that because of the fallout from Asia's financial crisis, it
may take two or three years -- and perhaps as long as seven -- for
the world's steel consumption to rise by 10 percent.</P>
      <P>But he said he foresees an upturn in Taiwan's steel consumption
next year because of the expected increase in Taiwan's infrastructure
spending.</P>
      <P>Holschuh put Taiwan's steel consumption this year at 20,040
metric tons, down 2.9 percent from the preceding year. For next year,
however, he forecast a 5.9 percent increase.</P>
      <P>At a meeting of the IISI Board of Directors on Sunday, USX Steel
President Thomas Usher of the United States, currently an IISI vice
president, was elected IISI president. He will take over the post
from Francis Mer, chairman of France's Usinor Steel, after the close
of the Taipei conference.</P>
      <P>Wang Chung-yu, chairman of Taiwan's China Steel Corp., was
elected as a new IISI vice president, together with current IISI Vice
President Akira Chihaya, president of Nippon Steel Corp.</P>
      <P>Wang told the media on Monday that he personally welcomed
mainland China's inclusion in the IISI, as do most IISI members. He
said their inclusion in the organization would help improve their
steel production know-how and prevent the pollution of mainland
China's environment.</P>
      <P>On Sunday night, the IISI held a reception to welcome the
conference delegates. ROC Vice President Lien Chan was among the
prominent figures invited to the reception.</P>
      <P>At the reception Lien praised the outstanding contributions the
IISI has made over the past three decades. He said he believes the
Taipei conference will serve to further advance the prosperity of the
world's economy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPOREANS SPEND MORE ABROAD AS FOREIGNERS SPEND LESS IN SINGAPORE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct.  5  (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singaporeans spent an estimated S$9.1
billion (US$5.3 billion) abroad last year, up from S$8.2 billion in
1996 and S$7.2 billion in 1995, according to figures from the Trade
and Industry Ministry.</P>
      <P>These estimates from the Department of Statistics indicate that
the amount spent by Singaporeans outside the Republic has gone up by
an average of 13 percent per year over the last three years.</P>
      <P>Not surprisingly, the bulk of overseas spending was in
neighboring Malaysia, where Singaporean tourists spent about S$2.98
billion last year. That figure represents a slight decline from the
S$3.09 billion spent there in 1996, though it is higher than the
S$2.75 billion spent there in 1995.</P>
      <P>The second most popular overseas destination for Singaporeans was
Indonesia, where spending has increased steadily from S$1.08 billion
in 1995 to S$1.29 billion in 1996 and S$1.50 billion last year.</P>
      <P>The steady increase in the amount that Singaporeans are spending
abroad contrasts starkly with amount that foreigners are spending
in Singapore, based on figures from the Singapore Tourism Board.</P>
      <P>In a report released in August, the board said that foreign
tourists spend just S$4.78 billion in Singapore last year, 8.3
percent less than in 1996. The amount spent on shopping has declined
as well, contributing to a retail slump. Shops in Singapore reported
a 28 percent plunge in sales during the nation's recent Great
Singapore Sale compared with its 1997 sale.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT MAY LIFT BAN ON BIG BANK MERGERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  5  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The coalition government of the Liberal
and National parties under Prime Minister John Howard is expected to
lift a ban on big bank mergers following its election-day victory on
Saturday, banking analysts said.</P>
      <P>They said a buying rush for bank stocks is likely this week in
anticipation of the ban's being lifted.</P>
      <P>They said the return of the coalition government to power for
another three-year term would bolster the share prices of Australia's
big four banks.</P>
      <P>The Australian Labor Party earlier said it would continue to ban
the mergers of the country's larger big banks -- including Westpac
Banking Corp., ANZ Banking Corp., the National Australia Bank (NAB)
and the Commonwealth Bank -- if the party won the election.</P>
      <P>NAB has been the most vocal advocate of lifting the ban on big
bank mergers. Analysts predicted that NAB would test the coalition
government by trying to merge with ANZ.</P>
      <P>"Big bank mergers are back on the agenda; that's the upshot of
the coalition's win," a fund manager said.</P>
      <P>But other analysts said there could be a gradual lifting --
rather than an immediate scrapping -- of the ban.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Monetary Authority of Singapore
announced in August a series of measures to liberalize the use of
Singapore dollars outside Singapore. These measures would make it
easier for foreign entities to list Singapore dollar-denominated
shares and to issue Singapore dollar bonds, in cases in which the
proceeds would be used outside Singapore.</P>
      <P>The aim was to develop broad and deep capital markets to attract
a broad range of international issuers, investors and intermediaries.</P>
      <P>The International Finance Corp. bond issuance is the first major
bond issue denominated in Singapore dollars by an international
issuer since the August announcement and also the first
supra-national issue in Singapore.</P>
      <P>"This is an encouraged development," said Koh Yong Guan, Managing
Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore. "We believe that
this would help stimulate the growth of the debt market in
Singapore."</P>
      <P>Koh added that he expects more Singapore dollar bond issues by
supra-nationals over the next year. "This is in line with our
objective of developing as a center for the origination, listing and
trading of foreign securities for the Asian region."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Affected by the Asian financial storm, the
number of overdue loans at local banks is expected to total more than
4 percent this year.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank of China (CBC) said that number of overdue loans
in the first and second quarters amounted to 4.16 percent and 4
percent, respectively, and both figures were considered high.</P>
      <P>CBC officials said that the percentage of overdue loans has
climbed in the past five years, indicating that after the enactment
of financial liberalization, monetary regulation has become lax, and
regulators negligent.</P>
      <P>The officials urged the banking sector to step up regulatory
efforts to effectively cut the risks of bad loans.</P>
      <P>They said that the rise in overdue loans can be attributed to a
sluggish economy, lackluster stock market and an attempt by the

    <HEADLINE>US DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE MONTHLY REPORTS ON TAIWAN'S ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  5  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy and political system
are more open, competitive and mature than many of its neighbors, the
latest issue of Business America Monthly said in its cover story.</P>
      <P>John Hoover, an economic officer of the American Institute in
Taiwan, the de facto US embassy in the ROC, contributed the story
titled "Taiwan's Tiger is a Regional Leader" to the publication
produced by the US Department of Commerce.</P>
      <P>Hoover highlighted Taiwan's international economic power,
discussed its bid to enter the World Trade Organization (WTO), and
described how the island has weathered the Asian financial crisis
relatively unscathed.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is the world's seventh largest foreign investor, the
second largest investor in mainland China and the third largest in
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), it is only
natural that it would want to enter the WTO, Hoover wrote.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, as a world class trading economy and a major
international investor, has much to gain from having representation
at the WTO table, he added.</P>
      <P>Hoover noted that although the New Taiwan dollar depreciated
roughly about 20 percent against the US dollar over the past year,
and its stock market fell along with other major international
exchanges, Taiwan still racks up a perennial trade surplus, and its
economy is set to grow by over 5 percent this year.</P>
      <P>The reasons why Taiwan has emerged from the financial turmoil
unscathed is because the island "is more open, more competitive, and
more mature -- both economically and politically -- than many of its
Asian neighbors," he said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has long eschewed foreign debt, preferring to finance
economic development using domestic funding and the retained earnings
of its private sector," the report said.</P>
      <P>Other contributing factors to the island's success amid the
regional downturn is that Taiwan does not have an excessively
overvalued, speculative real estate market, and its banking system is
relatively healthy and stable, Hoover wrote.</P>
      <P>"Structurally, Taiwan's economy differs in fundamental ways from
those of its neighbors. The population is uniformly well-educated
and highly skilled. The economy long shifted away form
labor-intensive industries..." he added.</P>
      <P>"Moreover, Taiwan's economy is dominated not by large
conglomerates, but by tens of thousands of small- and medium-sized
enterprises. Risk is therefore dispersed. Another benefit: the
private sector is competitive and highly agile in adjusting to shifts
in market conditions at home and aboard," the report said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's stable political leadership and prudent policy-making
decisions were also noted in Hoover's report. He praised the island's
leaders for exercising extreme care in monitoring and responding to
the regional financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Business America Monthly is the official publication of the
International Trade Board under the Department of the Commerce. The
cover of its September issue features an oil painting of a tiger to

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO SCRAP BARTER TRADE OF FRUIT WITH SOUTH KOREA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will end its barter trade of fruit with
South Korea this year as it goes against the grain of the World Trade
Organization, the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said on Monday.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials said the barter trade of fruit between the
Republic of China and South Korea -- which was disrupted after the
two nations severed diplomatic ties in September 1992 -- resumed in
1994 and continued for three consecutive years.</P>
      <P>Officials noted that South Korea imported a much lower amount of
onions and fruit from Taiwan compared to Taiwan's imports of South
Korean apples and pears, contravening the barter trade agreement.</P>
      <P>In view of the lack of sincerity on the part of South Korea to
import fruits and vegetables from Taiwan, trade and agricultural
officials concluded that with such a big gap on barter trade, there
was no reason to continue such a practice and barter trade
consultations between the two sides was suspended in 1997.</P>
      <P>The officials said they have notified South Korea that they will
not hold barter trade consultations this year, but related trade
issues will be discussed in a ROC-South Korea economic conference.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the practice of barter trade runs counter to the WTO
norm therefore the government will scrap its barter trade agreement
which is bound to be questioned by WTO members once Taiwan moves
closer toward entering the world trade organization.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  5 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's labor force participation rate in
the first half of 1998 hit a 15-year low at 58.02 percent, according
to figures released by the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The figures indicated that in the January-June period, men's
labor participation rate remained high at 70.77 percent, up 0.02
percent over the same period last year. However, women's labor
participation rate marked a 0.45 percent decrease to 45.38 percent.</P>
      <P>The decline in the overall labor force participation rate in the
first half of the year was no doubt caused by the drop in women's
participation rate, the CEPD said.</P>
      <P>Reasons for the decline were a protracted business slump,
difficulty for aged women to find jobs or change jobs, women choosing
early retirement, and the introduction of the Labor Standard's Law to
the service sector that indirectly forced some women to quit the
workforce, the CEPD said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's labor force participation shot up to a new high 60.93
percent in 1987. It began to decline in the following years and
dropped to a 15-year low of 58.33 percent last year.</P>

      <P>The state of Western Australia is planning
to promote a "Focus Taiwan" project aimed at enhancing trade and
investment relations with Taiwan, the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in Australia said.</P>
      <P>The Board of Foreign Trade under the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) welcomed the project, deeming it beneficial to bilateral
relations between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Australia has been much affected by the Asian financial turmoil
that began to sweep the region last summer, Taipei's economic office
in Australia said in its report to the MOEA. It added that the
monetary crisis taking place among Australia's leading Asian trade
partners has prompted an economic recession in Australia.</P>
      <P>Australian exports to mainland China alone dropped 17 percent in
the first half of 1998 yet Taiwan was the third largest importer of
Australian products in the first six months of this year, next to
Japan and South Korea, the report indicated.</P>
      <P>The Primary Products and Fishing Department of Western
Australia's "Focus Taiwan" project aims to further develop trade
relations as well as cooperative efforts between Taiwan and Western
Australia in the field of agriculture, fishing and food industry
sectors.</P>
      <P>A cooperative agreement was signed last April between the Primary
Products and Fishing Department of Western Australia and the
Agriculture &amp; Forestry Department under the Taiwan Provincial
Government for the exchange of agricultural technology.</P>
      <P>According to informed sources, primary items in the "Focus
Taiwan" project include: increasing Western Australia's understanding
of Taiwan's agricultural, fishing and food industry markets; raising
the image of products of Western Australia in Taiwan's market;
eliminating impediments of Taiwan's exports to Western Australia;
arranging the exchange of visits by government officials and
industrial personnel between the two sides; as well as the technical
exchange of strategic alliances.</P>
      <P>The Western Australia government's Primary Products and Fishing
Department is also planning to establish an Agribusiness Partnership
Club in Taiwan to act as an adviser to relevant cooperation and
exchanges between the two sides, which will be conducive to a closer

      <P>Mainland Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo was
languishing in an "education through labor" camp in the northeastern
city of Dalian during the mid-autumn festival on Monday, his wife Liu
Xia told a human rights organization.</P>
      <P>She told the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in China that her husband is suffering
from duodenal and stomach ulcers, and that applications for his
release on bail for treatment of the painful disease have been
rejected on the ground that his chronic illness is not
life-threatening.</P>
      <P>Liu was sentenced to three years in "education through labor"
camp in Oct. 1996 after he and dissident Wang Xizhe issued an open
letter urging the government to initiate political reforms.</P>
      <P>The information center also said in a press release that
mainland Chinese authorities have not released another dissident,
Kao Yu, for medical treatment despite her serious heart and skin
diseases. She suffered two heart attacks last month and there are

    <HEADLINE>ASPIRIN EXAMINED IN ENTEROVIRUS DEATHS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is too early to say that aspirin was the
cause of death among children who had contracted enterovirus, the
Department of Health (DOH) said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuo-hsiung, DOH acting director of the Bureau of Communicable
Disease Control, made the statement in response to a recent finding
that several enterovirus victims had been given aspirin to reduce
their high fevers.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica biomedical science assistant researcher Ho
Mei-hsiang discovered that among 14 enterovirus-related deaths, six
victims had taken or been injected with aspirin. Despite being widely
used to reduce fever, aspirin has been banned in the treatment of
sick children among the international medical community.</P>
      <P>Ho said the use of aspirin on infants or children could cause the
development of a serious condition called Reye's syndrome, a disease
of the liver and central nervous system. In advanced cases, it can
result in brain damage or death.</P>
      <P>The disease, discovered in 1963 by R.D.K. Reye in the United
States, kills about 30 percent to 40 percent of its victims.</P>
      <P>Although she is not completely sure that aspirin caused the
deaths of the patients with enterovirus, Ho said she knows that some
pediatricians on the island are not qualified to write a treatment
prescription.</P>
      <P>Ho was commissioned by Academia Sinica and DOH to analyze about
60 deaths related to enterovirus since this summer. So far, she has
completed her research in 14 cases.</P>
      <P>Regarding the discovery, Hsu said it would be better to wait for
the results of the analysis on other cases before coming to any
conclusion. She noted that hospitals have been asked to find out
whether children suspected of having contracted enterovirus had been
given any aspirin before they were brought in for treatment.</P>
      <P>Huang Li-ming, a pediatrist for the National Taiwan University
Hospital, said he does not believe the deaths reported from May to
July were related to Reye's syndrome.</P>
      <P>Huang explained that most enterovirus victims died from heart and
lung failure, as well as pulmonary edema, while patients suffering
from Reye's syndrome usually die from increased pressure in their
brains.</P>
      <P>The only explanation as to how Reye's syndrome may have claimed
the lives of enterovirus victims is that the disease further weakened
patients' resistance to illnesses, Huang added.</P>
      <P>Since September, there has been an increase of reported cases to
the DOH of enterovirus patients. Following concern that the contagion
may spread across the island again after its first outbreak this
summer, the DOH has resumed its daily reports on the disease and has
called on the public to be vigilant against the virus.</P>
      <P>According to DOH's statistics, the number of victims claimed by
the enterovirus reached seven since Sept. 25. Over the past 10 days,
over 1,000 patients suspected of having contracted the virus were
reported. Of these, 123 children were categorized as seriously ill,
DOH said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ever Fortune Group has indicated it may
be willing to bail out the financially troubled U-Land Group after an
executive reaffirmed Ever Fortune's commitment to U-Land affiliates
on Monday.</P>
      <P>Ever Fortune General Manager Chien Chao-han said although his
company has contacted U-Land, Ever Fortune has not yet decided on its
course of action and is still assessing the possibility of taking
over U-Land.</P>
      <P>Chien stressed that the most important issue is to protect
customers' interests no matter which group takes control over U-Land.
He called on the government and business community to provide
assistance to help U-Land survive its present crisis, as it is a
gargantuan task for an enterprise to grow from the scratch.</P>
      <P>Operations of the widely-diversified U-Land -- which focuses
mainly on the aviation, textile and construction sectors -- came to a
halt last Friday after billions of NT dollars worth of checks issued
by two of its affiliates bounced on Wednesday and Thursday.</P>
      <P>However, U-Land head Chou Chi-jui quickly announced Saturday that
the group's operations will be fully resumed on Tuesday, prompting
speculation that certain business groups have agreed to bail out
U-Land from its current financial problems.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, local newspapers reported that a business group based
in the southern city of Kaohsiung will take over a construction
project being launched by U-Land in central Changhua, while another
group in southern Taiwan will take over the King Textile Co., the
most profitable U-Land subsidiary.</P>
      <P>U-Land Airlines announced over the weekend that it will continue
to operate despite the group's financial crisis.</P>

      <P>The US-based investment bank said in its latest "ASEAN Data
Watch" report that the consistency and focus of Singapore's policy
tack will go some way to bolster investor confidence.</P>
      <P>"While some short-term pain can be expected, (the authorities')
flexibility and prudence positively sparkles in comparsion to that
displayed by other countries in the region," the bank said.</P>
      <P>But Singapore is unlikely to escape an outright economic
recession in the second half of this year and in 1999. The broad
export trend is still weak and the medium-term outlook is uncertain.</P>
      <P>"Looking ahead, the key signal of a turnaround in the global
electronics cycle will likely be some establishment in prices -- very
likely preceded by cutbacks in production," it said.</P>
      <P>An increasing number of DRAM and electronics-related plants are
now closing down, and this may help to stabilize prices temporarily.
"But with global demand expected to slow further in 1999, the odds on
price recovery continue to be long," it added.</P>
      <P>The bank estimated that Singapore needs to cut business costs by
around 30 percent to stay competitive with its key export rivals
Malaysia, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan.</P>
      <P>In addition, Singapore's reserves have dropped -- despite
sustained balance of payments surpluses -- due to currency
revaluation effects, the report added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Keelung,  Oct.  5  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Provincial Governor James Soong
began on Monday what he called his "graduation trip" across the
island before he leaves the post at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Upon his arrival at the northern city of Keelung, Soong said he
felt regret that he failed to complete the rebuilding of the Keelung
Harbor and Keelung's renovation project during his four-year tenure.
However, he said his campaign promise to develop the harbor city
during the 1995 election was mostly realized.</P>
      <P>Soong, who was the first popularly-elected Taiwan provincial
governor, will be the last elected member to the post. An appointed
governor will replace Soong in late December when moves are taken to
downsize the Taiwan Provincial Government.</P>
      <P>Keelung is the first stop of Soong's final around-the-island trip
as governor. During his tenure, Soong has traveled across the island
twice to inspect township construction.</P>
      <P>During his stay in the harbor-city, the governor visited the
Taiwan Provincial Keelung Hospital. The hospital, which is over 100
years old, recently underwent a NT$200 million (US$5.9 million)
renovation project with the assistance of the provincial government.</P>
      <P>Soong also visited the Keelung Harbor, the island's second

    <HEADLINE>ILO CRITICIZES EXPORT ZONE STANDARDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The world is acquiring more and more export
processing zones in response to globalization and the
decentralization of industry. This rapid growth, however, has severe
consequences for the 27 million people, 90 percent of them women, who
work in the zones.</P>
      <P>The Geneva-based International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates
in a report that there are 845 such zones around the world. Of these,
320 are in North America -- the 213 maquiladora assembly plants in
the US and the 107 Mexico. These zones export US$5 billion-worth of
products a year, more than 30 percent of Mexico's total exports.</P>
      <P>A further 225 zones can be found in Asia, including 124 in
mainland China, 35 in the Philippines, and 26 in Indonesia. The
numbers in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are also growing.</P>
      <P>In addition, the ILO report said, the zones are increasing in
regions such as the Caribbean (51); Central America (41); and the
Middle East (39).</P>
      <P>The report said the zones are one of the main components of the
foreign investment-led export-oriented industrialization strategy and
a vehicle for globalization. When global production networks or
chains are constructed, the zones provide the links.</P>
      <P>The report pointed out that the zones are highly labor intensive,
concentrating on garments, footwear, and electrical components, and
providing jobs, especially for women, in developing countries.
However, it added that "too many of them continue to be hampered by a
reputation for low wages and poor working systems." The zones lead to
little transfer of skills or technology to adjacent areas, it said.</P>
      <P>"The frequent absence of minimum labor standards and poor
labor-management relations have predictable outcomes," the ILO report
said. These include high labor turnover, absenteeism, stress and
fatigue, low rates of productivity, excessive wastage of materials,
and labor unrest.</P>

      <P>Australia on Tuesday urged China to ratify
the UN human rights covenants after Beijing signed the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) on Monday.</P>
      <P>Despite signing the ICCPR, China appears to be backing away from
allowing key individual freedoms guaranteed under a UN human rights
treaty, according to a Sydney Morning Herald dispatch from Beijing
published on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The paper quoted official Chinese media as saying that Beijing
may have to curtail some rights guaranteed under the UN Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights despite promises from senior Chinese
government officials that the treaty would be fully implemented.</P>
      <P>Australia Foreign Minister Alexander Downer welcomed China's
signing of the ICCPR and urged Beijing to "take the necessary step to
ratify and implement both the human rights covenants as soon as
possible."</P>
      <P>"The signature yesterday represents another significant step
towards full adherence to international standards on human rights and
complements China's signature on 27 October last year of the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,"
Downer said in a written statement.</P>
      <P>Adding that he has consistently emphasized human rights in 
bilateral dialogue with Beijing, Downer said Canberra has
demonstrated its commitment to the promotion of improved human rights
standards throughout the world and Asia by pursuing dialogue with
other countries.</P>

on Monday in step with financial markets around the world amid
continued global pessimism.</P>
      <P>In Toronto, the TSE 300 index shed 181 points to close at 5,336.
The Canadian dollar also had another bad day, falling almost half a

      <P>The drop in the Canadian dollar came after Quebec Premier Lucien
Bouchard told associates that the province's general election has

      <P>A Quebec election is expected to cause political unrest in the

easing concerns over her anti-Asian and anti-foreign investment

      <P>The high profile of Hanson and her party have distracted

      <P>The daily praised the Australian electorate for showing
sophistication by not being influenced by Hanson's simplistic
philosophy on race, international affairs and foreign investment.</P>
      <P>Asian investors have been hit hard by the financial crisis, and

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO GO AHEAD WITH IC CARD PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Contrary to Premier Vincent Siew's comments
last week, plans for the national multi-purpose IC cards islandwide
will continue as planned, a ranking government official in charge of
the project said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Kirby Chaur-shan Yang, chairman of the Cabinet-level Research,
Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC), said during a visit to
Penghu Island that the promotion of the cards, which combine the
functions of the National Health Insurance Card and the National
Identification Card, will take place as scheduled.</P>
      <P>Yang, at the head of a delegation composed of officials from the
Criminal Investigation Bureau, National Health Insurance Bureau and
officials in charge of households and population administration, is
on island to explain and promote the advantages of the IC card</P>
      <P>Three years ago, Penghu Island residents were the first in Taiwan
to be introduced to the IC cards, and the use of the new cards has
met with a positive response, Yang said.</P>
      <P>He also addressed public concern that personal data or
information from the IC cards may be obtained by unauthorized
personnel, saying that precautions have been taken to ensure that
this does not happen.</P>
      <P>The planned IC cards will be limited mainly to health insurance
and identification purposes, and users will be free to decide whether
they want to attach additional functions to their cards, he noted.</P>
      <P>These cards will help improve administration efficiency and
prevent the forgery of personal identification documents, the RDEC
chairman said. They will also be more durable than the current ID
cards which are made of paper.</P>
      <P>As to whether the multi-functional IC cards will include users'
fingerprints, Yang only said that it would be legal to do so. He
assured the public that the government will maintain a high-level of
openness and transparency while processing the cards.</P>
      <P>The RDEC is scheduled to sign an agreement with a contractor on
Dec. 25 to produce the cards. If everything goes as planned, the
first batch of cards in Taipei will be officially launched in June
1999 in the Daan district, he noted.</P>
      <P>Yang said the RDEC will sponsor the first public briefing in
Taipei on Monday afternoon to exchange opinions with experts and
academics on the issue. The commission will also hold a series of
seminars and publish position papers islandwide within the next three
weeks to forge support, he said.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on
Tuesday refuted a mainland Chinese allegation that the Republic of
China on Taiwan had "stolen" China's name in signing a key human
rights treaty that calls for freedom of expression, religion and
self-determination.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's ambassador to the United Nations, Qin Huasun,
signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights at
the UN headquarters on Monday.</P>
      <P>Qin's signing came exactly 31 years after the ROC signed the
accord in 1967 when it was still a UN member state. Qin issued a
statement after the signing that Taiwan's signature was illegal and
"null and void."</P>
      <P>In response, MOFA spokesman Roy Wu said Qin's statement distorted
truth and twisted historical facts.</P>
      <P>Wu said the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
is one of the two accords seen as fundamental to protecting human
rights. The other accord is the International Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights.</P>
      <P>According to UN regulations, only member states of the United
Nations and its affiliated organizations or other countries invited
by the UN can sign the two covenants.</P>
      <P>The two treaties were adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1966
and went into force a decade later.</P>
      <P>"The ROC signed the two treaties on Oct. 5, 1967," Wu said,
adding that as the ROC was a UN member at that time, it was
logically entitled to sign the accords.</P>
      <P>"Qin's statement was not only confusing and misleading but
also distorted facts and truth," Wu stressed.</P>
      <P>The ROC lost its seat in the United Nations in 1971 when the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Evergreen Marine Corp. of Taiwan
formally acquired Lloyd Triestino di Navigazione S.P.A. of Italy
Monday, hoping to open a new chapter for the 163-year-old shipping
company.</P>
      <P>Chang Yung-fa, chairman of the Evergreen Group, signed the
acquisition agreement in Trieste, the headquarters of Lloyd
Triestino, in southern Italy.</P>
      <P>More than 200 dignitaries from the two countries attended the
ceremony. Local officials welcome Evergreen's acquisition of the
company, hoping that the move will help the Italian shipping company
upgrade its competitiveness and promote the development of the city.</P>
      <P>Chang said that Evergreen and Lloyd Triestino have cooperated
with each other over the past six years, but initially he had no
desire to acquire the company.</P>
      <P>He said that the Evergreen Group worried about the difficulties
Asians would face in operating a European company and in acquiring
all its shares, but the group decided to send officials to Italy to
inspect the company after receiving encouragement from the Italian
government.</P>
      <P>Chang told all the staff working in Lloyd Triestino to rest
assured that they will not be laid off after the acquisition,
stressing that the name and personnel will remain unchanged. He also
said he will hire as many local people as possible.</P>
      <P>He said that he would spend about three to five years overhauling
the shipping company to give it a fresh start.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the size of Lloyd Triestino is only about
one-tenth that of Evergreen, but he believed that it has the
potential for development.</P>
      <P>Chang said that his first step will be capital reduction and then
capital increment, and he will also step up the promotion of markets

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC GROWTH EXPECTED TO EXCEED 5 PERCENT IN 1998: DGBAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth will exceed 5
percent in 1998, and the civil consuming growth rate is also expected
to be greater than 6.6 percent in the second half of this year, the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS)
under the Executive Yuan announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Chang-yao, director of the third bureau of the DGBAS, said
that although the domestic consuming price slipped, there is
absolutely no chance of igniting a flurry of deflation.</P>
      <P>The annual growth rate of Taiwan's average consumer price index
in the first nine months in 1998 was 1.3 percent, in addition to an
estimated 7 percent civil consuming growth rate in 1998 and a 6.6
percent increase in civil consuming growth in the second half of
1998. These figures indicate there in no chance of Taiwan
experiencing deflation, said Hsu.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, Hsu said, deflation refers to a negative
growth in price and to consumers' deferring their purchases,
resulting in a decreased willingness to consume. Hsu cited Japan as a
typical example of a deflationary economy and said Taiwan's situation
is different.</P>
      <P>Under the backdrop of a currency that is rising against the US
dollar, Taiwan's economic growth in 1998 is expected to exceed 5
percent, Hsu added.</P>
      <P>Besides, according to the statistics published Tuesday by DGBAS,
a 0.39 percent annual growth rate in the consumer price index in
September was the lowest growth rate increase since March. It is
expected that the annual growth rate of consumer prices in 1998 can
be kept under 2 percent -- between 1.5 and 1.6 percent -- according
to the report.</P>
      <P>The consumer price index in September was 0.62 percent higher
than August's index; compared with the same period last year,
however, the annual growth rate is lower, a phenomenon that will help
keep domestic prices stable, the DGBAS director commented.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct. 6 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One Nation leader Pauline Hanson's defeat
in Saturday's federal legislative elections is welcome news across
Asia and has given rise to better relations between Australia and
countries in the region, according to The Age of Melbourne, a leading
Australian daily.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Bangkok titled "Asia Hails Hanson Loss" on the
front page of Tuesday's Age of Melbourne, correspondent Craig Skehan
reported that from Beijing to Bangkok, newspaper editorials and
government officials have expressed hopes that the poor performance
of One Nation will help alleviate concerns in Asia about the rise of
the far right in Australian politics.</P>
      <P>Fears of Hanson's party have reportedly affected Asian tourism to
Australia and threatened to lead to a reduction in the number of
foreign students who come to Australia to study, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>A Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman said: "We welcome the rejection
by an overwhelming majority of the Australian electorate of policies
being put forward by the One Nation Party."</P>
      <P>"It does away with this irritant, that suspicion on whether One
Nation reflected the broader views of Australians. The majority have
not succumbed. Australia really is part of the region and we are able
to take them at their word when they say they want to be part of
Asia," he added.</P>
      <P>A front-page story in the official China Daily newspaper said
politicians from across the Australian political spectrum had been
quick to welcome the "humiliation of the far-right which split
Australia over its anti-immigration and anti-Aboriginal policies."</P>
      <P>In a previous editorial, The Nation newspaper in Thailand accused
the government of Australian Prime Minister John Howard of being
unwilling to adequately counter Pauline Hanson.</P>
      <P>But the daily has changed its tune, however, as a recent
editorial praised both Howard and opposition leader Kim Beazley,
because "they mounted a joint assault on Hanson's racism."</P>
      <P>"Now that the election is over and Australians have passed their
verdict, we hope that the coalition will pay more attention to the
Asian economic crisis and other regional issues," The Nation said.</P>
      <P>The Asian Wall Street Journal said the election result meant
outsiders would no longer be able to unfairly brand Australia as a
racist country.</P>
      <P>The daily reported Australian diplomats in Asia were relieved
that the rejection of One Nation was widely reported in Malaysia and
the Philippines.</P>
      <P>They believed this would go a long way to dispelling Asian
misconceptions about Australia's attitude toward the region.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC ISSUES POSITION PAPER ON KOO-WANG TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) issued a position paper on Tuesday to woo public support for
the upcoming talks between the top negotiators from the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The position paper outlined the main purposes of Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman C. F. Koo's forthcoming
ice-breaking visit to mainland China and the ROC government's
expectations of the future development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Koo, a veteran business tycoon who concurrently serves as a
senior adviser to President Lee Teng-hui and Taiwan's top negotiator
with Beijing, will visit Shanghai and Beijing from Oct. 14 through
Oct. 19. During his landmark mainland visit, Koo will meet with his
mainland counterpart, Wang Daohan, chairman of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies authorized
by their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in
the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>MAC, which oversees SEF operations, said in its position paper
that it hopes the upcoming Koo-Wang talks will lay a foundation for
the resumption of institutionalized SEF-ARATS dialogue and for the
improvement of cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Koo and Wang met for the first time in Singapore in April 1993 to
lay a framework for regular SEF-ARATS dialogue and consultations.
However, Beijing unilaterally suspended such institutionalized
engagements shortly after President Lee made a landmark visit to the
United States. Beijing interpreted Lee's US trip as a move to
promote Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>The MAC position paper said the upcoming Koo-Wang talks are
expected to pave the way for gradual restoration of the spirit of
previous SEF-ARATS agreements and to lay groundwork for future
cross-strait negotiations.</P>
      <P>The position paper went on to say the ROC government earnestly
hopes that mainland China can forsake its diplomatic suppression
and military intimidation against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Only through these concrete actions can mainland China
substantiate its intentions of improving cross-strait relations
based on the recognition of the reality that the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait are being ruled by two separate political entities.</P>
      <P>"We are also hopeful that following the upcoming Koo-Wang talks,
cross-strait relations will enter a new stage in which the two sides
engage in frank talks and pragmatic exchanges," the position paper
said, adding that the two sides should jointly seek effective ways to
resume institutionalized dialogue and forge peaceful, cooperative
bilateral ties in order to contribute to stability and prosperity in
East Asia.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MAC Chairman Chang King-yuh briefed a group of
lawmakers of different political stripes on the itinerary of Koo's
mainland trip.</P>
      <P>Chang told the legislators from both ruling and opposition
political parties that even though Koo's mainland trip is of great
significance, it is not a very complicated mission.</P>
      <P>"We hope local people will not expect too much and avoid adding
up to Koo's burden," Chang said, adding that the primary goals of
Koo's mainland trip and his talks with Wang are to normalize the
long-stalled SEF-ARATS exchanges and to lay a foundation for
improvement of cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Chang also sought the lawmakers' understanding that the
delegation to accompany Koo on his mainland trip will comprise only
SEF board members and will not include representatives of any
political parties. "The arrangement is mainly to avoid complicating
the matter," he explained.</P>
      <P>According to the schedule unveiled by MAC and SEF, Koo will
leave Taipei for Shanghai via Hong Kong on Oct. 14 and will travel
to Beijing from Shanghai on Oct. 16.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Shanghai, Koo will meet Wang for several
times for wide-ranging talks. While in Beijing, Koo will meet with
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Vice Premier Qian Qichen and
Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State
Council. Koo will also visit Beijing University and meet with Taiwan
business people with interests in mainland China as well as with
Chinese and foreign journalists stationed in Beijing.</P>

      <P>Political parties in Lesotho have
agreed to accept a proposal from the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) on the formation of a transitional structure for a
general election.</P>
      <P>The SADC-proposed committee will comprise one or two members from

      <P>The committee would appoint a new independent electoral
commission to review Lesotho's electoral system.</P>
      <P>The incumbent government will continue to rule until the election

      <P>Lesotho's political situation became chaotic late last month

    <HEADLINE>STEEL BEAM MAKERS ACCUSED OF DUMPING PRODUCTS ON TAIWAN MARKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>South Korea, Poland, Russia were accused
Tuesday of dumping steel H-beams in Taiwan, selling them at
below-market prices, according to sources from the International
Trade Commission (ITC).</P>
      <P>Officials from ITC's Investigation Division said H sections of
iron and non-alloy steel from South Korea, Poland and Russia have
been dumped on Taiwan's market, causing substantive harm to domestic
steel producers.</P>
      <P>The ITC began to investigate the sale of iron and non-alloy steel
H-beams from South Korea, Poland, Russia and Australia in Taiwan
after receiving complaints filed by Tung Ho Steel earlier this year.</P>
      <P>After the investigation, ITC decided to drop Australia from the
list of offenders because the volume exported from that country was
found to be too small to warrant possible retaliatory measures.</P>
      <P>ITC will pass the dumping charges to the Ministry of Finance
(MOF) for recognition. The MOF will then pass the charges to the
Executive Yuan for final approval. If the charges stand, dumping
taxes will be affixed to products from the three countries, ITC
officials noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ITC also accused South Korea and India of dumping
steel wires in Taiwan at below-market prices.</P>
      <P>ITC officials said uncoated stress-relieved steel wires, used in
making pre-pressed concrete, from South Korea and India have been
dumped on Taiwan's market, hurting local producers.</P>
      <P>Similar products from Spain were also under investigation, but
they were dropped from the list of offenders after it was determined
that Spain's export volume to Taiwan was too small to merit inclusion
on the list.</P>
      <P>Steel wires from South Korea and India may be hit with dumping
taxes if the ITC's dumping charges are recognized by the MOF and
approved by the Executive Yuan, ITC officials noted.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The financially troubled U-Land Group
received a new lease of life on Tuesday after two local business
groups confirmed that they will bail the company out of its current
crisis.</P>
      <P>Ever Fortune General Manager Chien Chao-han said his company,
along with the Hong Chung Group, have decided to jointly take over
U-Land's construction division. Each will continue with one of the
two construction projects being carried out by U-Land in central
Changhua County, and U-Land claimed that all its customers' interests
will be fully protected.</P>
      <P>However, Chien added that Ever Fortune is not likely to take
over King Textile Co. and U-Land Airlines, two major U-Land
subsidiaries, because textiles and aviation are beyond the scope of
Ever Fortune's businesses.</P>
      <P>Operations of all U-Land affiliates came to a halt on Friday
after checks totaling about NT$170 million (about US$5 million)
issued by King Textile and the group's construction division bounced.</P>
      <P>The group's financial turmoil was reportedly caused by too-fast
expansion.</P>
      <P>Although the incident raised grave concern among companies
maintaining business links with U-Land, U-Land President Chou Chi-jui
quickly announced last Saturday that the problems were almost
resolved and that the group would fully resume operations on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hong Chung head Lin Hung-chung said his group decided to extend a
helping hand to U-Land out of a sense of social responsibility and
family links. Lin is Chou's uncle.</P>
      <P>Lin expressed the hope that Hong Chung's assistance will help
maintain the livelihoods of all U-Land staff and workers and will
stave off any impact on the country's economic development.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, U-Land Board Chairman Lin Lung-shen apologized for the
damage to society caused by the incident.</P>
      <P>As of Tuesday, operations of U-Land's headquarters in central
Taichung City had returned to normal.</P>
      <P>The group is scheduled to hold a news conference in Taipei on
Wednesday to explain its current financial situation to the public

    <HEADLINE>PRO-DIRECT 'THREE LINKS' ACTIVISTS TO VISIT BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Taiwan activists will leave for
Beijing on Wednesday to push for the opening of direct trade,
transport and communications links across the Taiwan Strait, more
commonly known as the direct "three links."</P>
      <P>Chin Chieh-shou, leader of the group who is also a Taipei County
Council member from the pro-unification New Party, said on Tuesday
that the Beijing visit is mainly aimed at pushing for the inclusion
of the "three links" issue into the agenda for the upcoming
talks between the top negotiators from the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Chin was referring to the planned talks between Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) Chairman C. F. Koo and Wang Daohan, chairman of the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS) scheduled for mid-October. Koo is scheduled to visit
Shanghai and Beijing from Oct. 14 through Oct. 19.</P>
      <P>"We hope the Koo-Wang talks will discuss the 'three links'
issue because we believe that early opening of such links will
benefit Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait," Chin
said.</P>
      <P>The group, composed of a dozen elected representatives and
their aides, will pay visits to mainland China's Ministry of
Communications, the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council and
quasi-official ARATS. Members of the group include National Assembly
Deputy Tsao Yuan-chang, Taipei City Councilor Lee Cheng-lung, and
Hsinchu County Councilor Kuo Yuan-chang.</P>
      <P>Chin said his group most looks forward to seeing direct
cross-strait transport links become a reality in a gradual manner.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage, Chin said he hopes scheulded direct
ferrying services can be opened between Taiwan-held defense outpost
of Kinmen and Xiamen, a port city in the southeastern mainland
province of Fujian.</P>
      <P>In the second stage, Chin proposed that Taiwan's merchant
vessels and passenger planes be allowed to sail or fly to Xiamen via
Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Chin also proposed that Taiwan's merchant ships and commercial
airliners be allowed to sail or fly to mainland China's inland
destinations via Xiamen in the third stage and that full-fledged
direct cross-strait transport links be opened in the final stage.</P>
      <P>To highlight its cause, Chin said, his group may return to
Taiwan via a fishing boat sailing directly from Xiamen to a Taiwan
port. Chin would not divulge the Taiwan port that the group may land
on its return voyage.</P>
      <P>Chin and several other members of the group have been indicted
on charges of violating the National Security Law for sailing
directly from Taipei County's Shenao fishing port to Xiamen on Aug.

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Tuesday had high
praise for Taiwan's economy for remaining largely unscathed by Asia's
economic woes.</P>
      <P>During a brief meeting with former US Defense Secretary Casper
Weinberger, Lee said Taiwan's economic growth this year and next year
will definitely be much better than a recent International Monetary
Fund (IMF) forecast.</P>
      <P>Lee told Weinberger that Taiwan's economy, which is fundamentally
healthy, is expected to grow steadily in the coming years because of
the timely implementation of a government-directed domestic demand
expansion package this year.</P>
      <P>The president attributed Taiwan's ability to stand tall against
the Asian economic turmoil to its low foreign debt, and the
burgeoning democracy which has helped make government policy more
transparent.</P>
      <P>Weinberger, now chairman of Forbes magazine, expressed his
admiration for Taiwan's political and economic achievements,
particularly at a time when the entire Asian region is embroiled in
the regional economic meltdown.</P>
      <P>Forbes, an economic and financial bi-monthly with a circulation
of 755,000, has been rated one of the top five magazines in the
United States.</P>
      <P>Weinberger, a long-time staunch supporter of the Republic of
China, was defense secretary during the Reagan Administration. He was
also chairman of the USA-ROC (Taiwan) Business Council between 1991
and 1994.</P>
      <P>He wrote a number of articles in 1996 urging the US government
not to sit idly by as Beijing staged provocative moves against Taiwan
during that year when it conducted missile tests and live-ammunition
war games in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In an article carried in Forbes' July issue this year, he also
criticized US President Bill Clinton for "selling out" Taiwan. He
said Clinton's remarks on the "three noes" during his mainland China
trip seriously twisted the spirit of the Taiwan Relations Act and
have gravely violated Taiwan's interests.</P>
      <P>Weinberger is making his second visit to Taiwan this year. His

      <P>Republic of China Premier Vincent Siew said
on Tuesday that his government has worked out a multifaceted policy
to maintain Taiwan's economic growth.</P>
      <P>The three major objectives of this policy, he said, are to keep
the growth rate this year at 5.3 percent, to upgrade high-tech levels
and protect the environment, and to strengthen international
cooperation.</P>
      <P>Siew spelt out the policy in an address to the 32nd annual
conference of the International Iron and Steel Institute (IISI) at
the Taipei International Conference Hall.</P>
      <P>The three-day meeting opened on Monday with the participation of
delegates from 53 member countries and more than 200 steel companies,
steel associations and related research institutions.</P>
      <P>In his address, titled "The Development and Prospects of the
Republic of China," the premier said that in spite of the Asian
financial crisis, "many of our economic indices have remained
stable."</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan has not experienced the severe economic

      <P>In order to minimize the negative effects from the worldwide
economic slowdown on Taiwan's export drive and domestic economy, Siew
noted, the government has worked out a program for domestic demand
expansion.</P>
      <P>This program is designed to stimulate domestic investment and
assure continued growth, with the focus on increasing both public and
private investment.</P>
      <P>The premier said the government will expand the national budget
by allocating an additional NT$67.1 billion (US$2 billion) for fiscal
1999 and an estimated NT$57.2 billion (US$1.7 billion) for fiscal
2000.</P>
      <P>To ensure the smooth implementation of this program, Siew said
the government will strive to maintain financial stability, eliminate
obstacles to investment, and speed up the revision of related laws
and regulations.</P>
      <P>On improving levels of high-technology, the premier said that a
"technology nation implementation program" has been put into effect
for the new millennium, under which Taiwan's technology budget will
be maintained at no less than 10 percent, so that by 2000, national
spending on R&amp;D and investment in manpower will reach levels
comparable with those of most advanced countries.</P>
      <P>Siew told the gathering that as the world's 14th-largest trading
nation, the ROC seeks accession into the World Trade Organization
(WTO) to ensure long-term development and to increase the process of
liberalization and globalization.</P>
      <P>He said the ROC will continue to seek close cooperation with all
nations and to contribute to the world community. A successful
example is the establishment of the International Cooperation and
Development Fund that had seen commitments totaling US$377.4 million
by June this year.</P>
      <P>The premier pledged that Taiwan will actively engage with nations
through pragmatic diplomacy, and will work with the private sector to
develop "economic strategic partnerships" with friendly countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER TOUTS TAIWAN'S CORRECT RESPONSE TO ASIAN CRISIS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's appropriate response to the Asian
crisis has been vindicated by the relatively slight impact on its
economy amid the regional turmoil, Premier Vincent Siew said on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside legislators' requests to comment on international
financier George Soros' predication that Taiwan's economy is not yet
"out of the woods," Siew said at the Legislative Yuan that expanding
domestic demand to stimulate economic growth is a time-tested
prescription recommended by many economic powers for getting out of
economic difficulties, and that it will also work for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Dynamic domestic demand is the recipe worked out at meetings of
finance ministers of the seven industrialized countries and the
International Monetary Fund for containing the Asian crisis, and
Taiwan has won applause for holding its own in the crisis, said Siew.</P>
      <P>"Although we are not complacent with our performance, we will not
deign to rebut Soros' point of view on Taiwan," Siew said.</P>
      <P>Sharing Siew's opinion, P.K. Chiang, chairman of the Council for
Economic Planning and Development, assured the legislature that the
crisis has already run its course and that recovery is around the
corner. He said the economic forecast for next year is hopeful.</P>
      <P>Regarding Soros' view that instead of lowering interest rates,
which might not be effective in staving off recession, the
crisis-ravaged Asian countries should stimulate economic growth,
Chiang pointed out that this is exactly the course followed by Japan,
Thailand, and South Korea, especially Japan, which has earmarked 10
trillion yen for public projects as a way of enlarging domestic
demand.</P>
      <P>Given that trade with Asian states accounts for almost half of
Taiwan's foreign trade, Chiang said the island can hardly isolate
itself from the turmoil gripping its Asian neighbors.</P>
      <P>He predicted that those countries will not recover from the
disaster for one or two years, and said that Taiwan cannot rely on
their markets to fuel its own economy. In addition, the vital role
played by the psychological element in economic growth necessitates
investment at home to revive confidence in the economy as a way of
overcoming the crisis.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The people and government of the Republic of
China on Taiwan are sparing no effort to sharpen the country's
competitiveness, President Lee Teng-hui said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee was attending the opening of the World Hakka Association's
14th annual meeting in Taipei, where he outlined Taiwan's national
construction and development, categorizing them into four areas.</P>
      <P>The island is devoted to the promotion of political democracy,
Lee said, pointing out that since the lifting of martial law 10 years
ago, the country has opened up for parties and mass media outlets
with different political opinions, the legislature has been reformed,
and the first direct presidential election has taken place.</P>
      <P>With last year's constitutional reforms, the ROC became a member
of the world's democratic community, Lee said, adding that the status
will help Taiwan's efforts in globalization.</P>
      <P>The country has never stopped in its efforts to maintain stable
economic growth. The president introduced the ROC government's
current efforts to build the island into an Asia-Pacific operations
center, and said that although the Asian financial crisis has
seriously damaged the region's economic development, it has not
harmed Taiwan, because of its solid economic fundamentals.</P>
      <P>Lee said his government has taken measures to expand the island's
foreign trade and domestic demands, and added that he believes the
efforts will help Taiwan avoid the regional economic recession and
gain new opportunities for further economic development.</P>
      <P>The ROC has been fighting for its position and national dignity
in the international community, Lee told the meeting, adding that
through the promotion of pragmatic relationships with foreign
countries and bids for membership in international organizations, the
whole world will know of the ROC's existence.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei has also never rested in work aimed at keeping
the country safe, Lee said, citing the consistent upgrading of
national defense systems.</P>
      <P>Lee also talked about the pragmatic and flexible mainland China
policy, which helps the promotion of cross-strait exchanges and the
maintenance of the stability of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan scholar on Tuesday suggested that
Taiwan take the initiative to set up a regional stability fund with
mainland China to help financially stricken Southeast Asian
countries.</P>
      <P>Chu Yun-peng, director of the Institute of Social Sciences under
Academia Sinica, made the proposals at a symposium on mainland
China's economic development and its effect on cross-strait trade and
Taiwan's investment on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Koo Chen-fu, chairman of Taipei's Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), will resume talks next week with his
mainland Chinese counterpart, Wang Daohan of the Association of
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, Chu said the two sides should use
the opportunity to discuss how to cooperate to help Southeast Asian
countries ride out their difficulties.</P>
      <P>He said officials from the World Bank recently visited Taiwan and
mainland China, and advocated the idea of discussing the
establishment of an "Asian regional cooperation fund" during the
Koo-Wang talks.</P>
      <P>Chu also suggested bringing this issue before the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.</P>
      <P>Fu Feng-cheng, a researcher with the Chung-Hua Institute for
Economic Research, agreed that it is important for Taiwan and
mainland China to cooperate to extend aid to Southeast Asian
countries.</P>
      <P>But he said he did not think Beijing would agree to raising the
issue with APEC because of the "one China" problem. Instead, he
proposed that Taipei take five steps to promote relations with
mainland China:</P>
      <P>-- Take advantage of the establishment of special economic and
trade zones to make preparations for gradual realization of
cross-strait direct links;</P>
      <P>-- Upon entry into the World Trade Organization, let Taiwan
announce a policy of not using its exclusion clause against the
mainland;</P>
      <P>-- Invite Wang Daohan to visit Taiwan via a direct flight from
Shanghai;</P>
      <P>-- Support the use of domestic laws for Taiwan businessmen as a
way of protecting their investments on the mainland; and</P>
      <P>-- Strengthen cross-strait cooperation in science and technology,
with a joint development of auto engines as the start, and the
manufacture of a national car as the goal.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's private investments will grow by a
five-year high of 19.7 percent in 1998, Economic Affairs Minister
Wang Chih-kang said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang, who was speaking at a regular meeting of the ruling
Kuomintang's Central Standing Committee, cited a report in the most
recent issue of Newsweek magazine stating that Taiwan's economy
remains stable amid a global downturn under the capable leadership of
President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Based on estimates made by the Cabinet-level Directorate General
of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, the economics minister said
Taiwan's economy would post the largest growth of 5.3 percent among
the four Asian dragons for the whole of 1998. Singapore will register
zero growth, while Hong Kong and South Korea will post negative
growth of 4 percent and 7 percent respectively.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has weathered the Asian financial turmoil, Wang
stressed that the government is poised to take concrete measures to
counter a global economic recession such as boosting consumer demand,
developing new high-tech industries, strengthening the small business
sector, as well as exploring international markets and cooperative
ventures.</P>
      <P>In the face of keen competition from other emerging countries,
Wang said Taiwan must further diversify its high-tech sector into
aviation, biochemical, optical electricity, and precision machinery
as the island already enjoys an advantage in the information,
electronics and telecommunications industries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE-BURMESE URGE TAIPEI TO IMPROVE ID SERVICES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of ethnic Chinese from Burma on
Wednesday urged the Republic of China to improve services for
Chinese-Burmese who intend to visit Taiwan or obtain ROC citizenship.</P>
      <P>The Chinese-Burmese representatives, accompanied by Kuomintang
Legislator Han Kuo-yu, called at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) to describe the plight of ethnic Chinese in Burma when they
try to obtain a document proving their overseas Chinese status from
the ROC government.</P>
      <P>The representatives told Chu Chien-yi, director-general of MOFA's
Bureau of Consular Affairs, that since Taipei maintains no liaison
offices in Burma, the Chinese-Burmese must travel to Rangoon then to
Bangkok in Thailand to apply at the ROC representative office for an
ROC identification document.</P>
      <P>This entire process takes up much time, effort and money. The
cost of all this traveling for an average Chinese-Burmese is beyond
imagination, said Huang Tung-yi, deputy chairman of the Association
of Overseas Chinese from Burma.</P>
      <P>In response, Chu said Burma's closeness to mainland China makes
it extremely difficult to establish an ROC representative office in
Rangoon without provoking Beijing.</P>
      <P>Rangoon refuses to allow a proposed Taiwan representative office
to carry the name "Republic of China." It also disagrees to an office
with "Taipei" in the name, Chu noted.</P>
      <P>Rangoon also not permits a Taiwan office to perform basic
functions such as issuing visas, passports and related documents, he
added.</P>
      <P>Huang, in turn, suggested that MOFA regularly dispatch consular
affairs officials from Bangkok to Burmese cities to collect
application forms from potential applicants since Taipei cannot open
an office in Burma.</P>
      <P>Chu promised that he will ensure that Huang's suggestion will be
assessed by relevant MOFA officials.</P>
      <P>The number of ethnic Chinese in Burma is roughly estimated at 3
million. Many of them are offspring of former Kuomintang military
officers and soldiers who fled to the mountains near the Thai-Burmese
border after the Chinese communists took over the mainland in 1949.
Most members of the KMT's armed forces moved to Taiwan with the
central government.</P>

      <P>Air pollution and global warming have
claimed about 16,000 deaths in Canada annually, a study commissioned
by the David Suzuki Foundation said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>These deaths are "directly attributable to the burning of fossil

      <P>It is the first study to definitively show the health effects of

      <P>The study, titled "Taking our Breath Away," said between 1980 and
1989, 28 percent more boys and 18 percent more girls were
hospitalized because of asthma. Air pollution can cause asthma or
make it more severe. It can also make breathing more difficult and
lead to cardiac arrest.</P>
      <P>About 8 percent of non-accidental deaths in Canada are somehow

      <P>Aimee Butler, the Australian girl who came
to Taiwan on Sept. 28 to be reunited with her biological mother, is
scheduled to return home on Wednesday evening, now that she has met
both her birth parents.</P>
      <P>Butler, who today is a happy teenager, and an accomplished
violinist, pianist and singer, was sold to an Australian couple 18
years ago by a Taiwan baby-selling ring.</P>
      <P>Butler was born out of wedlock in Miaoli, some 60 kilometers
south of Taipei, in 1980, according to her birth mother Yen Kan, who
said that Aimee also had a twin sister who died shortly after birth.</P>
      <P>As the girl's father showed no intention of marrying Yen or
assuming the responsibility of raising the baby, Yen said that poor
health and a lack of finances forced her to sell her child for about
NT$10,000 (US$300).</P>
      <P>Yen, who almost immediately regretted the sale, said she was
given a few photos of Aimee and her new Australian parents, but had
had no opportunity until recently of contacting the child and her
adoptive parents.</P>
      <P>Yen said the story of Kartya Wunderle, another Australian who
returned to Taiwan last June to find her biological mother and
succeeded in her attempt, gave her renewed hope of finding her own
daughter.</P>
      <P>At a pre-departure press conference, Butler said she has also met
with her biological father, who declined to be identified in order to
avoid embarrassing Yen Kan and his own family. He is now married with
a family of his own. Butler said she fully understands her birth
father's situation and said she had no intention of disrupting his
family.</P>
      <P>At the press conference, a tearful Yen Kan repeated her heartfelt
gratitude to Aimee's adoptive parents, who have raised her daughter
into a healthy, lovely, and well-educated teenager.</P>
      <P>Yen said words cannot not describe her gratitude for the Butlers.
She said she did not want Aimee to stay with her in Taiwan or disturb
Aimee's life, and added that she would be the happiest woman in the
world if Aimee would visit her sometimes in the future.</P>
      <P>Wunderle, 17, stayed in Taipei after finding her biological
mother. She is working at a McDonalds restaurant, but aspires to be a

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's children are suffering again as a
result of the failure to eliminate the virulent enterovirus epidemic
which swept the island this summer.</P>
      <P>Over 60 children islandwide were killed by the virus during the
April to July period, after which the health authority believed the
virus was under control.</P>
      <P>However, since September, when the island started experiencing
cooler autumn weather, eight children have so far been reported as
having died from diseases allegedly caused by the enterovirus, which
had been believed to be active only in warm environments, according
to Department of Health (DOH) statistics.</P>
      <P>The sudden resurgence of the infection forced the DOH on Sunday
to resume its daily reports on the epidemic which threatens the lives
of the island's children.</P>
      <P>During the recent Mid-Autumn Festival weekend, a total of 761
patients suspected of having contracted the enterovirus were
reported, 46 of whom were admitted to hospital, according to Hsu
Kuo-hsiung, acting director of the department of communicable disease
control under the DOH.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, the first working day after the holiday, 23 more
children were admitted to hospital. They were among the approximately
300 people around the island who visited a doctor that day due to
illness allegedly caused by the virus, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>The latest outbreak is now centered in the southern part of
Taiwan, Hsu said, adding that there is no sign of cross-infection by
diseases caused by different types of enterovirus.</P>
      <P>The type 71 enterovirus is blamed for the current epidemic, based
on analyses by the Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, National

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chief statistician at the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) said on Wednesday that the island's
manufacturing sector is expected to recover its vitality next
October, when the Sixth Naphtha Cracking plant begins operating.</P>
      <P>Chang Yao-tsung made the prediction while announcing statistics
on the island's manufacturing output during the first nine months of
the year.</P>
      <P>The MOFA figures show that manufacturing production during the
January-September period rose 4.12 percent compared with the same
period of 1997, while an 8 percent annual rise was posted in 1997
from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>An overall economic recession caused by the year-long Asian
financial meltdown is to blame for the decline, Chang said.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Beijing-based private intellectual group
issued a statement on Wednesday urging Taiwan and mainland China to
jointly establish a "Chinese confederation."</P>
      <P>In the statement made public by the Hong Kong-based China Human
Rights Information Center, the "Association for China Development,"
composed of more than 3,000 intellectuals from Beijing, proposed that
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait set up a loose confederation as
two political entities on an equal footing.</P>
      <P>The association also urged the Beijing authorities to put forward
the idea at the upcoming meeting between the top negotiators of the
two sides. Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), and Wang Daohan, chairman of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), are
scheduled to meet in Beijing on Oct. 18.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are quasi-official organizations authorized by
Taipei and Beijing, respectively, to deal with cross-strait dealings
in the absence of official contacts.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and mainland China should resolve their unification
problem by setting up a loose confederation or implementing a "one
country, three systems" scheme, the association said, adding that
under the scheme, both sides would be entitled to their own
independent judicial, administrative, armed forces, and foreign
affairs systems.</P>
      <P>It suggested that the confederation should have a 50-year
framework, after which time a public referendum could be held so that
the people of both sides could decide their future.</P>
      <P>The statement suggested that the Taiwan authorities and political
parties respond to the association's call, and urged the
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party to adjust the course of
its policy. It also said that the United States should use its
influence to push for a summit meeting between the leaders on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait to discuss the possibility of a Chinese
confederation.</P>

    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Oct. 6 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The UK faces the risk of a new health scare
after a BSE expert said the mad cow disease could be present in
sheep, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"There is a distinct possibility that BSE (mad cow disease) is
out there in the sheep population," Professor Geoffrey Almond,
chairman of the sheep sub-committee of the Spongiform Encephalopathy
Advisory Committee, was quoted as saying. The committee is the BSE
watchdog in Britain.</P>
      <P>Only nine million of Britain's 42 million sheep have been tested
for BSE, Almond said. None were infected but the number of tests was
far too small to rule out the possibility that BSE had "gone back
into sheep from cows".</P>
      <P>UK sheep were fed BSE-contaminated meat and bone meal until a ban
was imposed in 1988.</P>
      <P>Experiments show that sheep fed with infected cattle brain can
contract BSE but it is not known whether this has occurred naturally.
Scrapie, a related disease, has been present in sheep for 200 years,
apparently without infecting people, but spreads more easily between
species.</P>
      <P>Almond urged the UK government to step up its research into
sheep. The British agriculture ministry said tests were expensive,
time-consuming and it was hard to distinguish BSE from scrapie.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The new headquarters of the ruling
Kuomintang was inaugurated on Wednesday amid boisterous protests from
different political groups.</P>
      <P>The KMT hosted a cocktail reception to celebrate the inauguration
of its brand-new, gleaming 12-story building, drawing a large crowd
of well-wishers.</P>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui, who concurrently serves as KMT chairman,
said on the occasion that he hopes the opening of the new building
will usher in a "new spring" for the 104-year-old party.</P>
      <P>"While the KMT is willing to engage in fair competition with
other political parties on an equal footing, we also earnestly hope
that members of the general public will side with us and use their
votes to support our cause," Lee said.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General John Chang said he was delighted to see the
inauguration of the KMT headquarters building before this year's
Double Ten National Day.</P>
      <P>"This symbolizes that the destiny of the KMT is closely
associated with that of the Republic of China," Chang noted.</P>
      <P>Following a traditional Chinese practice, Lee and four KMT vice
chairmen -- Lien Chan, Li Yuan-zu, Yu Kuo-hwa and Chiu Chuang-huan --
joined with staff members in making sweet rice dumplings to ward off
evil spirits and usher in good luck.</P>
      <P>Traditional Chinese lion dances, gong and drum performances, and
many other exciting events were also staged to mark the occasion,
adding much fanfare and a festive atmosphere to the building.</P>
      <P>The party's candidates for the year-end Taipei and Kaohsiung
mayoral elections -- Ma Ying-jeou and Wu Tun-yi -- were also present
at the reception to consolidate intraparty support for their
electoral bids.</P>
      <P>Outside the building, however, a number of opposition politicians
and activists staged protests against what they called the ruling
party's violations of construction regulations in building its new
headquarters.</P>
      <P>The protesters included Kao Cheng-yen, convener of the Green
Party of Taiwan; New Party Legislator Chu Hui-liang; New Party Taiwan
Provincial Assembly Deputy Yang Chen-hsiung; Hsu Jung-chi, head of
the Voice of Taiwan Broadcasting Co.; and several Taiwan Independence
Party heavyweights.</P>
      <P>The KMT obtained a permit to construct the new building when the
Taipei City Government was headed by Huang Ta-chou, a KMT stalwart.
However, by the time it had been completed in January 1997, the city
government had been taken over by Chen Shui-bian of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Under Chen's hand, the city government declined to issue an
operating permit, on the grounds that as the building occupied 6,021
square meters of land, it should have passed an environmental impact
evaluation before construction began.</P>
      <P>The resulting impasse resulted in political wrangling which
lasted for more than a year before permission was finally granted
in May this year to open the building.</P>
      <P>The city government agreed to issue the permit only after the
KMT scrapped its ownership of 26 sq. meters of the land on which the
new building is situated to meet the requirements of the current
construction law.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States is expected to impose
protectionist measures on foreign trade, Taiwan's Board of Foreign
Trade director-general warned on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>If the move takes place, it will be in the hope of easing
America's increasing trade deficits resulting from the greenback's
overwhelming strength against most Asian currencies, Chen Ruey-long
said.</P>
      <P>Chen stated that US consuming power has greatly accelerated due
to the US dollar's appreciation following the outbreak of the Asian
financial crisis last July.</P>
      <P>Eyeing this large consumer market, Asian traders, including those
from Taiwan, have gone full strength on their promotion of exports to
the United States over the past year, Chen said, adding that
Washington expects its trade deficits will surge to a historic high
this year.</P>
      <P>He put forward his analysis at a business conference attended by
more than 100 representatives of local businesses.</P>
      <P>The economics official told the participants that the fact that a
number of American businesses have accused Taiwan firms of dumping
over the past year raises the prospect of Washington taking more
radical measures to protect US traders.</P>
      <P>The United States is Taiwan's largest trade partner.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   7   (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's labor shortage in the
non-agricultural sector lessened between January and July due to the
economic slowdown, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The labor shortage in the non-agricultural sector as a whole in
the first seven months of this year decreased 0.4 percent to 196,000
people, said the DGBAS in its general report, adding however that the
shortage in the service sector increased 5.1 percent to 82,000
people.</P>
      <P>When broken down further according to individual sectors, the
report showed a labor shortage decline of 4.3 percent, or 98,000
people, in the manufacturing sector, and a decline of 2.5 percent, or
50,000 people, in the construction sector.</P>
      <P>The increased shortage in the service sector was attributed to
the fact that this sector is closely related to domestic demand,
which has been targeted by the government for expansion. In this
sector, the report pointed out, the financial, insurance, and real
estate sectors have suffered the most serious escalation of personnel
shortages, at 15.6 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to figures released by the government's
employment guidance services, registered job seekers increased by 1.2
percent, or 17,000 people, in August 1998, while job vacancies
decreased by 3.2 percent, or a reduction of 38,000 positions.</P>
      <P>This development shows that there are now reduced options for
those seeking a job, the DGBAS report commented.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMICS MINISTER STRESSES NEED FOR INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The changing economic situation shows the
need for the nation to promote private investment and increase
international cooperation to maintain competitiveness, Economic
Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks in a report on how to sustain international
competitiveness amid the changing world economic situation delivered
at a regular meeting of the Central Standing Committee of the ruling
Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>He said that several factors are emerging regarding the world
economy, including the knowledge that the world economy is not going
to rebound in the short term, that the competitive edges of emerging
market economies are changing, and that a form of neo-conservatism is
beginning to emerge.</P>
      <P>The minister noted that in the last three years, the trend toward
mergers has increased dramatically. In 1997, the value of
acquisitions totaled US$242.8 billion, up 25 percent from 1996.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the financial situations of many corporations have
deteriorated this year in the wake of the Asian financial storm,
which has triggered more mergers, and has created more and more
widely diversified conglomerates.</P>
      <P>He also said that the competitiveness of emerging economies will
decrease because of the financial storm, mainly because the dramatic
drop in a nation's currency will alter the competitiveness of its
products, and make it harder for emerging markets to attract
long-term stable capital.</P>
      <P>Wang went on to say that the rapid spread of the financial crisis
has been attributed to capital flow running out of control. For this
reason, he noted, a new conservatism is in the offing, and nations
will have to find management systems that will suit their own
interests and economic conditions.</P>
      <P>As the world economy is still enduring a downturn, continued
expansion of domestic demand is one way of ensuring economic growth,
he said, adding that the expansion of private investment will be the
prime mover behind the expansion of domestic demand.</P>
      <P>Wang said that as the map of the competitiveness of emerging
countries is changing, Taiwan must develop its technology-oriented
economy, make its industrial infrastructure more healthy, and ensure
a strong small- and medium-sized industry sector.</P>
      <P>In view of the increasing number of international conglomerates,
Wang also noted that domestic manufacturers will have to upgrade
export competitiveness, establish international cooperation channels,
and step up trade offensives into international markets.</P>

      <P>Kuomintang Secretary-General John Chang
confirmed on Wednesday that former New Party Legislator Tsai
Chen-yang will return to the KMT, adding that more superior and
refined talents are welcome to join the ruling party.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks after a tea party in celebration of the
inauguration of the KMT Central Committee's new headquarters.</P>
      <P>He said that some people have criticized the KMT for "boastful
talk" about NP lawmakers possibly returning to the ruling party.
Tsai's decision, however, has demonstrated that the KMT was not
boasting, as has a similar move made by NP Legislator Huang
Kuo-chung, he said. The KMT does not want to draw too much attention
to the matter, so as not to embarrass other political parties, he
added.</P>
      <P>Tsai said his decision to return to the KMT was based on special
circumstances and had nothing to do with the New Party. He said he
wished his former NP colleagues well.</P>
      <P>Three years ago Tsai, then a KMT member, switched allegiance to
the NP, joining the party because of its ideals and clean image.
Difficulties later erupted, however, between Tsai and fellow NP
members. As a result, he said, it became difficult for him to fulfill
his party obligations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARGENTINE PEOPLE SUPPORT ROC'S UN BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Asuncion,  Oct.  6  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Many Argentine people have recently
telephoned the Republic of China's representative office in Buenos
Aires to express their support for the ROC's bid to rejoin the
United Nations.</P>
      <P>An ROC diplomat stationed in Argentina told CNA on Tuesday that
the ROC representative office began receiving such phone calls after
a major Argentine daily, La Nacion, published a letter from one of
its readers criticizing the Argentine government for its opposition
to the ROC's UN bid.</P>
      <P>Norberto Alfredo Marino said in his letter to the paper that he
felt regret that the Argentine ambassador to the United Nations
opposed the inclusion of a pro-ROC UN bid motion into the agenda for
the ongoing 53rd General Assembly plenary session.</P>
      <P>"I simply couldn't understand why the Argentine government gave
up its basic principle and ignored international justice to join the
anti-ROC camp," Marino said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the ROC already came into being in 1912.
"Although the ROC moved its seat to Taiwan in 1949 after the Chinese
mainland lost to communist hands, it has continued to exist as an
independent sovereign state."</P>
      <P>Over the past five decades, Marino said, the ROC has grown
into the world's 14th largest trading nation, seventh largest
overseas investor, 16th most competitive economy and seventh
strongest technological power.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Marino said, cultural and commercial exchanges between
the ROC and Argentina have continued to increase in recent years.
"The two countries have recently reached an agreement allowing
Argentine beef and fruits to enter the Taiwan market."</P>
      <P>In addition, Marino said, many Taiwan investors have traveled to
Argentina to seek business and investment opportunities. On the
other hand, he said, Argentine enterprises have also launched
promotional efforts to tap into the Taiwan market.</P>
      <P>Marino went on to say that the ROC government and people have
repeatedly expressed their common aspiration for joining the United
Nations and their willingness to faithfully fulfill obligations as a
member of the international community.</P>
      <P>"There is no sign that the ROC's UN bid is designed to challenge
any existing UN member," Marino said, adding that the 21.8 million
people of Taiwan have been discriminated in the international
society and their legitimate rights lack legal protection because of
a lack of representation in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Even though Argentina recognizes Beijing and shares important
economic interests with it, the Argentine government should not have
voiced opposition to the ROC's UN bid simply for pleasing the
communist Chinese government in Beijing, which has often come under
fire for its human rights violations.</P>
      <P>Since Marino's letter was published last week, the ROC
representative office has received a large number of phone calls
from members of the Argentine public throwing their support behind
the ROC's UN bid.</P>
      <P>Fifteen of the ROC's diplomatic allies jointly presented a
motion to the UN Secretariat in July asking the UN to re-examine its
1971 Resolution No. 2758, which expelled the ROC to make way for
mainland China.</P>
      <P>The UN Steering Committee rejected in September the inclusion of
the motion into this year's General Assembly agenda.</P>
      <P>This was the sixth consecutive year that the ROC had spearheaded
its UN campaign through its diplomatic allies. Even though the bid,
like previous ones, failed to make the annual General Assembly
agenda, the ROC government has vowed to continue the annual campaign
to enlist global support for its cause.</P>

Wednesday to announce the establishment of a venture capital company
in Tokyo.</P>
      <P>The new company, called CDM, was formed on July 28 of this year
with a total capital of 495 million yen (US$3.73 million). Sixty
percent of the capital was from CDC and 40 percent from Mitsubishi

      <P>This is the first time an investment and trust company from
Taiwan has joined hands with a major Japanese trading house to
explore the venture capital market in Japan.</P>
      <P>CDC Chairman Liu Tai-ying told the media that in addition to the
general venture capital business in Japan, the new company will also
strive to promote technology transfers into Taiwan from Japan.</P>
      <P>Matsuhiko Kojima, executive director of Mitsubishi Shoji, said
that Taiwan has been active in the development of some high
technology sectors, such as the semiconductor industry.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's dynamism would be helpful to Japanese industries
now that Japan's economy has entered a deep recession.</P>
      <P>Kojima said that in the past two years, Mitsubishi Shoji and CDC

Economic Ministers' Meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations being held in Manila, and also stressed the need for first
world countries to assist the countries that have been badly hit by
the Asian financial crisis.</P>
      <P>In issuing the call to the United States, Estrada also said that
the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank play very crucial roles
in containing the crisis and in restoring the economic health of the
countries most severely affected.</P>
      <P>However, he pointed out that "it is now clear that the resources
of these institutions, particularly the IMF, are frighteningly
insufficient."</P>
      <P>"It is our hope that the countries which are in a position to do
so, especially the United States, will soon make available their
share in the capitalization of the IMF and lend support for
increasing funds of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank,"
he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>UK AGENCIES SET UP ALLIANCE TO ATTRACT TAIWAN INVESTORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>UK development agencies London First Center
(LFC) and Northern Development Company (NDC) have formed an alliance
to attract more investment from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At an event marking the launch in Taipei Wednesday, Stephen
O'Brien, chief executive of London First Center, said that the
alliance was driven by the aim "to present a unique business
opportunity to Taiwanese companies who are seeking to establish a
full presence in Europe, but for whom a single investment location
may not offer all that they seek."</P>
      <P>William Tang, director of the LFC/NDC Joint Taiwan Office, said
the office seeks to serve the needs of a growing community of
Taiwanese investors in the United Kingdom, particularly from the
electronic components and financial sectors, and the information
manufacturing industry.</P>
      <P>Tang noted that London is the financial hub of Europe with 561
global financial institutions setting up branches in the city. London
will be the first choice of Taiwan financial institutions wanting to
set up overseas branches in Europe, he said.</P>
      <P>The British Trade and Cultural Office in Taipei estimated that 85
Taiwan manufacturers' investments in Europe have converged in
Britain. Taiwan manufacturers' investments in northern England
include A.D. I., Kinpo Electronics, and China Synthetic Rubber, while
there are 91 companies investing in Britain, of which 53 are in the
information and electronics industry.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S FIRST SATELLITE TO BE SHIPPED TO FLORIDA FOR LAUNCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's first satellite, ROCSAT-1, having
already undergone the testing of its scientific instruments, is
scheduled to be transported to Florida later this month for launch,
possibly in January, said the National Space Program Office (NSPO) on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Instrument testing began in June 1997 after the satellite's main
body was transported to Taiwan by its US manufacturer, the TRW Space
&amp; Electronics Group. The testing is the most demanding part of the
assembly process, and its completion marks a milestone in the
development of Taiwan's satellite program, said Chu Fei-hung, general
director of the program.</P>
      <P>Noting that TRW and Canadian consultant TELESAT had forecast that
the satellite might not be ready for launch until April or May of
1999, Chu said the team managed to beat that forecast by finishing
the installation and fine-tuning of equipment ahead of schedule.</P>
      <P>TRW and TELESAT based their estimate on the fact that Taiwan has
no experience in conducting such a test and on the expectation that
it would take at least one year for a new laboratory in Taiwan, with
a price tag of NT$600 million to NT$700 million, to be able to carry
out such complicated experiments.</P>
      <P>The testing would have been completed sooner had the
manufacturers not tried to shift responsibility for manufacturing
defects and dragged their feet in addressing them, said Chu at a
press conference called to announce the test's completion.</P>
      <P>The satellite features five vital components that were Taiwan
made. Chu lauded the manufacturers' ability to meet the NSPO's
requirements, even though all were rookies in the field.</P>
      <P>Once launched, ROCSAT-1, which will carry three pieces of
scientific equipment, will orbit the earth 14.9 times a day at an
altitude of 600 kilometers and an inclination of 35 degrees, said
Chu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE SAYS FEASIBILITY OF TAX CUT QUITE LOW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui, who is concurrently
chairman of the ruling Kuomintang, said on Wednesday the feasibility
of a massive tax reduction plan, as submitted by an opposition party
to help stimulate the domestic economy, is quite low.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks after hearing a report on the global
economic and trade situation from Minister of Economic Affairs Wang
Chih-kang, at the KMT's Central Standing Committee meeting.</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman said that affected by international financial
turmoil, the economies of both mainland China and Hong Kong have
continued to deteriorate. He urged Taiwanese investors in those areas
to pay more attention to financial structures and to be mindful of
the inventories of their companies' Taiwan headquarters.</P>
      <P>In regard to international economics experts and institutions
that have warned Taiwan about its economic development, Lee
instructed the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Finance
and the Cabinet level-Council for Economic Planning and Development
to coordinate closely and to come up with measures to cope with the
situation.</P>
      <P>According to news reports, George Soros, the famed hedge fund
manager, said on Oct. 5 in Washington that while the worst of the
Asian crisis may be over, Taiwan's economy may worsen before it gets
better.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the two-year NT$200 billion tax-cut program
proposed by an opposition party, Lee said that there are three main
factors that affect economic development: investment, exports and
increases in consumption. He added that boosting investment and
exports, as well as enlarging domestic demand, is quite important in
stabilizing the national economy, making the feasibility of tax cut
quite low.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Finance Minister Paul Chiu said there is no room for a
tax reduction.</P>
      <P>In response to questioning by KMT Legislator from Tainan County
Hung Yu-chin at the Legislative Yuan, Chiu said Taiwan's taxes
amounted to only 16 percent of its gross national product (GNP), a
lower percentage than those of European countries, the United States
and Japan. Total tax revenue in those countries amounts to between 18
percent and 31 percent of their respective GNPs.</P>
      <P>Chiu pointed out that at present the government already has tax
reduction measures, such as the two-in-one tax system, and
regulations governing the promotion of small- and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs). He added that such measures have helped SMEs
reduce their taxes and that there is no additional room for further
reductions.</P>
      <P>According to Chiu, any revision in the tax system must take into
consideration the health of the national financial structure as a
whole. Otherwise, he added, it will create confusion in the tax
system.</P>

Chen-fu, who will visit mainland China from Oct. 14 to 19.</P>
      <P>According to the schedule, Koo and his entourage will leave

Shanghai at 3:25 p.m.</P>
      <P>He is slated to head for Beijing from Shanghai on Oct. 16 on an

    <HEADLINE>'GO SLOW, BE PATIENT' POLICY TO BE REVIEWED UNDER CONDITIONS: SIEW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will only review its "go
slow, be patient" policy under certain conditions, Premier Vincent
Siew said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The review will happen when the political and economic situation
in the mainland become stable, when there is a marked improvement in
cross-strait relations, when Beijing respects Taiwan as an equal
political entity and the fact that separate rule exists on the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait is recognized and when both sides of the
Taiwan Strait have reached an agreement to safeguard the interests of
Taiwan investors, Siew said.</P>
      <P>Only when those conditions are met will the government review and
adjust the "go slow, be patient" policy under the premise that
adjustment to the policy will not affect the island's economic
stability.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks when he met with more than 100
representatives from more than 40 Taiwan business associations on the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Siew stressed that the government will actively take the
initiative to improve cross-strait relations so as to create a
favorable environment for adjusting its trade policy toward the
mainland.</P>
      <P>He urged the mainland to reciprocate so as to create more room
for improving cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the meeting, held at the Grand Hotel, Siew noted that
the upcoming high-level talks between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait will be an important starting point to enhance positive
exchanges and rebuild mutual trust, which he said also means that
cross-strait relations have entered into a major new stage.</P>
      <P>Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation, is
scheduled to travel to Shanghai and Beijing and meet with Wang
Daohan, chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Siew said that he has high expectations for Koo's mainland trip
and his meeting with Wang, hoping the trip by Taiwan's top
negotiator, which takes place Oct. 14-19, will help set a model for
developing pragmatic cross-strait relations and institutionalize
cross-strait consultations so as to solve many outstanding issues
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The premier also said that the government has worked to achieve
 "mutually complementary and win-win" cross-strait trade relations,
adding that various measures to improve cross-strait relations have
been in place already.</P>
      <P>Regarding the government's current "go slow, be patient" policy,
he also said that the policy aims to further advance cross-strait
relations.</P>

      <P>Chang King-yuh, chairman of the Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) under the Executive Yuan, on Wednesday spoke
about the conditions for easing restrictions on expanding
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan may start negotiations on the so-called "three

policy if cross-strait relations improve to the extent that both
sides are able to solve bilateral problems pragmatically.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks when he met with representatives of Taiwan
businessmen from mainland China at a seminar organized by Taipei's
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>The MAC chief told the gathering that in advancing relations with
the mainland, the ROC government places a priority on protecting the
lives and interests of Taiwan businessmen on the mainland.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that those concerns will be listed as
top-priority issues when both sides resume negotiations in the
future.</P>
      <P>Chang also touched on the forthcoming talks between SEF Chairman
Koo Chen-fu and Wang Daohan, chairman of Beijing's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, in Shanghai in mid-October.</P>
      <P>He said he expects the talks will be fruitful, paving the way for
the resumption of systematic negotiations between Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>To show Taiwan's sincerity in improving relations with the
mainland, Chang pointed out that the ROC government has recently
suspended military drills designed to demonstrate this nation's
military power.</P>
      <P>He urged the Beijing authorities to change their irrational
policies toward Taiwan so as to build stable and healthy cross-strait

its membership in international groups that require statehood.</P>
      <P>Concerned that Beijing will try to achieve a similar diplomatic
coup with Tokyo by demanding the same declaration, Siew solemnly
warned Japan not to harm the interests of Taiwan while engaging

January-September period, Thai officials said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Inflation has been kept under the 10 percent target set by the

      <P>Chung Kuan was paralyzed from the shoulders down not long after

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan-made steam iron for sale in the

burns among its users, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission said
on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The "Onika" steam iron was made in Taiwan for a California-based

January. Around 7,000 Onika irons have been sold in the United

      <P>The commission found through their investigation that the
product's design and material are potentially hazardous. The design
of the iron's steam dispenser results in frequent accidental burns

the House floor on Friday.</P>
      <P>The veteran House heavyweight said he would be delighted to see
the passage of the resolution before his retirement. Solomon will not
seek re-election in the November mid-term congressional elections.</P>
      <P>The resolution said the 21 million people of Taiwan are entitled
to appropriate and meaningful participation in WHO activities. It
proposed that the United States push WHO to arrange for Taiwan to
have a meaningful representation in the United Nations-affiliated
organization.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is not a UN member, it cannot become a full member of
WHO. Nevertheless, the resolution said WHO can admit observers which
can participate in WHO activities.</P>
      <P>The resolution further said Taiwan's participation in WHO will
not only help improve Taiwan's health care and medical services but
will also contribute to the improvement of regional medical services.</P>
      <P>A concurrent resolution mainly expresses congressional opinions
or sentiments and is not binding to the executive branch.</P>
      <P>The Clinton administration has said it will not support Taiwan's
membership in international organizations in which statehood is a
requirement.</P>
      <P>Co-initiators of the non-binding resolution also included
Benjamin A. Gilman (R-NY), chairman of the House International
Relations Committee, and Bill Barrett (R-Nebraska), chairman of the
House Asia-Pacific Subcommittee.</P>
      <P>The original version of the non-binding resolution called for US
support for Taiwan's full WHO membership. In order to win the support
of more House members, the wording was changed to participation in
WHO activities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAMES SOONG LAMENTS TPG WORKERS TAKING TO THE STREETS</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>James Soong, governor of the Taiwan
Provincial Government (TPG), said that it is regrettable that nearly
1,000 TPG workers took to the streets on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Soong made the remark while fielding questions from
Taiwan Provincial Assembly member Lin Nan-sheng of the ruling
Kuomintang at the Taiwan Provincial Assembly.</P>
      <P>Lin asked about media reports that said that more than 80 percent
of the TPG staff will no longer support the KMT and asked about
Soong's views on their protests in front of the Legislative Yuan
Thursday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Soong said high-ranking KMT officials have not fulfilled their
duty, adding that they had failed to offer solutions to the problems
faced by the TPG workers, nor had they explained the situation to the
workers fully, which he believed has done damage to the party.</P>
      <P>He also denied that the islandwide tour, also known as his
"graduation tour," he will take before stepping down as the first
popularly elected TPG head at the end of December will pave the way
for a presidential bid in 2000.</P>
      <P>The new head of the downsized TPG will be assigned by the central
government.</P>
      <P>Soong was responding to questions from DPP Taiwan Provincial
Assembly members that his tour is aimed at paving the way for a
presidential run and at drumming up support for provincial assembly
members who want to run in year-end legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Soong played down his islandwide tour, saying that this will be
the fifth time he has toured the 309 townships, counties and cities
of the island.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NT DOLLAR APPRECIATION TO HELP EXPORTS, DOMESTIC PRICES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  8  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A stronger New Taiwan dollar will help
stabilize domestic prices and boost exports, the Directorate General
of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The NT dollar has continued to appreciate against the US dollar,
soaring more than one dollar in a seven-day trading session, DGBAS
officials said. The NT dollar was trading at NT$32.905 against the
greenback at noon on Thursday. It was the first time Taiwan's
currency broke the NT$33 threshold over the past six months.</P>
      <P>The appreciation has been attributed to a weakened US dollar.</P>
      <P>Currencies in Southeast Asia have also seen a rally recently, but
the appreciation of the NT dollar is not expected to undercut the
competitiveness of Taiwan products, officials said, adding that
Taiwan's exports are expected to rebound in the fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>The appreciation in the NT dollar is expected to cut the cost of
importing agricultural and industrial raw materials, and crude oil --
items which account for 68 percent of Taiwan's imports, DGBAS
officials noted.</P>
      <P>They added that although international prices for such items have
begun to edge up, the higher value of the NT dollar will help
stabilize domestic prices.</P>
      <P>Due to the sharp depreciation of currencies around Asia in the
wake of Asian financial turmoil, imports and domestic demand have
dropped. The recent rally of the region's currencies is expected to
boost imports to these countries. As half of Taiwan's exports are
destined to Asian nations, this will help increase the island's trade
with such countries, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports to the mainland and Hong Kong accounted for 22
percent of the island's total exports. The weakened greenback will
ease pressure for the mainland and Hong Kong to depreciate their
currencies.</P>
      <P>When mainland China's exports begin to pick up, Taiwan's raw
materials sent to the mainland for processing will also increase
which will benefit Taiwan's export figures in the fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>However, the DGBAS officials said whether Taiwan's exports to the
United States and Europe will be affected remains to be seen. Growth
in exports to the two destinations from the January-August period
were 1.8 percent and 9.3 percent respectively.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRADE SURPLUS EXPECTED TO REACH US$7 BILLION THIS YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  8  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's trade surplus reached US$1.1
billion in September, the third consecutive month it has topped US$1
billion, the Ministry of Finance reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuo-chung, director of the Department of Statistics under the
Ministry of Finance, said that he was cautiously optimistic about
Taiwan's trade performance in the fourth quarter and estimated that
the trade surplus this year could reach US$7 billion.</P>
      <P>Hsu noted that the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) had estimated that this year's trade surplus would
reach US$4.8 billion.</P>
      <P>The total surplus for the first three quarters of this year,
however, is US$4.69 billion. If the surplus averages US$800 million a
month for the next three months, the total surplus for the year would
amount to US$7 billion, down from US$7.66 billion last year.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that Taiwan's exports in September totaled
US$9.51 billion, down 12.4 percent from the same period last year,
while its imports totaled US$8.41 billion, down 13.7 percent from the
same period last year.</P>
      <P>Exports in the first nine months totaled US$82.54 billion, while
imports amounted to US$77.85 billion during the same period, down 8.1
percent and 7.7 percent, respectively, from the same period last
year.</P>
      <P>Hsu attributed September's decline to sharp declines in exports
to Hong Kong, Japan and Association of Southeast Asian Nations
members, and to decreased imports from the United States, Japan,
Europe and ASEAN members.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's largest current trade deficit is with Japan, and Hsu
said it is estimated that the deficit with Japan could reach US$17.5
billion to US$18 billion this year, up from US$17.3 billion last
year.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that Taiwan should continue to promote exports to the
United States and Europe so as to make up for sagging exports to
Asian nations and to minimize the impact of the Asian financial storm
on Taiwan's exports.</P>
      <P>He also said that the government should continue its public
construction projects to stimulate domestic investment so as to
maintain steady domestic economic growth.</P>

      <P>He said Singapore's exports to Europe in the first eight months

      <P>Tham said the Netherlands was the fastest-growing export market,
absorbing just under 20 percent of Singapore's exports to Europe.</P>
      <P>According to the TDB, exports to the Netherlands in the first
half grew 56.6 percent while trade rose 37.5 percent. Trade with the
European Union in the same period grew 3.6 percent to S$25.7 billion.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet on Thursday approved a package

violent crime.</P>
      <P>The protective package, drafted by the Ministry of Justice, will

      <P>Justice Minister Cheng Chung-mo said the package is designed to
complement the crime victims protection statute which took effect on
Oct. 1.</P>
      <P>"As the protection of crime victims covers many areas and
involve many technical problems, it requires concerted efforts of
various central government agencies and local-level governments,"
Cheng said, adding that detailed measures are needed to ensure
smooth enforcement of the protection law.</P>
      <P>The grand justice-turned-minister further said the package
offers action guidelines for the establishment of comprehensive
protective networks for victims of various kinds of violent crime.</P>
      <P>"The package also signifies the government's determination to
intensify protection for crime victims," Cheng stressed.</P>
      <P>The package comprises measures for rescuing, saving or assisting
victims of violent crime, and for security protection, financial
compensation, lawsuit counseling, educational campaign and other
related services, Cheng said.</P>

county governments will cooperate closely to better protect the
legitimate rights of crime victims or their families and to improve
social order.</P>
      <P>Highlights of the package include:</P>
      <P>-- Prohibiting sales of publications featuring real crime plots
for profits;</P>
      <P>-- Strengthening statistics, analysis and research of crime
victims and their problems;</P>
      <P>-- Intensifying educational campaign for preventing oneself from
falling victim to criminal activities and stepping up cultivation of
professional workers to offer protective services for crime victims;</P>
      <P>-- Offering counseling services for victims of sexual crime and
domestic violence;</P>

seriously injured in major violent crimes;</P>
      <P>-- Tightening protection of personal safety and privacy of
crime victims and their families;</P>
      <P>-- Directing police, prosecution and judiciary institutions to

victims and witnesses;</P>
      <P>-- Offering financial compensation for crime victims or their
bereaved families in accordance with the newly enacted crime victims
protection law.</P>

were critically injured in violent crimes may be eligible for
compensation of up to NT$2.37 million (US$68,497) and NT$1.05 million
(US$30,347), respectively.</P>
      <P>Some 6,000 people die as a result of violent crimes each year
with 500 more being severely wounded, according to a recent
government report.</P>

NT$400,000 in emergency funds with which to pay for the victim's
funeral.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 100 members of northern Taiwan
Lions Clubs got together Thursday at the 2-28 Memorial Park in
downtown Taipei to kick off an islandwide cleanup campaign.</P>
      <P>The campaign, one of the activities marking the Lions Clubs
International's annual Service Day, will have Lions roaming the
streets of Taiwan's cities. Streets will be swept and garbage
collected in more than 20 cities and counties in central, southern
and eastern Taiwan, said Lin Ming-teh, a spokesman for the Formosa
Lions Club.</P>
      <P>Several dozen group members will travel from city to city for a
total of 25 days in the campaign. At each stop, they will be joined
by local Lions Club members. During that time, streets will be swept
by day and recycling workshops given by night, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Environmental Protection Administrator Tsai Hsun-hsiung greeted
the Lions Club members at a ceremony at the memorial park Thursday
morning. He lauded the group's efforts, saying the campaign will
serve as a catalyst to bring about larger-scale cleanup action
islandwide.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the amount of garbage produced by Taiwan households
exceeds 8.9 million metric tons a year. Garbage dumps, incinerators
and other waste-treatment centers are nearing saturation points.</P>
      <P>The only effective way of solving the problem is to reduce the
amount of garbage generated and to improve recycling efforts, Tsai
noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) is scheduled
to hold a meeting on Friday to discuss whether to lower their oil
prices in response to a drop in the cost of imported crude oil.</P>
      <P>The CPC announced Thursday that its operating revenues amounted
to NT$30.37 billion (US$920.3 million) in September, with a pre-tax
profit of NT$3.32 billion, NT$1.32 billion above its legislatively
mandated profit ceiling.</P>
      <P>From July to September, the CPC's profits exceeded the amount
permitted for a three-month period by NT$4.66 billion.</P>
      <P>A significant increase in the amount of oil refined and a drop in
production costs were the major reasons for the excess profits,
officials said.</P>
      <P>The recent appreciation of the New Taiwan dollar is making crude
oil even less costly for the CPC to import, they added.</P>
      <P>The US dollar has lost ground against the local currency for the
past eight days, closing at 32.96 on Thursday on the Taipei foreign
exchange market.</P>
      <P>Despite the advantages of a cut in oil prices, the CPC officials

    <HEADLINE>VIAGRA TO BE FORMALLY MARKETED IN TAIWAN IN DECEMBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Prices for the smuggled anti-impotency drug
Viagra are declining in Taiwan, while legally imported "small blue
pills" are poised to enter the local market before the end of this
year, the United Evening News reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The paper quoted a senior executive with the Taiwan subsidiary
of the US-based Viagra manufacturing firm Pfizer as saying that if
all goes well, the company will be able to legally market the magic
drug in Taiwan in December.</P>
      <P>After a careful evaluation, the executive said the company has
decided to adopt a low-price marketing strategy to stem smuggling of
Viagra tablets from the United States into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The retail price for a 50 mg Viagra pill will not exceed NT$600
(US$18.18)," the executive said, adding that the company is also
studying the feasibility of even lowering the retail price to NT$500
per tablet.</P>
      <P>In addition to discouraging Viagra smuggling, the executive
said, the low-price strategy is also aimed at attracting local men
to purchase the anti-impotency drug.</P>
      <P>"We don't expect that the National Health Program will pay for
Viagra any time soon. Therefore, we must market the drug at
affordable prices," said the executive.</P>
      <P>Pfizer has applied for permission to market Viagra in Taiwan.
According to government regulations, the maker must present reports
on clinical tests at several local hospitals. Such reports are
needed to determine local patients' reaction to the drug and the
dosage most suitable for Taiwan users.</P>
      <P>The executive said Pfizer researchers have completed a detail
analysis of clinical test reports provided by Taiwan hospitals.
"We'll present the analysis and other required additional documents
to Taiwan's health department later this month. Once the Department
of Health (DOH) finalizes its screening and issue a green light, we
can market the drug within six weeks. If all goes smoothly, the
four-pill pack drug will be formally marketed in Taiwan before year's
end," he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the United Evening News reported that even though
Viagra has not been legally marketed in Taiwan, some 10,000 Taiwan
men have managed to use the drug so far.</P>
      <P>With legal marketing of the drug increasingly imminent, the
paper said, retail prices for smuggled Viagra tablets have declined
significantly in recent weeks, from between NT$1,000 and NT$2,000 per
tablet to between NT$600 and NT$800. Some black market retailers
even offer special discounts for those who make large purchases.</P>
      <P>DOH officials said sales of Viagra remain illegal before the DOH
formally issues a marketing permit. Violators can receive a maximum
seven-year sentence plus a fine of up to NT$150,000.</P>
      <P>However, the officials admitted that they have difficulties
cracking down on illegal sales of smuggled Viagra pills because
black market retailers have consistently struck such deals via
cellular phones.</P>
      <P>"We can only remind members of the general public of the dangers
of using smuggled Viagra tablets," said a DOH official.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NT DOLLAR'S APPRECIATION COULD BOOST DOMESTIC DEMAND: MOEA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  8  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The recent appreciation of the New Taiwan
dollar against the US dollar will result in an infusion of capital
and the expansion of domestic demand, said officials with the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The degree of the appreciation of Taiwan's currency has led to
manufacturers selling greenbacks for NT dollars, a situation
favorable to the infusion of capital into the domestic market and to
a greater willingness by business people to invest, remarked the MOEA
officials, adding that this development is also conducive to a
reduction in the cost of imports and to the stabilization of domestic
prices.</P>
      <P>Taiwan merchants said that a stable exchange rate between the NT
dollar and the US dollar is highly desirable, and they thought that
an exchange rate of NT$32-NT$34 against the US dollar is a reasonable
figure.</P>
      <P>Wang Chih-kang, minister of the MOEA, noted earlier that a
small-scale appreciation of the Taiwan dollar would not have much of
an impact on Taiwan's exports; it would instead contribute to the
stabilization of Taiwan's domestic prices.</P>
      <P>The rise in the value of the NT dollar will not greatly affect
Taiwan's exports, because Taiwan's counterparts -- other
export-oriented countries -- are also seeing their currencies
appreciate against a weakened US currency, Wang added.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, an appreciation in Taiwan's currency will be
beneficial to the island's importers and keep domestic prices stable,
the minister remarked.</P>
      <P>Chang Yao-tsung, director-general of the Statistics Department of
the MOEA, said that the current increase in the value of the Taiwan
dollar against the US dollar -- about 4 percent to 5 percent -- is
rather low compared with that of the Japanese yen, which has
appreciated about 18 percent against the US dollar, rising from 150
yen to 123 yen against the greenback.</P>
      <P>A large-scale appreciation will surely affect the competitiveness
of Taiwan's exporters, said Chang. He further said that if the NT
dollar rises by more than 10 percent against the US dollar, the
ministry will survey the island's exporters to learn their opinions
on the matter.</P>
      <P>As the current appreciation has been relatively low, it is best
that the market alone determine the currencies' exchange rate, Chang
said.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The drug problem in Australia's largest
city, Sydney, and in other cities in New South Wales is getting more
serious as the demand for drug rehabilitation centers is exceeding
the supply.</P>
      <P>A new survey shows nearly 11,700 people will seek admission to
the non-government centers for treatment.</P>
      <P>Only 3,392 people will be admitted to treatment while the rest
will be turned away because of a severe shortage of places, according
to Peter Connie, head of the Network of Alcohol and Drug Agencies,
which conducted the survey.</P>
      <P>He said the total capacity of the residential drug treatment
sector -- mainly clinics offering long-term rehabilitation -- has not
changed since 1996.</P>
      <P>"Just 28 percent of people who inquire about a residential
treatment service get one, down from 32 percent in the 1996 survey,"
he said.</P>
      <P>He said more than 60 percent of drug addicts have been refused
admission because there was no treatment place available.</P>
      <P>Connie said the New South Wales needs 3,064 extra places on top
of the current 2,321 places now available.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia is expected to escape the worst
effects of the Asian financial crisis, suffering only a mild
recession, according to international consultants KPMG Barents.</P>
      <P>The survey shows the Asian economic crisis could cost countries
in the region US$1.5 trillion, but Australia would be mildly hit
because its corporate sector was well capitalized with a sound
monetary policy and realistic property values, according to Barents'
global chief executive officer, Bill Haworth.</P>
      <P>"We estimate the cost of fully addressing embedded credit losses
will range from US$1 trillion to US$1.5 trillion, just within Asia,"
he said.</P>
      <P>"We still expect a mild recession with demand down for Australian
exports and prolonged low growth as the global economy struggles
towards recovery," he said.</P>
      <P>He said it will take between three and five years for a full
recovery, but said Australia should benefit from its "safe haven"
status.</P>
      <P>He said the likely scenario for developing countries involved
lower interest rates, forcing the imposition of currency and capital
controls and the prospect of hyper inflation, negative real interest
rates and lower savings levels.</P>

(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) announced on Thursday that Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
Chairman C.F. Koo will lead a 12-member delegation to mainland China
on Oct. 14.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by his wife, Koo, a veteran business tycoon who
concurrently serves as a senior advisor to President Lee Teng-hui,
and his delegation will tour Shanghai and Beijing from Oct. 14
through Oct. 19.</P>
      <P>During his ice-breaking visit, Koo will meet again with his
mainland counterpart, Wang Daohan, chairman of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies
authorized by their respective governments to handle cross-strait
exchanges in the absence of official relations.</P>
      <P>The MAC has expressed its hope that the upcoming Koo-Wang meet
will lay the foundation for a resumption of institutionalized
SEF-ARATS dialogue, and for the improvement of cross-strait
exchanges.</P>
      <P>Koo and Wang met for the first time in Singapore in April 1993 to
lay a framework for regular SEF-ARATS dialogue and consultations.
However, Beijing unilaterally suspended these engagements shortly
after President Lee made a landmark visit to the United States in
1995.</P>
      <P>A final namelist of the delegation has not yet been formally
announced, but it is expected to include four representatives of the
National Unification Council (NUC), four from the MAC, and four from
the SEF.</P>
      <P>The probable NUC delegates are: either Kang Ning-hsiang of the
Control Yuan, or Michael H. H. Siao, national policy advisor to the
president; Wu Rong-I, president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research; Chen Po-chih, professor of Economics at National Taiwan
University; and Chang Jung-kung, director of the ruling Kuomintang's
Mainland Affairs Research Department.</P>
      <P>Those from the MAC are expected to be: Jan Jyh-horng, director of
the Department of Research &amp; Planning; Johnson Liu, director of the
Department of Legal Affairs; Chang Yung-shan, director of the
Department of Information &amp; Liaison; and Chang Chih-yu, section
chief.</P>
      <P>The SEF delegates will probably be: Shi Hwei-yow,
secretary-general &amp; vice chairman; Wu Hsin-hsing, deputy
secretary-general; Chan Chih-hung, deputy secretary-general; and
Hsieh Fu-yuan, director of the Department of Legal Services.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chiou I-jen, secretary-general of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), called on Koo to express the hope
that DPP personnel will also be allowed to take part in the upcoming
trip. Chiu was accompanied by DPP Legislator Lin Cho-shui and Yen
Wan-chan, director of the DPP's Department of China Affairs.</P>
      <P>Koo said the SEF fully respects the DPP's views, and promised to

    <HEADLINE>SHOWCASE COURT-MARTIAL BEGINS FOR FOUR MILITARY OFFICERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  8  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Court martial proceedings against four
officers charged in a high-profile corruption case early this year
opened on Thursday, in what is set to be a showcase trial.</P>
      <P>The four -- a lieutenant general, a major general, a lieutenant
colonel, and a major -- were prosecuted for leaking classified
military information to defense contractors in return for money and
sexual favors.</P>
      <P>According to court documents, Maj. Gen. Wo Chi-kao, former
director of the Engineering Department at the Headquarters of the
Combined Services Force, and his two staffers, Lt. Col. Lee Cheng and
Major Lee Chun-lin, disclosed the maximum price of a contract for the
construction of a bomb-resistant ammunition depot to a defense
contractor named as the Shengpai Company, with the intent of helping
it win the contract in public bidding.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lt. Gen. Liu Hsueh-ta, director of the Military
Affairs Bureau at the Ministry of National Defense, was accused of
playing the role of broker in the deal between Maj. Wo and Chuang
Ping-huang, Shengpai's owner.</P>
      <P>The case came to light in January when Chuang ordered the
kidnapping of Maj. Wo and Lt. Col. Lee Cheng, and the bombing of Wo's
house in Kaohsiung after he failed to win the contract.</P>
      <P>In Thursday's trial, both Lt. Gen. Liu and Maj. Gen. Wo denied
any wrongdoing, despite admitting to having been treated by Chuang to
wining and dining at luxurious restaurants, treatment which they
dismissed as "normal social behavior."</P>
      <P>Lt. Gen. Liu said at the trial that investigators showed him the
transcript of a secretly recorded telephone conversation between him
and Chuang which mistakenly interpreted his use of the English word
"condition" for "commission," and led to him being accused of asking
for kickbacks from Chuang.</P>
      <P>Maj. Wo also denied his earlier confession to the investigators,
saying that he was coerced into making a false statement because the
investigators threatened to put him in a jail cell along with drug
traffickers and rapists, which would expose him to sexual attacks and
insults.</P>
      <P>He said his only sin was associating with Chuang, and that he
never promised to reward Shengpai with the ammunition depot contract.
He also said he has returned a NT$200,000 bribe to Chuang.</P>
      <P>Wo said he had rejected suggestions from the two accused staffers
to limit the bidders' credentials in an attempt to make Shengpai and
its associated firms the only eligible competitors in the public
bidding.</P>
      <P>Lt. Col. Lee Cheng admitted having received a NT$500,000 bribe
from Chuang, including a check for NT$250,000 which he deposited in
the bank account of his girlfriend Chiu Jui-ling, in addition to
payment of NT$100,000 for drawing a construction blueprint for
Shengpai, and a loan of NT$150,000 which was not repaid because of
his detention in connection with the case.</P>
      <P>But he denied doing Shengpai any illegal favors, and contended
that he was only following Maj. Gen. Wo's orders.</P>
      <P>Maj. Lee Chun-lin, charged with leaking classified information to
Chuang, argued that the information stored on 10 computer disks which
he gave to Chuang had already been made public.</P>
      <P>He said he gave Chuang the information as a thank you gift
because Chuang once suggested that he postpone his wedding, which
made him put off a proposed business trip, thereby avoiding a flight
on a plane which later crashed.</P>
      <P>The trial, overseen by a panel of five military judges,
continues.</P>

    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct.  7  (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asian economic crisis has been blamed
for the drop in Canada's targeted immigration as fewer people than
expected will move to Canada this year, Immigration Minister Lucienne
Robillard said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Of the approved candidates for immigration, about 15,000 skilled
applicants have decided not to leave their homes. A common problem is
that many prospective immigrants from Asia do not have the money
required to resettle in Canada, Robillard said.</P>
      <P>The target for new immigrants and refugees this year was between
200,000 to 225,000, but only 180,000 to 200,000 will likely move to
Canada. Despite this year's decline, the target for 1999 will remain
at the 225,000 level, the minister said.</P>
      <P>Robillard said if immigration continued to decline, it may have a
long-term negative impact on Canada's economy.</P>

      <P>Chiu Yi-jen, secretary-general of the main
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), visited Straits Exchange
Foundation Chairman C.F. Koo on Thursday to express the DPP's desire
to participate in the long-awaited Koo-Wang meeting.</P>

hope DPP representatives can take part in the meeting with his
mainland Chinese counterpart, Wang Daohan, chairman of the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), to spell
out Taiwan's diverse voices.</P>
      <P>Koo responded that the SEF fully respects the DPP's opinion, and
promised that he will refer the DPP's proposal to the Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), the government's highest-level agency charting
Taiwan's mainland policy and overseeing SEF operations.</P>
      <P>Koo is scheduled to depart for mainland China on Oct. 14 for a
six-day visit at the head of a delegation composed mainly of
government officials in charge of mainland affairs.</P>
      <P>Koo and Wang are slated to meet for the second time on Oct. 18 in
Beijing after a hiatus of more than five years.</P>
      <P>Chiu said the DPP understands it does not have the right to
demand that party members be included in Koo's delegation, but that
it would like Koo to reflect the DPP's voice and stance to mainland
China.</P>
      <P>According to Chiu, the DPP has a three-point statement and one
requirement which Koo should relay to the mainland:</P>
      <P>-- Taiwan in an independent sovereignty which does not belong to
mainland China;</P>
      <P>-- Taiwan and the mainland should resume negotiations to tackle
issues of major concern for people on both sides as soon as possible;</P>
      <P>-- The two sides of the Taiwan Strait should cooperate to cope
with major regional affairs under an international framework;</P>
      <P>-- Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Wang should be
invited to visit Taiwan to observe the elections planned for the end
of this year and witness the democratic process in action.</P>
      <P>SEF Secretary-General Shi Hwei-yow said in response that the SEF,
an intermediary body authorized by the ROC government to deal with
bilateral exchanges with mainland China, is fully capable of
reflecting the voices and opinions of Taiwan's 21 million people.</P>
      <P>Shi said the SEF can study the feasibility of inviting Wang to
Taiwan since any such visit would be at working level. As for
inviting Jiang, he said that is outside the SEF's jurisdiction and
should be decided by relevant government agencies.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China has been formally allowed to
export fresh garlic to Taiwan to help ease off garlic shortages and
soaring prices in domestic markets, sources from the Taipei County
Farmers Association reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture contracted the Central
Trust Bureau to authorize the first import of 8,000 metric tons of
mainland Chinese garlic recently. The imported garlic, it is hoped,
will alleviate upward pressure on domestic garlic prices, which have
surged in recent months.</P>
      <P>The 8,000 metric tons of mainland garlic, all originating from
the northern province of Henan, were described by association
officials as "big and cheap."</P>
      <P>The Henan garlic is now available at major supermarkets and
traditional markets around the island at an average price of NT$120
per kilogram. The retail price is about 45 percent lower than that of
locally produced garlic, association officials said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The fourth World Electronic Forum (WEF) will
open in Taipei on Oct. 20 and will be attended by representatives of
19 electronic information business associations from 13 countries and
regions, including Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This will be the first time the annual conference has taken place
in Taiwan since it began in 1995. The conference aims to facilitate
business cooperation and information exchanges among electronic
information businesses around the globe.</P>
      <P>Wu Si-chung, chairman of the Taiwan Electrical and Electronic
Manufacturing Association, said that in the upcoming forum, a call
for the promotion of free trade will be issued. Wu urged economies to
solve trade disputes by negotiations rather than tariffs and trade
barriers.</P>
      <P>Citing instances in which the European Union (EU) has enacted
anti-dumping measures to protect their industries against Taiwan's
strong exports, Wu said the EU must admit that some Taiwan electronic
products are competitive in Europe, just as the cellular phones sold
in Taiwan adhere to European frequency standards, such as GSM900 and
DSC1800.</P>
      <P>Protectionist measures are not the best way to solve trade
disputes, especially as the world has been moving toward freer trade,

    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct.  8  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canadian investigators confirmed Thursday
that the pilots of Swissair Flight 111 had smelled smoke before the
jet crashed early last month off Nova Scotia.</P>
      <P>Vic Gerden, lead investigator for the Transportation Safety Board
of Canada, said flight data recorders have revealed the crew decided
to divert the plane to Halifax after smelling and then seeing smoke.</P>
      <P>But Gerden said there is no indication of smoke in the passenger
cabin, or of problems in handling the aircraft before the last 90
seconds of recorded data.</P>
      <P>He added that in those 90 seconds, the flight data recorder
recorded a sequence of fault codes that could provide important clues
about the cause of the disaster. Those codes will take time to
decipher, and they will only indicate the symptoms, not the source,
of any problems experienced, he said.</P>
      <P>The recorders stopped working six minutes before the crash, which
killed all 229 people on board.</P>
      <P>Investigators reported that phase one of the recovery operation
is now complete and all accessible human remains have been recovered.</P>
      <P>The second phase will involve using a heavy lift to recover as
much of the remaining debris as possible before weather conditions
deteriorate.</P>
      <P>The pilot and co-pilot were identified by DNA recently, according
to Dr. John Butt, the investigation's chief coroner. An outside
agency will perform toxicology tests on their remains, he said.</P>
      <P>To date, 78 people have been identified through dental records,

    <DATELINE>Canberra, Oct. 9 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia experienced strong job growth in
September, indicating its economy has remained resilient in the wake
of the Asian financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Employment Minister David Kemp said 41,300 jobs -- most full-time
ones -- were created in September, about 10,000 more than expected.</P>
      <P>The federal government and financial market economists said the
growth augured well for increased consumer spending and improved
confidence in the domestic economy over the next six months -- just
as the worst of the Asian contagion is expected to hit.</P>
      <P>Despite a surge in employment, Australia's unemployment rate
however remained high at 8.1 percent in September and the figure is
unlikely to fall below 8 percent before June 1999, Kemp said.</P>
      <P>But opposition Employment Minister Martin Ferguson warned the
Howard government should start explaining what they will do to create
jobs before the expected 10 percent tax on goods and services is

    <HEADLINE>HEAVY SNORERS SAID IN DANGER OF HAVING HEART DISEASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  9 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Heavy snorers should visit their doctors
to find out whether they are at risk of hypertension and
cardiovascular disease, according to a leading Australian sleep
expert.</P>
      <P>Dr. John Wheatley, president of the Australian Sleep Association,
told the Sydney Morning Herald that sleep apnea, a condition in which
people persistently stop breathing for a few seconds throughout the
night, can cause extreme stress on the heart.</P>
      <P>He said that for people who stop breathing between 10 and 14
times an hour during sleep, the risk of heart disease is more than
four times higher than it is for the general population.</P>
      <P>When a person stops breathing, the body is deprived of oxygen and
the nervous system is stimulated. These two conditions increase the
amount of work the heart has to do.</P>
      <P>He said being overweight and drinking alcohol -- both separately
linked to heart disease -- can cause apnea because extra fat deposits
around the neck may narrow the airways.</P>
      <P>Aging, which makes muscles and tissue floppy, may cause temporary
obstruction in the airways of people who have not previously had a
problem. But genetics is also a factor, with some people's air
passages up to a third narrower than the average, Wheatley said.</P>
      <P>"Age 40 to 60 years is when we clinically pick up a lot of
people. Their partners are very important because the snorer is
usually unaware of the nighttime stuff," he said.</P>
      <P>People who snore sometimes gasp for breath or cough after a bout
of excessively loud snoring. In the morning, such people often feel
groggy and unrefreshed, he said.</P>
      <P>He said most people have some non-breathing episodes each night,
especially in the first hour or two after falling asleep. But more
than five episodes an hour indicate an apnea problem. About 10
percent of snorers are apnea sufferers, he said.</P>
      <P>He suggested losing weight and abstaining from alcohol as ways
for people to reduce sleep-related breathing problems.</P>

lost ground in Friday morning trade after reports of a renewed plunge
by the US dollar against the Japanese yen and heavy sales by US hedge
fund operators, analysts said.</P>
      <P>The All Ordinaries Index fell 16.8 points to 2,486.5 in morning

morning, down from its high of 62.33 US cents in London on Thursday
night.</P>
      <P>The Australian dollar had hit a two-and-a-half-month high because
of a surge in the value of the Japanese yen against the greenback.
The yen climbed to 114.84 against the US dollar on Thursday night.</P>
      <P>The US dollar has fallen more than 17 percent in just two days
from its level of about 135 yen early on Wednesday, analysts said.</P>
      <P>They said the yen's resurgence has fueled a rally in the

      <P>They said the sudden strength of the Australian dollar has caused
fears among stock investors that the profits of Australian companies

      <P>The SES and TAIEX are working on establishing a link that will

      <P>A report in Thursday's Commercial Times of Taiwan said the two

      <P>In Singapore, the proposed linkage drew a favorable response from
both institutional and retail investors.</P>
      <P>Fund managers said the idea of a single point of access to the

    <HEADLINE>MAC UNVEILS KOO DELEGATION LIST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) on Friday unveiled the list of 11 delegates who will accompany
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman C. F. Koo to visit
mainland China next week.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Sheu Ke-sheng told a news conference that as
Koo's Oct. 14-19 trip to Shanghai and Beijing is mainly aimed at
promoting exchanges between the two intermediary bodies on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait, the top concern in delegate selection is
professional expertise and functions.</P>
      <P>"Based on this principle, the delegates all come from
institutions in charge of mainland China-related work, such as the
National Unification Council (NUC), MAC and SEF," Sheu said, adding
that none of them have been selected for their party affiliation.</P>
      <P>Delegates from SEF are Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Shi
Hwei-yow; Deputy Secretary-General Jan Jyh-horng, who is also
director of the MAC's Department of Research and Planning; Hsieh
Fu-yuan, director of the Department of Legal Service; and Ho
Wu-liang, a section chief with the legal service department.</P>
      <P>From the Cabinet's MAC are Pao Cheng-kang, chief secretary;
Johnnason Liu, director of the Department of Legal Affairs; and
Tsai Ying-wen, an advisor to MAC.</P>
      <P>The delegates also include Kang Ning-hsiang, an NUC member; and
three NUC researchers -- Wu Rong-i, also president of the Taiwan
Institute of Economic Research; Chang Jung-kung, also director of
the ruling Kuomintang's Department of Mainland Research; and Pao
Chung-ho, also a political science professor with National Taiwan
University. The NUC is a consultative body attached to the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Although the pro-independence main opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) has on many occasions expressed its
intention to send a representative with Koo's delegation, no DPP
member has been included.</P>
      <P>"We feel regret that there will be no DPP member in Koo's
mission," said DPP Secretary-General Chiou I-jen. "The DPP intends to
take part in Koo's delegation not out of partisan consideration. We
simply hope to clearly and comprehensively express the fundamental
stance and common aspirations of the Taiwan people."</P>
      <P>Chiou said he is convinced that DPP's absence from the
upcoming talks between Koo and his mainland counterpart, Chairman
Wang Daohan of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) will have an adverse impact on future
cross-strait interaction.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the DPP will call a news conference on the
eve of Koo's departure for his landmark mainland visit to explain the
party's views on the event.</P>
      <P>"Incumbent and all previous DPP chairmen will be invited to
attend Tuesday's press conference to give a detailed explanation of
our party's stance on Koo's mainland trip," Chiou said, adding that
the DPP will also make a proper response after Koo's delegation
returns to Taipei.</P>
      <P>Koo's forthcoming mainland trip is widely seen as a major
breakthrough in the more-than-three-year cross-strait impasse. MAC,
which oversees SEF operations, said earlier this week it is hopeful
that Koo's mainland trip will help lay a solid foundation for the
resumption of institutionalized dialogue and consultations between
SEF and ARATS as well as for the improvement of cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are quasi-official organizations authorized by
their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in the
absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Beijing unilaterally suspended regular SEF-ARATS dialogue
shortly after ROC President Lee Teng-hui made a landmark visit to
the United States in June 1995. Beijing interpreted Lee's US trip as
a move to promote Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>During his upcoming mainland visit, Koo, also a senior adviser
to President Lee, will hold several rounds of talks with Wang on a
broad range of issues of mutual concern. He will also meet with
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier Qian Qichen
for wide-ranging talks.</P>

      <P>The main opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) will formally kick off its campaign tour around the

      <P>DPP Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung expressed the hope that candidates
solicit votes through their views on various policies, instead of
engaging in a war of words, as has been seen in recent days between
the ruling Kuomintang and DPP candidates.</P>
      <P>The DPP's central campaign team will comprise DPP mayors and
county magistrates, legislators and National Assembly deputies. They
are scheduled to roam the streets to meet with voters in the morning
and appear at campaign rallies in the afternoon to drum up support
for DPP candidates.</P>
      <P>All DPP candidates nominated by the party will sign a letter in
which they pledge to conduct a clean campaign, avoid entanglements
with special interest groups and make public their political
donations.</P>
      <P>The campaign team will launch its first stumping tour at Taipei
Dunhua Primary School Saturday night. Chairman Lin, current Taipei
Mayor Chen Shui-bian of the DPP and nine DPP legislative candidates
will participate in the rally.</P>
      <P>The DPP campaign team has attached special importance to
Kaohsiung City, hoping its candidate, Frank Hsieh, can beat the
current mayor, Wu Den-yih of the ruling Kuomintang.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO NET GAIN FOR MAINLAND IF YUAN IS DEVALUED: STUDY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct.  9  (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The adverse impact of a devaluation of
the yuan on mainland China's trade with East Asia would more than
cancel out any benefits from the move, according to a study by
researchers at the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).</P>
      <P>In a recently released paper, MAS's external economies division
argues that if a yuan devaluation leads to a further regional
slowdown, the mainland is likely to feel the impact on its exports
to, and investments from, Asia. This would likely overwhelm the
benefits of more price-competitive mainland exports.</P>
      <P>MAS said the views expressed in the paper -- titled "The Impact
of the Asian Crisis on China: An Assessment" -- are those of its
staff and should not be attributed to the MAS.</P>
      <P>The paper distinguishes between the "price effect" of the Asian
crisis on the mainland and the "income effect" of a yuan devaluation.</P>
      <P>Anecdotal evidence suggests that price competition from the
region has already affected selected industries in the mainland, such
as textiles and steel, according to the study.</P>
      <P>The result has intensified lobbying from some mainland industries
for a devaluation of the yuan.</P>
      <P>But the study points out that mainland exports to the United
States and European Union -- regions that accounted for 31 percent of
the mainland's exports in 1996 to 1997 -- remain strong.</P>

to East Asian countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER DPP HEAD URGES STIMULATION OF DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  9  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government must stimulate domestic
consumption to maintain Taiwan's economic development, former
chairman of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Hsu
Hsin-liang said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who is now chairman of Rising People Foundation, made the
remarks during an address at the Keelung City Cultural Center on
Taiwan's economic situation amid the Asian financial storm.</P>
      <P>He said that he believes the world economy will gradually recover
over the next two years, but added that if Taiwan is hurt too badly
during the current regional financial turmoil, it will be hard for it
to keep up with the pace of the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that at a time when Taiwan's exports are in decline, it
is necessary for Taiwan to stimulate domestic consumption to help
maintain Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>The former DPP chairman also said that the ruling Kuomintang's
package to increase the budget for public construction by NT$190
billion (US$5.86 billion) over the next two years to expand domestic
demand will be a rash way to spend money, claiming that it will only
result in shoddy work.</P>
      <P>He reiterated his own proposal to cut NT$300 billion (US$9.09
billion) in taxes over the next two years, saying that if the
commodity tax and security transaction taxes are halved, this will
encourage more consumption and more stock transactions.</P>
      <P>He also said that Taiwan has strong production ability, but has
become increasingly reliant on OEM production for overseas brands.
This is making it more difficult for the island to create its own
brands now, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>However, Hsu stressed the fundamental factor governing Taiwan's
economy will be normalized cross-strait relations, and more of a
foothold for Taiwan companies in mainland China's market, adding that
Taiwan will have the advantage over other nations if it makes further
inroads into the mainland.</P>

      <P>An entrepreneur who is well-known in Taiwan
for building his Chi Mei "kingdom" into a company, a museum, and a
hospital, on Friday broke his customary silence to voice discontent
with the "government reform" campaign implemented by the Executive
Yuan.</P>
      <P>W.L. Shi criticized administrative authorities for excessive
interference into people's lives by means of restrictive laws and
regulations, despite the government reform, which he said underlines
the need for the establishment of a small but efficient government.</P>
      <P>Complicated and stringent regulations enacted to ensure orderly
development of the island's business and industrial sectors seem to
serve a "planned economy" system, rather than a "market economy"
system, the entrepreneur said.</P>
      <P>Shi stressed that local governments should be fully authorized to
carry out administrative affairs, and urged the leaders of the
country to "govern by doing nothing," following the ideas of the
ancient Chinese philosopher Lao Tzi.</P>
      <P>The Chi Mei Corporation, one of Taiwan's leading chemical
producers, has the world's largest output of acrylonitrile butadiene
styrene (ABS). It is also listed as one of the top 50 businesses on
the island.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIT CHIEF SPELLS OUT US EXPECTATIONS FOR KOO-WANG TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  8  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States is hopeful that the
soon-to-be-resumed dialogue across the Taiwan Strait will be
substantive and constructive, the top US liaison officer with the
Republic of China on Taiwan said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Richard Bush, chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT),
made the statement while attending a cocktail reception marking the
ROC's Double Ten National Day. The AIT is a quasi-official
organization authorized by the US government to handle exchanges with
Taiwan in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Bush said the United States looks forward to seeing the upcoming
visit to mainland China by Taiwan's top negotiator with Beijing,
Chairman C.F. Koo of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), will help
clarify any misunderstandings existing between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"We also hope to see the two sides forge a consensus to bring
about deeper cross-strait dialogue and broader cross-strait
cooperation," Bush said, adding he is convinced that if the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait cooperate closely, they will certainly be able
to mend their differences over both substantive and procedural
issues.</P>
      <P>Bush further pointed out four major developments in ROC-US
relations over the past year, describing them as: the resumption of
cross-strait dialogue; the signing of a bilateral agreement on the
terms for Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization;
Taiwan's ability to remain largely unscathed by the Asian financial
turmoil; and the two summit meetings between US President Bill
Clinton and his mainland counterpart, Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>Koo, accompanied by 11 mainland affairs administrators and
experts, will leave Taipei for an ice-breaking mainland trip next
week. Koo's Oct. 14-19 mainland visit will mark a major breakthrough
in the long-stalled cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>During his mainland visit, Koo will meet with his mainland
counterpart, Chairman Wang Daohan of the Beijing-based Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), to discuss matters of
mutual concern. Koo will also meet with Jiang and Vice Premier Qian
Qichen for wide-ranging talks.</P>
      <P>Beijing unilaterally suspended regular SEF-ARATS dialogue shortly
after ROC President Lee Teng-hui made a landmark visit to the United
States in June 1995. Beijing interpreted Lee's US trip as a move to
promote Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Senior Clinton administration officials have said they are happy
to see the two sides of the Taiwan Strait resume peaceful dialogue to
resolve their disputes. They have also reaffirmed the US "no
involvement, no interference" stance on cross-strait affairs.</P>
      <P>The cocktail reception was hosted by the ROC representative
office in Washington, D.C. in celebration of the ROC's National Day
which falls on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Nearly 3,000 guests, including Americans and overseas Chinese
representatives, attended the reception to give their best wishes for
Taiwan's well-being.</P>
      <P>Among the well-wishers was Rep. Gerald Solomon (R-NY), chairman
of the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives, who said that
the long-standing US-ROC friendship will never change.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INDIRECT CROSS-STRAIT TRADE VIA HONG KONG DECLINING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong, Oct. 9 (CNA)
(By Chang Yuan-hsiang and Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The continuing decline of indirect trade
across the Taiwan Strait via Hong Kong reflects the changes taking
place in cross-strait trade, according to Hong Kong trade statistics.</P>
      <P>Indirect trade between mainland China and Taiwan via the former
British colony in the first five months of this year totaled HK$32.7
billion, a decline of 7.6 percent from the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>Total trade from Taiwan to the mainland via Hong Kong in January
through May was valued at about HK$27.3 billion, a slip of 8.9
percent, while trade from the mainland to Taiwan through Hong Kong in
the same period totaled about HK$5.4 billion, a drop of 0.4 percent.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1992, cross-strait trade was conducted primarily via
Hong Kong. However, in the wake of a gradual increase in direct
trade, either openly or covertly, between the two sides since 1992,
indirect cross-strait dealing has fallen correspondingly.</P>
      <P>Following the establishment in April 1997 of a direct shipping
link between the southern Taiwan port of Kaohsiung and the mainland
city of Fuzhou in coastal Fujian Province, trade volume via Hong Kong
accounted for less than 60 percent of total cross-strait trade. The
figure further plummeted to 55.2 percent in the first five months of
1998, a drop of 2.6 percent from the same period last year, the
statistics show.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is the full text of
Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui's National Day message:
Ladies and Gentlemen:</P>
      <P>Today is the 1998 National Day of the Republic of China. We are
gathered here, our hearts brimming with happiness, to celebrate the
birth of our nation and, at the same time, solemnly take stock of the
development of our country.</P>
      <P>The formidable ordeals we experienced founding our country
constituted a heroic chapter in modern world history, worthy of
poetic praise and tears of gratitude. The recent achievements of the
Republic of China on Taiwan have added one more glorious page to the
history of human civilization. For 87 years, despite the incessant
changes and tribulations on our national front, we have never failed
to adhere to the ideals of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, our Founding Father, and,
hence, have risen above the adversities and defeated the challenges.
We have opened a new era of freedom and prosperity and proved to the
world that truth is invincible and justice is always the winner.</P>
      <P>In the past ten years or more, we have gone one step further to
gradually push forward constitutional reform and consolidate
democracy and the rule of law, in line with Dr. Sun's political ideal
of "popular sovereignty." As a result, we have built a democratic
system of deciding public affairs by the free will of all the people.
We have carried out a "quiet revolution," winning worldwide acclaim
and adding a new source of vigor to the camp of democracy. In the
future, challenges may still come thick and fast from abroad and
home, but we, already on the right side of history, are sure to
overcome all the difficulties and stride forward to a great and
brilliant future as long as we stay the course and remain united as
one.</P>
      <P>Judging from the circumstances that now surround us both at home
and abroad, we must have a firm grasp of the world trend and complete
the following renovations so that our national development may be
further advanced well into the upcoming century.</P>
      <P>With the recent constitutional reform as a guiding principle, we
must streamline the administrative system and reinvent the
government. Legislation for this purpose as well as a series of
action plans have been initiated. They have to be meticulously
formulated and thoroughly implemented in order to attain greater
efficacy in governance and higher national competitiveness. At the
same time, we should take into account the need of long-term national
development and the worldwide trend of development so that we may
have a more forward-looking and better-crafted system of democracy
serving as a firm foundation for sustainable national development.</P>
      <P>We are happy to note that initial headway has been made in our
national effort to foster a happy, orderly and vigorous society based
upon the two pillars of equity and justice. We have scored
preliminary successes in educational reform, judicial renovation, and
law and order. But, new ideas and new problems keep cropping up in a
fast changing society such as ours. We must further improve
long-range planning, continue the reform initiatives, make welfare
services easily accessible, and strengthen the social security
mechanism. It is hoped that the well-being of all the people will
thus be enhanced on the basis of equity and justice. (more)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Good economic fundamentals have enabled us to sustain domestic
prosperity and effectively cope with the sweeping Asian financial
turmoil. In this regard, we have drawn worldwide attention and
praise. From now on, we must devote special efforts to promoting an
even healthier economic structure, removing barriers to investment,
expanding the domestic market, and speeding up industrial upgrading.
At the same time, we must guard against any aftershocks of the
regional financial crisis and be prepared to create a new window of
opportunity for our economy.</P>
      <P>Based upon the principle of persistent defense and effective
deterrence, we will continue with the military consolidation plan and
the deployment of second-generation weaponry and equipment required
for a modern defense force. At the same time, to ensure better
security for our country, we must take advantage of our strategic
position in the Asia-Pacific region and step up dialogue and
cooperation with related nations in the interests of regional
security and peace. As we continue our policy of national security
and regional stability, our citizens must remain vigilant against any
latent danger, recognize that national security guarantees safety for
all, and pledge ourselves as the strongest bulwark for national
security.</P>
      <P>Our pragmatic efforts to participate in the international
community, based on the ideal of mutual assistance and cooperation
for world peace and prosperity, have begun to win recognition and
approval from many nations. Henceforth, on the strength of our
economic prowess and our democratic achievements, we will expand our
presence in international organizations and activities. We will also
increase international exchanges and cooperation, play a more
prominent constructive role, dismantle anachronistic and unreasonable
constraints on the international scene, and help shape a new world
order of peace, cooperation and prosperity in the 21st century.</P>
      <P>We are committed to the ideal of democracy, freedom and equitable
prosperity in pragmatically promoting cross-strait relations. We are
looking forward to constructive dialogue between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait based on the reality of divided rule. The two sides
should promote mutual understanding through exchanges, dispel
hostility through reciprocity, and seek eventual reunification under
democracy by a gradualist approach. At the same time, we hope the
Chinese communist authorities will recognize the world trend of
democratization and thoroughly revamp their social and political
system. For the sake of the long-term well-being of all Chinese
people, they should also adopt a practical attitude, take a broader
view, and foster a peaceful, stable, mutually beneficial and
co-prosperous cross-strait relationship.</P>
      <P>Ladies and Gentlemen: In the 87 years since its founding, the
Republic of China has weathered an endless series of blows and
trials. Throughout, it has stood tall, testifying that our
nation-building spirit remains undiminished and that we have never
stopped striving. Our faith and our feats have profound significance
to the 21.8 million people and their descendants in the Taiwan,
Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu area; they will also greatly influence the
Chinese mainland's future course of development. Looking into the
21st century, I firmly believe that the Republic of China, with its
people united in faith and in action, will shine even more
brilliantly in the future.</P>
      <P>In closing, may I wish the Republic of China great prosperity and
every one of you good health and happiness. Thank you.</P>

trillion in 1997, making it one of the seven largest economies in the
world.</P>
      <P>Its per capita GNP, however, was comparatively minuscule at
US$860, the 82th among the 130 nations and areas.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong, now a special administrative district of mainland

    <HEADLINE>SECOND VISITING FORCES AGREEMENT SIGNED BY US, PHILIPPINES</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>While United States naval ships have been
making port calls in many Asian countries in the last several years,
not one American naval ship has visited the Philippines since
December 1996.</P>
      <P>This seems anomalous, US Ambassador to the Philippines Thomas
Hubbard said on Friday, because the Philippines and the United States
have had the longest-running cooperation, particularly in military
cooperation, in Asia.</P>
      <P>Hubbard aired this observation during an informal chat with the
media following the signing of the Visiting Forces Agreement 2 (VFA2)
which governs Filipino military personnel visits to the United
States, either on official military business or for study.</P>
      <P>The VFA2 complements the VFA signed in February last year which

    <HEADLINE>US SENATE APPROVES LEGISLATION ON RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  9  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>the US Senate unanimously approved
legislation on Friday that would require the US government to monitor
and take action against foreign governments that engage in systematic
acts of religious persecution.</P>
      <P>When asked to gauge how the bill might impact mainland China,
Saudi Arabia, and Russia, Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat
said the sponsors of the bill made clear that they intend to promote
religious freedom and tolerance without targeting any particular
religion or region.</P>
      <P>"With the changes that we have now negotiated," Eizenstat
stressed, "the bill advances the cause of religious freedom while
giving the president the flexibility he needs, and without
undermining relations with important countries around the world,
which have been among the causes of our objections to earlier
versions of similar legislation."</P>
      <P>The International Religious Freedom Act, passed by a 98-0 vote,
would create a federal office responsible for monitoring the
treatment of religious minorities in countries where the US
Department of State has documented acts of religious persecution.</P>
      <P>If a pattern of religious persecution is identified, the act
provides for the US president to use a series of sanctions. These
would include diplomatic responses, such as public condemnation and
cancellation of scientific and cultural exchanges, as well as certain
economic sanctions.</P>
      <P>The sanctions are milder than those of earlier versions of the
legislation, which the Clinton administration opposed. The
legislation has been sharply debated both in the House of
Representatives and the Senate.</P>
      <P>Critics charge that it could hurt the president's ability to
conduct foreign policy, make it difficult to use quiet diplomacy, and
create a hierarchy of victims, where those claiming religious
persecution would receive preference.</P>

      <P>The United States announced on Friday
the possible sale to Taiwan of nine Chinook heavylift helicopters,

      <P>The proposed sale, worth US$486 million, includes nine Boeing

      <P>The CH-47SD is the latest and most advanced Chinook model,
generally considered the world's most efficient heavylift helicopter.
In one of its earlier configurations, the craft can seat 44 persons

      <P>On Thursday, the United Overseas Bank shaved 25 basis points off
its prime lending rate to 7 percent. This is its second cut in less

off another round of interest rate cuts.</P>

such unprecedented low levels, most are of the view that lending
rates will fall at least another 100 basis points from the current 7

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China patriots living in
Hong Kong issued a joint statement on Saturday reiterating their
support for the goal of China's reunification espoused by the ROC.</P>
      <P>More than 1,000 representatives of Hong Kong's cultural,
educational, press, motion picture, and business sectors got together
at Kowloon's Hotel Regency on Saturday for a rally marking the ROC's
Double Ten National Day.</P>
      <P>The statement said that although Hong Kong's international status
and situation have changed over the last year, their steadfast belief
in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ideal of building a free, democratic and
prosperous China remain unchanged.</P>
      <P>It expressed the hope that Hong Kong, which has weathered many
twists and turns over the past year, will become more economically
and politically stable, so that the special administrative region
will play a more active role in pushing for China's modernization.</P>
      <P>The statement urged the Hong Kong administration to strengthen
bilateral relations between Taiwan and Hong Kong, and make more
efforts to bolster Hong Kong's entrepot role between Taiwan and
mainland China.</P>
      <P>In order to bring about China's ultimate reunification, the
statement called for both sides of the Taiwan Strait to bury the
hatchet and help each other.</P>
      <P>In a keynote speech to the rally, Cheng An-kuo, Taipei's chief
representative in Hong Kong, said that after Hong Kong's handover to
mainland Chinese rule in July 1997, Taiwan-Hong Kong relations have
become part of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Cheng said he hopes that as cross-strait relations gradually
improve, Taiwan-Hong Kong ties will simultaneously improve.</P>
      <P>He also expressed regret at Hong Kong administration authorities'
forcible removal of ROC national flags from Hong Kong streets on
Saturday morning.</P>
      <P>He said it is regretful that the Hong Kong authorities
demonstrated disrespect towards the Hong Kong people, who displayed
the ROC banners to show their respects to the memory of the ROC's

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Saturday called
for the establishment of a more forward-looking and better-crafted
system of democracy to serve as a firm foundation for sustainable
national development.</P>
      <P>Lee made the appeal in an address delivered at a mass rally in
front of the Presidential Office in downtown Taipei to mark the
Republic of China's 87th Double Ten National Day.</P>
      <P>"In the approach to the new millennium, we should be committed to
the tasks of government restructuring and consolidation of
constitutional democracy in order to upgrade national competitiveness
and ensure sustainable national development," he stressed.</P>
      <P>The president also pledged to promote peaceful exchanges and
constructive dialogue with mainland China on an equal and reciprocal
basis.</P>
      <P>"We look forward to developing mutually beneficial and prosperous
relations with mainland China for the sake of the long-term
well-being of all Chinese people," Lee said.</P>
      <P>He also called on the Beijing authorities to recognize the world
trend of democratization and thoroughly revamp their social and
political systems.</P>
      <P>Based on the principle of persistent defense and effective
deterrence, Lee said, the ROC will go ahead with its military
consolidation plan and the deployment of second-generation weaponry
and equipment required for a modern defense force.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's pragmatic efforts to participate in the
international community have begun to win recognition and approval
from many nations, Lee said the ROC will continue to expand its
presence in international organizations and activities on the
strength of its economic prowess and democratic achievements.</P>
      <P>Lee went on to say that the ROC has weathered many blows and
trials since its founding as the first democratic republic in Asia 87
years ago.</P>
      <P>"Throughout, our country has stood tall, testifying that our
nation-building spirit remains undiminished and that we have never
stopped striving," the president said, adding that the ROC's feats
not only have profound significance to the 21.8 million people and
their descendants in the Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu area, but
will also greatly influence mainland China's future course of
development.</P>
      <P>"Looking into the 21st century, I firmly believe that the
Republic of China, with its people united in faith and in action,
will shine even more brilliantly in the future," Lee added.</P>
      <P>The mass rally brought together thousands of local people from
all walks of life as well as many foreign dignitaries and overseas
Chinese community leaders to celebrate the ROC's birthday.</P>
      <P>Among the foreign guests were Burkina Faso President Blaise
Compaore and Grenada Prime Minister Keith C. Mitchell.</P>
      <P>The rally was presided over by Legislative Yuan President Liu
Sung-fan, who urged his fellow countrymen to stand united and work
hand-in-hand to create an even brighter future for the country.</P>
      <P>Prior to the rally, students from selected senior high schools
and universities in major cities around the island gave colorful
dancing and folk art performances, adding much fanfare and creating a
youthful, exuberant and joyful festive mood.</P>
      <P>The carnival-style performances highlighted the theme of this
year's National Day celebrations -- promoting spiritual reform and
creating a peaceful, harmonious living environment.</P>
      <P>Following the rally, the student performers paraded through the
streets of downtown Taipei, drawing large crowds of spectators.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, President Lee presided over a ceremony in the
auditorium of the Presidential Office as part of the National Day
celebrations.</P>
      <P>Later in the afternoon, many civilian troupes gave dazzling folk
art and stunning acrobatic performances on the Presidential Office
plaza. Meanwhile, breakthtaking massive fireworks display on the west
side of Taipei has been scheduled for later in the evening.</P>
      <P>Similar festivities were held simultaneously in other cities
throughout the island to mark the festive occasion.</P>
      <P>About 7,000 overseas Chinese representatives from 50 countries
and areas around the world have come back to Taiwan to take part in
various National Day celebration activities, according to statistics

    <HEADLINE>DOMESTIC GASOLINE PRICES TO BE CUT BY 2-TO-3 PERCENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  10  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp.
(CPC) is expected to announce yet another oil price cut on Tuesday
to reflect its slumping production costs, the United Evening News
reported on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The paper said the oil price consultative panel under
the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) already agreed on Friday to
authorize the CPC to further lower prices for its products in the
near future.</P>
      <P>Barring unexpected developments, the paper said, the CPC will
make a formal announcement on Tuesday and the new prices will take
effect on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>This will be the fifth time since July that the state monopoly
has offered an across-the-board price cut for its products amid a
downward spiral in international crude oil prices.</P>
      <P>The evening paper quoted an unnamed member of the MOEA's oil
price advisory panel as saying that the upcoming price cut will
exceed 2 percent or even approach 3 percent.</P>
      <P>The member predicted that the retail price for premium gasoline
will be lowered by NT$0.3 to NT$0.4 per liter, while that for
diesel will be cut by NT$0.2 to NT$0.3. The domestic gasoline price
now stands at NT$17.4 (US$0.52) per liter.</P>
      <P>Thanks to a significant increase in its production and a drop
in production costs, the CPC had raked in NT$4.66 billion in
excess profits between July and September. The excess profits refer
to the earnings that exceed the legislatively mandated profit
ceiling.</P>
      <P>CPC sources said although international crude oil prices are
rising because of the advent of winter, when the demand for oil
usually rises in the Northern Hemisphere countries, the upward swing
is expected to remain modest.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the sources said, the recent appreciation of the New
Taiwan dollar is making crude oil even less costly for the CPC to
import.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the CPC's upcoming oil price cut may
be larger than expected.</P>
      <P>The CPC has lowered its prices by a total of 5.69 percent since
July. Under current government regulations, the CPC is allowed to
adjust its prices within a range of 6 percent over three consecutive
months. Beyond this range, it must obtain prior approval from the
MOEA's oil price consultative panel.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Twenty children, who have undergone
live-liver transplants at the Kaohsiung Chang Kung Memorial Hospital
in the past few years, gathered at the hospital on Friday to
celebrate their second chance at life.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung hospital began conducting liver transplants in 1993
and has completed 44 liver transplants to date. The survival rate for
liver transplants is 89 percent, but that for live-liver transplants
is 100 percent, said Dr. Chen Chao-lung, chief surgeon of the
hospital's liver transplant team.</P>
      <P>All 20 live-liver transplant recipients were children, Chen
added. In 17 cases, mothers donated their livers while fathers were
the donors in three cases.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that all the donors and recipients continue to be in
very good medical condition. But as a side effect of long-term use of
anti-resistance drugs, recipients have denser and darker eyebrows.</P>
      <P>The 20 children were invited to attend a party given by the
Kaohsiung hospital to celebrate their new lease on life. They sang "A
Heart With Gratitude" to express their heartfelt gratitude toward the
surgeons and the staff.</P>
      <P>Transplants are the last resort for patients with liver disease.
Most of the 20 live-liver recipients suffered from closed gall ducts
which blocked the flow of bile into their intestines.</P>
      <P>The waiting list for those in need of liver transplants at the
Chang Kung Hospital is between 40-50 people, Chen said. He urged the
public to help these people by donating their livers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC President Lee Teng-hui said in a British
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) interview that the ROC's success in
promoting democracy and economic liberalization can be a model for
mainland China's reforms.</P>
      <P>In an interview with former Hong Kong Governor Christopher
Patten, Lee urged Beijing to take advantage of the "Taiwan
experience" in promoting cross-strait ties as it is better than only
considering economic interests.</P>
      <P>Lee was responding to Patten's question on whether a democratic
Taiwan can help mainland China to peacefully reform its system.</P>
      <P>The interview is part of a special series Patten produced for the
BBC regarding his five years as governor in the former British
colony. Patten handed Hong Kong's sovereignty over to Beijing last
year.</P>
      <P>In the BBC program, Patten described the political and economic
development of Taiwan and mainland China and how the two sides
separated in a civil war in 1949.</P>
      <P>He praised the ROC's efforts in achieving democratic progress and
gaining economic prosperity, pointing out that Taiwan is one of the
richest places in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Patten also said although Beijing is still reluctant to recognize
Taiwan's status as a sovereign entity, and most people in Taiwan do
not seek the island's independence, none in Taiwan are willing to
give up their freedoms, capitalist system and sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Despite having undergone martial law for many years, Taiwan has
transformed into a democratic country after voters elected their
first president in 1995, Patten said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Beijing's economic efforts, Patten stressed he
believes sooner or later the mainland will also undergo political
transformation like other places in the world.</P>
      <P>Patten's interview with Lee will be broadcasted on the BBC 2

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bien would accept
Kuomintang mayoral candidate Ma Ying-Jeou's challenge to debate in
public their agenda for the city, said Chen's campaign manager Lo
Wen-chia on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen, who has shunned the challenge until now, would like to
confront his two competitors in public forum, but only separately,
that means he would debate with Ma first, then with New Party
candidate Wang Chien-shien, said Lo.</P>
      <P>And, in response to Ma's previous demand that the it to be held
the sooner the better, the first debate with Ma should be staged
within three days, said Lo.</P>
      <P>The three would appear on the same stage only after Ma and Wang
have argued with each other, said Lo.</P>
      <P>He urged Ma to response to his offer positively, instead of
demanding the three argued in a forum at the same time.</P>
      <P>Ma, through one of his staff Chin Fu-chung, welcomed Chen's
long-awaited reply to his demand for debate on Aug. 26, but dismissed
the three-day deadline as irresponsible because it would take more
time than three days to held discussion among the three candidates on
the form and way to conduct the debate and asked well-respected
social bodies or mass media to sponsor it.</P>
      <P>Chin counter-offered to hold the public debate once per week in
the remaining eight weeks leading to the Dec. 5 poll. It should be
conducted by the candidates themselves, rather than their campaigning
teams as Chen advocated previously, and between the three candidates
instead of the two.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile Wang said he would accepted Chen's offer although he
thought Lo speaking with tongue in cheek, because separate debate
would deprive audience the valuable opportunity to examine the
candidates' views simultaneously.</P>
      <P>He suspected Chen's initial is aimed to weary the voters and
dilute the significance of the debate. Wang also dismissed Chen's
idea of having his staff to contradict other candidates' criticism in
public debate as no other than having candidates' wives argue against
each other.</P>
      <P>Knowing Chen's offer to debate is but a trick, Wang said, as a
minor party candidate, he preferred accepting it on Chen's terms to
reject it and lost the opportunity to float his campaign promises.</P>

      <P>A well-known American China hand said on
Friday that resolving the so-called "Taiwan issue" has become the
main concern in mainland China's military acquisition strategy.</P>
      <P>David Shambaugh, director of a China research program at the
George Washington University, further said even though mainland China
is now not strong enough to attack Taiwan, it can still use its
ballistic missiles to pose a serious threat to the island.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on mainland China's ongoing military
modernization plan, Shambaugh said the foremost task of the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) at the moment is to prepare for a possible
attack on Taiwan under Beijing's order.</P>
      <P>As a result, Shambaugh said Beijing's current military purchase
strategy is aimed at acquiring the capabilities it presently does not
have.</P>
      <P>For instance, he said, the PLA hopes to acquire the ability in
five to seven years to blockade Taiwan's major sea ports and to
enable at least 750,000 of its amphibious troops to land on the
island.</P>
      <P>At the moment, Shambaugh said, mainland China's air force still
cannot control the skies over the Taiwan Strait, not to mention
Taiwan's air space. The combat capabilities of its naval and
amphibious forces are also limited.</P>
      <P>"However, this does not mean that mainland China cannot mount
troubles or threats to Taiwan at present," Shambaugh warned, adding
that Taiwan is facing increasing threats from Beijing's M-11 missiles
and cruise missiles.</P>
      <P>Taking the 1995-96 Taiwan Strait crisis as an example, Shambaugh
said Taiwan's stock market plunged some 25 percent during the period
when mainland China test fired several M-class missiles into waters
near Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The next time that mainland China may take "action" against
Taiwan is probably in the run-up to Taiwan's next presidential
election in the year 2000, he predicted.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Chen shui-bien has accepted
Kuomintang mayoral candidate Ma Ying-jeou's challenge to a public
debate, Chen's campaign manager Lo Wen-chia said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen said he would like to debate his two rivals including New
Party candidate Wang Chien-shien, but only separately and within the
next three days, Lo stated.</P>
      <P>The mayor has ducked the issue of a debate since Ma first laid
down the challenge in late August.</P>
      <P>According to Chin Fu-chung, a member of Ma's campaign staff, the
KMT candidate has welcomed Chen's response, but said the three-day
deadline is not sufficient to organize the debate's format, media
sponsors and venue.</P>
      <P>Speaking for Ma, Chin suggested that a public debate be held
every week until the Dec. 5 election. The candidates themselves
should respond to comments instead of campaign staff as the mayor has
suggested, and all three candidates should appear instead of only two
at a time, Chin added.</P>
      <P>New Party candidate Wang said although he is not happy with the
mayor's conditions, he would be willing to meet Chen and Ma in a
public debate.</P>
      <P>Wang also noted that the public needs the opportunity to examine
all three candidates' views simultaneously. He said he suspects
Chen's strategy is to wear down the voters' endurance and dilute the
significance of the debate with this two-man format.</P>
      <P>He dismissed Chen's suggestion that staff members counter
candidates' criticisms in the debate. He compared the scenario to
having the candidates' wives argue against each other.</P>
      <P>Regardless of these flaws in Chen's offer, Wang said as a minor
candidate, he preferred accepting it to rejecting it and losing the
opportunity to promote his campaign promises.</P>

said Chuang Chin-ho, a driving school owner in Chungli City.</P>
      <P>On Saturday morning, a giant ROC national flag -- the white sun
in a blue sky over a crimson ground banner -- was flying in front of
Chuang's driving school next to the Chungli highway. Some drivers
passing by were stunned by the size of the flag which is about 22
feet by 14 feet.</P>
      <P>Despite being called a "nut" by some people for flying such an
enormous flag, Chuang said he was exhilarated to do so on National

      <P>After traveling around the world and experiencing discrimination
and humiliation, Chuang said all he wanted to do on National Day was
to fly a giant flag.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China's Defense Ministry on
Saturday welcomed the US government's decision to sell nine Boeing
CH-47SD Chinook helicopters to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Defense Ministry officials said the deal will be effective within
a month, but Boeing data indicated that the nine CH-47SD helicopters
will not roll off the assembly lines until the end of 1999.</P>
      <P>The CH-47SD helicopter is the latest and most advanced Chinook
model, generally considered the world's most efficient heavy-lift
helicopter.</P>
      <P>ROC officials said the nine CH-47SD helicopters, once delivered,
will form an airborne battalion within the ROC Army's airborne
brigade.</P>
      <P>The new sale, which involves the nine helicopters and other
military equipment totaling US$486 million in value, was announced by
the Pentagon on Friday.</P>
      <P>ROC officials disclosed that the United States had earlier sold
four Boeing B234 helicopters, the same model as the CH-47D, to Taiwan
in a commercial deal.</P>
      <P>They said the US decision to sell nine Ch-47SD helicopters to the
ROC in a military deal indicated that Washington has not changed its
policy of selling arms to Taiwan after President Bill Clinton's

      <P>According to military data, the CH-47SD helicopter is capable of
carrying 25,000 pounds or 37 armed personnel, with a maximum flight
distance of 1,200 kilometers. It can be used for transporting troops,
artillery, fuel, raw material and water, as well as for ambulance and
fire-fighting missions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THE STORY OF HUNG-MAO CHENG (FORT SANTO DOMINGO)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11   (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hung-Mao Cheng, which translated means
red-haired fort, was originally called Fort Santo Domingo. It is one
of the oldest places of interest in northern Taiwan and is an ideal
place for vacations and recreation in the outskirts of Taipei City.</P>
      <P>The story of Hung-Mao Cheng dates back to the end of the 15th
century, when burgeoning mercantilism brought European ships to the
Far East. The Portuguese headed east with the aim of reaching India
and China, while the Spaniards, who had the same goal, headed in the
opposite direction and accidentally discovered South America.</P>
      <P>The Portuguese, while on their way to China, passed by the island
of Taiwan and were so taken by its physical beauty they named it Ilha
Formosa, or "beautiful island". However, only a few of them
have landed here and stayed temporarily. Instead, the Dutch with
their early sea power set to monopolize trade with China and sent
troops to strategic locations in the area. They eventually invaded
and occupied Taiwan during the Ming dynasty of China.</P>
      <P>Spain had earlier invaded and occupied the Philippines in 1571
and had planned to attack Taiwan since Japan, under the
administration of Hideyoshi Toyotomi, cracked down on Spanish
missionaries and were mistreating them. Japan had also planned to
invade Taiwan and use the island as a springboard in its attack of
the Philippines.</P>
      <P>However, Toyotomi died and Japan was ruled by Ieyasu Tokugawa who
took a friendlier position toward Spain by enhancing mutual trade
relations. Spain then dropped its plan to invade Taiwan.</P>
      <P>When the Dutch occupied the Tainan region in 1624 and built Fort
Zeelandia in southern Taiwan, the Spanish found their trade with both
Taiwan and Japan seriously threatened. To safeguard their interests,
Spanish troops launched an attack from the Philippines in 1626 and
occupied northern Taiwan. They built Fort San Salvador on Hoping
Island and placed Keelung under its control.</P>
      <P>The Spaniards extended their sphere of influence gradually to
Fuwei, now known as Tamsui, and in 1629 establish Fort San Domingo,
totally controling the sea lane off northern Taiwan. The twin forts
interlocked and protected each other and became important commercial
destinations and military fortresses at the time.</P>
      <P>However, in 1642, northern Taiwan was hit by a plague. With
reduced trade activities, many Spanish people and troops withdrew
from both Fort San Salvador and Fort San Domingo. The Dutch troops
seized the opportunity to despatch a large number of troops to attack
north Taiwan. After a six-day battle, the Spanish troops were
defeated and ended their 16 years of occupation.</P>
      <P>As the Dutch were expanding their hold on both south and north
Taiwan, the Ming dynasty was collapsing and the Manchu troops rushed
to fill the vacuum. Many Ming loyalists, including Cheng Cheng-kung
(also known as Koxinga) escaped to southern China to resist the
Manchus over the next 20 years.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Dutch gradually expanded their power to western
Taiwan and colonized the island for 38 years until 1661 when Cheng
Cheng-kung claimed Taiwan from the Dutch after a series of fierce
battles.</P>
      <P>Cheng choose Anping (or modern-day Tainan) as his capital, and
ordered General Ho Yu to station himself at Port San Domingo to guard
against the return of the Dutch.</P>
      <P>Cheng succumbed to a serious illness and died in 1662 at the age
of only 38. He was succeeded by his son, Cheng Ching. In 1683, the
Manchu court sent Shih Lang, a Cheng Cheng-kung's general who had
defected to the Manchu Emperor, to attack Taiwan. Cheng's navy was
defeated and the Cheng family surrendered to the Ching dynasty.</P>
      <P>Although the Manchus took over the island of Taiwan and in the
following year made it a prefecture of Fukien Province, they did not
send troops to Fort San Domingo. The fortress gradually collapsed due
to neglect.

    <TEXT>
      <P>After the Manchus took over Taiwan in 1683, many officials
advocated the immediate abandonment of the island because of its
remoteness. The Ching court, though, finally adopted Shih Lang's
suggestion to retain its rule over Taiwan. The change of policy by
the Yung Cheng Emperor who banned Christianity in 1724 resulted in
the repair of Fort San Domingo, and troops were sent there because of
its important strategic position.</P>
      <P>During the entire 18th century and the early 19th century, the
Ching court adopted a virtual closed door policy toward the Western
world. The European powers, however, were not content to allow China
to remain isolated, as they coveted Chinese markets and resources.</P>
      <P>After the so-called "Opium War" of 1839-42, the Treaty of Nanking
was signed on Aug. 29, 1842. It proved to be the most important
treaty in China's modern history, for it was the first of a series of
unequal treaties signed with Western powers.</P>
      <P>With the signing in 1860 of the Treaty of Tientsin, which
stipulated that Fuwei (Tamsui) was to be opened for British trade and
a consulate was to be established there, the British consulate in
Tainan was moved to Tamsui in 1861. The consulate then moved into
Fort San Domingo in 1868 after the Ching court signed another treaty
in 1867 providing England a permanent lease of Fort San Domingo.</P>
      <P>The Great Britain, which leased Fort San Domingo for 104 years
without paying any rent, recognized Beijing in 1950 and asked
Australia to look after Fort San Domingo. In 1972 when the
Commonwealth of Australia established diplomatic ties with Beijing,
the management of the fort was transferred to the United States,
which in turn moved its embassy from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.</P>
      <P>The history of Hung-Mao Cheng, which was returned to the
government of the Republic of China in 1980 after active negotiations
with the British government, is the epitome of all the miseries and
hardships suffered by China in the past few centuries.</P>
      <P>In the summer of 1629, the Spaniards entered Tamsui. They named
the place Castillo, and built Fort San Domingo. Castillo, which is
located on the north bank of the estuary of the Tamsui River, is the
oldest town in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition to its military usefulness, Castillo served as a
habitat for deer and proved to be sitting atop land rich in such
natural resources as coal and brimstone.</P>
      <P>With deer-hide being a main commodity by that time, the Dutch in
southern Taiwan made many attempts to drive the Spanish out of
the north. Finally, in the summer of 1642, the Spaniards, threatened
by a native rebellion in the Philippines, were forced to recall
three-quarters of their troops from Taiwan. The Dutch then landed at
Castillo and conquered it.</P>
      <P>After the Dutch became the new rulers of Castillo, the Chinese
people there described the Dutch as "red-haired" and called Fort San
Domingo Hung-Mao Cheng (red-haired fort).

      <P>Standing at a height of 30 Chinese feet and a circumference of
200 Chinese feet, the red-haired fort was prominent in its location
on Tamsui mountain. However, most of the fortress has now collapsed.</P>
      <P>After the Dutch were driven out by Cheng's troops, the local
inhabitants, most of them farmers, disliked the place because of the
heavy smell of sulfur emanating from the nearby Tatun mountain and
because the surrounding areas are mostly hills and swamps, difficult
for the development of agriculture.</P>
      <P>Near the fortress sits a two-story consulate building which was
built much later in a typical British colonial style of architecture.
There is a marked difference between the verandahs on the first and
second floors as Spanish influence was heavy at the time. The
verandahs were constructed out of bricks without any concrete, and
wards off the sun and rain.</P>
      <P>Most of the construction materials used in the consulate building
were produced in the region with the bricks from Chingsui, roof tiles
from Fukien province, and floor boards from Java. After the British
obtained rights to the permanent lease of Hung-Mao Cheng, they added
observation towers and short walls on the old citadel, and changed
the fortress' color to red.</P>
      <P>The transportation of commodities in northern Taiwan used to
depend heavily on the Tamsui River. Following the development of more
land-bound infrastructure and the accumulation of silt in the river,
the once-prosperous Tamsui which attracted greedy-eyed foreigners
gradually lost its luster.</P>
      <P>With its low tilted-roof buildings, rickety old streets and
broken brick walls, it is difficult for some people to imagine Tamsui
as the bustling center of trade in the region. But visit the
red-haired fort during sunset and enjoy the gentle evening breeze
while you watch the twilight reflect its fading light on the
fortress, then you might better see how it all was in time long past.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A higher percentage of Taiwan's population
is dying from kidney-related problems than of other advanced nations,
the Department of Health (DOH) reported on Sunday.</P>
      <P>DOH officials also said that the number of patients with kidney
problems that require dialysis increased 36.6 percent over the past
three years. The number of dialysis patients in Taiwan now exceeds
28,000.</P>
      <P>That means one out of every 775 kidney patients on the island
needs a kidney dialysis, a higher ratio than in Japan or the United
States.</P>
      <P>A kidney specialist said that the aging of the population has led
to a higher number of cases of high blood pressure and diabetes among
the old, while the increased consumption of western-style fast food
has resulted in a large number of overweight youngsters. These people
are more likely to develop kidney problems later.</P>
      <P>The specialist noted that after the 1980s, kidney problems were
the eighth-leading cause of death for local men and the sixth-leading
cause of death for local women.</P>
      <P>Between 1993 and 1997, 784 kidney transplants were carried out.
On average one out of every 159 kidney dialysis patients has needed a
kidney transplant, compared with one out of every 229 dialysis
patients in Japan.</P>

      <P>The 11 delegates who will accompany Koo on his Shanghai-Beijing

      <P>Koo and the 11 delegates selected from the National Unification
Council (NUC), the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and
the quasi-official SEF will leave for mainland China on Wednesday for
a six-day visit.</P>
      <P>The visit marks a major breakthrough in the long-stalled
relations across the Taiwan Strait. Senior ROC officials have said
Koo's mainland trip is expected to help foster an amiable atmosphere
and improve cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairman Chang King-yuh will formally present authorization
certificates to Koo and other delegates before their meeting with
Premier Siew.</P>
      <P>SEF, a semi-official intermediary body authorized by the ROC
government to handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence of
official ties, is under MAC's supervision.</P>
      <P>Chang said on Sunday that Koo will be authorized to conduct
"constructive dialogue" with mainland authorities during his
visit.</P>
      <P>"The constructive dialogue refers to talks that will benefit
both sides of the Taiwan Strait," Chang explained, adding that Koo
will be authorized to freely exchange views with mainland
negotiators or leaders on a broad range of issues, including such
sensitive topics as the opening of direct cross-strait "three
links"; Taiwan's "go slow, be patient" policy on investment in
mainland China; and even the proposed exchanges of visits by top
leaders on the two sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>"Koo can also decide on his own whether to invite his mainland
counterpart, Chairman Wang Daohan of the Beijing-based Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), to visit Taiwan,"
Chang said.</P>
      <P>He further stressed that the top goal of Koo's mainland trip is
to help ease and improve cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>On Monday, Chang will also brief Koo and members of his mission
on the basic government stance on cross-strait relations and the
current cross-strait situation.</P>
      <P>In addition to holding wide-ranging talks with ARATS Chairman
Wang, Koo will also meet with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and Vice Premier Qian Qichen during his stay in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Koo and Wang met for the first time in Singapore in April 1993
to lay a framework for institutionalized cross-strait dialogue.
However, Beijing unilaterally suspended such regular contacts
shortly after ROC President Lee Teng-hui made a landmark visit to
the United States in June 1995. Beijing regarded Lee's visit as

    <DATELINE>New  York,  Oct.  10 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The upcoming mainland visit by Straits
Exchange Foundation Chairman Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's top negotiator
with mainland China, is expected to improve current relations between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Business Week magazine reported
in it newest issue.</P>
      <P>In a bid to carry out the long-awaited second meeting between Koo
and his mainland Chinese counterpart, Wang Daohan, chairman of the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, both Taiwan and
mainland China have made compromises, said Business Week in a
Taipei-dispatched story.</P>
      <P>Taiwan canceled an annual military drill originally slated for
Oct. 12, while the mainland agreed to focus the meeting on the
discussion of technical matters of major concern to people on both
sides, such as fishery disputes, by temporarily putting aside the
controversial "one China" issue, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years, Beijing has showed great changes in
its attitude toward Taipei, shifting from posing military threats to
offering an olive branch, the report said. It attributed Beijing's
changes to mainland China's strong demand for Taiwan capital and
technology while in the process of its economic reforms.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, bringing Taiwan to the track of unification
will help mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin consolidate his
leadership role and create a legacy in history.</P>
      <P>Citing recent remarks made by mainland Chinese Foreign Minister
Tang Jiaxuan that Taiwan will be able to enjoy greater freedom than
Hong Kong if it unifies with mainland China, the report said Tang's
statement indicates that Beijing is seeking to sell a "one country,
three systems" formula to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme, Taiwan can have its own military and ranking
Taiwan officials would be allowed to work for the mainland Chinese
government. The report called these proposals as "very friendly"
gestures to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The report stressed, however, that judging the situation from all
aspects, time will be on mainland China's side if Taiwan continues to
respond coolly to mainland China's overtures.</P>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton's public declaration of his support for
the "three noes" policy toward Taiwan during a visit to mainland
China this summer has already constituted a major diplomatic defeat
for Taiwan, and Taiwan will lose more diplomatic partners if it
continues to turn down Beijing's "reasonable proposals," the magazine
warned.</P>
      <P>The "three noes" refer to no support for Taiwan independence, no
support for "one China, one Taiwan" or "two Chinas," and no support
for Taiwan's membership in international organizations for which
statehood is required.</P>
      <P>Currently, only 27 countries maintain formal diplomatic ties with
the Republic of China on Taiwan. Most of the ROC's diplomatic allies
are African and Central American countries.</P>

safety of Taiwan people and their property in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Their hopes rose after the government said that the meeting

"constructive dialogue."</P>
      <P>Lin Ping-hui, father of kidnapped and murdered Kaohsiung City
Councilwoman Lin Ti-chuan, said that he was still overcome with grief

      <P>Lin hoped that mainland authorities can put into law the
protection of the safety of Taiwan people and their property.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan people who were murdered in the mainland

Taiwan people, which he said is seen as the basic solution by Taiwan
people in the mainland.</P>

to him, he believed that it was because of the special status of his
daughter. He doubted other Taiwan people would get the same kind of
treatment.</P>
      <P>As Li Guangzhi, the prime suspect of the Lin's murder, is still
at large, Lin has commissioned lawyers to file criminal and civil
suits in the mainland.</P>
      <P>He said that he was informed that the case will be tried in three
months and that he would definitely travel to the mainland to hear
the testimony of the accomplices.</P>
      <P>In tandem with Lin's death, a Taiwan businessman, Wang Fu-ching,
was also murdered in the mainland. His ashes were returned to Taiwan
but the murderer remains at large.</P>
      <P>Wang's brother, Wang Fu-Kuan, said that there are many Taiwan
people dying for unaccountable reasons. He expressed the hope that C.
F. Koo, Taiwan's top negotiator with the mainland, could convey the
sense to the mainland that Beijing should protect the rights of
Taiwan people there through legal channel.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC HAILS US HOUSE SUPPORT FOR ITS PARTICIPATION IN WHO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China on Sunday hailed the
passage of a resolution by the US House of Representatives supporting
its participation in the World Health Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>"We welcome the House resolution. It certainly will have a
positive bearing on our bid to return to the WHO," said Chan
Chi-shean, director-general of the Department of Health (DOH).</P>
      <P>Chan made the remarks after the US House overwhelmingly approved
on Saturday a concurrent resolution calling on the Clinton
administration to support Taiwan's participation in the WHO, a United
Nations-affiliated body.</P>
      <P>The non-binding resolution was approved by a vote of 418-0. The
resolution falls short of asking for Taiwan's full membership in the
WHO. Instead, the resolution said it should be a US policy "to
pursue some initiative in the WHO which will give Taiwan meaningful
participation."</P>
      <P>Chan said returning to the WHO is a common goal of both the
ruling and opposition parties here and that the greatest obstacle to
this goal lies in mainland China's opposition.</P>
      <P>"The US House resolution indicates that the concerted efforts of
our government and people in promoting our WHO bid have gradually
borne fruit," Chan said.</P>
      <P>The ROC was originally a WHO founding member, but lost its seat
in the organization in 1972 after losing its UN membership in 1971.</P>
      <P>Chan said Taiwan should not continue to be shut out of the WHO
because the organization mainly deals with health issues which
should not factor in any political disputes or considerations.</P>
      <P>"Health knows no national boundary. The WHO should not reject
our participation simply for political reasons," Chan stressed.</P>
      <P>Chan said the ROC is now capable of paying the international
community back for its help in the past. "We are willing to share
our experience and achievements in the public health field with
other countries, such as vaccination and information about some
contagious diseases," he noted.</P>
      <P>During Saturday's debate, a US House representative especially
lauded Taiwan for its efforts to fight an enterovirus outbreak this
summer.</P>
      <P>Chan said the DOH has never ceased its contacts with health
authorities in other countries to seek their understanding and
support of the ROC's cause.</P>
      <P>"We have sent letters to many countries around the world
informing them of our experience in handling the enterovirus
epidemic," Chan said, adding that health agencies in the United
States and many European countries have contacted the DOH for more
information about the disease.</P>
      <P>Chan went on to say that the ROC will be able to contribute more
to world health promotion and disease prevention and control if it
is re-admitted to the WHO.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chan said WHO entry will enable Taiwan to further
upgrade its health and medical services to improve health of its
people.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's strong opposition, the WHO consistently
rejected in the past two years the inclusion into the agenda for
its annual meeting of Taiwan's application for entering the WHO as an
observer.</P>
      <P>The US House resolution recognizes that "Taiwan does not fulfill
the criteria for membership," but points out that the WHO does allow
observers to participate in its activities.</P>
      <P>Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the original sponsor of the resolution,
said that the House has acted to "advance our effort to help Taiwan
people obtain first-rate medical care."</P>
      <P>"The resolution approved today is a good compromise measure,
reached with solid bipartisan support," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW PARTY SPIRITUAL LEADER MAY SUPPORT KMT MAYORAL CANDIDATE?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The New Party's spiritual leader, Hsu
Li-nung, may support the Kuomintang's Taipei mayoral candidate, Ma
Ying-jeou, rather than the New Party's candidate, Wang Chien-hsien,
according to reports.</P>
      <P>Hsu would neither confirm nor deny the reports.</P>
      <P>Responding to this development, Wang said on Sunday, "that would
be purely Hsu's personal decision."</P>
      <P>Hsu, a vice chairman of the National Unification Council, has
been an influential elder within the New Party.</P>
      <P>The China Times said on Sunday that Hsu said on Saturday that the
New Party's Wang is a good candidate, but, in consideration of the
nation's future development, he would support Ma in the upcoming
mayoral election in December.</P>
      <P>Hsu reportedly said that if he backs the New Party's Wang, it
might negatively affect Ma and help the incumbent mayor, Democratic
Progressive Party member Chen Shui-bian, get re-elected.</P>
      <P>He reportedly pointed out that national affairs come before party
affairs, and that therefore, he has made the painful choice to
support Ma.</P>
      <P>He said that a news reporter asked him on Saturday night whom he
would support in the mayoral election. Instead of answering, Hsu
asked the reporter "What do you think?"</P>
      <P>Hsu said the reporter made a number of remarks and that what
appeared in the paper on Sunday were the reporter's remarks.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian said that the reports seemingly
indicate that "Ma is the New Party's candidate."</P>
      <P>Ma's campaign managers said on Sunday that although Ma is a
candidate nominated by the Kuomintang, he would seek support from all
parties.</P>
      <P>They rejected the DPP's claim that "Ma is the New Party's
candidate," saying that such slander was aimed at confusing the
voters. Ma's aides noted that in a previous mayoral race in Hsinchu,
Hsu openly sided with the DPP's candidate, Tsai Jen-chien. "Then can
we say that Tsai was a New Party candidate?" they asked.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan people made a total of 4.08 million
visits overseas in the first eight months of this year, down 6
percent from the same period in 1997, according to the Cabinet-level
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>In terms of the number of visits, Asian countries are the most
popular destinations for Taiwan visitors, who paid 3.05 million
visits to other countries in the region during the January-August
period, DGBAS tallies showed. That figure, however, represents a 6.1
percent decrease from last year.</P>
      <P>The Americas are the second most popular destination for Taiwan
tourists, who paid around 500,000 visits to countries in that region
during the same eight-month period, a decline of 0.6 percent from a
year ago. About 140,000 ROC citizens traveled to Europe, up 4 percent
on a year-on-year basis.</P>
      <P>Among Asian countries, Indonesia experienced the largest drop in
the number of Taiwan tourists. Only about 100,000 ROC citizens
traveled to that Southeast Asian country between January and August,
a drop of 35 percent from year-earlier levels. The decline is due to
persistent social unrest and to high levels of haze there.</P>
      <P>The number of Taiwan tourists to Hong Kong, Singapore and Macao
also dropped, while the number to Japan and Thailand registered
growth, the same tallies indicated.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the number of foreign visitors to Taiwan
decreased by 6.5 percent to 1.49 million. Nearly 900,000 of them were
Asian visitors, with Japanese tourists making up of the bulk, despite
a fall of 12.7 percent in the number of arrivals compared with last
year.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS attributed the slide in both outbound and inbound
passengers to the protracted Asian financial crisis, which has
greatly affected the public's consumption power and their desire to
go abroad.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP, KMT TAIPEI MAYORAL CANDIDATES TIE IN SUPPORT RATING: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The two front runners in the hotly
contested Taipei mayoral election tied in their support rating,
according to the result of a recent public opinion poll released on
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Both incumbent Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian of the main
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and ruling Kuomintang
candidate Ma Ying-jeou each received the support of about 30 percent
of the respondents to the telephone survey conducted by the minor
opposition New Party between Oct. 8 and Oct. 9. A total of 1,009
valid samples were collected in the poll.</P>
      <P>When asked if the mayoral election were to take place on the
following day, 30.2 percent of the adult Taipei residents who
were interviewed said they would vote for Chen, while 29.3 percent
said they would choose Ma.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 5.5 percent said they would opt for New Party
candidate Wang Chien-hsien, and 31 percent said they have yet to
decide their favorite candidate.</P>
      <P>New Party's top campaign manager Jaw Shau-kong said the poll
results indicate that the recent resignation of former Taipei City
Government Deputy Secretary-General Ma Yung-cheng over his personal
misdemeanor has not had any significant impact on the two front
runners' ratings.</P>
      <P>Survey results also showed that 40 percent of New Party
supporters will vote for KMT's Ma instead of Wang.</P>
      <P>The same survey found that 51.6 percent of the respondents do
not believe in the DPP Legislator Yeh Chu-lan's recent allegation
that a group of pro-unification politicians has targeted the Taipei
mayoral election campaign as a battle ground to restore control
over the KMT and to extinguish the political resources held by
Mayor Chen, who is considered the most hopeful future presidential
candidate of the DPP.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, 19.8 percent said they believe Yeh's allegation is
true, and 28.6 percent said they cannot determine whether Yeh's
accusation is true or not at the moment.</P>
      <P>Twenty-three percent said they believe Ma will adopt a
mudsling campaign strategy against Chen; another 22 percent said they
think Chen will also adopt such negative campaign tactics; but only
2.4 percent said they believe that Wang will also follow suit.</P>
      <P>As for the collective image of each candidate's campaign team,
19.5 percent said they believe Chen's camp is most likely to
violate law or take bribes, compared to 15.6 percent who said
Ma's camp is most likely to do so.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, 23.3 percent said they believe Ma's camp
is most likely to commit influence-peddling, compared to Chen
camp's 17.6 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 25.7 percent said they think New Party's Wang is
cleanest and least corrupt; 20.8 percent chose Chen; and 20.5
percent said they believe Ma's is the least corrupt among the
three candidates.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT PEACE AGREEMENT DRAFT UNVEILED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A cross-strait peace agreement draft was
unveiled on Sunday before the resumption of cross-strait talks
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait next week.</P>
      <P>The draft, prepared by opposition New Party Legislator Lee
Ching-hua and several scholars, calls for the renunciation of the use
of force against each other to solve differences across the strait
and an end to the ongoing diplomatic tug-of-war in the international
arena.</P>
      <P>The draft also called for the establishment of representative
offices as well as advisory councils in each other's territory to
provide advisory views and monitor respective authorities across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Scholars who co-signed the draft include Professors Chang
Lin-cheng, Wang Hsiao-po and Lu Ya-li of National Taiwan University,
Yang Kai-huan of Soochow University and Professor Tai Wan-chin of
Tamkang University.</P>
      <P>The draft said that both sides of the Taiwan Strait should share
sovereignty based on the "one China" policy, end the threat of
military confrontation and boost the well-being of the people to
create peaceful, equitable and stable cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>On the political front, the draft calls for the end of the use of
force against each other, for both sides of the Taiwan Strait to stop
engaging in diplomatic warfare and for them to join forces in taking
part in international affairs and in shouldering responsibilities as
members of the international community.</P>
      <P>On the military front, the draft calls for both sides to advise
each other before conducting military exercises and to invite
observers from the other side to the exercises. In addition, both
sides of the Taiwan Strait would not target their weapons against
each other or send spies to other side under the agreement.</P>
      <P>On the economic front, the draft calls for the establishment of
direct trade, postal and transportation links across the strait and
the signing of investment guarantee agreements.</P>
      <P>Both sides would grant national treatment to people from the
other side and recognize the credentials of all schools on the other
side.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee said he hopes the draft will be used for reference
by C. F. Koo, the top negotiator with the mainland, in his upcoming
talks with the mainland during a visit there Oct. 14-19.</P>
      <P>Professor Chang said that in view of the current cross-strait
situation, it is impossible to implement the provisions outlined in
the draft, but that if both sides of the Taiwan Strait work toward
moving in that direction, the goal of peaceful co-existence can be
achieved.</P>

      <P>Endangered blackface spoonbills have begun
to arrive in Tainan County in the southern part of Taiwan, bird
watchers said on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chihku Village's Tsengwen River, located in Tainan County, is

The endangered birds migrate each year southward to Taiwan for the

      <P>Huang Fu-hsing, secretary-general of Tainan County Blackface
Spoonbill Conservation Society, said that 19 blackface spoonbills
have been spotted since early this month.</P>
      <P>He speculated that the figure could reach 100 by the end of the
month.</P>
      <P>The largest number of blackface spoonbills to arrive at Tsengwen
River in recent years was 339, about two-thirds of the rare bird's
total population, Huang said.</P>
      <P>He said the migration of the blackface spoonbill usually peaks at

    <HEADLINE>THINK TANK SUGGESTS INVITING MAINLAND PRESIDENT TO VISIT TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local private think tank on Sunday
suggested that Taiwan take the initiative to invite mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin to visit Taiwan in either private or official
capacity.</P>
      <P>The Rising People Foundation, headed by Hsu Hsin-liang, a former
chairman of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),
said no prerequisite should be set for the proposed invitation to
Jiang.</P>
      <P>The foundation further said the first meeting between Jiang and
ROC President Lee Teng-hui can be held in either Hong Kong or Macau
in 1999.</P>
      <P>The foundation presented the proposals three days before the
departure of Taipei's top negotiator with Beijing, Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) Chairman C. F. Koo, for an ice-breaking visit to
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Foundation Chairman Hsu said Koo's landmark visit to
Shanghai and Beijing will mark a new beginning for relations across
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"We hope Koo will take advantage of his upcoming China visit to
convey a message of peace to Beijing leaders and to invite Jiang to
visit Taiwan in his capacity as President Lee's special envoy," Hsu
told a news conference.</P>
      <P>The foundation also suggested that Taiwan promise to revise its
current "no haste, be patient" policy on investment in mainland China
under a premise that Beijing agrees to let Taiwan join the World
Trade Organization ahead of the mainland.</P>
      <P>Other proposals recommended by the foundation include:</P>
      <P>-- Ministerial-level officials from economics and trade
departments and central bank governors on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait exchange visits regularly to discuss cooperative
measures for addressing the lingering Asian financial turmoil;</P>
      <P>-- Both sides face up to the historical reality and seek
"phased" agreements on their disputes instead of pursuing a
comprehensive or all-encompassing conclusion right now;</P>
      <P>-- An informal or a "Track Two" communications channel should be
opened after Koo's Oct. 14-19 mainland visit to pave the way for the
next high-level cross-strait meeting;</P>
      <P>-- A joint press conference should be held and Beijing allows
its national television networks to give live broadcast on
such a news conference to let people on both sides of the
strait get first-hand information about cross-strait peace.</P>
      <P>During his mainland visit, Koo will hold talks with his
mainland counterpart, Chairman Wang Daohan of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), on a
broad range of issues. He will also meet with mainland President
Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier Qian Qichen.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the general international situation has changed
significantly since the first Koo-Wang meeting held in Singapore in
April 1993.</P>
      <P>"Following the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait crisis, Taipei and
Beijing should seek the establishment of a new order between the two
sides of the strait," Hsu said, adding he hopes both sides will
refer to the foundation's above-mentioned proposals in charting
their future policies on cross-strait engagement and relations.</P>
      <P>Hsu further said maintaining the status quo is the best strategy
for both sides of the Taiwan Strait at the moment. "The two sides
should patiently engage in peaceful dialogue under the premise of
respecting the status quo and increase economic exchanges and
cooperation to lay a solid foundation for the establishment of a new
cross-strait order.</P>

      <P>Thailand is concerned that the number of
Taiwanese tourist arrivals in Thailand during the first eight months
of this year fell by 4.3 percent compared with the same period in
1997, while the economy of the Republic of China on Taiwan has
remained relatively strong during the regional economic crisis.</P>
      <P>Tourism Authority of Thailand officials said that only 287,348
Taiwanese tourists arrived during the first eight months of this
year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the number of Indonesian tourists fell 43.84 percent
to 37,591, while the number of visitors from South Korea fell by

figures could worsen over the next few months as the effects of
Malaysia's strict currency controls start to sink in.</P>
      <P>But the weak baht and the stable political and social climate in
Thailand has helped to boost the overall number of tourist arrivals

    <HEADLINE>US SEES RISE IN PROTECTIONIST SENTIMENT IN BEIJING AND LATIN AMERICA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Oct.  10  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US government is concerned about
indications that mainland China and some Latin American countries are
beginning to consider protectionist trade policies, according to
reports from the Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO)
Saturday.</P>
      <P>The US government sees "the slight beginnings of a turning inward
in some countries," the WTO report said, citing Brazil, Argentina,
Chile, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela and mainland China.</P>
      <P>The US government said it has so far seen "nothing very
dramatic," but that there have been suggestions of import licensing
and increases in tariffs.</P>
      <P>"We will, of course, enforce our laws against unfair foreign
export practices and adopt sensible policies in case of import
surges."</P>
      <P>The US administration will "ensure that countries like Communist
China, Argentina, Chile and Brazil do not respond by reverting to
protectionism; we will refuse to panic and shut off trade ourselves,"
the WTO report quoted US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky as
saying.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ONE NATION ON VERGE OF SPLIT AFTER ELECTION DEFEAT (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  11  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One Nation is on the verge of a split
following the embarrassing defeat of its leader, Pauline Hanson, in
federal elections on Oct. 3 election as recriminations are mounting
within the party.</P>
      <P>Hanson's supporters plan to remove her former top adviser --
David Oldfield -- and her national party director -- David Ettridge.
But the supporters of the two Davids counter that Hanson was directly
responsible for the most serious gaffes in her election campaign.</P>
      <P>Political analysts said that despite the stunning defeat of One
Nation in federal elections, One Nation will remain a "nagging
presence" on the Australian political scene.</P>
      <P>They said Hanson failed her party by losing the election. But
that does not mean the end of the party, which is often called racist
because of policies that are regarded as anti-Asian immigration,
anti-multiculturalism, anti-foreign investment and anti-Aboriginal
people.</P>
      <P>They said Hanson lost her election because of the 2 percent
"Easytax" proposal which even she herself could not explain clearly
to supporters during the election campaign.</P>
      <P>Another contributing factor to her failure to win was Hanson's
calling herself the "mother of Australians," while her eldest son
said she had not been a good mother in an interview with a popular
weekly magazine.</P>
      <P>Analysts said a split of the party could happen at the general
meeting of One Nation in Gold Coast, a popular resort city known for
its beautiful beaches, in Queensland.</P>
      <P>They believe Hanson's supporters will try to remove both Oldfield
and Ettridge as party directors.</P>
      <P>They will then seek the establishment of an elected 20-person
national council to replace Hanson's One Nation Ltd., a company that
comprises only three figures -- Hanson, Oldfield and Ettridge.</P>
      <P>One Nation's candidate for the federal seat of Brisbane, Sam
Tornatore, said Oldfield should "accept full blame" for Hanson's
failed campaign and be "kicked out" of the party.</P>
      <P>He said Oldfield's "stupid" decision to call police to evict
journalists from the party's campaign launch cost One Nation many
votes during the Oct. 3 elections.</P>
      <P>He called for a reform in the party structure to make it more
democratic. "We are not happy with the way things are, and changes
need to be made," he said.</P>
      <P>But Oldfield hit back, describing Tornatore's comments as "stupid
and ignorant." "It is the Queensland campaign committee that directed
everything that happened up there," he said. Oldfield himself lost
his seat in the Senate during the elections.</P>
      <P>A new dispute emerging between Hanson's and Oldfield's supporters
is over the location of the party's headquarters.</P>
      <P>Hanson's supporters want the headquarters to be relocated to
Ipswich in Queensland, where the party was based. But Oldfield's
supporters want the headquarters to remain in Sydney.</P>
      <P>If the head office is moved, then it will diminish the influence
of party power brokers -- the two Davids -- and put One Nation under
the control of Pauline Hanson and Heather Hill, the only One Nation
candidate to win a seat in the Oct. 3 elections.</P>
      <P>All other party candidates lost their races, surprising many One
Nation supporters and substantially reducing the party's influence
and its ambition to become a force in Australian politics, analysts
said.</P>
      <P>Speaking publicly for the first time since losing her seat in
Parliament, Hanson denied One Nation's failure to win any Lower House
seats signaled its demise.</P>
      <P>She was optimistic before the election, predicting One Nation
could win 12 seats in the House of Representatives and six seats in
the Senate.</P>
      <P>Instead of blaming herself for the party's poor showing, Hanson
shifted the blame to the Australian media and the voting system based
on preferences for her stunning loss in the election.</P>
      <P>Despite her defeat, Hanson will become the president of the One
Nation Party and is expected to be paid a six-figure salary similar
to that of federal members of Parliament because she will be
responsible for conducting speaking tours throughout Australia, in an
attempt to win more grassroots supporters.</P>
      <P>Supporters and key party figures said One Nation still needs
Hanson because she was the one who set up the party 18 months ago.</P>
      <P>"Without her as the party president, One Nation could vanish
totally," one analyst said.

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One Nation won about 8 percent of the votes during the Oct. 3
election. Based on that percentage, One Nation will receive about A$3
million (US$1.87 million) from the federal government to reimburse
party candidate for expenditures.</P>
      <P>With the backing of her supporters in Queensland, Hanson has
decided that she would take control of One Nation and "run it
myself," moving the party's head office to her political base in
Ipswich.</P>
      <P>But Ettridge suggested that Hanson's name be dropped from the
party name because she is no longer the leader of One Nation. He also
said the party's head office should remain in Sydney where both
Davids operate.</P>
      <P>But Hanson said One Nation will become a Queensland-based party
and that she will control it herself. "We have got a state executive
here in Queensland and we want to expand on that. I'll be looking at
heading it here in Queensland and running it here in Queensland
myself," she said.</P>
      <P>Supporters of Ettridge and Oldfield, however, say that if One
Nation were to move its base to Queensland, it would become a state,
rather than a national, political organization.</P>
      <P>Analysts said the split will only worsen before any possible
compromise during next month's meeting at Gold Coast.</P>
      <P>"Let's wait and see whether One Nation is moving towards its rise
or fall after its drastic loss in the October election," one analyst
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA TO ALLOW IMPORT OF 200 BREEDING RAMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Responding to requests by the Goat Farmer
Association, the Council of Agriculture (COA) has agreed to import
200 breeding rams.</P>
      <P>COA officials said that in the past the council has allowed only
a limited number of breeding rams to come to Taiwan so as not to have
too many goats and tip the balance of supply and demand.</P>
      <P>But with repeated requests from the association, the COA has for
the first time permitted the import of a large number of rams into
Taiwan next year.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by the Department of Agriculture
and Forestry (DAF) under the Taiwan Provincial Government, there are
in Taiwan at present 2,958 breeding dairy rams and 6,879 breeding
rams.</P>
      <P>COA officials said that although Taiwan Livestock Research
Institute has used artificial insemination to try to relieve the
current shortage of breeding rams, the Goat Farmer Association has
complained about the procedure's high costs and the fact that its
success rate is substandard.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the council has therefore decided to
import 200 breeding rams from the United States, Australia and Japan
starting next year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN REPATRIATES 70 ILLEGAL MAINLAND IMMIGRANTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ilan,  eastern  Taiwan,  Oct.  12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ilan Detention Center
repatriated 70 illegal mainland Chinese immigrants on Sunday, marking
the first repatriation of people from Taiwan to mainland China in six
months, police sources said.</P>
      <P>Since all repatriations require the cooperation of mainland
Chinese authorities, Sunday's delivery was considered a good-will
gesture by Beijing before a visit to the mainland by Taiwan's top
negotiator, Koo Chen-fu, local political observers said.</P>
      <P>Since April of this year, Beijing has been reluctant to take back
illegal immigrants. An unwillingness to do so is a violation of the
Kinmen Agreement reached between the Red Cross Societies of both
sides in 1990, the sources noted.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, the mainland is supposed to take delivery of
illegal mainland immigrants within 20 days of receiving a list of the
immigrants' names.</P>
      <P>The Ilan Detention Center, one of three Taiwan detention centers
for stowaways and illegal immigrants from mainland China, repatriated
110 mainlanders between January and April of this year, according to
the sources. The Two other centers are located in Hsinchu, central
Taiwan, and on the offshore island of Matsu.</P>
      <P>Among the 70 detainees in Ilan, some were happy and some were sad
at being repatriated.</P>
      <P>Lin Mouqin, 29, from Pingtan, Fujian Province, has been at the
center longer than any other detainee. Lin, who has been arrested
twice since 1994, said he was pleased to be sent back to the
mainland, adding that trying to sneak into Taiwan was not sensible.</P>
      <P>Lin was nabbed trying to sneak into Taiwan in 1994 after paying
20,000 renminbi to a cross-strait human smuggling ring.</P>
      <P>He was again arrested for illegally entering Taiwan with forged
documents in May 1997 after paying another 20,000 renminbi to the
operators. He has been in detention since then.</P>
      <P>"I won't come again," he told reporters. "The deal is not worth
it."</P>
      <P>Nien Jiaping, another young man from Pingtan, was apparently not
as light-hearted as Lin. Nien, 25, wept constantly since being told
last week he would be repatriated.</P>
      <P>Nien, nabbed upon landing on Taiwan's soil in April of this year,
was diagnosed as having acute fibrosis by detention physicians in
August. The center has since spent some NT$500,000 (US$15,150) on his
medical bills. He has developed myoatrophy and can hardly walk.</P>
      <P>Nien said before being sent back to the mainland that he is not
sure he will be capable of receiving medical care back home or
whether his condition can be treated.</P>

market-oriented economy, since Fujian province has opened its market
for quite some time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF ADVANCE TEAM LEAVES FOR SHANGHAI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A six-member advance team left for
Shanghai on Monday to settle some technical details to ensure smooth
proceeding of Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman C. F. Koo's
upcoming landmark visit to mainland China.</P>
      <P>SEF Deputy Secretary-General Jan Jyh-horng, head of the advance
team, said prior to his departure that as Koo's Oct. 14-19 mainland
visit is mainly aimed at improving the atmosphere of relations
across the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan basically will respect Beijing's
arrangements.</P>
      <P>After three rounds of preparatory talks in April, July and
September, Jan said, Koo's mainland itinerary has largely been set.
"The advance team will mainly put finishing touches on some
technical issues," he noted.</P>
      <P>Still, the advance team's workload is expected to be very heavy.
It must handle all logistic support to ensure smooth progress of
Koo's Shanghai-Beijing visit.</P>
      <P>Jan said the advance team will coordinate with its counterpart
from the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS) to ensure that all news media from both sides of the
Taiwan Strait will have fair access to all related information.</P>
      <P>According to press reports, more than 400 journalists from
Taiwan, mainland China and other countries will cover Koo's
high-profile mainland visit, particularly Koo's meetings with
mainland President Jiang Zemin in Beijing on Oct. 18 and with his
mainland counterpart, ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan, in Shanghai on Oct.
15-16.</P>
      <P>The advance team is expected to set up media liaison centers and
make all necessary arrangements to enable Koo to perform well before
Chinese and foreign media and clearly explain the Republic of
China's stance on cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>After the 12-member Koo delegation arrives in Shanghai on
Wednesday, the advance team will leave for Beijing to clear the way
for Koo's arrival on Oct. 16 evening.</P>
      <P>While in Beijing, Jan said, the advance team will most like to
know how many members of the Koo delegation can be present at the
Koo-Jiang meeting and which Taiwan news media will be allowed to
cover that event.</P>
      <P>ARATS Chairman Wang was quoted by the local press as saying last
week that mainland President Jiang will only meet Koo and his wife.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, a senior mainland affairs official
said Taiwan does not like to see such a scenario. "We hope several
other delegates will accompany the Koos in meeting Jiang," the
official said.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan's plan, SEF Vice Chairman and
Secretary-General Shi Hwei-yow, National Unification Council
(NUC) member Kang Ning-hsiang, NUC researcher Chang Jung-kung and
Pao Cheng-kang, chief secretary of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council, will also be present at the Koo-Jiang
meeting, which will be the highest-level cross-strait talks
in five decades.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the official said, the Koo delegation may shorten its
visit if Beijing takes another move to squeeze Taiwan's diplomatic
frontier during Koo's stay on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Beijing announced the establishment of full diplomatic ties with
the West African state of Guinea-Bissau, originally an ROC diplomatic
ally, when SEF Deputy Secretary-General Jan was on the mainland to
pave the way for Koo's ice-breaking mainland visit.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  12 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign tourists coming to see the 2000
Olympic Games in Sydney may be hit by a 10 percent goods and services
tax (GST) if the Australian government is able to get the GST
legislation passed by June 1999.</P>
      <P>Federal Treasurer Peter Costello on Sunday warned the government
would lose valuable GST revenue from foreign tourists if the Senate
delayed the tax reform package.</P>
      <P>The warning came as Australian Democrats Party leader Meg Lees
and two independent senators declared that they would oppose the tax
if food were not exempted from it. The three senators hold the
balance of power in the Senate.</P>
      <P>Costello said the government needed the legislation to be passed
before June 30, 1999 to provide businesses, consumers and the
Australian Taxation Office a full 12 months to prepare for the
change.</P>
      <P>"International experience shows us this -- from the time of the
passing of the legislation to the time of its implementation takes
about 12 months. If you were going to have a new tax system operating
in Australia by July 1, 2000, you need the legislation passed through
both houses of Parliament by about June 30 next year," he said.</P>
      <P>The ruling coalition of the Liberal and National parties under
Prime Minister John Howard has a majority in the House of
Representatives, but lacks one in the Senate.</P>
      <P>Costello said July 1, 2000 was chosen as the target date
to implement the tax because it would enable the government to
collect revenue from overseas visitors who will come to see the
Sydney Olympic Games in September.</P>

the United States and Latin America, Finance Minister of Singapore

      <P>Singapore slipped into negative growth
in the third quarter of this year, but the economy could still
achieve positive growth for the year, Finance Minister Richard Hu Tsu
Tau said.</P>
      <P>Saying the indication that Singapore had registered negative
growth in this year's third quarter was not surprising, Hu noted
government predictions called for growth this year between 0.5
percent and 1.5 percent.</P>
      <P>"If we take first and second quarters as positive, the third
quarter must be negative, mathematically if nothing else. Fourth
quarters tend to be a lot better. The third quarter will probably be
the worst, statistically," he said.</P>
      <P>The speed with which New York's Dow Jones Industrial Average and
the US dollar have fallen make it difficult to predict how things
will go in the near term, he said.</P>

      <P>Still calling for caution is Goh Mou Lih, a strategist at Daiwa
Institute of Research. But Manu Bhaskaran, managing director and
group research head at SG Securities, argued for an overweight
position on Singapore stocks in a strategy piece last Friday.</P>
      <P>"It goes show how difficult it is to call a very volatile market.
You stick out your neck and argues your case, but it could be
anyone's guess and anyone could be right," commented another research
director.</P>
      <P>For one thing, it is unclear whether the strengthening yen, a
major factor behind the recent rise in regional markets, would last.
By the reckoning of many, the yen really has more to do with the
unwinding of large speculative positions than with any fundamental
change.</P>
      <P>More significantly, the yen rose because the US dollar fell on
recessionary fears. If the United States goes into recession next
year, as forecast by JP Morgan, demand for Asian exports would
collapse, hindering any recovery by Singapore's export-driven
economy, Goh said.</P>
      <P>Since the start of the fourth quarter, the benchmark Straits
Times Index has gained nearly 4 percent. It ended Friday at 976.65,
above the year-end target of 950 points Daiwa has set. This was not
enough, however, for Goh to revise his forecast. "For the time being,
it is difficult to raise the target because of all the
uncertainties."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>While sales of general computer servers
are on the decline, the market for Internet server is booming,
especially in most countries in the Asia-Pacific region, according to
a preliminary study by Dataquest, a division of Gartner Group Inc.</P>
      <P>Five key countries in the region -- Singapore, Hong Kong,
mainland China, Australia and South Korea -- are together expected to
grow a robust 141 percent this year from last year, much higher than
the global growth rate of 114 percent for 1998.</P>
      <P>Internet servers are computer servers used specifically for
Internet-related applications, including e-commerce, Web hosting,
messaging and collaborations.</P>
      <P>"They are the fastest-growing niche category and should account
for 20 percent of all servers sold globally this year, compared to
just 10 percent last year," Saleem Bikanerwala, principal industry
analyst for Dataquest Asia-Pacific, told The Business Times.</P>
      <P>"In the Asia-Pacific, they would form about 26 percent for all
servers sold this year, against 11 percent last year."</P>
      <P>The region accounts for around 7.5 percent of the global market
for Internet servers, which was worth US$6.21 billion last year and
is expected to gross US$13.27 billion this year.</P>
      <P>Singapore saw sales of US$204.2 million in servers last year,
with Internet servers forming about 15 percent of the total,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Asia's demand for Australian energy will
weaken in the short term because of the region's financial crisis,
but long-term prospects are rising, Energy Minister Warwick Parer
said.</P>
      <P>"The current financial difficulties will have a short-term

      <P>Parer cited a forecast by the Asia Pacific Energy Research Center
that indicated energy demand in the Asian Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum will rise by 41 percent between 1995 and
2010 and coal's share of regional power generation will increase from
58 percent to 66 percent during the same period.</P>
      <P>APEC members must improve their investment regimes to attract the
US$70 billion the Asian Development Bank says is needed to develop
the region's gas infrastructure, he said.</P>
      <P>APEC's energy strategy, however, would result in rising

    <HEADLINE>MAC HEAD URGES BEIJING TO MOVE FASTER IN ITS DEALINGS WITH TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   12   (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chang King-yuh, chairman of the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), on Monday presented a
banner to Koo Chen-fu, officially authorizing Taiwan's top negotiator
with mainland China to embark on his landmark visit to Shanghai and
Beijing, which will begin Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chang, Taiwan's top official in charge of ROC policies toward
mainland China, said Koo's forthcoming visit to the mainland is
poised to give fresh impetus to cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that pushing for better cross-strait relations is
not a single-handed effort. Both sides must demonstrate the sincerity
and goodwill necessary to achieve better relations, he said.</P>
      <P>He urged Beijing to show its sincerity and goodwill by
accelerating the pace of concrete moves to redress differences and
solve problems across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The visit to the mainland by Koo, chairman of the Taipei-based
intermediary Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), is a plus to the
process of warming cross-strait ties, he added.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that through the resumption of meetings between Koo
and Wang Daohan, chairman of the mainland's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), the level of cross-strait
negotiations will gradually be heightened, so that both sides will
gain an understanding of each other and be able to solve various
issues arising from increased exchanges across the strait, Chang
noted.</P>
      <P>Koo met with Wang in Singapore in 1993, an event that served as
an ice-breaking session between representatives from Taiwan and
mainland China after more than four decades without contact.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew received Koo and his mainland-bound team at
the Executive Yuan after Koo was presented with the banner by Chang.
Siew had a 50-minute conversation with Koo concerning the upcoming
mainland visit.</P>
      <P>During his talk with Koo, Siew mentioned his willingness to push
for grassroots democratic exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.
Commenting on the premier's remarks, Chang said that Taiwan, with its
half century of experience in democratic politics and general
elections, is willing and able to share its legal and democratic
development experiences with mainland China.</P>
      <P>On the "positioning" of Koo's mid-October mainland visit, Chang
said Taipei has reiterated its position more than 110 times, calling
for Beijing to return to the negotiating table and to help
institutionalize cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>Chang said Koo has been given "broad authority" by MAC to embark
on the mainland visit, which will inevitably involve "talks."</P>
      <P>He added that Koo is authorized to talk about anything with his
mainland hosts -- including peace and security developments across
the strait, SEF-ARATS exchanges and issues that are mutually
reciprocal -- as long as the discussions are constructive.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOST PEOPLE SUPPORT CROSS-STRAIT SUMMIT MEETING: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of Taiwan people support the
proposal that the top leaders from both sides of the Taiwan Strait
either exchange visits or hold a summit meeting, according to the
result of a public opinion poll released on Monday.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey was conducted by the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) from Sept. 29 through Oct. 2 to probe local
people's opinion about cross-strait relations ahead of an
ice-breaking visit to mainland China by Taiwan's top negotiator with
Beijing, Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman C. F. Koo.</P>
      <P>The poll of 1,078 adults residing throughout the island found
that 39.6 percent of the respondents believe that Koo's Oct. 14-19
Shanghai-Beijing visit will be helpful to future cross-strait ties;
only 10.7 percent hold a negative view.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 63.1 percent said issues related to the rights and
well-being of the people on both sides of the strait should top the
agenda of future cross-strait negotiations, while 12.4 percent said
political negotiations should take precedence over any other topics.</P>
      <P>Most noteworthy was that the survey results indicated a
significant change in local people's ethnic identification
probably because of the impact of such incidents as US President Bill
Clinton's declaration of the so-called "three noes" policy against
Taiwan and the kidnap-murder of Kaohsiung City Councilor Lin Ti-chuan
in mainland China in late July.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 38.9 percent said they identify
themselves as Taiwanese, up from 30.5 percent recorded in a similar
survey conducted in May.</P>
      <P>Another 37.8 percent said they identify themselves as both
Taiwanese and Chinese. It was the first time that the percentage of
this category of people fell below 40 percent.</P>
      <P>Poll results also showed that 58.6 percent of the respondents
throw their support behind the proposal that President Lee Tang-hui
and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin either exchange visits or
hold a summit meeting.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, 14.1 percent nixed such a proposal and 27.3
percent said they do not have any opinion about the overture.
A marginal 0.2 percent said they would support the proposal only
under the premise that Lee meets Jiang in his capacity as the
Republic of China's head of state.</P>
      <P>As much as 73 percent said they oppose the Beijing-initiated "one
country, two systems" unification scheme; only 6.3 percent said they
support such a formula. Similar MAC surveys conducted since
1991 on this issue indicate that local people's attitude toward the
proposal has remained almost unchanged.</P>
      <P>As for local people's stance on Taiwan's future, the latest poll
found that the majority of local residents still prefer to
maintain the status quo.</P>
      <P>A total of 75.9 percent of those interviewed said they favor
maintaining the status quo, including those who want to see the
status quo maintained permanently and those who want to maintain
the status quo at the moment and to decide either independence or
unification in the future.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, the percentage of those who favor
immediate declaration of independence still exceeds that of the
people who favor an immediate reunion with mainland China, 20
percent vs. 17 percent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 70 percent of Taipei residents
believe neither government officials nor city councilors should go to
hostess bars, the results of a recent survey released on Monday
showed.</P>
      <P>According to the public opinion poll, about 67 percent of those
surveyed said city councilors, like government officials, should not
visit hostess bars or nightclubs, citing "private morale" as the
reason. Only 14 percent said they were not opposed to such conduct by
city councilors.</P>
      <P>A top aide in Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian's re-election campaign
stepped down recently after he was found frequenting hostess bars.
The issue stirred up a debate along with verbal attacks among the
three contenders in the approach to the year-end election for Taipei
mayor.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, around 71 percent of Taipei residents
expressed the hope that the political parties would stop lashing out
with verbal attacks while only 13 percent said they did not mind such
behavior.</P>
      <P>Despite earlier vows to stage a clean election campaign by all
three major political parties, about 50 percent said they did not
believe the mayoral election would be a discreet one compared to 26
percent who expressed such confidence.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Councilor Chen Hsueh-fen, who released the results of
the poll, said she believed the survey's outcome would give all
public opinion leaders the opportunity to think about the issue and
moderate their behavior accordingly.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted through telephone interviews with 899
Taipei residents from Oct. 7-9.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EVOLUTION OF TALKS ACROSS THE TAIWAN STRAIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government of the Republic of China
announced in May 1991 its "one China, two political entities" policy
with regard to Beijing in the hope that the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait could develop ties and promote reunification on the basis of
equal footing.</P>
      <P>In November 1987, the ROC government dropped its ban on
cross-strait travel and Taiwan nationals were permitted to visit
their relatives on the Chinese mainland. This turned a new leaf in
cross-striat ties.</P>
      <P>Follwoing the gradual relaxation of the cross-strait situation
and an increase in private exchanges, many problems have arisen. The
people-to-people exchanges, the indirect trade and investment, and
the cultural exchanges that blossomed in the wake of this thaw have
engendered a range of issues that necessitated a more systematic
approach to bilateral interaction.</P>
      <P>To safeguard people's rights and interests, it was crucial that
both sides of the strait communicated and negotiated to solve their
problems. With this view, the ROC government in February 1991
estalbished the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) as the only
private organization empowered by the government to handle matters
of a technical and business nature with regard to the mainland.</P>
      <P>In December 1991, Beijing set up their Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), with Wang Daohan as its chairman,
to negotiate with SEF.</P>
      <P>After over a year of interaction, Koo Chen-fu, chairman of SEF,
and ARATS chairman met in Singapore and held talks in what was the
first contact between Taipei and Beijing since 1949.</P>
      <P>The first round of Koo-Wang talks resulted in several agreements
dealing with document authentication, the handling of mail and
future meetings. Provisions were made for regular and non-periodic
meetings between SEF and ARATS officials.</P>
      <P>Details of the agreement are as follows:</P>
      <P>1. The Agreement on Document Authentication Between the Taiwan
Area and the Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>The increasing number of private-sector exchanges between the
Taiwan Area and the Chinese mainland made it necessary to present,
for use on the other side of the Taiwan Strait, documents concerning
the claim of rights or the receipt of payments, for resettlement or
residential purposes.</P>
      <P>However, given the different legal systems on the two sides of
the strait and in particular the extensive area, it was difficult to
dtermine whether a document was authentic.</P>
      <P>Leberal authentication could adversely affect the interests of a
party with genuine rights, whereas strict authentication might
create inconvenience for the public. it was therefore essential that
documents be authenticated trough a sumple verification process
common to both Taiwan and the mainland.</P>
      <P>Formerly, neither side had been able to provide a method of
document authentication for the other siade. When handling cases of
document verification, SEF had to make written requests for
verification by the issuing agency on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Not only was the exchange of correspondence time-consuming, but
also no mainland agency would respond to SEF inquiries. This
resulted in inefficient document authentication, a backlog of
verification cases and a great deal of problems.</P>
      <P>In the Agreement on Document Authentication Between the Taiwan
Area and the Mainland Area, both sides agreed to send copies of
documents concerning inheritance, adoption, marriange, birth, death,
consignment, adacemic degree, residence, dependency, and property
ownership for verification purposes to the other side.</P>
      <P>Documents are now authenticated by comparison with copies sent
by the other side, and verification may be resquested in writing in
case of any doubt.</P>
      <P>This method should provide better and more effective service for
the public. SEF and ARATS also agreed to consult and provide mutual
assistance in individual cases concerning non-notarized documents.

      <P>2. The Agreement on the Tracing of and Compensation for Lost
Registered Mail Between the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>Ordinary mail is sent across the Taiwan Strait via a third area,
but registered mail service has not been established.</P>
      <P>The difficulty in the conveyance of important correspondence
has mainly been due to a lack of arrangements by either side over
the scope of any cross-strait registered mail service to be offered
and the tracing of and compensation for lost registered mail.</P>
      <P>In the Agreement on the Tracing and Compensation for Lost
Registered Mail Between the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, both
sides agreed that the registered mail service would cover letters,
post cards, aerograms, printed matter, newspapers, magazines, and
letters written in Braille. Under the agreeement, registered mail,
like ordinary mail, is to travel indirectly between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Both sides agreed to provide mutual assistance to track down
lost registered mail, and to respond within three months of receiving
a written inquiry. To simplify matters, it is decided that
anyone who sent a letter that was lost, stolen or destroyed would be
compensated by the area from which the letter was mailed.</P>
      <P>3. The Agreement on the Establishment of Systematic Liaison and
Communication Channels Between the SEF and the ARATS is aimed
primarily at building up a systematic form of communication and
dialogue between the two agencies.</P>
      <P>In Principle, the agreement calls for regular or irregular
meetings between SEF and ARATS chairmen, vice chairmen, and
secretaries-general. Department directors or office heads shall meet
once every three months to discuss more timely issues in their area
of responsibility.</P>
      <P>The agencies' deputy secreataries-general, or personnel of
equivalent status, will be the contact person in emergencies. In
addition, SEF and ARATS shall mutually facilitate the entry and exit
of SEF and ARATS personnel.</P>
      <P>4. The Koo-Wang Talks Joint Accord.</P>
      <P>SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu and ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan met in
Singapore on behalf of their respective agencies to proceed with
non-governmental talks on economic, practical, and functional
matters.</P>
      <P>The Koo-Wang Talks Joint Accord set up a priority list for
topics of mutual concern that both sides agree require further
discussion.</P>
      <P>Topics to be discussed this year include repatriation of
illegal immigrants, efforts to crack down on illegal activities at
sea, the resolution of fishing disputes, the protection of
intellectual property rights, and mutual assistance on judicial
issues.</P>
      <P>As for economic exchanges; the development and exchange of
energy resources; and cultural, educational, scientific and
technological exchanges, SEF and ARATS will continue to hold
talks to resolve matters of concern to people on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait and to facilitate more orderly private exchanges

      <P>The 16th session of the Sino-Saudi
Permanent Joint Committee on Economic and Technical Cooperation
concluded on Sunday in Riyadh with both sides pledging to further
accelerate bilateral exchanges and cooperation.</P>
      <P>Over the past two days, Republic of China and Saudi Arabian

including a bilateral trade arbitration system to be devised by the
two countries' private sectors to solve trade disputes, said Lin
Yi-fu, vice economic affairs minister and chief ROC delegate to the

      <P>Riyadh also agreed to assess the feasibility of signing an
agreement on the temporary admission of goods with Taipei to expedite
bilateral economic and cultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>Riyadh also welcomes Taiwan to sponsor exhibitions of turn-key

      <P>Taiwan, meanwhile, agreed to allow Saudi Arabian vegetables,
ceramic and earthenware products to be exported to Taiwan. Saudi
fruit was excluded from the agreement as the country is still listed

granted loans to Taiwan to construct the Chungsha Bridge in the

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei Prosecutor's Office on Monday
filed charges against 186 people in connection with a large-scale
prostitution ring.</P>
      <P>Charges included violation of sex regulations as well as those
for organized crime.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Liu Cheng-wu, who is in charge of the investigation,
said this was the largest prostitution ring found in Taiwan in recent
years.</P>
      <P>In the next two months, Liu aims to bust the operation which has
lured women from Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Macau, mainland
China, Singapore, and the Philippines to Taiwan and forced them into
prostitution.</P>
      <P>He added that he wants to end Taiwan's reputation as a land of
prostitution and deter women from regions hard hit by the Asian
crisis from coming to Taiwan to work as prostitutes.</P>
      <P>Chen Chun-hung and Liu Chiu-hsieh, the two prime suspects in the
case, reportedly run ads in Southeast Asia, mainly Thailand, to
entice women to come to work in Taiwan. Once these women arrive in
the island, Chen and Liu allegedly seize their passports and control
their movements to force them into prostitution.</P>
      <P>The so-called "Paiho" ring has worked with international gang
leaders, known as snake heads, to smuggle women into Taiwan and have
them to work in 62 local inns and hotels, the prosecutor said.</P>
      <P>Those charged included 23 women from Thailand, two from Malaysia,
four from Hong Kong, three from Macau, and eight from the mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THE HAKKAS HOLD WORLD CONVENTION IN TAIPEI (1)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  10  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 1,500 representatives of the Hakkas
from Taiwan and 30 other countries in the world converged on Taipei
this week to attend the 14th Convention of World Hakkas with a
purpose to renew their traditional bonds.</P>
      <P>The Hakkas are Chinese whose ancestors lived in "Chung Yuan," or
China proper, comprising Hubei, Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and some
parts of other provinces in central and northern China. They
have gradually moved to southern China and emigrated to Southeast
Asia and other parts of the world during national upheavals since the
fourth century.</P>
      <P>It was estimated in 1971 by the Chung Cheng Association of Hong
Kong that there were 45 million Hakkas in the world at that time. The
Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (OCAC) in Taipei estimated in
1992 that there were 34 million overseas Chinese at that time, and
that one third of them were Hakkas.</P>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui, Vice President Lien Chan, Premier Vincent
Siew, and other government leaders attended the convention earlier
this week to thank the Hakkas from all over the world for their
support to the Republic of China, and to brief them on government
policies and the current situations in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>British preacher George Campbell said in his book, "Origin and
Migration of the Hakkas," that "The Hakkas are really the most
outstanding and powerful people among the Chinese nation. Their
origins, migrations and various stories have indeed cultivated a
family-loving psychology and a spirit of fighting against a common
enemy." "The contribution of the Hakkas to the endeavor and progress
of the Chinese nation will be greater and more assertive in the
future," he added.</P>
      <P>Ellsworth Huntington, an American professor of anthropology
at Harvard University, also said in his book titled "The Character of
Races" that "with regards to the status of the Hakkas, the first
thing we notice is their dialect." "What they use is really the
Mandarin language and is different from the dialects of the
non-Hakkas around them, but is similar to the language presently used
in Henan in Central China. From this fact, we can tell that the
Hakkas originated in North China." The Hakka dialect is one of the
five major dialects of China. (more)</P>

    <HEADLINE>THE HAKKAS HOLD WORLD CONVENTION IN TAIPEI (2)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  10  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ancestors of the Hakkas are believed to be wealthy and
aristocratic people living in Chung Yuan before the early fourth
century. They moved south in five major waves when China was
in upheavals caused by alien invasions from the north beginning in
317 AD, 880 AD, 1127, and 1645, and by the Taiping Rebellion
beginning in 1867.</P>
      <P>As a result, they have settled down mostly in Fujian, Guangdong,
Guangxi, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Sichuan provinces in the southern part
of mainland China, and also in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, Malaysia,
Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Borneo, Vietnam, and several
countries in Europe, America, Africa, and Australia. It is estimated
that the Hakkas account for one third of the Chinese living in Hong
Kong, 20 percent of the overseas Chinese in Thailand, and 16 percent
in Vietnam. There are approximately 4 million Hakkas in Taiwan,
about 20 percent of the population on the island.</P>
      <P>It was estimated in 1992 by the OCAC that 88 percent of all
overseas Chinese lived in Indonesia, Thailand, Hong Kong, Malaysia,
and Singapore, and that one third of them were Hakkas. The OCAC
defines overseas Chinese as all people of Chinese descent living
overseas.</P>
      <P>The Hakkas are noted for their persistent adherence
to traditional Chinese customs and values, such as patriotism,
loyalty, hard working, endurance of hardship, love of freedom, and
resistance to alien aggression and influence. In addition, they look
upon themselves as people of high social status. This is why they do
not assimilate very well into the local community and are called
"guest people" wherever they live. "Hakka" means "guest families" in
Chinese.</P>
      <P>The Hakkas also attach great importance to education and family
love. Because of all these virtues, many Hakkas have become effluent
and reached prominence in their fields. Some of them have become
successful in the political field, such as Lee Kuan Yew in Singapore,
Ne Win in Burma, Arthur Chong in Guyana, Ong Yup-lin in Malaysia, and
Gee Mei-lin in Mauritius. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, founding father of the
Republic of China; Hung Hsiu-chuan, leader of the Taiping Rebellion
against the Manchu Court, and some other heroic leaders in Chinese
history were Hakkas.</P>
      <P>In order to renew the bonds among the Hakkas scattered in various
parts of the world, the First Convention of World Hakkas was held in
Hong Kong in 1971, and the World Association of the Hakkas was
established in Taipei in 1974. The predecessor of this association
was the Chung Cheng Association, which was set up in Hong Kong in
1921. The next Convention of World Hakkas will be held in Malaysia
in 1999.</P>
      <P>The World Association of Taiwan Hakkas was inaugurated in the
American city of Dallas, Texas in 1997. The Hakkas in Taiwan have
also established Hakka cultural centers and a Hakka radio station
for the preservation of Hakka culture and customs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER SIEW OUTLINES TOP GOALS FOR KOO'S MAINLAND TRIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Monday outlined the
ROC government's main expectations for a trend-setting visit to
mainland China by its top negotiator with Beijing.</P>
      <P>"We hope Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman C. F. Koo's
upcoming mainland visit will help push for the resumption of regular
dialogue between SEF and its mainland counterpart, and foster an
amiable atmosphere to facilitate the development of constructive ties
across the Taiwan Strait," said the premier.</P>
      <P>Siew made the statement while meeting with Koo and the 11
delegates who will accompany the senior adviser to President Lee
Teng-hui on his Oct. 14-19 visit to Shanghai and Beijing.</P>
      <P>The premier also expressed hope that the two sides will implement
a new way of thinking and approach in addressing cross-strait issues
and rebuild a framework for bilateral exchanges that suits the
current state of separation on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"We earnestly hope that Koo's mainland trip will help usher in a
new 'Chinese help Chinese' stage in cross-strait relations," Siew
said.</P>
      <P>He further pointed out that a major breakthrough in cross-strait
ties lies in Beijing's willingness to face the reality that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait are now separately ruled by two equal
political entities.</P>
      <P>If mainland authorities can respect this aspect of reality and
take concrete actions to end hostility, Siew said he believes
cross-strait relations will soon make great headway.</P>
      <P>The premier went on to say that all-out modernization on both
sides of the strait will be the most effective way to resolve the
fundamental bilateral disputes.</P>
      <P>"We recognize mainland China's economic reforms and open-door
policy. In the meantime, we hope mainland China will gradually expand
democratic experiments from the grassroots level upward to the
central government hierarchy," Siew said, adding that Taiwan is
willing to promote grassroots cross-strait democratic exchanges and
share its experiences in the democratization process with the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Noting that a host of problems still exist between the two sides,
Siew said he is convinced that many of those issues can be resolved
with sincerity, patience and mutual trust.</P>
      <P>Siew further said Taiwan is showing its "goodwill and sincerity"
by sending its top envoy to the mainland to forge rapprochement.</P>
      <P>"Koo brings our goodwill and wishes for mutually beneficial
cross-strait relations, and our friendship and concerns for mainland
people," the premier noted, adding that Koo's forthcoming meetings in
Shanghai with his mainland counterpart, Chairman Wang Daohan of the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), will mark
the beginning of a new phase in cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>For his part, Koo said he feels honored to be authorized by the
government to embark on an ice-breaking mainland visit and talk with
his mainland hosts to push for the resumption of institutionalized
SEF-ARATS dialogue, and nurture an atmosphere conducive to positive
cross-strait interaction. "I feel the mission is a great
responsibility," he added.</P>
      <P>Koo, a business tycoon and experienced ambassador-at-large, said
he will do his utmost to clearly detail and explain Taiwan stances on
cross-strait relations and on various issues raised by his mainland
hosts.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Chang King-yuh presented a letter of authorization to Koo,
entrusting him to embark on the Shanghai-Beijing visit aimed at
improving cross-strait relations. The Cabinet-level MAC charts
Taiwan's policy toward mainland China and oversees SEF operations.</P>
      <P>Koo will first visit Shanghai, where he will meet Wang Daohan,
his mainland counterpart, for wide-ranging talks.</P>
      <P>The Shanghai meeting will be the first between the two elder
statesmen since 1993 talks in Singapore that marked the first formal
contact between the sides since they split politically amid civil war
in 1949.</P>
      <P>Based on the agreement they reached, the two sides held talks on
practical issues such as recognition of legal documents, until
mainland China backed out in June 1995 in anger over Taiwan's efforts
to raise its international profile.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOMESTIC PORK MARKET NOT AFFECTED BY IMPORTED PORK: COA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The recent slip in domestic pork prices was
due to market fluctuation and not the introduction of imported US
pork to Taiwan, the Council of Agriculture (COA) under the Executive
Yuan said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Taipei agreed to open its markets to US pork and pork offal
according to a quota system beginning July 1998 as a part of its bid
to join the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>However, pork consumption in Taiwan has not been affected by the
availability of US pork, COA officials said. Authorities were instead
taken by surprise when pork prices did not drop but instead rose
steadily. Pork prices soared as high as NT$7,000 per 100 kilograms in
September.</P>
      <P>COA Chairman Peng Tso-kwei, who expressed initial concern that
Taipei's participation in the WTO would exert a terrible blow to
Taiwan's pig farming industry, requested the COA's Animal Industry
Department (AID) to investigate why pork prices rose.</P>
      <P>AID Director Chen Bao-ji said the hike in pork prices was due to
a seasonal factor and pork prices normally fall after the Mid-Autumn
Moon Festival, which took place recently.</P>
      <P>AID officials also pointed out that people in Taiwan are not used
to US pork. They said US pork gave off an unusual smell which is
attributed to the different methods in raising hogs.</P>
      <P>US hogs are not washed as they are in Taiwan, AID officials said,
adding that male hogs in Taiwan are castrated when they are 14 days
old so no male hormones affect the quality of the meat.</P>
      <P>Frozen pork imported from the US is competitive only in terms of
price, the COA commented, adding that Taiwan consumers have not
switched their preference for cheaper pork at present.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOJ PROBING ALLEGED MAINLAND CHINA CAPITAL IN ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Justice Minister Cheng Chung-mo said on
Monday that law enforcement authorities are investigating allegations
that mainland Chinese capital has flowed into Taiwan to support
several candidates' electoral bids.</P>
      <P>The grand justice-turned-minister made the statement in response
to an interpellation by an opposition lawmaker during a Legislative
Yuan Judiciary Committee meeting.</P>
      <P>During the session, Legislator Tsai Huang-lang of the
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said mainland
China is reportedly using its capital to support several candidates
in Taiwan's critical year-end elections.</P>
      <P>"Beijing is doing so in an attempt to foster influence in
Taiwan's legislature," Tsai claimed, adding that mainland capital is
being brought into Taiwan either by Taiwan businesspeople or by
brokers who often travel across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Tsai said he suspects that three candidates for the year-end
Legislative Yuan elections in central Taiwan constituencies may be
using capital provided by mainland authorities or Beijing-affiliated
business groups to finance their campaign activities. "Two of the
candidates may be businesspeople with interests in China," he noted.</P>
      <P>Tsai admitted that he still does not have enough evidence to
substantiate his suspicions. "Nevertheless, the data already in my
hands is enough to prove that my suspicions are not totally
unfounded," he added.</P>
      <P>Tsai then presented all his data to Cheng, and asked the Ministry
of Justice (MOJ) to investigate the financial sources of the three
candidates under suspicion.</P>
      <P>In response, Cheng said allegations about possible involvement of
mainland capital in the year-end elections have been rife in local
society in recent months.</P>
      <P>"I have heard of that. As law enforcement authorities are already
investigating such reports, I can't divulge any details at the
moment," Cheng said, adding that the MOJ will do its utmost to
prevent mainland involvement in the upcoming elections.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cheng said he has received numerous phone calls from
unidentified persons threatening to take action against him since he
assumed his current post on July 15.</P>
      <P>Cheng said he thinks the intimidating phone calls may come from
members of criminal rings, as he has launched several crackdowns on
organized crime and vote-buying in the past few months.</P>
      <P>The soft-spoken minister further reaffirmed his determination to
eradicate involvement of violence, money and criminal rings in the
Dec. 5 elections for the Legislative Yuan and for the mayors and city
councils of Taiwan's two special municipalities, Taipei and
Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Cheng went on to say that law enforcement authorities will
actively investigate vote-buying charges as long as they can acquire
clear information regarding "who, what, when, where, and how."</P>
      <P>Noting that the upcoming legislative elections will be the first
after the suspension of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly elections,
Cheng said competition for a seat in the legislature is very fierce
and that the electoral outcome is crucial to Taiwan's future
development.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Cheng said the MOJ will spare no effort
to stem involvement of violence, money and gangsters to ensure that
only capable candidates with a clean image and reputation will
be able to enter the legislature.</P>

    <DATELINE>Manila  Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Timothy Sun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Philippine President Joseph Estrada, who is
currently on a visit to Singapore, pledged on Monday to take the
steps necessary to apprehend kidnappers who prey on wealthy
businessmen, particularly Filipino-Chinese.</P>
      <P>The president has ordered the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime
Task Force to come down hard against criminal syndicates without
jeopardizing the safety of kidnap victims, Press Secretary Rodolfo
Reyes said in an interview with a Manila-based radio station.</P>
      <P>Reyes is a part of Estrada's official delegation which is on a
four-day state visit to Singapore.</P>
      <P>Estrada has also directed a committee to keep him abreast of the
situation while he is abroad and give him updates on kidnapping cases
in Mindanao, National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre said in a
separate radio interview in Manila. One of those cases involves the
kidnapping of a Taiwan businessman's family.</P>
      <P>On Sunday, Filipino-Chinese groups gathered to call for
government action after the recent kidnap and murder of a
businessman. Wilson Ong was abducted on Aug. 26 and killed by his
captors after his family failed to raise the 50 million pesos ransom
demanded. The kidnappers dumped Ong's bullet-riddled body in front of
his textile factory in Valenzuela on Oct. 4.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The director-general of Taiwan's Department
of Health (DOH) said on Monday that he cannot foresee when the ROC
will enter the World Health Organization (WHO), but stressed that the
department will not cease in its attempts to obtain membership.</P>
      <P>Chan Chi-shean made the remarks while answering questions in the
legislature on Taiwan's efforts to rejoin the WHO.</P>
      <P>The ROC was originally a WHO founding member, but lost its seat
in the international organization in 1972 after losing its United
Nations membership in 1971.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, the US House of Representatives unanimously approved
a resolution that expresses the parliamentary body's support to the
ROC in its efforts to join the WHO.</P>
      <P>"Does the DOH have a timetable for joining the WHO?" asked Huang
Tsiou-chu, a legislator from the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party, after being made aware of the US support.</P>
      <P>Chan answered that his department cannot say when the country
will be able to obtain WHO membership, but will never stop its
promotional work in this regard.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the DOH over
the past several years has made efforts to persuade the ROC's foreign
allies to voice their support for Taiwan's WHO membership at WHO

    <HEADLINE>TAIPOWER DENIES REPORT ABOUT NUCLEAR WASTE DISPOSAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-run Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower)
denied a newspaper report on Monday that it will commission mainland
China to dispose of its nuclear waste.</P>
      <P>Taipower said unless mainland China changes its "one China"
policy toward handling Taiwan's nuclear waste, Taipower is unlikely
to strike any deal with the mainland.</P>
      <P>A Taipower executive recalled that the company once commissioned
its subsidiary, the Electricity Research and Experiment Center,
five years ago to explore the feasibility of entrusting a suitable
mainland agency to treat its radioactive waste.</P>
      <P>"Negotiations between the two sides originally proceeded
smoothly. But later, the situation changed due to Beijing's
insistence that the deal be struck under its so called 'one China'
policy. That means Taipower should recognize that Taiwan is part of
the People's Republic of China," the executive said.</P>
      <P>As a state-owned enterprise, the executive said, Taipower must
abide by the Republic of China's law and policy. "Therefore, we
stopped our talks with the mainland," he stressed.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's top negotiator with Beijing, Chairman C. F. Koo of
the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation, will leave Taipei on
Wednesday for an ice-breaking visit to the mainland, local media
have again shown interest in the possibility of commissioning
mainland China to handle Taipower's nuclear waste.</P>
      <P>The Taipower executive, however, insisted that the nuclear
waste disposal issue is not on Koo's agenda for his meetings with
his mainland hosts.</P>
      <P>"There are so many far more pressing cross-strait issues to be
discussed by Koo and his mainland hosts. The nuclear waste issue
will not become a topic during Koo's mainland trip," he asserted.</P>
      <P>The executive further said Taipower is still seeking
possible destinations at home and abroad for permanent disposal of
its nuclear waste, including North Korea, Russia, the
Marshall Islands, and Wuchiu, a small islet of the
Taiwan-held Kinmen Islands, which lie closer to the
southeastern mainland coast that to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taipower once signed a contract with North Korea to ship 20,000
barrels of low-grade nuclear waste to that country for permanent
disposal. The planned shipment, however, has been stalled because of
some technical problems and strong opposition from South Korea and
several other countries on environmental protection grounds.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The "Corruptive Behavior Watch," a
dissident organization, Monday urged the Communist Party of China
(CPC) to clean up corruption in the rural area in order to prevent
the relations between farmer and government from getting worse.</P>
      <P>The dissident organization issued an open letter to the Presidium
of the Third Plenary Session of the 15th Central Committee of the
CPC, which opened in Beijing Monday, through the Hong Kong-based
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China.</P>
      <P>The open letter said that corruption is rampant in the rural
area, and that the central government should clean up such
corruption, reduce tax and other burdens on farmers, and promote
democracy in the rural area. Agricultural and rural problems are high
on the agenda of the three-day CPC Central Committee plenum,
according to recent news reports from the mainland.</P>
      <P>The Corruptive Behavior Watch was organized by nine dissidents
from seven provinces. They filed an application with the Ministry of
Civil Affairs in Beijing on Sept. 23 for registering the
dissident organization, but the ministry has not given any reply, An

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Medical Professional Alliance
(TMPA) on Monday urged mainland China to respond positively to the
ROC's bid to enter the World Health Organization (WHO) in the coming
cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>The TMPA has sent representatives to Geneva to lobby for Taiwan's
entry to the United Nations' health body for the past two years.</P>
      <P>TMPA President Teng Chao-fan said the outbreak of the
foot-and-mouth disease and enterovirus in Taiwan showed that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait could complement each other in pushing for
disease prevention and improved public health conditions.</P>
      <P>He added that Beijing should consider lending its support for
Taiwan's WHO bid so as to pave the way for the establishment of a
communicable disease control mechanism for the greater China area.</P>
      <P>The TMPA is now planning to set up a Taiwan international health
foundation and will work with the government to assist with
international health efforts, Teng said.</P>
      <P>He said the idea has gained support from several local major
hospitals which have pledged to nurture local talent in public health
and provide medical services.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Department of Health (DOH) Director General Chan
Chi-shean said on Monday he will continue with efforts to try to pry
open the door to the WHO next year.</P>
      <P>Chan made the remarks after the US House of Representative passed
a resolution over the weekend supporting Taiwan's participation in
the WHO.</P>
      <P>Although the passage of the resolution has no binding power on
the US administrative branch, Chan said it demonstrates the ROC's
efforts to return to the WHO have borne fruit.</P>
      <P>In addition to the WHO, the DOH is also applying to join the
Pharmaceutical Inspection Corporation/Scheme (PIC/S) to try to boost
the export of Taiwan pharmaceuticals.</P>
      <P>Hu You-pu, director of DOH's Bureau of Medical Affairs, said he
believes Taiwan's chances of gaining entry to the Geneva-based
organization is high.</P>
      <P>The biological and pharmaceutical industries are expected to be
the star performers in the next century, Chan said. With this view,
local pharmaceutical companies should pool their sources, streamline
marketing efforts, and take part in international experiments to
boost the competitiveness of Taiwan's pharmaceutical industry, he
added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang
has promised a US official that Taiwan has no intention of using the
influence of the US Congress to aid Taiwan's accession to the World
Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>A ranking official with the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
disclosed on Monday that Wang made the promise during talks with US
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky.</P>
      <P>In order to avoid causing unnecessary trouble to the Clinton
administration, the official said, Wang told Barshefsky that Taiwan
would not take the initiative to seek congressional influence over
the WTO issue.</P>
      <P>Last Saturday, the US House of Representative passed a
resolution, 418-0 to call on the Clinton administration to support
Taiwan's participation in the World Health Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>This support for Taiwan to participate in the international
organization is believed to have put some pressure on the Clinton
administration.</P>
      <P>It has been eight years since Taiwan first applied to rejoin the
WTO. Taipei has urged the US government on numerous occasions to help
expedite its accession, but seems to have been less willing to employ
the influence of the US Congress.</P>
      <P>This year, Taiwan has made some remarkable progress in its WTO
efforts, concluding bilateral talks with the United States in
February, with Switzerland in May, and with the EU in July.</P>
      <P>To date, there are only three WTO members -- Canada, Hong Kong,
and the EU -- with which Taiwan has yet signed formal bilateral
agreements.</P>
      <P>After finishing the bilateral negotiations, the entry process
will move to multilateral talks. Taiwan expects that the next working

    <HEADLINE>REVIEW  OF  DEVELOPMENTS IN KOO-WANG CONSULTATIONS SINCE 1993</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 1993 round of talks between Koo
Chen-fu, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), and Wang
Daohan, chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS), resulted in several agreements which went into effect
on May 29 of that year.</P>
      <P>Following the 1993 Koo-Wang meetings in Singapore, the two sides,
represented by the SEF and ARATS, held seven rounds of functional
talks and three rounds of secretary-general-level talks.</P>
      <P>These meetings focused largely on practical issues, and led to a
number of agreements in areas such as the repatriation of hijackers,
illegal immigrants, and fishing disputes. Dates for future talks were
also settled.</P>
      <P>Just as cross-strait relations were becoming less tense, and the
ROC government was actively promoting friendly relations with the
Chinese mainland, the Chinese communists released a white paper
titled "The Taiwan Question and the Reunification of China" on August
31, 1993.</P>
      <P>This move demonstrated mainland China's rigid stance toward the
ROC on Taiwan, according to Chang Liang-jen, former director of the
Department of Cultural Affairs at the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC).</P>
      <P>Chang, who is now SEF's deputy secreatry-general, noted that the
various issues arising from private exchanges between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait are extremely complex.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, he recalled, they were discussed in full during the
Koo-Wang talks, and were given priority in order of magnitude and
urgency. According to this priority list, the following topics were
to be discussed by the end of 1993:</P>
      <P>-- repatriation of people entering the area of the other party in
violation of pertinent regulations, and related issues;</P>
      <P>-- joint efforts to combat smuggling, hijacking, and other
crimes;</P>
      <P>-- consultations on the handling of fishing disputes at sea;</P>
      <P>-- protection of intellectual property rights of the two sides;
and</P>
      <P>-- mutual assistance between the judicial organs of the two
sides.</P>
      <P>Both parties agreed to select a different time and place to
continue discussions on economic issues, on which the two sides have
widely divergent views, and to further discuss cultural and
scientific exchanges. The priority issues to be discussed in future
talks were thus clearly delineated.</P>
      <P>In order to fulfill the agreements, an SEF delegation made a trip
to Beijing on Aug. 28, 1993, hoping to discuss the five subjects
specified above.</P>
      <P>Due to time limitations, the SEF proposed that "mutual assistance
between the judicial organs of the two sides" and "repatriation of
people entering the area of the other party in violation of pertinent
regulations and related issues" be discussed first. The SEF was also
willing to discuss the other three priority issues agreed upon in the
Koo-Wang Talks Joint Accord.</P>
      <P>ARATS, however, proposed that either the agenda stipulated in the
joint accord be "rearranged," or priority issues for 1993 should be
"specifically arranged." ARATS also proposed a timetable that would
have had both sides discussing 13 issues in the last four months of
1993.</P>
      <P>Among the 13 subjects raised by ARATS were issues which fell
outside the scope of the Koo-Wang Talks Joint Accord, such as the
opening of Taiwan's labor market to mainland workers.</P>
      <P>During the August talks in Beijing, the SEF delegates fully
respected the opinion of their ARATS counterparts, and stated that if
specific conclusions were reached by the end of that year, ARATS' new
proposals could be discussed.</P>
      <P>The ARATS delegates, however, insisted that a timetable for
holding talks on economic issues had to be set, and they were willing
to listen to, but refused to speak about, the two previously
agreed-upon priority issues of "repatriation of illegal immigrants"
and "judicial assistance."

(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The non-interactive nature of the discussions stripped the talks
of any meaning. Both sides should have followed common practice by
simply abiding by the agreements already reached, according to Chang.</P>
      <P>Making random changes, advancing unreasonable interpretations,
and changing the order of the talks as one pleases are all
inappropriate behavior, he added.</P>
      <P>ARATS' attempt to rearrange the agenda under the pretext of
carrying out agreements reached during the earlier Koo-Wang talks was
in stark violation of the Koo-Wang Talks Joint Accord. In addition,
discussing generalities was of no help at all in solving the
practical problems at hand.</P>
      <P>Faced with these less than ideal circumstances, the SEF
delegation chose to return to Taipei on Sept. 3, earlier than
originally scheduled. Although the talks in Beijing failed to reach
any conclusion, the SEF remained willing to continue consultations in
line with the Koo-Wang Talks Joint Accord.</P>
      <P>The other six consultations were held from Nov. 2 to 7, 1993 in
Xiamen; from Dec. 18 to 24, 1993 in Taipei; from March 25 to 30, 1994
in Beijing; from July 30 to Aug. 2, 1994 in Taipei; from Nov. 23 to
27 in Nanjing; and from Jan. 22 to 27, 1995 also in Nanjing.</P>
      <P>At a preparatory meeting held from May 27 to 28, 1995 in Taipei,
it was decided that a second round of Koo-Wang talks would be held on
July 20, 1995, in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Both sides agreed that the talks would cover issues such as the
implementation of accords signed during the first round of talks,
Taiwan investment rights in mainland China, and a wide range of
unofficial exchanges.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the mainland authorities postponed indefinitely
this second round of Koo-Wang talks in June 1995, and staged their
notorious test-firing of missiles into the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTARIAN URGES TAIPEI-BEIJING RAPPROCHEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Rapprochement with Beijing would give
Taiwan more leeway in exploring ties with foreign countries, because
mainland China's objections are the main cause of the island's
marginalization, a visiting member of the European Parliament said on
Monday.</P>
      <P>Beijing's huge market of 1 billion people gives it an inflated
status in the eyes of European states, and has prompted these states
to sideline the human rights agenda in their engagements with
Beijing, said Viviane Reding, a member of the European Parliament
(EP) from Luxembourg, and president of the pro-Taiwan EP-Taiwan
Intergroup.</P>
      <P>Strong pressure from Beijing also explains the difficulty senior
Taiwan officials have had in visiting Europe recently, said Reding,
adding that a normalization of ties between Taipei and Beijing would
ease mainland China's opposition to Taipei's efforts to enhance its
international profile.</P>
      <P>Although calling it an important step, Reding warned against
reading too much into the forthcoming meeting of Koo Chen-fu and Wang
Daohan, the respective chairmen of Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation and Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>She said it is only natural for people with the same language and
culture to get together, and added that rapprochement can occur
naturally and smoothly only when mainland China parallels Taiwan in
its economic and democratic development.</P>
      <P>She said she finds it inexplicable that Taiwan has been excluded
from the United Nations in spite of its dynamic economic strength and
its 21 million population, "much, much bigger" than the 450,000
people of her native Luxembourg.</P>
      <P>To remedy this mistake "stemming from past political factors,"
Reding said she favors Taiwan's entry into the World Trade
Organization, and the United Nations Children's Fund, as well as
other UN agencies, to pave the way for the country's full integration
into the international community.</P>
      <P>Although a supporter of a European Parliament resolution earlier
this year to set up a trade representative office in Taiwan, Reding
refused to speculate when the words of the proposal will be
translated into deeds, because it is up to the European Union
Ministerial Council to decide whether to proceed with the plan.</P>
      <P>After attending celebrations for the ROC Double Ten National Day,
the head of the EP-Taiwan Intergroup which groups some 100 European
Parliament members, will leave Taiwan on Tuesday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui said on Monday that
this week's mainland China trip by Koo Chen-fu, chairman of Taiwan's
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), will have profound significance.</P>
      <P>Lee said the system that has been implemented in the Republic of
China on Taiwan is "not only a symbol of liberty and democracy, but
also a goal mainland China should strive for."</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks at a presidential tea party in
honor of representatives of overseas Chinese communities who had come
to Taipei for the ROC Double Ten National Day festivities.</P>
      <P>Koo is leaving for Shanghai later this week to resume his talks
with Wang Daohan, chairman of Beijing's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS). After the talks in Shanghai, Koo
will proceed to Beijing to meet with mainland China's President Jiang
Zemin.</P>
      <P>Lee stressed that the ROC is an independent sovereign country and
a political entity equal to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Only under such a basis and common consensus, he said, will the
two sides be able to enter consultations to solve common problems.
"Otherwise, the 1.2 billion people on the mainland may not be able to
genuinely free themselves from socialism and communism."</P>
      <P>The president lauded his visitors for their deep concern over the
ROC's national development. He said his government will in turn do
its utmost to help overseas Chinese in the economic, cultural, and
educational fields.</P>
      <P>Lee said that over the past decade, the ROC has made remarkable
achievements in political democratization and social reform,
achievements of which the people of the mainland should be aware.</P>
      <P>The president said that the government will continue to work
toward building up a civilized, modern country, and expressed the
hope that overseas Chinese everywhere will continue to support the
nation.</P>

Monday held separate trade workshops in Taipei, with the aim of
attracting investment from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the Hungarian workshop, Tibor Melega, leader of the East
European country's bureau of trade and investment promotion,
recommended his country's investment environment.</P>
      <P>He said that Hungary is expected to join the European Union by
2002, an incentive that will facilitate Taiwan businesses wishing to
gain a foothold in the European market.</P>
      <P>Melega also pointed out that foreign investment has never stopped
in Hungary. Half of the world's top 50 enterprises have investments
in the country, he cited, noting that this fact proves his country

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING SETS LOW-KEY LINE FOR KOO-WANG TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing has determined that the talks
between the top negotiators on both sides of the Taiwan Strait will
be set amid a "ceremonial reception" and "low key media reports," a
Hong Kong paper reported on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Ming Po daily cited sources as saying mainland authorities
laid down this particular framework because they do not believe the
Koo-Wang meeting will produce any substantive breakthrough in
bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>The report came as Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), is set to begin a six-day mainland visit on
Wednesday. Koo is scheduled to meet with his mainland Chinese
counterpart, Wang Daohan, chairman of the Beijing-based Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), in Shanghai on Sunday
for the first time in more than five years.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin will receive Koo in
Beijing in a ceremonial reception. Jiang will not discuss any
concrete issues with Koo, and mainland media will make brief reports
about their meeting, the paper reported.</P>
      <P>A meeting was held on Monday in Shanghai in which scores of
municipal and Communist Party officials in charge of Taiwan affairs
and state security decided on the type of reception and reaction to
Koo's visit, according to Ming Po.</P>
      <P>An ARATS official who spoke to the paper on condition of
anonymity, said the coming Koo-Wang meeting will not resolve
practical matters but should have a positive impact on cross-strait
dealings.</P>
      <P>The official said the root problem in bilateral relations is the
question of jurisdiction. Mainland China has realized that political
differences are the major hurdle in two-way exchanges, so it favors
starting political negotiations to address Taiwan people's aspiration
for peace and safety.</P>
      <P>But as the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have not yet begun
procedural talks for political negotiations, Koo's meeting has been
defined as only "a visit and tour," the ARATS official said.</P>

      <P>Tourism industry chiefs have strongly
criticized the Australian government's attempt to target foreign
tourists with a 10 percent goods and services tax or value-added tax
when Sydney hosts the 2000 Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>Federal Treasurer Peter Costello on Sunday said the government

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asian economic crisis is expected to
drag down Australia's gross domestic product growth below the 2.75
percent target in fiscal 1998-99 and boost the country's unemployment
rate, forecasters said.</P>
      <P>The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics
(ABARE) said the GDP growth would fall to 2 percent, well below the
official target made earlier this year.</P>
      <P>ABARE's worst case scenario was included in a report on energy
demand given to the energy ministers of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum at the weekend, according to the Australian
Financial Review on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The new forecast of 2 percent growth is based on the assumption
that the economic turmoil in Asia will continue for a longer period
than previously expected with more severe ramifications for the 21
APEC countries.</P>
      <P>Australia's unemployment rate is expected to rise sharply and the
budget will slide back into a deficit over the next 18 months as the
country will be swept up in the unfolding global crisis, according to
the Syntec Economic Services, a leading forecasting consultant in
Australia.</P>
      <P>In its five-year forecast, Syntec predicted that the jobless rate
would rise to 8.7 percent by June 1999 before rising further to 9
percent by the middle of 2000. The Howard administration's predicted

    <HEADLINE>DOMESTIC OIL PRICES TO BE LOWERED BY 2.99% FROM WEDNESDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC)
announced yet another oil price cut on Tuesday to reflect its
declining production costs.</P>
      <P>Starting on Wednesday, retail prices for a variety of petroleum
products will be lowered by an average of 2.99 percent, a CPC
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>This is the fifth time since July that the state monopoly has
offered an across-the-board price cut for its products amid a
downward spiral in international crude oil prices.</P>
      <P>Altogether, the CPC has slashed its product prices by a total of
8.68 percent since July.</P>
      <P>As the domestic oil market will be deregulated next year, some
market analysts and officials with the Fair Trade Commission said
CPC's repeated price cuts are partly aimed at discouraging private
enterprises from entering the local market.</P>
      <P>The CPC, however, refuted such speculation, saying that the
allegation is biased and unfair.</P>
      <P>"We have lowered prices partly to reflect slumping oil refining
costs and partly to upgrade our competitiveness in preparation for
the impending market liberalization," a CPC spokesman said, adding
that the company's efforts to sharpen its competitive edge should not
be interpreted as a move to prevent prospective competitors from
entering the market.</P>
      <P>Formosa Plastics Group, one of Taiwan's leading
private conglomerates, is poised to market its oil products early
next year.</P>
      <P>After Wednesday's adjustment, the retail price for premium
gasoline will fall marginally to NT$17 (US$0.52) per liter from the
current NT$17.4, while fuel oil prices will be lowered by NT$168 per
kiloliter to NT$4,002.</P>
      <P>The price for research octane number (RON) 95-unleaded gasoline
will decline to NT$16.8 per liter from NT$17.2 and the price for
RON-92 unleaded gasoline will be cut to NT$15.8 from NT$16.2.</P>
      <P>The price for high-grade diesel will drop to NT$12.1 per liter
from NT$12.4, while normal-grade diesel will slide from NT$11.2 to
NT$10.9.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the wholesale price for household-use liquefied
petroleum gas (LPG) will edge down to NT$9.93 per kilogram from
NT$10.33, and the retail price for vehicle-use LPG will dip to
NT$10.1 from NT$10.3.</P>
      <P>The CPC spokesman said the new prices were calculated based on two
criteria -- crude oil prices at NT$13 per barrel and a currency
exchange rate of NT$32.89 against the US dollar.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said although international crude oil prices
rebounded in September, the appreciation of the NT dollar against the
greenback has helped offset the increase in the CPC's crude oil
import costs.</P>
      <P>The CPC has conducted weekly reviews of domestic petroleum prices
since March in an attempt to have its prices fluctuate in tandem with
international crude oil prices and the local currency's exchange rate
against the greenback.</P>
      <P>The company first offered a 1.57 percent cut in prices for its
products on July 1, and again trimmed its prices by an average of
1.28 percent on July 22. It announced a further 1.53 percent cut on
Aug. 12, and another 1.31 percent reduction on Aug. 26.</P>
      <P>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS) hailed the CPC's price cuts, saying the move will help slow
the growth of domestic consumer prices.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials said there is still room for domestic oil price
reductions as rises in international crude oil prices in the
coming winter season is expected to remain limited and the NT dollar
may continue appreciating against the greenback.</P>
      <P>The officials predicted that the domestic inflation rate will
fall below 1.5 percent this year.</P>
      <P>Despite the oil price reduction, Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower),
also a state monopoly, said it will not follow suit in cutting its
electricity prices because oil prices account for a limited portion
of its power generation costs.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Taipower said it will adjust its pricing structure
in the near future to offer different prices at different time slots
and charge higher power rates for big electricity users.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC CHAIRMAN EXPECTS KOO TO CONVEY ROC'S GOODWILL TO MAINLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Chang
King-yuh said on Tuesday that he hopes Koo Chen-fu, chairman of
Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation (SEF), will convey the ROC's
goodwill to the mainland during his visit there Oct. 14 to 19.</P>
      <P>Koo will leave for Shanghai on Wednesday to resume talks with
Wang Daohan, chairman of Beijing's Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), that were begun in 1993 in Singapore.</P>
      <P>After the Shanghai talks, Koo will proceed to Beijing to meet
with President Jiang Zemin and other Beijing officials.</P>
      <P>Chang, who met with the media to indicate the government's
expectations from the talks, said he believes the talks will attain
the goals laid down by ROC Premier Vincent Siew when he received Koo
and members of his mainland-bound delegation on Monday: the promotion
of exchanges between SEF and ARATS, the resumption of bilateral
systematic negotiations, the cultivation of a friendly atmosphere and
the development of constructive relations.</P>
      <P>Chang also expressed his hope that Beijing will resume
negotiations on issues related to the interests of people on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In addition to participating in formal talks, Koo will engage in
some sightseeing and visit with a variety of mainland officials and
representatives during his six-day trip. Chang said the visit will
afford Koo a good opportunity to convey the ROC government's
position, as well as the thoughts of the people of Taiwan, to the
mainland.</P>
      <P>The MAC chief said the ROC has existed for 87 years, and a
division of rule between the two sides of the strait is not only a
historical truth but also a political fact. Because of this national
division, he said, the Republic of China has been striving for
reunification with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chang pointed out that the ROC government's basic national policy
is to pursue liberty, democracy, the equality of wealth and eventual
reunification based on rationality, peacefulness and equality of
status.</P>
      <P>He said that Beijing should respect the present division of rule
and search for ways to improve cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>He noted that any attempt by Beijing to block the ROC's
diplomatic activities, to attempt military intimidation or to isolate
Taiwan politically would only hurt bilateral relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEMINAR ON CROSS-STRAIT JURISPRUDENCE EXCHANGE OPENS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A seminar on cross-strait jurisprudence
exchange, co-sponsored by Soochow University and the Law Association
of China, opened Tuesday at the downtown campus of Soochow
University.</P>
      <P>Representatives of both sides of the Taiwan Strait, including Lu
Ren-fa, ROC state public prosecutor general under the Supreme Court,
and Sun Wanzhong, executive vice president of the mainland's Law
Society, expressed their hopes that the seminar would be beneficial
to furthering the understanding of and exchanges by both sides of the
strait.</P>
      <P>Lu, a Soochow University graduate, pointed out at the seminar
that since the opening up between the two sides, both civil contacts
and commercial engagements have increased greatly. In the face of
this new trend and environment, remarked Lu, it is necessary for
academic sectors of both sides to research and resolve differences
and misunderstandings across the strait.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Sun -- who served director of the Bureau of
Legislative Affairs under mainland China's State Council for many
years -- said that economic development, social stability and
cultural prosperity all hinge on the protection of the rule of law,
which is based on the study and research of scholars.</P>
      <P>Sun further said that although there were differences between the
two sides, the fact that people on both sides of the strait share the
same cultural and historical traditions, as well as a common
language, means the normal development of bilateral relations can be
expected as long as a cross-strait engagement and exchanges continue.</P>
      <P>Wu Hsin-hsing, deputy secretary-general of the Taipei-based
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), attended the meeting on behalf of
SEF Vice Chairperson and Secretary-General Shi Hwei-yow.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that the current separation between Taiwan and mainland
China can be seen as going back 103 years to 1895, when Taiwan was
ceded to Japan under the terms of the Treaty of Shimonoseki.</P>
      <P>Differences in concepts, ideas, laws and regulations, as well as
in administrative systems, between the two sides is inevitable, Wu
added. The SEF deputy secretary-general expressed his hope that the
two-day seminar will serve as an opportunity for both sides to learn
about the differences between and similarities of their systems of
jurisprudence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING REPATRIATES 4 TAIWAN FUGITIVES ON EVE OF KOO'S VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China repatriated four Taiwan
fugitives via the Republic of China's defense outpost of Matsu
Islands on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Local observers said it was a gesture of goodwill from Beijing
on the eve of new talks between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) under the National
Police Administration said the repatriation was conducted in
accordance with the Kinmen Agreement signed by the Red Cross
Society on both sides of the Taiwan Strait in 1990.</P>
      <P>A total of 47 Taiwan outlaws have been repatriated from mainland
China since the agreement was signed, said a CIB official.</P>
      <P>Under the escort of mainland Chinese Red Cross Society
officials, the four Taiwan fugitives were sent to Matsu, which lies
closer to the southeastern mainland coast than to Taiwan, Tuesday
morning. The fugitives were later escorted back to Taiwan by CIB
agents.</P>
      <P>"We appreciate mainland China's cooperation in helping crack down
on crime," the CIB official said, adding that the CIB hopes the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait can cooperate even more closer in
fighting crime.</P>
      <P>The repatriation came a day before the departure of Taiwan's top
negotiator with Beijing, C. F. Koo, for a six-day visit to mainland
China. During his stay in Shanghai and Beijing, Koo will meet with
his mainland counterpart, Wang Daohan, and mainland President Jiang
Zemin. Their meetings will be the first high-level cross-strait
encounters in more than three years.</P>
      <P>According to CIB tallies, 192 Taiwan outlaws, including
some convicted criminals, are still hiding in mainland China. Among
them are movie and cable television operator Yang Teng-kuei; Bamboo
Union Gang leaders "White Wolf" Chang An-lo and Huang Hai-ju;
and Huang Shang-feng who allegedly seriously injured prosecutor
Chang Chin-tu a few years ago.</P>
      <P>The CIB official said Taiwan outlaws who have managed to flee to
the mainland mostly hide in Donguan, Guangzhou, Shenzhen in
Guangdong Province; Xiamen and Fuzhou in Fujian Province; Shanghai;
and Hainan.</P>
      <P>The official said many of those fugitives are still directing
their henchmen in Taiwan to conduct illegal business operations or
criminal activities, and some of them have collaborated with mainland
criminal rings to conduct cross-strait drug trafficking or human and
firearms smuggling.</P>
      <P>"We hope mainland authorities will pay attention to these
developments and coordinate with Taiwan to establish a joint
crime-fighting framework to stem cross-strait criminal activities,"
the official said.</P>
      <P>The four fugitives repatriated on Tuesday were identified as
Wang Pao-lien, 42, who had been sentenced to 14 years in prison on
charges of drug trafficking before she fled the island; Chen
Chung-cheng, 36, who has been wanted for alleged involvement in
several robbery cases; Shen Ching-hsiang, 33, who had been sentenced
to receive reformatory education in accordance with an
anti-organized crime law before he fled to the mainland; and Yen
Lien-hsing, 26, who has been wanted for alleged involvement in an
armed robbery.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 13 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Radio Moscow said over the weekend in its
Mandarin commentary, titled "The Process of Democratization in
Taiwan," that Taiwan has made remarkable achievement in
democratization since it lifted martial law in 1987.</P>
      <P>The commentary, which was made on the occasion of the
national day of the Republic of China on Oct. 10, said the ideas of
Dr. Sun Yat-sen, founding father of the republic, have always been
remembered by his countrymen. The ideas have become "the basis of the
democratic government on Taiwan," it added.</P>
      <P>The lifting of martial law and abolition of the "Temporary
Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion" in
1987 marked the beginning of informal contacts between Taiwan and
mainland China, the commentary said.</P>
      <P>In the next year, Taiwan lifted the ban on the registration of
new mass media and on political demonstrations. Two years later,
Taiwan lifted the ban on the formation of new political parties.
Political pluralism has been established in Taiwan as a result, it
added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has revised the Constitution in several steps in the past
few years to facilitate political reforms, it said, adding that
constitutional amendments have enabled the direct election of the
President of the country. Lee Teng-hui became the first
popularly-elected president in Chinese history in March, 1993, the
commentary said.</P>
      <P>"Of course, this doesn't mean every problem of Taiwan is
resolved... Reform is continuing," it said, adding that "despite
difficulties and obstacles, Taiwan is able to conduct political
affairs within the scope of democracy, and this is what Taiwan
people can be proud of."</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CALLS KOO-JIANG MEETING PRIVATE IN NATURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman
Lin Yi-hsiung said on Tuesday that cross-strait exchanges should be
monitored by the whole of society and that the upcoming meeting
between Taiwan's top negotiator and mainland Chinese President Jiang
Zemin should be seen as private in nature.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference called by the DPP on the eve of
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Koo Chen-fu's long-awaited
visit to mainland China, Lin said Koo's planned meeting with Jiang
should be viewed as private, since Jiang will only receive Koo and
his wife.</P>
      <P>Koo will embark on a six-day visit to the mainland on Wednesday
at the head of an 11-member delegation composed mainly of government
officials in charge of mainland affairs.</P>
      <P>Lin said the DPP is not opposed to cross-strait engagement and
dialogue, but added that the process should be subject to social
monitoring. He stressed that in principle, the DPP does not object to
a possible summit between ROC President Lee Teng-hui and Jiang, but
said the two leaders should avoid meeting in private.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Chiu Yi-jen, however, said that time is not
yet ripe for a much speculated Lee-Jiang meeting due to a dispute
over Lee's status in any such meeting. Taiwan insists he must travel
as "president of the ROC," while Beijing balks at this demand.</P>
      <P>Yen Wan-chin, director of the DPP's Mainland Affairs Department,
said the party will do its best to play the role of monitor in
cross-strait talks, despite the fact that no DPP member is included
in Koo's delegation.</P>
      <P>He called on the SEF and its mainland Chinese counterpart -- the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait -- to exchange
institutionalized branches to deal with problems arising from
bilateral exchanges, saying it would help protect the rights of the
people on both sides and that the proposal is a reflection of the
DPP's mainland policy, which favors across-the-board dialogue with
the mainland.</P>
      <P>Legislator Shih Ming-te, a former DPP chairman, lamented the
absence of DPP representatives in Koo's delegation. He said the DPP
stands firm in its pursuit of Taiwan independence and that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait should resolve their disputes through
negotiation.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chang Chun-hung stressed the importance of peace in
the Taiwan Strait. He said cross-strait tensions have raised grave
concern around the world, and suggested that the two sides jointly
launch a military satellite and cooperate on the economic front.</P>
      <P>He demanded that Koo fully relay the opinions of all Taiwan's
people to his mainland counterparts during his tour.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Cho-shui claimed that Koo and his delegation are
not entitled to make any response to, or compromises on, issues
related to unification, or the "one China" controversy.</P>
      <P>He urged Koo to stick to President Lee's ideal of sharing
Taiwan's democratization experience with the mainland, and called on
SEF Secretary-General Shi Hwei-yow to keep his promise to fully
reflect Taiwan's stance.</P>
      <P>Criticizing Jiang's decision to receive Koo and his wife in
private, Legislator Chang Chun-hsiung described the meeting as a bad
arrangement. He said Koo's visit to mainland China only forms part of
the exchange process, and should be transparent to the public.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP HOPES KOO DELEGATION CONVEYS SENSE OF TAIWAN PEOPLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) on Tuesday expressed its hope that C. F. Koo, Taiwan's top
negotiator with the mainland, conveys the sense of the Taiwan people
during his upcoming mainland trip.</P>
      <P>The DPP made the appeal in a press conference held on the eve of
the first high-level cross-strait talks in five years.</P>
      <P>DPP heavyweights, including DPP Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung, former
party Chairman Shih Ming-teh and Legislators Chang Chun-hung and Lin
Tzou-shui, participated in the conference.</P>
      <P>The DPP also proposed that Koo, chairman of the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), invite his mainland counterpart, Wang Daohan,
chairman of the Association of the Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS), to come to Taiwan to witness year-end city council, mayoral
and legislative elections.</P>
      <P>The DPP urged both sides of the Taiwan Strait to resume
consultations on issues that are related to the interests of the
people across the Taiwan Strait, including judicial assistance,
investment guarantees, business arbitration and joint crackdowns on
criminal activities as soon as possible, adding that these issues
should not be affected by political concerns.</P>
      <P>The DPP suggested that SEF and ARATS set up branch offices in the
mainland and Taiwan, respectively, and that such offices be
authorized to handle issues related to people on both sides of the
strait.</P>
      <P>The DPP also proposed that both sides of the Taiwan Strait, under
the framework of international organizations, engage in consultations
to devise a strategy to deal with the current financial turmoil in
Southeast Asia and to establish a mechanism that will effectively
ensure peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>For this reason, the DPP suggested that Taiwan and mainland China
propose at November's Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
meeting that all rim nations in South China sea send
ministerial-level officials to attend a proposed economic cooperation
conference on the South China Sea.</P>
      <P>The DPP asked the Taiwan delegation to insist that the island of
Taiwan is a sovereign state and to ignore calls for reunification
from Beijing.</P>
      <P>During the first talks between Koo and Wang in Singapore in 1993,
talks that set up the framework for regular dialogue across the
strait, the DPP sent a delegation to the city-state to protest the
talks.</P>
      <P>The DPP was worried that those talks might touch such issues as
unification and that Taiwan's interests might be compromised.</P>
      <P>Although the DPP was excluded from Koo's 12-member delegation, it
has made friendly proposals to Beijing and expressed its wishes that
the meeting will prove a success.</P>
      <P>Koo's delegation should reflect fully the sense of the people of
Taiwan, the DPP said, citing the results of a recent public opinion
poll that indicated 77 percent of the people in Taiwan do not support
the "one country, two systems" formula advocated by the mainland,
while 84 percent of the people insist that the fate of Taiwan should
be decided not by mainland China but by the 21.3 million people of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The results of that poll also revealed that 83.1 percent of
Taiwan people believe mainland China should renounce the use of force
against Taiwan, while 92 percent think Taiwan should join
international organizations.</P>

      <P>Europe imported a total of 2.18 million
personal computers from Taiwan in the first half of this year, up
77.2 percent form the same period of last year, according to the
latest official statistics.</P>
      <P>The statistics released on Tuesday by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) show that Taiwan exported a
total of 7.97 million PCs during the first six months of this year,
up 49 percent from the same period of 1997, and making the region
Taiwan's second-largest market for PCs.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's total PC production volume reached 8.24 million units in
the January-June period of this year, registering a 48.5 percent
surge in comparison with the year-earlier level. Of those, 270,000
were sold on the island, the statistics show.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials said the significant growth could be attributed
to a world trend for low-priced computers and global demand for
computer upgrades following the launch of Microsoft's Windows 98

      <P>Taiwan's PC exports to the Asia-Pacific region amounted to 1.98
million in the first six months of 1998, up 50 percent from the same
period of 1997, but registering as a decline in growth due to the

      <P>Desktop PCs accounted for 5.7 million units of the exported PCs,
up 60.6 percent, while notebook PCs accounted for 2.54 million, a 27

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN REPATRIATES 215 ILLEGAL MAINLAND IMMIGRANTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Matsu,  Oct.  13  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China repatriated 215
illegal mainland Chinese immigrants on Tuesday from its front-line
offshore outpost of Matsu, marking the first repatriation from Taiwan
to mainland China in six months.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, four suspected criminals from Taiwan were repatriated
from the mainland to Matsu. The four -- three men and one woman --
were flown back to Taiwan and turned over to police in the afternoon,
Matsu police sources said.</P>
      <P>As all repatriations require the cooperation of mainland Chinese
authorities, Tuesday's delivery was considered a goodwill gesture by
Beijing before a visit to the mainland by Taiwan's top negotiator,
Koo Chen-fu, local political observers said.</P>
      <P>Since April of this year, Beijing has been reluctant to take back
illegal immigrants to Taiwan. An unwillingness to do so is a
violation of the Kinmen Agreement reached between the Red Cross
Societies of both sides in 1990, the sources noted.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, the mainland is supposed to take delivery of
illegal mainland immigrants within 20 days of receiving a list of the
immigrants' names.</P>
      <P>The 215 mainlanders have been detained in four ROC detention
centers for stowaways and illegal immigrants from mainland China. Two
centers are located on Matsu and one each is located in central
Taiwan's Hsinchu and eastern Taiwan's Ilan.</P>
      <P>As of Tuesday afternoon, there were still some 200 illegal
mainland Chinese immigrants in the two Matsu detention centers
awaiting repatriation.</P>
      <P>Of the 215 mainlanders, one woman, Yang Caixia, is a wanted
criminal from the island province of Hainan. Yang married a Taiwanese
man, Chao Yi, in 1992. She and her husband returned to her hometown
in April 1996. One night that June, Yang killed Chao while he slept
and dumped his body in a reservoir. She sneaked back into Taiwan on a
fishing boat three days later. Soon after that, she was nabbed and
sent to a Taiwan detention center, Matsu police authorities said.</P>
      <P>Besides the four Taiwanese criminals who were repatriated
Tuesday, there are still 192 suspected Taiwan criminals whom police
believe are hiding in the mainland. Some have been able to maintain
their cross-strait criminal enterprises by remotely controlling their
operations, according to the police authorities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WTO  EXPECTS  GROWTH  IN  WORLD  TRADE TO HALVE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Geneva-based World Trade Organization
(WTO), which in March predicted only a "small dent" in global output
from the Asian crisis, now expects the growth in world trade to halve
this year.</P>
      <P>The volume of merchandise trade is unlikely to grow by more than
4 percent to 5 percent in 1998 compared with an exceptionally high
9.5 percent last year, according to the WTO report.</P>
      <P>In dollar terms, trade may stagnate this year or even decline, a
situation that reflects the strength of the US dollar, the slump in
oil prices, and the depreciated currencies of Asian countries that
are important exporters of manufactured goods.</P>
      <P>The WTO's economists originally thought it might be possible to
contain the crisis to the five countries most seriously affected --
South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.
Provided the rest of the world kept markets open, these countries
were expected to begin an export-led recovery this year.</P>
      <P>However, the worsening situation in Asia, Japan's failure to
surmount recession, and the "contagion" effect in other emerging
markets, including Russia and Brazil, have forced a reassessment.
This is in line with downward revisions of global output growth
forecasts by the IMF and others to no more than 2 percent to 3
percent this year.</P>
      <P>Of the five worst-affected countries, only South Korea and
Thailand have managed to increase export volumes substantially -- by
30 percent and 15 percent respectively -- in the first half of this
year from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>Since imports by Asian countries are still contracting, exports
from the region are going mainly to Europe and North America. In an
article published recently, Renato Ruggiero, WTO director-general,
again called on the West to keep markets open and resist calls for
protectionism in response to widening trade deficits with Asia.</P>
      <P>In the first half of 1998, according to the WTO report, US
imports from Asia rose 9.5 percent in dollar terms, while exports
fell by 14.5 percent. Exports from the European Union to the five
most affected Asian countries fell by 40 percent, while imports
increased 12 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TIES  WITH  MAINLAND  CHINA  DICTATE  TAIWAN'S  POLICIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's troubled relations with mainland
China dictate most of the island's international and domestic
policies, according to an article which appeared in Tuesday's edition
of the Asian Wall Street Journal.</P>
      <P>The article, carried in a special advertising section prepared to
mark the World Economic Forum, a seminar held in Singapore between
Oct. 12-14, said Taiwan and mainland China are closely intertwined in
economy but bitterly divided in politics.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which was involved in a civil war with communist China
and has been deemed by Beijing as a renegade province for most of the
past five decades, has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in
the mainland, and more than 1.5 million Taiwanese visit mainland
China each year, according to the article.</P>
      <P>This makes mainland China the primary recipient of Taiwan
investment, and its number two trading partner after the US, said the
article.</P>
      <P>But the trade ties have failed to persuade Beijing to give up its
attempts to isolate Taiwan diplomatically. It regularly hectors any
country that displays anything close to recognition of Taiwan, said
the journal.</P>
      <P>While counting partly on its investment in mainland China for its
solid performance in the Late 1990s, Taiwan is worried that its
increasing economic dependence on the mainland will lead to erosion
of its de facto sovereignty, and pursues a "go slow" policy regarding
investment in the mainland, in order to keep a rein on ties, said the
article.</P>
      <P>The political relationship between Taiwan and mainland China has
taken a recent turn for the better, but Taiwan is still carrying on a
curious charade: struggling for global recognition while rejecting
the unwanted embrace of "mother China," said the article.</P>

two other physicists -- Prof. Robert Laughlin of Stanford University,
and Prof. Horst Stoermer of Columbia University.</P>
      <P>They were awarded the prize for "discovering that electrons
acting together in strong magnetic fields can form new types of
particles, with charges that are fractions of electron charges."</P>
      <P>Upon learning of Tsui's achievement, former Academia Sinica

    <HEADLINE>SEF CHAIRMAN TO SELL TAIWAN DEMOCRACY TO MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland China
said on Tuesday he will take the opportunity of his imminent visit to
the mainland to sell Taiwan's democratic evolution and economic
transition.</P>
      <P>Koo Chen-fu, a veteran business tycoon and chairman of Taipei's
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), is scheduled to leave for the
mainland on Wednesday for a six-day visit.</P>
      <P>He is expected to meet with his mainland counterpart, Wang Daohan
of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS), in Shanghai on Wednesday and Thursday, marking the
first cross-strait rendezvous between the top negotiators from both
sides in more than five years.</P>
      <P>At a press conference prior to his departure, Koo said he will
meet various mainland Chinese officials for constructive talks. He
said these talks will afford him a good opportunity to let the
mainland people know how much the ROC has achieved in democratic
evolution and economic transition over the last half-century.</P>
      <P>It has been 11 years since the two sides began to engage in
cross-strait exchanges at the private level, after nearly four
decades of no contact, Koo said.</P>
      <P>During the past 11 years, there have been gains in cross-strait
exchanges and negotiations, but twists and turns were never scarce,
he noted.</P>
      <P>Koo is scheduled to join Wang, both octogenarians, in a
performance of the famous Peking opera "Kung Cheng Chi," or "The
Bluff," in Shanghai on Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Kung Cheng Chi" is an intriguing play which tells the story of
figures in the Three Kingdoms period of China between A.D. 222 and
A.D. 265.</P>
      <P>Koo said he is intrigued by the play, a story of a war of wits,
and added that joining Wang in the performance carries great
significance in cross-strait relations, which he said can do without
violence.</P>
      <P>Koo recalled that in his first rendezvous with Wang, in Singapore
in April 1993, the SEF and ARATS reached four agreements which laid
the framework for future exchanges and regular meetings across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, he said, he and Wang failed to meet again for the
second round of talks scheduled for 1995, because Beijing
unilaterally suspended the talks in protest against President Lee
Teng-hui's landmark visit to the United States in June 1995, which
Beijing viewed as a move to promote Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Koo said the time has finally arrived for him to meet Wang for
the second time. Over the last three years, Taipei has called for a
resumption of cross-strait talks more than 100 times, and he
personally offered last November to take the initiative to travel to
the mainland to resume the talks.</P>
      <P>He said he hopes that his imminent meetings with Wang will pave
the way for resuming the long-stalled talks.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>James Soong,
governor of the Taiwan Provincial Government (TPG), said on Tuesday
that President Lee Teng-hui has made outstanding contributions to the
development of democracy in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Soong made the remark while answering interpellations from Taiwan
Provincial Assembly member Yang Tai-soon of the opposition New Party
at an Assembly meeting. The first popularly elected TPG head also
stressed that he will leave the TPG when his term of office expires
on Dec. 20.</P>
      <P>Commenting on his position as a member of the ruling Kuomintang
Central Standing Committee, he said that according to the system, he
has office tenure, but that if the KMT decides to remove him from the
committee simply because he is no longer governor, he will have no
reluctance in giving up the position.</P>
      <P>Soong said that the KMT has played a very important role in the
development of Taiwan, and that thanks to the persistency of the KMT,
Taiwan has been able to avoid falling under the control of the
communist regime in Beijing.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, if the ruling party wants to continue its
development, it should follow current trends, and make sure any
policy-making and advocacy should comply with the popular wishes of
the public.</P>
      <P>In answering interpellations from assembly member Chao Liang-yen,
also of the New Party, Soong suggested that during the upcoming
year-end elections, candidates who really love Taiwan should stress
the superiority of Taiwan, rather than become embroiled in
provincialism and inter party fighting, or espouse the "priority for
Taiwan" slogan advocated by the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party.</P>
      <P>He added that candidates should also stress that Taiwan's systems
and concepts are better than those of mainland China.</P>

      <P>Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's top negotiator with

is scheduled to meet with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin in
Beijing on Oct. 18.</P>
      <P>In a press conference held on Tuesday prior to his departure for

delegation which will be accompanying him during the meeting with
Jiang has yet to be decided.</P>
      <P>"Our team won't be large, but all the participating members will
be chosen based on their expertise," he said.</P>
      <P>In Shanghai, Koo said, he will meet with his mainland
counterpart, Wang Daohan of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), on three occasions
between Wednesday and Thursday.</P>
      <P>When asked why Chang Jung-kung, a researcher of the National
Unification Council (NUC), and Kang Ning-hsiang, an NUC member, were
included in his delegation, Koo said Chang is a well-known mainland
China hand, while Kang, who used to be a member of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party, is a living witness of Taiwan's
democratic evolution.</P>
      <P>Koo said that if given the chance, he would like to talk about
grassroots democratic exchanges between Taiwan and mainland China
when he meets with Jiang. He may also invite mainland people to
Taiwan to witness for themselves the year-end general elections, he
noted.</P>
      <P>"Seeing is believing. Only by seeing it for themselves at first
hand will the people of the mainland understand what Taiwan democracy
is all about," Koo stressed.</P>
      <P>Asked what he will say if the mainland side asks him about
China's reunification, Koo answered that first, he will clarify the
fact that China has yet to be reunified. And second, he said, he will
emphasize that the reunified China sought by the ROC is a China
unified under democracy.</P>
      <P>Koo also noted that although he and his delegation will travel
via Hong Kong, they will stay for only about two hours. "No formal

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's top negotiator with
Beijing left for mainland China on Wednesday for the highest-level
talks across the Taiwan Strait in more than five years.</P>
      <P>"I'll bring Taiwan's goodwill to the mainland," Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) Chairman C. F. Koo said prior to his departure for
Shanghai via Hong Kong to meet his mainland counterpart, Chairman
Wang Daohan of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS).</P>
      <P>Stating that he fully knows the people of Taiwan have pinned high
hopes on his visit, Koo said he believes if both sides face current
political reality and treat each other respectfully on an equal
footing in discussions on matters of mutual concern, cross-strait
peace and prosperity will be boosted.</P>
      <P>The veteran ambassador-at-large said more than five years have
passed since he first met Wang in Singapore in April 1993 and that
regular cross-strait consultations have also been suspended for over
three years.</P>
      <P>"We are pleased to see mainland China finally respond to our
repeated appeals for the reopening of communication channels between
the two intermediary bodies on the two sides of the strait," Koo
said, adding that he hopes both sides value the opportunity of his
mainland visit to usher in a new era in cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Koo, a senior adviser to President Lee Teng-hui, said the top
goals of his Shanghai-Beijing visit is to promote SEF-ARATS
exchanges, push for the resumption of systematized SEF-ARATS
consultations and improve cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Koo, 81, is heading a 12-member delegation on his landmark
mainland visit.</P>
      <P>The 11 other delegates are SEF Vice Chairman and
Secretary-General Shi Hwei-yow; National Unification Council (NUC)
member Kang Ning-hsiang; and NUC researchers Chang Jung-kung, Wu
Jung-i and Pao Chung-ho; Pao Cheng-kang, chief secretary of the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC); Jan Jyh-horng, director of the MAC's
Research and Planning Department; Liu Teh-hsun, director of the MAC's
Legal Affairs Department; Tsai Ying-wen, an adviser to MAC; Hsieh
Fu-yuan, director of the SEF's Legal Service Department; and Ho
Wu-liang, a section chief with the SEF's Legal Service Department.</P>
      <P>Koo's wife, Yen-Koo Chou-yun, their son Koo Chi-yun and daughter
Koo Hui-chun are also accompanying Koo on the visit.</P>
      <P>A composed man, Koo is widely respected and leads a proud and
prosperous business family. He is well versed in the arts and
culture. He is also a Peking opera lover.</P>
      <P>Because of Taiwan's extraordinary status, Koo, head of one of the
island's largest business groups, often attended international
meetings that senior ROC leaders were barred from going to. In the
past three years, Koo has represented President Lee at the annual
informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum.</P>
      <P>The Koo delegation is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at around
4 p.m. Koo will deliver a brief speech upon his arrival at the
Shanghai airport.</P>
      <P>Koo will meet with his mainland counterpart, Wang, at
Shanghai's posh Peace Hotel at 5 p.m. The two elder statesmen are
expected to deliver speeches on the occasion. Wang will host a

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT URGED TO EASE MAINLAND INVESTMENT POLICY</HEADLINE>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei should ease its policy governing
Taiwan investment in mainland China as soon as possible, Chinese
National Federation of Industries (CNFI) Chairman Kao Chin-yen urged
on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Kao, who also heads Taiwan's largest food processing company, the
President Group, called on the government to review its present "no
haste, be patient" mainland investment policy amid improving ties
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. He predicted that Taipei
would do so next year after bilateral relations turn for the better.</P>
      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's
top negotiator with mainland China, is due to arrive in Shanghai
Wednesday afternoon for a six-day mainland visit. It is the first
such trip since cross-strait relations hit a low ebb after President
Lee Teng-hui paid a landmark visit to the United States in June 1995.</P>
      <P>Koo's planned meeting with his mainland Chinese counterpart, Wang
Daohan, chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait, will be the second of its kind after the two met for the
first time in Singapore in 1993.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Zhang Jiakun, vice governor of mainland China's Fujian
province, said Taiwan and Fujian should enhance bilateral cooperation
and investment since the southeastern mainland province is one of the
most popular destinations among Taiwan businesses in recent years.</P>
      <P>Zhang made the remarks after his arrival in Taipei on Wednesday
morning. He is on a 12-day visit to the island at the invitation of
the CNFI.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this trip is to exchange opinions with Taiwan
business leaders and to promote Taiwan investment in Fujian, Zhang
said, adding that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should work
together to tackle the current Asian financial crisis.</P>
      <P>The vice governor will call on Formosa Plastic Group Chairman Y.
C. Wang and Yulon Group Chairwoman S. W. Wu later in the afternoon.
The two business groups and the President Group are the three leading
investors in Fujian province.</P>

    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Oct.  14 (CNA)
(By Huang Wen-chung and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland
China, C. F. Koo, arrived in Hong Kong at 10:40 a.m. Wednesday on
his way to Shanghai for the highest-level talks across the Taiwan
Strait in more than five years.</P>
      <P>Koo, chairman of Taipei's quasi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation, received warm welcome from Paul Kwok-wah Yip, the top
adviser to Hong KOng Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's representative to Hong Kong, Cheng An-kuo, and Xing
Keuishan, a department director at the Hong Kong office of Beijing's
official Xinhua News Agency, also greeted Koo and his delegation at
the airport.</P>
      <P>Yip conveyed Tung's regards and best wishes to Koo. For his
part, Koo expressed his gratitude for the hospitality the Hong Kong
government accorded him on his transit stop.</P>
      <P>Koo, also Taiwan's veteran ambassador-at-large, said he has deep
feelings for his ongoing visit to the mainland, his first
cross-strait trip in 50 years.</P>
      <P>Koo said the main purposes of his current mainland visit is to
push for the resumption of institutionalized cross-strait
consultations and to foster an amiable atmosphere for
future cross-strait engagements.</P>
      <P>Koo will meet his mainland counterpart, Chairman Wang Daohan of
the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS), in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>The first Koo-Wang meeting was held in Singapore in April 1993
during which time the two elder statesmen signed several
agreements to lay a framework for SEF-ARATS dialogue and
consultations.</P>
      <P>Beijing, however, suspended such contacts in mid-1995 in anger
over Taiwan's efforts to upgrade its international profile.</P>
      <P>"It has been more than five years since I first met Wang and
cross-strait dialogue has also been suspended for more than
three years. I have many things to talk with Wang. I earnestly
hope my visit will help improve the atmosphere and lay a solid
foundation for future cross-strait rapprochement," Koo said.</P>
      <P>Koo was accompanied by 11 other Taiwan delegates on his
mainland visit.</P>
      <P>The Koo delegation left Hong Kong for Shanghai at around 1:20
p.m. The delegation is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at around 4

    <HEADLINE>MORE CONFIDENCE IS NEEDED ACROSS TAIWAN STRAIT: SIEW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Brussels,  Oct.  13  (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More confidence and mutual trust is
required between Taiwan and mainland China if long-term stability is
to be maintained in the Taiwan Strait and East Asia, ROC Premier
Vincent Siew said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Taiwan Strait relations as well as other issues in
an exclusive interview with the Rotterdam Dagblad daily recently,
Siew said, "We hope to be treated equally and no longer be excluded
from the international community."</P>
      <P>"I personally attach great expectations on China's reunification
under a democratic system. To achieve that goal, however, requires
tremendous patience, as well as common wish of the people of the two
sides," Siew told J. Prins, the daily's editor-in-chief.</P>
      <P>The widely-circulated Rotterdam Dagblad devoted a full page to
the interview as a part of its series of special reports marking the
Republic of China's National Day on Oct. 10. Prins traveled to Taipei
in August to conduct the interview.</P>
      <P>Premier Siew, who assumed office last September, has successfully
led Taiwan in limiting the effects of the Asian financial meltdown
and its aftermath while other leaders in the Far East have failed to
do so, Prins said.</P>
      <P>Prins noted that although Taiwan's overall economic growth
figures have dropped, its economy is still growing. Premier Siew's
greatest accomplishment over the recent months has been in helping
regain Taiwan's confidence, he added.</P>
      <P>While the people of Taiwan are proud of their economic prosperity
earned through hard work as well as social and political stability,
they keenly expect to be respected and recognized by the world
community, Prins wrote.</P>
      <P>Siew has become one of the guides of the Taiwan miracle, Prins
continued. With his knowledge, effort and unswerving determination,
Siew has shown himself capable of clearing up complicated situations.
This talent is akin to turning the poverty-stricken island with a
high population density into a nation which is frequently acclaimed
as one of the world's economic powerhouses, Prins said.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Siew said perhaps Taiwan's economic miracle can
convince mainland China that under a market-oriented economy, the
mainland Chinese people can also lead better lives.</P>
      <P>On relations across the Taiwan Strait, Siew said Taiwan wants to
be a good neighbor and is willing to engage in any kind of
negotiations.</P>
      <P>"The age of using horrible terms such as communism, fascism and
terrorism has passed and the last thing we want to do is to remember
those terms," Siew said. He added that civilized people and countries
talk while diplomatic pressure and military intimidation must be put
to an end.</P>
      <P>Siew told Prins that the "one country, two systems" formula
Beijing applies to Hong Kong is not at all suitable for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The ROC on Taiwan is not a colonial area, instead, the ROC is a
sovereign country with its own Constitution. We have a plural-party
political system and a popularly-elected president. We have our own
history and our own defensive system," Siew noted.</P>
      <P>On how Taiwan has managed to limit the blows inflicted by the
Asian crisis, Siew cited several actions including measures to
stabilize foreign exchange rates, minimize room for financial
speculation and adopting an easy-credit policy to prevent interest
rates from being driven up. The fact that Taiwan does not rely
heavily on foreign capital is an added advantage to remaining
relatively unscathed by the crisis, he added.</P>
      <P>Despite all these actions, Siew admitted that Taiwan, which
maintains close economic ties with Southeast Asian countries, has
more or less been adversely affected by the Asian economic turmoil.</P>
      <P>"The Taiwan currency has depreciated, stock markets fell and the
island's exports to Japan and Southeast Asia have declined 20
percent," the premier said. Nevertheless, he added, Taiwan's
performance has been the best among other economies in the Far East.</P>
      <P>Siew lamented that as a country with foreign exchange reserves
exceeding US$83.66 billion, Taiwan is barred from extending financial
assistance to its neighbors simply because it is not a International
Monetary Fund member.</P>
      <P>"We would like to help, but we cannot because we are not
acknowledged as a sovereign state.... The ROC is a sovereign country,
but it is excluded from the international community," he continued.</P>
      <P>As the 14th largest trading country in the world, Taiwan is not
recognized, and not allowed to extend a helping hand. It is indeed
too bad for the countries which are seeking financial aid to try and
recover, Siew said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN UN BID TO CLEAR WAY FOR UNIFICATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei's bid to join the United Nations
will help ensure peace and security in the Taiwan Strait, thereby
paving the way for China's eventual unification, Foreign Affairs
Minister Jason Hu said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Refuting Beijing's charges that Taipei's UN bid is a covert move
aimed at creating "two Chinas," or "one China, one Taiwan," Hu
stressed that Taiwan wishes to lay a cornerstone for cross-strait
negotiations through such efforts.</P>
      <P>Hu made the remarks during a Legislative Yuan briefing for the
Foreign Affairs and Overseas Chinese Affairs Committees on the
government's strategy to join the world body.</P>
      <P>Admitting that trying to gain entry to the UN is a gargantuan
political task, the foreign minister pointed out that the mainland's
growing economic clout and Beijing's increasing diplomatic offense
are making it more difficult for Taiwan's bid in the short term.</P>
      <P>However, Hu said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will
continue to promote the island's bid to enter the UN as it is in the
best interest of Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>According to Hu, MOFA has outlined three major directives to
achieve the goal. First, it will cement the support of ROC diplomatic
partners. Second, Taipei will encourage ROC diplomatic allies to
continue putting the issue of Taiwan's UN entry on the agenda for the
world body's discussions in the coming years. Third, MOFA will try to
reduce opposition from other UN members.</P>
      <P>In addition to 23 ROC diplomatic partners, Latvia, the Czech
Republic, and Fiji all voiced support for Taiwan's membership at the
session of this year's UN general debate, an indication that the
issue has commanded greater attention among countries friendly to
Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US COULD HELP AVOID CONFLICT IN TAIWAN STRAIT ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  13  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Conflict between mainland China and
Taiwan would be more likely if the United States does not deter
mainland aggression and promote democracy, an analysis released by
the Heritage Foundation on Tuesday said.</P>
      <P>The study's author, Stephen J. Yates, is a China policy analyst
with The Asian Studies Center, a Washington-based think tank.</P>
      <P>Yates wrote that although President Bill Clinton and his
administration have stated that the "three noes" Taiwan policy was a
reiteration or clarification of a long-term US policy, the president
in fact changed US policy toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Clinton stated while in Shanghai on June 30, "We don't support
independence of Taiwan, or two Chinas, or one China one Taiwan. And
we don't believe that Taiwan should be a member of any organization
for which statehood is a requirement."</P>
      <P>The statement reflects an appeasement to the Beijing government.
It was a far cry from March 1996 when the US upheld the terms of the
Taiwan Relations Act and sent aircraft carriers to the Taiwan Strait
as China was conducting live missile tests off the coast of Taiwan's
two most important ports, Yates noted.</P>
      <P>"The administration's new policies will make conflict with China
more likely in the future and undermine US credibility," he said,
adding that by failing to protect security and promote freedom in
Taiwan, the administration's Taiwan policy runs counter to
long-standing US interests in the Asia-Pacific region and violates
the spirit if not the letter of US law.</P>
      <P>To restore clarity and consistency to the US' Taiwan policy,
Yates suggested that the Clinton administration and Congress adopt
the following positions:</P>
      <P>-- Promote the process and not the outcome in the cross-strait
dispute. The US should not take a policy position that prejudices the
outcome of the standoff between mainland China and Taiwan. It should
neither endorse nor oppose Taiwan's independence or reunification
with the mainland, but it should insist that any eventual resolution
of this conflict come through peaceful means and with the consent of
the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>-- Distinguish between long-term obligations and short-term
administration policy. To avoid miscalculation and miscommunication
with Taipei and Beijing, the administration should make clear to both
governments which aspects of the US' Taiwan policy constitute binding
long-term obligations and which reflect the administration's own
interpretation of how best to implement those obligations.</P>
      <P>-- Deter Beijing's military aggression. The US must recognize
that China's military modernization efforts and willingness to use
force to impose its will on Taiwan are the primary sources of danger
and instability in the Taiwan Strait. Adequate deterrence, specified
in the Taiwan Relations Act, is the best guarantee against military
intimidation or attack.</P>
      <P>-- Promote Taiwan's democracy in China and abroad. If the US is
to have any credibility in advocating democracy on the Chinese
mainland, it must properly recognize and reward the Taiwan people for
their success in establishing a democracy in their republic.</P>
      <P>Yates concluded that if the Clinton administration wishes to
avoid military conflict in the Taiwan Strait, it must shelve the
restrictive recommendations in its 1994 Taiwan Policy Review and
faithfully implement the spirit and the letter of the Taiwan
Relations Act.</P>
      <P>"Only when the United States resolves to deter aggression and
promote democracy will the 50-year standoff in the Taiwan Strait be
likely to find peaceful resolution with the consent of the Taiwan
people," he wrote.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING MUST RENOUNCE USE OF FORCE AGAINST TAIWAN: JAPAN PAPER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Oct. 14 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing could greatly improve its relations
with Taipei if it were to renounce the possible use of force against
Taiwan as a means for reunifying China, the English-language Japan
Times said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The article titled "Rejecting Force as a Cross-Strait Option" was
written by US expert on Chinese affairs, Ralph A. Cossa. It said
although both sides have cautioned against expecting too much in the
coming Koo-Wang talks in Shanghai, the mere fact that talks are
resuming is promising.</P>
      <P>Cossa is executive director of the Pacific Forum CSIS, a
Honolulu-based policy research institute affiliated with the Center
for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</P>
      <P>He identified two core issues that must be addressed before real
progress in cross-strait reconciliation can be achieved. One, he
said, involves each side's different interpretation of "one China,"
and the other concerns Beijing's refusal to renounce the use of force
as a means of achieving reunification.</P>
      <P>Taiwan accepts "one China" as a goal but not as a current
reality. Two separate political entities exist today with neither one
exercising jurisdiction over what President Lee Teng-hui calls "one
divided China," says Cossa.</P>
      <P>Lee's statement in an August 1998 Asian Wall Street Journal
editorial -- which refuted allegations that Taiwan was pursuing
"independence" or "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" -- should
help set the stage for a more productive cross-strait dialogue and
may even provide a key to defusing the use-of-force issue, the
article said.</P>
      <P>The use-of-force issue creates problems not only in Taipei but
also with Washington since US acceptance of "one China" is predicated
on peaceful resolution, Cossa noted.</P>
      <P>Both sides of the Taiwan Strait have proven they can coexist with
different interpretations of "one China." What is now needed is a
mutually acceptable common definition that addresses both mainland
sovereignty concerns and Taiwanese aspirations, Cossa suggested.
Putting the use-of-force issue behind them will facilitate this all
important dialogue, he concluded.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Local people were battening down the
hatches on Wednesday in anticipation of an onslaught by typhoon Zeb,
as the storm, which has already slammed into the northern
Philippines, gained momentum and headed for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Zeb was centered 540 kilometers south-southeast of Hengchun, the
southernmost tip of Taiwan, at noon on Wednesday, and reported to be
moving in a northwesterly direction at a speed of 18 kilometers per
hour, the Central Weather Bureau (CBC) said.</P>
      <P>With a radius of 350 kilometers and packing center winds of 55
meters per second, Zeb is expected to begin affecting the entire
island by late Wednesday night, CBC weathermen reported.</P>
      <P>They said that while the southern counties of Kaohsiung, Pingtung
and Taitung are expected to bear the brunt of the typhoon's strong
winds, the entire island can expect torrential rains in the coming
two days.</P>
      <P>Zeb, the strongest of the eight storms to visit Taiwan this year,
is expected to sweep over the island on Thursday and Friday.</P>
      <P>As of Wednesday noon, heavy seas whipped up by Zeb had already
killed one man, an angler, and left two missing, presumed drowned, in
eastern Ilan County.</P>
      <P>In Pingtung County, schools were closed on Wednesday afternoon
and air traffic to and from southern and eastern cities was disrupted
by canceled flights.</P>
      <P>In the southern port of Kaohsiung, the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau
has organized an ad hoc typhoon command center, and has suspended
shipping between Kaohsiung and the offshore islands of Penghu (the
Pescadores) and Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Ships plying the Bashi Channel and the southern part of the
Taiwan Strait were reported to be seeking shelter at the port.</P>
      <P>Weathermen issued a three-day typhoon alert for the entire

(ARATS).</P>
      <P>Zhao cited the recent high-profile murder of Taiwan councilwoman
Lin Ti-chuan in mainland China as a case in point. Disagreements over
the handling of the affair were attributed to a lack of measures for
dealing with cross-strait economic and trade disputes.</P>
      <P>In view of the rapidly expanding economic and trade volume
between the two sides, similar disputes can be expected to occur in
the future, Zhao said, which makes the need to strengthen exchanges
of opinions across the strait all the more pressing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GERMAN PAPER REPORTS ON KOO-WANG MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bonn,  Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and mainland China on Wednesday
resumed their semi-official meeting after a three-and-a-half-year
hiatus, according to a report in Germany's mass-circulation daily Die
Welt newspaper.</P>
      <P>During the six-day meeting, which began in Shanghai on Wednesday,
Taiwan aims to address issues involving technical problems relating
to bilateral contacts, while Beijing is preparing to broach
discussions on China's reunification, the newspaper report said.</P>
      <P>Die Welt said that while both Taiwan and mainland China profess
reunification to be their ultimate goal, the two sides have differing
conditions on how reunification should take place. Beijing favors the
"one country, two systems" formula that it imposed on Hong Kong in
July 1997, but Taiwan scoffs at this idea, saying that "Taiwan is not
a colony."</P>
      <P>Through mediation from the United States, the paper said, the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait have recently begun to make gestures of
goodwill, paving the way for Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
Chairman Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland China, to
travel to Shanghai to meet with his mainland counterpart, Wang
Daohan, chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>The Koo-Wang meeting, the first of its kind in more than five
years, will move north to continue in Beijing after Shanghai, the
paper said.</P>
      <P>The report said a majority of countries in the world, including
Germany and the United States, have succumbed to Beijing's pressure,
and do not maintain diplomatic ties with the ROC.</P>
      <P>In its attempts to end its international isolation, Taiwan hopes
to engage again in negotiations with Beijing. Taiwan has continuously
demonstrated goodwill in this regard, including a call by President
Lee Teng-hui for "constructive" dialogue between the leaders of the
two sides, and the cancellation of planned war games prior to Koo's
trip.</P>
      <P>In the series of meetings, Taiwan is hoping to broach "practical
subjects," including the security of the lives and property of
Taiwanese business people on the mainland, thorough investigation of
crimes committed on Taiwan people visiting the mainland, and direct
cross-strait postal links, the report said.</P>
      <P>Beijing, meanwhile, expects to touch on the reunification issue,
which Taipei says cannot be discussed as long as the mainland remains
under communist rule, according to the newspaper.</P>

    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Oct. 14 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin
will meet Taiwan's top negotiator with Beijing, C.F. Koo, and his
wife, in a "private family setting" on Oct. 18, a Hong Kong daily
reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Sing Tao Yih Pao quoted unnamed sources as saying that
mainland authorities will not agree to Taiwan's request that several
members of Koo's entourage be present at the meeting.</P>
      <P>The sources said Jiang will host a private family dinner in honor
of the Koos, adding that the arrangement is a goodwill token
underscoring the mainland leader's respect for Koo's contributions to
the promotion of rapprochement across the Taiwan Strait over past
years.</P>
      <P>The sources further said Jiang's decision to meet the Koos
betrays the fact that he attaches great importance to the reopening
of high-level contacts between the two quasi-official intermediary
bodies on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait -- Taipei's Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) and Beijing's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait -- after a more-than-three-year impasse.</P>
      <P>SEF Chairman Koo, Taiwan's veteran ambassador-at-large and a
senior adviser to ROC President Lee Teng-hui, arrived in Shanghai via
Hong Kong on Wednesday afternoon to meet his mainland counterpart,
ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan, for the highest-level cross-strait
meeting in more than five years.</P>
      <P>After several meetings with Wang, Koo and his 11-member entourage
will travel to Beijing on Oct. 16 to continue their ice-breaking
mainland visit.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile on Wednesday, the English-language Hong Kong Standard
daily reported that mainland China has formulated a three-phase
strategy to press for cross-strait political talks.</P>
      <P>According to the strategy, the paper said, mainland China will
push for political dialogue in the initial stage, followed by
consultations on procedural issues which will pave the way for
full-fledged political negotiations.</P>
      <P>The paper said the Beijing authorities attach great importance to
Koo's current mainland visit because they regard it as a prelude to
the opening of cross-strait political dialogue.</P>
      <P>The paper further said mainland leaders believe that President
Lee's plans to make a "journey of peace" to the mainland and to meet
with Jiang will become a reality only after the two sides come to
terms on procedural issues related to eventual political
negotiations.</P>
      <P>Koo and his delegation are scheduled to end the high-profile
mainland visit on Oct. 19.</P>

      <P>Koo Chen-fu, chairman of Taiwan's Straits

Taiwan Strait should resume negotiations to help the people of both
sides to solve their urgent problems.</P>
      <P>Koo made the remarks at a press conference shortly after his
arrival in Shanghai at the start of a historic six-day visit to
mainland China. He also pointed out that after nearly a half-century
of separation, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have had
people-to-people contact since 1987.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Beijing have established the SEF and the Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), respectively, Koo
said, adding that five years ago, he and ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan
signed the Koo-Wang Talks Joint Accord which promoted cross-strait
visits by people and bilateral trade.</P>
      <P>The SEF chairman said that upon arriving in Shanghai, he saw the
bustling trade and the prosperity of the city, but pointed out that
as cross-strait exchanges have increased rapidly, so too have the
number of problems related to exchanges and visits. He added that the
SEF and ARATS should start helping people to solve their urgent

related to cross-strait relations.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A visiting trade delegation from mainland
China's coastal Fujian Province on Wednesday welcomed Formosa
Plastics Group (FPG) to invest in the mainland, saying "the bigger
the investment, the better."</P>
      <P>But Fujian Vice Governor Zhang Jiakun, traveling at the head of
the delegation, said that FPG Chairman Y.C. Wang will have the
ultimate decision as to how much money will be invested and in
which sector.</P>
      <P>FPG's plan to invest in a US$3.2 billion thermal power plant in
Zhangzhou, Fujian Province, has been stalled by the ROC government's
"go slow" policy regarding investment in mainland China. The policy
bans large-scale investment in mainland China's major infrastructure
projects.</P>
      <P>The group has therefore transferred its stake in the proposed
project to foreign companies, and is biding its time, waiting for the
government to relax the ban, when it plans to buy back its stake.</P>
      <P>Zhang said that although the problem has yet to be resolved,
construction work for the plant has been proceeding smoothly.</P>
      <P>Zhang said that what Fujian provincial authorities can do now is
create favorable conditions and improve the investment environment to
lure investors from around the world.</P>
      <P>He also said that the mainland is revising regulations governing
the protection of the interests of Taiwan businessmen.</P>
      <P>The 10-member delegation, at the invitation of Taipei's Chinese
National Federation of Industries (CNFI), arrived here on Wednesday
for a 12-day visit. It aims mainly to attract more investment to the
province which lies directly opposite Taiwan across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu said on
Wednesday that he has received as yet unsubstantiated
information that mainland China is stepping up its efforts to lure
away the Republic of China's diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>"Mainland China reportedly will adopt a double-faced strategy
against Taiwan during and after the current ice-breaking visit to the
mainland by Taiwan's top negotiator with Beijing, C. F. Koo," Hu
said at a Legislative Yuan Foreign and Overseas Chinese Affairs
Committee meeting.</P>
      <P>"That means Beijing, while agreeing on the one hand to reopen
contacts across the Taiwan Strait, is simultaneously intensifying its
diplomatic offensive against Taiwan on the other," Hu explained.</P>
      <P>The minister went on to say that Beijing once vowed to lure away
all of the ROC's diplomatic allies before the advent of the next
century.</P>
      <P>"I don't think Beijing will be able to realize its goal," Koo
said. "Nevertheless, I believe that Beijing's efforts to court our
allies will reach a peak in the coming year."</P>
      <P>Hu said Taiwan may be hurt by Beijing's move. "But I simply
can't believe that Beijing will succeed in its attempt."</P>
      <P>In the face of Beijing's mounting diplomatic offensive, Hu said
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will do its utmost to let
mainland leaders understand that its hostile move against Taiwan is
"unnecessary and unfeasible.</P>
      <P>"We hope mainland leaders will finally come to understand that
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should not waste their precious
resources in a zero-sum game in the international arena," Hu
stressed.</P>
      <P>Through MOFA's strenuous efforts over the past year, all of the
ROC's diplomatic allies in the United Nations managed to voice
explicit or indirect support for the ROC's bid to rejoin the UN at
this year's UN General Assembly debate session.</P>
      <P>"This indicates that our all-out efforts to consolidate relations

      <P>Jaw Shau-kong, a heavyweight within
Taiwan's New Party, suggested on Wednesday that Taipei's top
negotiator with the mainland, Koo Chen-fu, seek clarification from
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) Chairman
Wang Daohan over reports that Wang has said "one China" does not
necessarily refer to the People's Republic of China (PRC).</P>
      <P>Wang is also reported to have said mainland China will not resort
to force in its dealings with Taiwan as long as the island does not
declare independence.</P>
      <P>Koo, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), left for
a six-day visit to the mainland Wednesday at the head of a 12-member
delegation. Koo is scheduled to hold a series of meetings with Wang
in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>After his talks with Wang, Koo will meet with mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier Qian Qichen. Qian is seen as
being one of the mainland's senior-most officials in charge of Taiwan
affairs.</P>
      <P>Both Hsu Li-nung, the New Party's spiritual leader, and Liang
Su-jung, president of the Association for the Promotion of Peaceful
Unification, have visited mainland China within the past year, and
both have said Wang has told them that "one China" does not
necessarily refer to the PRC; that the official name and national
anthem of a united-China-to-be can be discussed between the two
sides; and that Beijing will not resort to force as long as Taipei
does not declare independence.</P>
      <P>Jaw remarked that what Taiwan people most worry about is that
"one China" means the PRC and that Taiwan is merely one of China's
provinces. He expressed his hope that Koo will seek clarification of
these points during his meetings with Wang.</P>
      <P>If Wang admits to having made these remarks, it would help to
ease lingering doubts held by the people of Taiwan. If Wang were to
deny having said those things, his denial would still help to clear

is a fellow of Academia Sinica, the premier academic research

      <P>Tsui was awarded the Nobel Prize together with Professor Robert
Laughlin of Stanford University and Professor Horst Stoermer of

in strong magnetic fields can form new types of particles, with
charges that are fractions of electron charges."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister Jason Hu said on
Wednesday that there is no sign that mainland China will relax its
efforts to stifle Taiwan in the international arena.</P>
      <P>There is also no guarantee that Beijing will not slap Taiwan in
the face again after the first high-level meeting between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait in more than five years, Hu said.</P>
      <P>But he stressed the importance of communication between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait, saying Beijing needs to understand that
Taiwan seeks deserved space in the international arena, not
independence.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while reporting to the Legislative Yuan's
Foreign Committee on Taiwan's strategy to seek to join the United
Nations.</P>
      <P>But legislators were more concerned with the high-level
cross-strait meeting as C. F. Koo, chairman of Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation, left on Wednesday for Shanghai via Hong Kong to
meet with his mainland counterpart, Wang Daohan, chairman of the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Hu said that not only is there no sign that the mainland will
relax its attempts to strangle Taiwan diplomatically, there is
evidence that such efforts will be stepped up.</P>
      <P>Hu urged Beijing to have a consistent strategy if it wants to
ease cross-strait relations. It cannot be soft and harsh at the same
time -- on the one hand expressing hope that both sides of the Taiwan
Strait can conduct talks, while at the same time trying to strangle
Taiwan diplomatically, he said.</P>
      <P>He stressed that he could not be sure that Beijing will
demonstrate goodwill and sincerity after the Koo-Wang meeting.</P>
      <P>Legislator Alice Kao of the opposition New Party asked if the
Koo-Wang meeting would bring a truce to the diplomatic tug of war
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Hu said the public should not hope for too much from the Koo-Wang
meeting, saying that a truce would not bring about real understanding
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. The important thing is
that both sides of the Taiwan Strait communicate with each other, he
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has to let the mainland understand that the island needs
breathing space in the world and is not trying to create "one China,
one Taiwan" or "two Chinas" or seeking independence, he said.</P>

      <P>Koo Chen-fu, chairman of Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), said on Wednesday that he hopes to meet
with his mainland counterpart to find an appropriate track for the
development of relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Koo made the remarks at a press conference in the Portman
Ritz-Carlton Hotel shortly after his arrival in Shanghai. He noted
that during his six-day visit to mainland China, he will have several
meetings with Wang Daohan, chairman of the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Reviewing cross-strait relations, Koo said that after nearly a
half-century of separation, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have
had person-to-person contacts since 1987. In order to handle problems
arising from the exchanges, Taipei and Beijing established SEF and
ARATS.</P>
      <P>Five years ago, Koo said, he and Wang met in Singapore and signed
four agreements, laying a solid foundation for future exchanges and
systematic negotiations.</P>
      <P>The SEF chairman said that upon arriving in Shanghai, he saw the
bustling trade and prosperity of the city, but pointed out that as
cross-strait exchanges have increased rapidly, so too have the number
of problems related to exchanges and visits.</P>
      <P>He added that SEF and ARATS should resume negotiations to
help the people of both sides to solve their urgent problems, as
well as to work to solve problems related to cross-strait relations
as a whole.</P>
      <P>Koo and his entourage arrived at Shanghai airport at 3:42 p.m. He

(By K. C. Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Professor Daniel C. Tsui of
Princeton University said on Tuesday he is his usual self even after
learning that he is a co-winner of the 1998 Nobel Prize in physics.</P>
      <P>A modest yet humorous scholar, Tsui said jokingly at a news
conference that one cannot be "too serious about" the Nobel Prizes.</P>
      <P>Tsui, a devout Christian, later added: "We should always be
grateful as our lives have many, many beautiful things."</P>
      <P>He described scientific research as a funny, interesting and
challenging work. "What a good thing that you are even regularly paid
for doing such an interesting job."</P>
      <P>Tsui has been teaching physics at the electric engineering
department of the ivy-league Princeton University since 1982.</P>
      <P>The Chinese-American scientist said his quiet, simple daily life
will not have any change after becoming a Nobel laureate.</P>
      <P>Tsui's colleagues and students at Princeton University praised
Tsui for his devotion to his research and teaching career. "He is a
diligent, serious scholar and teacher," said Harold Shapiro,
Princeton University president.</P>
      <P>Tsui was born in Henan in northern China in 1939. He and his
elder sister managed to flee to Hong Kong in 1951. After
completing his high school education on scholarship in Hong Kong, he
came to the United States in 1958 to attend Augustana College in Rock
Island, Illinois. He received his doctorate in physics from the
University of Chicago and was appointed a professor at Princeton in
1982.</P>
      <P>Tsui will share the US$978,000 prize with two other US-based
physicists for discovering how electrons can change their behavior,
work that can lead to further advances in microelectronics.</P>
      <P>The two other outstanding scientists are Robert B. Laughlin of
the United States and Horst L. Stoermer of Germany.</P>
      <P>They discovered that ordinary electrons acting together in strong
magnetic fields and very low temperatures can condense into new types
of composite subatomic particles that function as a fluid, the Royal
Swedish Academy of Sciences said. Subsequently, other researchers
confirmed their experiments and directly observed these new
composites, known as quasiparticles.</P>
      <P>According to the citation, the three men discovered a new form of
``quantum fluid'' _ fluids such as liquid helium that have certain
properties in common, such as superfluidity.</P>
      <P>What makes these fluids important for researchers is that they
can reveal more about the inner structure and dynamics of matter.</P>
      <P>It is ``yet another breakthrough in our understanding of quantum
physics and to the development of new theoretical concepts of
significance in many branches of modern physics,'' the academy said.</P>
      <P>Mansour Shayegan, a colleague of Tsui's at Princeton, said all
three have done wonderful work. "They have essentially discovered a
new state of condensed matter,"' he said.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wang Daohan, who met with Straits Exchange
Foundation Chairman Koo Chen-fu in Shanghai, is commonly regarded as
a "state teacher" of mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>Currently chairman of the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) of mainland China, Wang was born in Anhui
province in March of 1915 and graduated from Shanghai Jiaotong
University.</P>
      <P>In 1938 Wang joined in the Communist Party's army and served the
party in a political, as well as in a military, capacity during the
Eight-Year War of Resistance Against Japan.</P>
      <P>From 1946 to 1949, Wang filled a variety of posts, including that
of vice director of the finance and construction departments under
the Jiangsu-Anhui remote-district government, political commissar for
the central China and Shangdong military regions and director of
finance for the Anhui administration.</P>
      <P>After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in
1949, Wang served as vice minister of the mainland's machine-building
industry, vice minister of foreign economic liaison affairs and vice
minister for the state commission on import-export management.</P>
      <P>Between 1980 and 1985 Wang served as secretary of the Shanghai
Municipal Committee, Shanghai vice mayor and Shanghai mayor.
Succeeded by Jiang as mayor of Shanghai in 1985, Wang formally
retired from politics.</P>
      <P>But he never really retired from government service and was hired
one year later as a consultant to the Shanghai city government. In
1991 he was tapped to head ARATS, an intermediary body set up to
handle cross-strait affairs.</P>
      <P>Wang served as a deputy to the fifth and sixth National People's
Congress. He also holds several honorary titles, such as honorary
chairman of the board of Shanghai Jiaotong University.</P>
      <P>According to mainland media reports, Wang likes to read. Even
though he generally works until midnight, Wang is said to frequently
grab a book from the stack piled in front of his bed and read a
little before falling asleep.</P>
      <P>Wang has said that visiting book stores is his main hobby and
that he buys new books every month. His wide-ranging reading
interests encompass everything from literary criticism to scientific
and technological theories.</P>
      <P>Wang met with Taiwan's Koo in Shanghai Wednesday, after Koo
arrived from Taipei for a six-day visit to the mainland. This is
their first meeting since 1993, when Koo and Wang engaged in historic
talks in Singapore.</P>

      <P>Hsu Hsin-liang, former chairman of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party, said on Wednesday that
mainland China does not expect tangible results to come from the
first high-level meeting between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
in five years.</P>
      <P>What Beijing has in mind is to formally bring political issues to
the negotiating table in meetings between C.F. Koo, chairman of the
Straits Exchange Foundation, and his mainland counterpart, Wang
Daohan, chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Hsu said Beijing hopes the Koo-Wang meeting will signify the
start of political dialogue and does not expect the meeting will
result in anything tangible.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that both sides could state their stances and that
Taiwan should not give only perfunctory answers during these
meetings.</P>
      <P>He said that political dialogue between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait should not target only other side, but should also
target the world. If Taiwan does not take advantage of this
opportunity to publicize its cause internationally, it risks even
stronger pressure in the future.</P>
      <P>On the development of cross-strait relations after the Koo-Wang
meeting, Hsu reaffirmed his two proposals. He suggested that the
leaders across the Taiwan Strait meet with each other, adding that
the very act of meeting will have rich political implications.</P>
      <P>He also proposed that Taiwan agree to direct trade, postal and
transportation links with the mainland in exchange for Taiwan's entry
into the World Trade Organization before mainalnd China's.</P>
      <P>Hsu called Koo the ROC's best envoy, adding that the meeting
between Koo and mainland President Jiang Zemin is a boon for the
ruling Kuomintang in the face of year-end elections.</P>
      <P>He explained that Beijing is extending an olive branch to

      <P>Chang Jung-kung, a researcher with the
National Unification Council (NUC), said on Wednesday that both sides
of the Taiwan Strait should resume systematized negotiations to
determine the extent of political barriers between Taiwan and
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks after the first meeting between Koo

Daohan, chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS), at the Peace Hotel.</P>
      <P>Chang, who is the deputy spokesman of Koo's delegation, also
conveyed the view of Kang Ning-hsiang, another NUC member, at the
meeting.</P>
      <P>Kang said that in the past few years, more than 12 million
Taiwanese people have visited the Chinese mainland and invested about
US$20 billion. This has shown Taiwan's goodwill toward the mainland
and its sincerity in improving cross-strait relations. He also noted
that Taiwan has said it would not resort to force to resolve the
cross-strait issue.</P>
      <P>Chang said Koo suggested in his meeting with Wang that both sides
should resume a systematized negotiation channel and that through
negotiations the extent of the political barriers between the two
sides of the strait can be determined.</P>
      <P>Chang said the determination of such barriers could be helpful to
future SEF-ARATS negotiations by expanding the number of topics that

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) Chairman Koo Chen-fu on Wednesday stressed the importance of
resuming the cross-strait consultation channel that has been
suspended for three years.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in his first round of talks with Wang Daohan,
chairman of Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS), at Shanghai's Peace Hotel.</P>
      <P>The main points of Koo's remarks during the talks, which lasted
more than an hour, were disclosed to the media by SEF Vice Chairman
Shi Hwei-you.</P>
      <P>Koo expressed the hope that the Shanghai talks would "create a
good atmosphere" to promote normal operations by SEF and ARATS and
eventually lead to the resumption of cross-strait consultations.</P>
      <P>He said he earnestly expects that the current mainland trip will
help pave the way for a second round of Koo-Wang negotiations. Koo
and Wang held their first round of negotiations in Singapore in April
1993.</P>
      <P>During their meeting, Koo and Wang frankly expressed their views
on several important issues of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>On the development of cross-strait relations, Koo said both sides
should resume use of the consultation channel to continue the
discussion of topics shelved by the suspension of the consultations.</P>
      <P>The mainland side said cross-strait relations have entered a
"political dialogue" period and that the "three links" -- a reference
to direct trade, transportation and communication links -- should
materialize promptly.</P>
      <P>Koo said the two sides should be regarded as having equal
political status and deserving of mutual respect, a condition that
would produce more substantive results in upcoming bilateral
consultations.</P>
      <P>Koo pointed out that the Republic of China on Taiwan has already
renounced the use of military force to solve cross-strait problems
and that it has been engaging in active exchanges with the mainland.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, he said, Beijing has not abandoned the use of
force against Taiwan and has continued to obstruct Taiwan's
participation in international activities.</P>
      <P>Such moves, he said, would only deepen the antipathy of the
Taiwan people and would not help to build mutual trust.</P>
      <P>Koo told Wang that democratization and modernization have become
irresistible trends in the world and that Taiwan is willing to share
its experiences in political reform and economic development with the
mainland.</P>
      <P>The day's talks were held in a what was called a "quiet
atmosphere."</P>
      <P>Koo told Wang that the most important thing in the development of
cross-strait relations at present is to resume use of the
consultation channel, based on the agreements reached during their
1993 negotiations.</P>
      <P>Wang indicated his hope that both sides would start to engage in
political talks. But Koo suggested that SEF-ARATS consultations be
resumed first. If difficult political issues were to then arise, both
sides could approach discussions with a rational attitude, he said.</P>

      <P>Koo Chen-fu, who left for Shanghai
Wednesday at the head of a Taiwan delegation on an "ice-breaking
mission," is the chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF), a semi-official institute with a government mandate to deal
with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Koo was born Jan. 6, 1917 in Tamshui, northern Taiwan, to a
highly esteemed family that immigrated from Fujian, mainland China to
Changhua, Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He attended the Taipei Imperial University when the island was
governed as a colony by Japan, and graduated from National Taiwan
University, successor to the Taipei Imperial University, in 1940
after the island had been handed over to the Republic of China. He
pursued postgraduate study at Tokyo's Japan Imperial University, the
predecessor of Tokyo University.</P>
      <P>While a freshman at the Taiwan Imperial University, Koo inherited
his family's huge assets after his father died. Because of Koo's
successful management skills, those assets have mushroomed into one
of the most influential conglomerates in Taiwan, comprising some 91
companies.</P>
      <P>Koo was ranked in 1990 by Forbes magazine as among the world's
181 billionaires and in 1998 as the 11th-richest person in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He is active in politics as well as in the business world, having
had good relations with Taiwan's leaders over the years. His rich
business experience and good command of both English and Japanese
have aided him in his capacity as an envoy of President Lee Teng-hui.
Koo attended a summit meeting of economic leaders in the Asia-Pacific
region in 1995, 1996 and 1997 in place of Lee, who was excluded from
the meetings as the result of pressure from Beijing.</P>
      <P>With the full trust of President Lee, Koo was appointed SEF
chairman in 1990. As SEF's chairman, Koo is Taiwan's point man in
dealing with Beijing in the absence of formal ties. He was also named
as a senior adviser to the president in 1991.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Philippine President Joseph Ejercito Estrada
and Indonesian President Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie agreed Tuesday to
study ways to enhance trade between their two countries by using
local currencies instead of dollars, Malacanang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"During our casual talks (with Habibie), we proposed that
products produced by the Philippines and Indonesia and traded between
our two countries won't use dollars any more so we can save on our
foreign currencies," Estrada said.</P>
      <P>Estrada said the practice of using local currencies for trade
between two member-countries of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) is already being used between the Philippines and
Malaysia.</P>
      <P>"Mr. Habibie and I agreed that our economic managers will study
the mechanics of using our own currencies in trade between our two
countries," Estrada said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan
Wednesday urged rival political parties in Lesotho to work to resolve
outstanding issues so that a climate conducive to free and fair
elections can be created.</P>
      <P>In a statement read at multiparty talks Wednesday morning, Annan
said "the UN stands ready to provide any assistance that will make
the process a success."</P>
      <P>The multiparty talks are being held in Lesotho's capital, Maseru.
A spokesman for the Southern African Development Community said
delegates of the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy and opposition
parties will discuss how to make sure all parties have an equal
chance in Lesotho's elections, to be held in 15 to 18 months.</P>
      <P>The parties have said there will be robust debate on the issue of
a government of national unity, which would rule the country until
new elections are held. The opposition parties want the formation of
such a government, but the ruling party has rejected the idea.</P>
      <P>Lesotho became chaotic last month when supporters of opposition
parties staged demonstrations, claiming May's general election was
rigged. South Africa and Botswana intervened militarily on Sept. 22.</P>
      <P>After the situation stabilized, the ruling party and opposition
alliance began talks early this month. They agreed to hold new
elections but disagreed on whether the ruling Lesotho Congress for
Democracy should rule the country or whether a government of national
unity should be established to rule the country until new elections
are held.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A dwarf sperm whale which was grounded off
Kaohsiung City Harbor two weeks ago died early Thursday morning
despite efforts to save it.</P>
      <P>Officials of the proposed Marine Life Museum said the exact cause
of death has yet to be determined pending the results of an autopsy.</P>
      <P>They suggested the whale died after experiencing difficulty in
adjusting to its new environment. Since Tuesday, the whale began
exhibiting emotional strain and was ramming itself against the walls
of the pool which contained it.</P>
      <P>The whale was about 6 months old, and weighed 25 kilograms when
it was rescued by fishermen in Hsitzu Bay, Kaohsiung on Oct. 1. Upon
examination, the whale was found to have sustained numerous injuries
and subsequently was sent to the museum for treatment the next day.</P>
      <P>Museum officials said the young whale had appeared to be
recovering well and was being fed powdered baby formula and squid.
They said they did not expect it to die so soon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KOO VISITS MAINLAND'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FLAGSHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Shanghai, Oct. 15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo and CNA reporters)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with Beijing, Koo
Chen-fu, and his entourage on Thursday visited the Pudong new
district in Shanghai, mainland China's flagship of economic
development in the 1990s.</P>
      <P>Koo, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation, arrived in
Shanghai on Wednesday for the highest-level meeting across the Taiwan
Strait in more than five years. Koo's tour of the mainland's largest
city marked the veteran ROC ambassador-at-large's first visit to
Shanghai in 53 years.</P>
      <P>Koo's first stop of his Shanghai tour was not to visit his
hometown, but instead the eight-year-old Pudong new district.</P>
      <P>Pudong has been undergoing swift expansion since the late
mainland paramount leader Deng Xiaoping went there in 1992 and
instructed officials to develop it into a bellwether of economic
development in the Yangtze River region and the Changjiang Delta
area.</P>
      <P>Under a strong push from the mainland authorities, Pudong turned
into a showcase of reforms in the mainland during the 1990s. Its
gross domestic product has grown 20 percent annually over the last
several years, as compared with 7 percent to 10 percent growth posted
by the city of Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Koo and his party visited the Shanghai Stock Exchange Building
located in Pudong's Lujiazui finance and trade area.</P>
      <P>While at the fully-modernized stock exchange, Koo, founder of the
Taiwan Stock Exchange, advised his Shanghai friends to observe laws
and jurisprudence while keeping management transparent so as to usher
the influential stock market onto higher-level operations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Koo's wife Yen Chuo-yun and daughter, who are
accompanying him on this landmark trip, visited the Soong's family
plot in a cemetery located in suburban Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Yen, who is from a wealthy and respected Shanghai family, said
Madame Chiang Kai-shek had asked her to sweep the tombs of her
parents. Madame Chiang, Mayling Soong, is now living in New York.</P>

(By Chu Lu-sheng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The worst of the Asian financial
crisis is over but recovery will progress slowly, the Los Angeles
Times cited finance leaders and analysts as saying on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Recent signs have indicated that the worst appears to be over in
the 15-month meltdown which has affected markets around the world,
Mark Magrier wrote in the front-page article.</P>
      <P>Stabilized Asian currencies and stock prices, declining interest
rates and increased political resolve in Japan and elsewhere have
contributed to growing optimism that the region has ended its
downward spiral.</P>
      <P>"I think it's going to be a long, hard road (to recovery)," said
Brian Lippy, managing director of Tokai Asia Ltd., a hedge fund
backed by Japanese capital. "But there's now some cautious optimism.</P>
      <P>The most dramatic step has been Japan's approval this week of
bank reform legislation and a beefed-up bailout, after months of
political paralysis, wrangling and false starts.</P>
      <P>Asia's recovery is very much dependent on continued US and

    <HEADLINE>MAC, SEF REFUTE TANG'S REMARKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) issued a statement Thursday, refuting a senior mainland 
Chinese negotiator's remarks on the root cause of the rupture of
bilateral talks in mid-1995.</P>
      <P>An emotional Executive Vice Chairman Tang Shubei of the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS), said in Shanghai on Thursday that Taiwan should be blamed
for the disruption of cross-strait talks more than three years ago.</P>
      <P>Tang made the accusation at a news conference held after an
hour-long meeting in Shanghai's historic Peace Hotel between C.F. Koo
and Wang Daohan, the two elder statesmen charged with shepherding
Taiwan-mainland China ties in the absence of formal channels.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Tang's allegation, the MAC said it was Beijing, not
Taipei, that unilaterally shut the doors to cross-strait
consultations.</P>
      <P>The MAC pointed out that ARATS and its Taipei counterpart, the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), held preparatory talks in Taipei
in May 1995 to pave the way for a second meeting between SEF Chairman
C. F. Koo and ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan.</P>
      <P>Tang himself came to Taipei for the preparatory talks, and the
two sides reached consensus on eight key points for the proposed
second Koo-Wang meeting, the MAC said.</P>
      <P>However, ARATS formally informed SEF a month later of its
decision to indefinitely postpone cross-strait consultations on the
excuse that the atmosphere for bilateral engagement was spoiled by
ROC President Lee Teng-hui's private visit to the United States in
June 1995.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years, the MAC said, mainland China has
repeatedly balked at Taipei's call for the resumption of systematic
dialogue and meetings between SEF and ARATS, the two quasi-official
intermediary bodies authorized by their respective governments to
handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>"This is a historical fact that nobody can deny," the MAC
stressed in its statement, adding that Tang was wrong to blame Taiwan
for the rupture of cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>"It was Beijing, not Taipei, that had reneged on the agreements
signed by Koo and Wang during their historic first meeting in
Singapore in April 1993 on systematic SEF-ARATS dialogue," the MAC
noted.</P>
      <P>During the lapse in talks, the MAC said, senior ROC officials
from President Lee down had on more than 100 occasions called for an
early resumption of systematic cross-strait consultations.</P>
      <P>"ARATS had not responded to our appeals until February this year
when it informed SEF that it agreed to reopen bilateral dialogue,"
the MAC said, adding that ARATS should not try to distort the facts.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, SEF Deputy Secretary-General Wu Hsin-hsing rebutted
Tang's allegation that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have
reached a consensus on the so-called "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>"Tang's comment is misleading," Wu asserted.</P>
      <P>He recalled that Beijing raised the "one China" principle when
SEF and ARATS officials held talks in Beijing in March 1992 on some
practical issues arising from increasing cross-strait civilian
exchanges.</P>
      <P>At that time, Wu said, SEF negotiators made it clear that the
"one China" issue had nothing to do with bilateral talks on practical
or technical matters.</P>
      <P>The two intermediary bodies then started a lengthy exchange of
views on the "one China" issue through fax and letters.</P>
      <P>With the MAC's authorization, Wu said, SEF finally reached a
consensus with ARATS that each side can make verbal explanations of
its own definition of the "one China" concept.</P>
      <P>According to Beijing's definition, there is only one China -- the
People's Republic of China, and Taiwan is part of it.</P>
      <P>However, Taipei sees "one China" as a goal rather than a current
reality, and regards "China" in abstract terms -- as a historical,
geographical and cultural entity but definitely not as the PRC, which
by no means can be said to include the whole of China.</P>
      <P>Taipei also insists that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are
now separately ruled by two equal governments and that the two sides
can be unified only under the principles of freedom, democracy and
equitable prosperity.</P>

      <P>The plan allowing investors in Taiwan
and Singapore to trade shares listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange
(TSE) and Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) may begin by the middle
of 1999, TSE Chairman C.Y. Lee said.</P>
      <P>Speaking to reporters after a panel discussion on regional stock
exchanges during the World Economic Forum, Lee said a 10-member
negotiating team from the TSE is currently in Singapore to work out
details of the dual listing plan. Issues that need to be ironed out
include different regulations, reporting standards and disclosure
policies.</P>
      <P>SES President Lim Choo Peng said the pact with the TSE was not
designed to compensate for the end of trading in Malaysian shares on
Clob International as the plan was hatched before the start of the
Asian crisis.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, Singapore shares will likely be traded in New
Taiwan dollars on the TSE, while Taiwanese stocks will trade in
Singapore dollars on the SES.</P>
      <P>The TSE, which closes earlier than the SES, will stay open longer
for the trading of Singapore stocks. The plan is to include all TSE

      <P>US pressure is said behind Taipei's
suggestion that ROC President Lee Teng-hui and mainland President
Jiang Zemin meet at the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
leaders summit in Kuala Lumpur next month, the Australian reported.</P>
      <P>Greg Sheridan, the daily's foreign editor, quoted Deputy
Secretary-General to the President Su Chi as saying the APEC summit
would be a perfect setting for the two leaders to meet.</P>
      <P>"APEC doesn't require enormous preparation, whereas a meeting
here or in Beijing would," Su said.</P>
      <P>The proposal will not likely be accepted by Beijing as it has
long opposed Lee's direct participation in APEC, Sheridan wrote.
However, the renewed flexibility both sides are showing each other is
partly a result of US pressure as Washington has asked Taipei and
Beijing to create a calm atmosphere across the Taiwan Strait, he
added.</P>
      <P>Sheridan said that while mainland China wants formal negotiations
to lead to reunification with Taiwan, Taipei wants to delay the talks
on reunification and instead discuss practical arrangements such as
shipping and trade. If both sides understand the other side's
differing agenda, any discussion should be useful, he concluded.</P>

      <P>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) has already embarked on a

    <DATELINE>Brussels,  Oct. 14 (CNA)
(By Tang Ping-chun and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As the top two negotiators on both sides
of the Taiwan Strait met in Shanghai on Wednesday, halfway across the
globe, Belgium's VRT Radio 1/Actueel reported that the relationship
between Taiwan and the mainland was dancing on a tightrope.</P>
      <P>Mike De Mulder, a journalist for the Dutch radio station,
described the background in the antagonistic relationship between the
two sides to listeners in Belgium and Holland.</P>
      <P>Communist forces gained control of mainland China through
military force in 1949 and compelled the Republic of China government
to flee to the island of Taiwan. Since then, Beijing's communist
leaders and Taipei's ruling Kuomintang have both claimed formal
representative status as China, Mulder said.</P>
      <P>During the Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek eras on the mainland
and Taiwan, strongly antagonistic sentiments dominated cross-strait
relations. But the hostility eased after Chiang's eldest son and
successor, Chiang Ching-kuo, began to implement reforms in pursuit of
democracy and economic competitiveness.</P>
      <P>After gradual political changes, the two sides across the Taiwan
Strait began to pursue a course of peaceful engagement.</P>
      <P>As time passed, Mulder said, talks began as well as cross-strait
exchanges.</P>
      <P>However, relations soured after ROC President Lee Teng-hui went

what it saw as a veiled attempt to promote Taiwan independence,

      <P>In 1996, Lee won a landslide victory, becoming the first

    <HEADLINE>DPP LEGISLATORS CRITICIZE KOO-WANG MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators from the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) on Thursday criticized the high-level
meetings between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait just as they
began.</P>
      <P>Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's top negotiator with the mainland, led a
12-member delegation to Shanghai on Wednesday for a six-day mainland
visit. Koo met with his mainland counterpart Wang Daohan, chairman of
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, for the first
round of talks later that day.</P>
      <P>Legislator Yeh Chu-lan said remarks made by Tang Shubei, ARATS
vice chairman, indicate there is a carrot-and-stick strategy at work
among mainland leaders as they hold flowers in one hand and a sword
in the other.</P>
      <P>Tang said on Wednesday that political negotiation across the
Taiwan Strait has begun. He also harshly criticized Taiwan's ban on
three direct links -- trade, transportation and communication -- with
the mainland, and its imposed investment limits on the mainland.</P>
      <P>But Yeh said the mainland's strategy allows the people of Taiwan
to clearly see Beijing's attempts to push Taipei to the political
negotiation table. She asked Koo's delegation to clearly convey the
wish of the 21 million people on Taiwan for an independent state to
the mainland.</P>
      <P>Beijing wants to define the meetings as political negotiations
that would lead to the reunification of Taiwan and the mainland,
while Taipei has wanted to talk about pragmatic matters.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hung Chi-chang said that Tang's remarks highlight the
fact the mainland still wants to strangulate the maneuvering space of
Taiwan diplomatically under its "one China" principle, and Taiwan
could not accept it.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Cho-shui said that Taiwan's delegation should
take the offensive instead of defensive posture, should not avoid
political dialogue, and should use its trump card of democracy.</P>
      <P>Koo Kuan-min, brother of Koo Chen-fu, said the mainland wants to
continue to block Taiwan's breathing space in the international
arena.</P>
      <P>Koo Kuan-min, who has long been devoted to Taiwan independence,
said although mainland China is important to Taiwan, the island
should not wrongly assess the situation nor have too high
expectations on these talks.</P>
      <P>He said the real focus of the high-level meeting across the
Taiwan Strait is his brother's meeting with mainland president Jiang
Zemin, which may upgrade Taiwan's status and even that of his
brother. But he questioned what price Taiwan should pay for such a
meeting.</P>
      <P>He stressed that Beijing wants to block Taiwan diplomatically,
and said that if Taiwan has to consult with the mainland for
everything, it would have no room to maneuver in the international
community.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TYPHOON ZEB REIGNS SUPREME OVER TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  15  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Typhoon Zeb, the strongest of the eight
storms to visit Taiwan this year, is expected to encompass the entire
island by midnight Thursday, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB)
reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>In addition to strong winds, Zeb is expected to produce
torrential rains over the next two days. Rains resulting from the
typhoon could cause flash flooding, landslides and mud flows, CWB
weather forecasters said.</P>
      <P>Zeb was centered 250 kilometers south of Hengchun, the
southernmost tip of Taiwan, at noon Thursday and is moving in a
northerly direction toward central and northern Taiwan at a speed of
15 kilometers per hour, weather forecasters said.</P>
      <P>After whipping through the northern Philippines, Zeb has weakened
into a middle-strength typhoon, with its radius shrinking from 350
kilometers on Wednesday to 300 kilometers by noon Thursday. But the
typhoon is still packing center winds of up to 45 meters per second.</P>
      <P>The typhoon whipped through Pingtung early Thursday morning,
battering the southernmost county of Taiwan with high winds and heavy
rains. Statistics indicate 10.4 centimeters of rain fell in Pingtung
within a few hours. No casualties have been reported.</P>
      <P>The county governments of Pingtung, Taitung and Hualien announced
government services and school activities would be suspended
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Heavy rains and the anticipation of Zeb's approach have disrupted
air traffic to and from southern and eastern cities, as well as the
offshore islands of Penghu, Green Island, Lanyu and Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Far East Air Transport, which operated two flights each on its
Taipei-Makung, Taipei-Kinmen and Taipei-Kaohsiung routes Thursday
morning, joined all other domestic airlines in suspending all
afternoon and evening flights.</P>
      <P>International flights departing from and arriving at Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport, however, have not been affected by
the typhoon.</P>
      <P>As of noon Thursday, one fisherman was missing and presumed to
have drowned in Taitung, one worker was killed by a fallen object and
four others were stranded, while more than 4,000 homes islandwide
were without electricity, according to the typhoon monitoring
headquarters of the Taiwan Provincial Government.</P>
      <P>The weather bureau warned people in central and northern Taiwan
to be on guard, as Zeb is expected to sweep across the island in a
northerly direction Thursday evening.</P>
      <P>In the southern port city of Kaohsiung, the Kaohsiung Harbor
Bureau has organized an ad hoc typhoon command center and has
suspended shipping between Kaohsiung and the offshore islands of
Penghu and Kinmen.</P>
      <P>In central Taiwan, more than 100 merchant vessels and fishing
boats have sailed into Taichung Harbor and nearby Wuchi Port to seek
shelter.</P>

      <P>The ultimate resolution of the
cross-strait issue will hinge on the democratization of mainland
China, according to a joint declaration made by pro-democracy
organizations on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In response to the current meeting between Taipei's top

counterpart, Wang Daohan, a pair of groups working to promote
democracy in mainland China -- the Overseas Preparation Committee of
the Chinese Democracy Party and the Chinese Democratic Justice Party
-- issued a joint declaration in New York.</P>
      <P>Mainland political dissidents now living abroad have taken note
of calls made by ROC Premier Vincent Siew to enhance the exchange of
democratization experience, according to the statement. The
declaration calls for the collaboration of various political bodies
across the strait to promote mainland China's democratization, thus
laying the foundation for a final resolution of the cross-strait
issue.</P>
      <P>In addition, it said that any suggestion or decision regarding
Taiwan's future must respect the wishes of Taiwan's 21 million
people. Likewise, any suggestion or decision regarding the well-being
of the mainland's 1.2 billion people should reflect the wishes of
those people, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>Representatives of opposition parties both in Taiwan and in the
mainland should be allowed to participate in future cross-strait
meetings. This is the only way for the meetings to be acceptable to
all people on both sides of the strait, it said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>There has been economic integration
between Taiwan and mainland China in the past decade, but the gulf
between the two sides in political, social and cultural terms is
widening, according to an unnamed Western analyst.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Beijing titled "Thaw Across Taiwan Strait,"
The Australian reported the current talks between representatives
from Taiwan and mainland China in Shanghai showed signs of a thaw in
the ice-cool relations between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The talks resumed following a long period of suspension since the
first contact was made in Singapore in 1993.</P>
      <P>But few analysts believed the talks would produce any
breakthroughs in the short- or medium-term.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted a Western analyst in Beijing as saying "The big
conundrum is that there has been a decade of economic integration,
but the gulf between the two in political, social and cultural terms
is widening all the time."</P>
      <P>"Taiwan sees itself as a rival central government and Beijing
sees the situation as one central government and one provincial
government -- there can be no breaching that gulf unless they can
fudge that central contradiction," he said.</P>
      <P>The analyst said that, for the past 49 years, Beijing has
regarded Taiwan as a renegade province and has yet to rule out the
use of force to achieve its ultimate goal of reunification.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  15  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Western observers have underestimated
mainland China's historic sense of self-containment and Chinese
economists predict the yuan will not be devalued, but will instead
appreciate, despite the marginal impact of the Asian economic crisis
on the mainland.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Beijing, Australian Financial Review
correspondent Rowan Callick reported that a recent AT Kearney survey
revealed the following truths, unlikely as they may seem, about
mainland China's economy:</P>
      <P>--Mainland China no longer cares about joining the World Trade
Organization;</P>
      <P>--Mainland China is being only marginally affected by Asia's
financial turmoil;</P>
      <P>--Mainland China is "marketizing" its economy -- but its private
sector, beyond the farms, is struggling to survive; and</P>
      <P>--More than one-third of all international companies operating in
mainland China are losing money.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that as a reward for mainland China's apparent
self-sacrifice in maintaining the value of its currency, and in order
to lock mainland China into any fresh attempts to regulate the global
economy, US Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin is considering inviting
mainland China to join the G7.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted two Chinese economists as predicting that
mainland China's central bank will begin to offload its foreign
exchange holdings of about US$140 billion to make way for the
purchase of treasury bonds to help stimulate the economy, which will
in turn drive the yuan higher.</P>
      <P>The daily reported mainland China has been shielded from the
adverse impact of short-term capital flows by the non-convertibility
of its currency.</P>
      <P>The economists said the yuan could appreciate between 10 percent
and 15 percent in the next two years.</P>

      <P>Koo Chen-fu, chairman of Taiwan's Straits

expects mainland China and Taiwan will discuss measures to protect
Taiwan businessmen on the mainland at an early date.</P>
      <P>The top negotiator for Taiwan arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday at

chairman of Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan

      <P>The Taiwan Enterprises Association in Shanghai played host to a
luncheon in honor of Koo and his delegation at a local restaurant.</P>
      <P>The president of the Taiwan Enterprises Association, Yang

business in Shanghai and have invested more than US$3 billion in the
city.</P>
      <P>He joked that more than half of the Taiwan investors in Shanghai
had begun to turn a profit, but that doing had either turned their

      <P>Koo praised the Taiwan businessmen for their contributions to the

    <HEADLINE>ROC REGARDS KOO-WANG TALKS AS 'CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE': MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China regards the ongoing
talks in Shanghai between the top negotiators from both sides of the
Taiwan Strait as "constructive dialogue," a senior mainland affairs
official said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Sheu Ke-sheng, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), made the statement in response to a senior
mainland Chinese negotiator's remark on Wednesday that cross-strait
"political dialogue" has got under way.</P>
      <P>Sheu said as Tang Shubei, executive vice chairman of the
Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS), didn't detail what the "political dialogue" means, he
could not make any comments.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Sheu said the ROC government considered as
"constructive dialogue" the current talks in Shanghai between C. F.
Koo and Wang Daohan -- the two elder statesmen charged with
shepherding Taipei-Beijing ties in the absence of formal channels.</P>
      <P>"As the current Koo-Wang meetings provide a forum for the
two sides to exchange views freely and frankly in a calm, amiable
atmosphere, we consider them as 'constructive dialogue,'" Sheu said.</P>
      <P>Noting that straight talks are better than mutual suspicion,
Sheu said candid explanations of each side's basic stances on various
issues will help boost mutual understanding.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Tang's allegation that Taiwan should be held
responsible for the disruption of cross-strait talks in
mid-1995, Sheu said Tang was wrong to place the blame on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"It was Beijing, not Taipei, that unilaterally shut the doors to
cross-strait consultations more than three years ago," Sheu said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that ARATS and its Taipei counterpart, the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), held preparatory talks in Taipei in May
1995 to pave the way for a second meeting between SEF Chairman C. F.
Koo and ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan.</P>
      <P>Tang himself came to Taipei for the preparatory talks, and the
two sides reached consensus on eight key points for the proposed
second Koo-Wang meeting, Sheu recalled.</P>
      <P>However, ARATS formally informed SEF a month later of its
decision to indefinitely postpone cross-strait consultations on the
excuse that the atmosphere for bilateral engagement was spoiled by
ROC President Lee Teng-hui's private visit to the United States in
June 1995.</P>
      <P>"This is a historical fact that nobody can deny," Sheu stressed,
adding that it was Beijing, not Taipei, that had reneged on the
agreements signed by Koo and Wang during their historic first meeting
in Singapore in April 1993 on systematic SEF-ARATS dialogue.</P>
      <P>Responding to Tang's calls for an end to cross-strait
hostilities and the opening of direct mail, trade and transportation
links, Sheu said the ROC's stances on such issues are quite clear.</P>
      <P>"Our stance on the direct 'three links' is that they can be
opened only when the safety and well-being of the people on both
sides of the strait can be well protected and quaranteed," Sheu said,
adding: "Taiwan is willing to negotiate the 'three links' issue only
if Beijing can face up to the reality that the two sides of the
strait are now separately ruled by two equal governments or
entities."</P>
      <P>As for the end of hostilities, Sheu said, Taiwan already
renounced the use of force in resolving cross-strait issues in
May 1991 when President Lee declared the termination of the Period of
National Mobilization for Suppression of the Communist Rebellion.</P>
      <P>"It is contradictory that Beijing, while calling for an end to
cross-strait hostilities, has been unwilling to renounce the use of
force against Taiwan and has continued its relentless campaign
campaign to try to isolate the ROC by blocking the nation's
presence in the international community," Sheu explained.</P>
      <P>Sheu went on to say that the two sides already reached a
consensus after the first Koo-Wang meeting that each side can hold
its own definition of the "one China" concept.</P>
      <P>"Beijing should not unilaterally force us to accept its 'one
China' concept, and should instead recognize the reality that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait have been separately ruled by two equal
governments since 1949," Sheu said, adding that with this
recognition, the two sides can then treat each other on an equal
footing and enable bilateral ties to make headway.</P>
      <P>Sheu also urged Beijing to resume systematic SEF-ARATS dialogue
and consultations as soon as possible to address practical
matters related to the protection of personal safety and legitimate
rights and interests of the people on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>

      <P>Taiwan Provincial
Governor James Soong said Thursday he believes C.F. Koo, chairman of
Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation (SEF), will convey the
aspirations of the people of Taiwan to Beijing.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks during questioning by Taiwan Provincial
Assembly member Chou Hui-ying of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party at the Taiwan Provincial Assembly.</P>
      <P>Chou had asked whether Song, during a recent visit to Singapore,
had asked senior minister Lee Kuan Yew to convey a message to
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Soong replied that he would neither recklessly stir up trouble
for Singapore nor introduce apprehension into its dealings with
Beijing.</P>
      <P>"We should respect other countries instead of asking for
trouble," he added.</P>
      <P>Song said that in a side-by-side comparison, Taiwan's political
system is superior to the mainland's. The validity of Taiwan's
system, in line with current global trends, has been affirmed
throughout the world, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy is more advanced than the mainland's as well, he
said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the Taipei mayoral race, Soong said candidates
should focus on issues rather than engage in verbal attacks or
"battles of saliva." He also warned against raising ethnicity as an
issue in the elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KOO'S WIFE VISITS SOONG FAMILY PLOT ON BEHALF OF MADAME CHIANG</HEADLINE>

(By Yang Hui-chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The wife of C.F. Koo, Taiwan's top
negotiator with Beijing, paid a visit to the graves of the parents of
former ROC first lady Madame Chiang Kai-shek at a cemetery in
suburban Shanghai on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Koo-Yen Chou-yun, who arrived with her husband in Shanghai on
Wednesday for the highest-level contacts across the Taiwan Strait in
more than five years, told reporters that she was visiting the grave
at Madame Chiang's request.</P>
      <P>As secretary-general of the National Women's League of the
Republic of China, Mrs. Koo said she maintains regular contact with
Madame Chiang, who founded the league decades ago and has lived in
New York since the passing of her husband, Generalissimo Chaing
Kai-shek.</P>
      <P>"After learning that I was to visit Shanghai, Madame Chiang asked
me to lay a wreath before her parents' graves to convey her tribute
and remembrance to them on her behalf," Mrs. Koo said.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by her daughter and personal aides, Mrs. Koo arrived
at the Soong family plot at 11 a.m.</P>
      <P>She first laid a wreath before a tombstone bearing an inscription
saying that it was erected in the name of the six Soong children in
August 1932. Mrs. Koo then placed a bouquet of fresh flowers before
the grave of Madame Chiang's father, Soong Yao-ju, and another before
the grave of her mother, Ni Kuei-chen.</P>
      <P>Because of political reasons, Madame Chiang, whose maiden name is
Soong Mayling, has not set foot in mainland China for 50 years. "She
has told me on many occasions that her mother, a devout Christian,
has had profound influence on her marriage and career. Madame Chiang
said she still feels pain and grief when she remembers her mother,"
Mrs. Koo said.</P>
      <P>Madame Chiang was once considered the most powerful woman in
China. Her life has been inextricably linked with the history of
modern China and Taiwan. She became widely known in the West as a
spokeswoman, in elegant English learned at Wellesley College in
Massachusetts, for the Chinese cause against the invading Japanese in
the 1930s.</P>
      <P>After the Chinese communists took control of the mainland in
1949, Madame Chiang and her husband retreated to Taiwan. The couple
became Asia's foremost anti-communist symbol. Generalissimo Chiang
served as ROC president until his death in Taipei in 1975.</P>
      <P>The tomb of Madame Chiang's elder sister, Soong Qingling, is
located on the right of her parents' graves. Mrs. Koo, however,
didn't lay a bouquet before her tomb. "Madame Chiang didn't ask me to
do so," Mrs. Koo explained.</P>
      <P>Soong Qingling, widow of the ROC's national founding father Dr.
Sun Yat-sen, once served as communist China's honorary president. She
died in 1981 at age 88.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chiu Yi-jen, secretary-general of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said on Thursday that
the prime task for C.F. Koo's delegation in mainland China is to
firmly express its position instead of focusing on other details.</P>
      <P>Chiu was referring to remarks made by Tang Shubei, vice chairman
of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS), who claimed on Wednesday that the meeting between
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Koo and his mainland
counterpart, ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan, represents the start of
cross-strait political negotiations.</P>
      <P>Tang's remarks provoked widespread criticism in Taiwan, and he
was accused of adopting a tough stance toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Koo embarked on a historic visit to mainland China on Wednesday
at the head of a 12-member delegation. Soon after his arrival, he had
the first of several meetings with Wang.</P>
      <P>The Koo-Wang meeting represents a major improvement in bilateral
ties after a hiatus of more than five years, although no breakthrough
is expected to result from this round of discussions.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has insisted on focusing the meeting on discussion
of political issues based on the "one China" principle, while Taiwan
said technical issues of major concern to the interests of the people
of both sides of the Taiwan Strait should take precedence on the
agenda.</P>
      <P>In contrast to the strong criticism at home, Chiu said Tang's
remarks should not have come as a surprise, and that the Taiwan
delegation should have been able to foresee such a development. He
added that Taiwan should not waste time on issues such as the
mainland side's attitude, manners, or courtesy.</P>
      <P>According to Chiu, the most important thing for Koo's delegation
to do is to firmly spell out its viewpoints to the mainland. He
hailed the delegation's performance as "on the right note so far,"
and asked the public not to judge Koo and his entourage too harshly.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PETA HAILS TAIWAN'S ENACTMENT OF ANIMAL PROTECTION LAW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US-based People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals (PETA) hailed on Wednesday the passage by
Taiwan's legislature of a tough animal protection law.</P>
      <P>The animal rights promotion group said the new legislation marks
an initial victory in its campaign for protecting the large number of
stray dogs in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>PETA President Ingrid Newkirk presented a basket of fresh
flowers to the Republic of China's representative office in
Washington, D.C. to express the group's happiness and appreciation
of the passage of the island's first animal protection legislation.</P>
      <P>Newkirk said she is delighted to learn that the ROC's
Legislative Yuan has finally completed a third reading of the
much-anticipated animal protection law on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"We hope Taiwan will then take positive steps to streamline its
some 70 stray animal shelters or pounds now that the new act has
provided its administrative agencies a solid legal basis to crack
down on unethical treatment of animals," Newkirk said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the PETA has launched a worldwide campaign, asking
all animal rights activists to write letters to senior ROC
officials to push for immediate improvement of the management of
Taiwan's public stray animal shelters.</P>
      <P>The organization also unveiled on its Internet website the
residential addresses, E-mail addresses and fax numbers of several
ROC officials, including Premier Vincent Siew, the Taoyuan County
magistrate, and the mayors of Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung, Sanchung and
Chungho cities.</P>
      <P>The PETA said Taiwan should immediately clean up its public stray
animal shelters to offer a clean living environment for stray
animals.</P>
      <P>The organizations also proposed several other measures that
Taiwan should take immediately, including offering adequate food
and water to dogs kept at the public shelters; stopping the use
of "cruel methods" to kill ailing stray dogs; separating stray dogs
based on their gender and size; cooperating with experienced animal
protection groups to gain expertise in managing animal shelters.</P>
      <P>The PETA has lobbied strongly in the past two years to push
Taiwan to legislate an animal protection law.</P>
      <P>Under the new law, people who fail to treat their pets ethically
will face harsh punishment.</P>
      <P>According to official tallies, Taiwan currently has about 1.7
million stray animals, mostly dogs.</P>

    <DATELINE>New York, Oct. 14 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan won't have much interest in closer
ties to mainland China until Beijing's political system starts to
look more like that of Taiwan, a columnist said in an article
carried Wednesday by the Philadelphia Inquirer.</P>
      <P>In the article dispatched from Taipei, titled "Beijing finally
sees that voters will determine Taiwan's future," Trudy Rubin said
threats and scare tactics won't persuade Taiwanese to reunite with
the mainland. Divided from the mainland since 1949, Taiwan has
developed into a democracy with no interest in speedy reunification
with a communist regime, the columnist said.</P>
      <P>She said Beijing seems to have recognized the crucial fact about
Taiwan: This island is a democracy, whose future political behavior
depends not on one strongman, but on its voters. "And muscle-flexing
won't win support from the Taiwanese people." Polls show that
Taiwanese overwhelmingly support the status quo, with only about 15
percent favoring reunification later on.</P>
      <P>To score points with the Taiwanese, mainland China will have to
become more attuned to dealing with a democracy, she said, adding
that Beijing will have to get more sophisticated in its
understanding of Taiwanese politics.</P>
      <P>The columnist quoted a Taiwan political researcher as saying
that "The only solution that Beijing has is to change itself in
order to attract Taiwan to be closer to China."</P>

      <P>The Republic of China has been a sovereign
country since its founding in 1912, and Taiwan is the territory of
the Republic of China without any doubt, Roy Wu, spokesman for the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), said Thursday.</P>

of 1943, the Potsdam Declaration of 1945, and the agreement on
Japan's surrender signed on the US battleship Missouri on Sept. 2,
1945 have all clearly attested that Taiwan is the territory of the
Republic of China, whose government has existed since 1912 without a
moment of interruption.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the global trend toward more
relaxed interest rates, mainland China will not cut interest rates
again for fear of aggravating capital flight from the country, a
senior mainland China treasury official said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Previous interest rate cuts have not been effective, said Lou
Jiwei, executive vice minister of finance, who was in Singapore for
the World Economic Forum's East Asia Economic Summit.</P>
      <P>According to Lou, the current interest rates are not very high.
Companies with good fundamentals can live with them, and those in bad
shape will not be helped by another cut.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has cut interest rates five times in the past two
years, but has failed to stem the economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>Any new cut now would be detrimental to the stability of the
renminbi's exchange rate in view of the high interest rate

      <P>Koo Chen-fu, chairman of Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), called on Thursday for the lifting of
restrictions on Taiwan investors, who currently can purchase only B
stocks on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>After touring the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the visiting SEF head
said broader access to the Shanghai bourse for Taiwan investors will
facilitate their integration into the local business sector.</P>
      <P>Noting the difficulties involved in establishing and running a
stock exchange, Koo emphasized the importance of cast-iron and
comprehensive regulations to regulate stock transactions, and the
need for transparency in the management of the bourse, according to
Shi Hwei-yow, vice chairman of the SEF, who is a member of the
12-strong delegation accompanying Koo on his historic four-day trip
to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Shi quoted the Taiwan business tycoon as saying that opaque
management will add to investors' frustration, already high because
of the ups and downs of stock prices.</P>
      <P>Since both Taiwan and mainland China have weathered the Asian
financial storm with relative little damage, Koo suggested that the
two sides jointly invite their harder-hit neighbors to find a way to

China," according to an American expert in Asian security affairs.</P>
      <P>Ralph A. Cossa, executive director of Pacific Forum at the
Washington-based Center for Strategies and International Studies,
wrote in the latest PacNet Newsletter that both Beijing and Taipei
have cautioned against expecting too much from the long-overdue
resumption of high-level cross-straits dialogue, but the mere fact
that the Koo-Wang talks have finally resumed is promising.</P>
      <P>Both Koo Chen-fu, chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), and Wang Daohan, president of Beijing's Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), are highly trusted
close personal advisors to their respective presidents. The decision
to schedule a courtesy call for Koo with mainland China's President
Jiang Zemin is a sign of the importance that Beijing attaches to
resumption of the talks, Cossa said.</P>
      <P>There are a number of outstanding issues to be addressed,
including the eventual signing of a peace treaty between the two
sides. But there are two core issues that must also be addressed
before real progress toward cross-strait reconciliation can be
experienced, noted Cossa.</P>
      <P>One involves each side's different interpretation of "one China,"
and the other concerns Beijing's refusal to renounce the use of force
as a means of achieving reunification.</P>
      <P>Defusing the "use of force" issue could help improve the
atmosphere for cross-strait dialogue and remove a major impediment in
Sino-US cooperation, said the expert.</P>
      <P>One option is for Beijing to issue a statement that, "as long as
Taiwan continues to pursue the goal of eventual reunification and
rejects a `two Chinas' or `one China, one Taiwan' solution, Beijing
can envision no scenario under which the use of force would be
required to bring about this mutually-desired end state," Cossa said.</P>
      <P>He explained that implicit in such a statement is the recognition
that a change in Taiwan's currently stated policy would negate this
pledge. But also implicit is a continued willingness by Beijing not
to force the issue or establish an artificial timetable or deadline
for reunification.</P>
      <P>This would help create a more positive atmosphere and perhaps
open the door for a bit more flexibility regarding the "third no" of
President Bill Clinton's policy toward Taiwan, which is especially
important to ROC President Lee Teng-hui, according to Cossa.</P>
      <P>Neither side appears to fully understand or appreciate the
other's concerns. The fact is, any long-term solution must take
Taiwan domestic attitudes and conditions into account, just as Taipei
(no less than Washington) must continue to recognize the unyielding
nature of Beijing's commitment to eventual reunification, said Cossa.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) Chairman Koo Chen-fu on Thursday concluded his second round of
discussion with Chairman Wang Daohan of Beijing's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Their wide-ranging discussions have rebuilt the basis for the two
semi-official organizations to resume formal consultations after a
five-year hiatus.</P>
      <P>Unlike Wednesday's first round of discussions that featured
different views on the issue of political status, the meaning of "one
China," and ways of developing cross-strait relations, Thursday's
meeting produced some concrete results.</P>
      <P>Koo extended an invitation for Wang and his wife to visit Taiwan
"at an appropriate time." Wang accepted the invitation, and said he
looks forward to making such a visit to gain more of an understanding
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>SEF Vice Chairman Shi Hwei-you said he hoped Wang would be able
to visit Taiwan in November or December, so that he can observe at
first hand the campaigns for the year-end legislative elections.</P>
      <P>But ARATS Vice Chairman Tang Shubei ruled out the possibility of
a visit at such short notice, citing the extensive arrangements which
would have to precede such a visit.</P>
      <P>In Thursday's talks, Koo and Wang were reported to have reached
consensus on another three points:</P>
      <P>-- The SEF and ARATS will engage in dialogue to discuss diverse
subjects, including political and economic issues. Concrete
arrangements will be made through consultations between the leaders
of the two bodies;</P>
      <P>-- The two organizations will step up bilateral exchanges,
including exchanges of visits by missions to be headed by SEF and
ARATS officials; and</P>
      <P>-- The two organizations will strengthen assistance in incidents
involving the lives and property of Taiwan people visiting the
mainland, and vice-versa.</P>
      <P>In addition to the talks with the ARATS chairman, Koo visited the
Shanghai Stock Exchange on Thursday morning, where he urged the
Shanghai authorities to lift the restrictions on Taiwan investors,
who currently can purchase only B stocks there.</P>
      <P>Koo also attended a luncheon given in his honor by the Taiwan
Enterprises Association in Shanghai, where he expressed the hope that
the mainland and Taiwan will discuss ways to boost the protection of
Taiwan investors on the mainland at an early date.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Koo's wife, Koo-Yen Chou-yun, paid a visit to the
graves of the parents of former ROC First Lady Madame Chiang Kai-shek
in suburban Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Koo laid a wreath on behalf of Madame Chiang, who now
resides in New York.</P>
      <P>On Thursday night, the Wangs invited the Koos to a Peking Opera
at a famous Shanghai theater. Several members of Koo's delegation
were also invited.</P>
      <P>Koo arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday at the head of a 12-member
delegation. He will leave for Beijing on Friday to meet with Beijing
officials. He is also scheduled to meet with mainland China's
President Jiang Zemin on Oct. 18.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland
China, C. F. Koo, left for Beijing on Friday after a two-day
high-profile visit to this booming mainland city.</P>
      <P>Koo, chairman of the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF), and his entourage left for the mainland capital aboard an Air
China flight at 1 p.m.</P>
      <P>Koo, also a senior adviser to ROC President Lee Teng-hui, is
expected to deliver a brief speech upon his arrival at the Beijing
airport at 3 p.m. He will also give a news conference at Shangri-La
Hotel at 4:30 p.m.</P>
      <P>Koo's itinerary in Beijing on Friday also includes attending a
cocktail reception hosted by the mainland government-backed
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) in his

present at the Koo-Jiang meeting.</P>
      <P>Before his departure for Beijing, Koo and his entourage visited
a major Shanghai tourist attraction -- the Yuyuan, a traditional
Chinese-style garden.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by his wife, son, daughter and an 11-member
entourage, Koo arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday for the
highest-level talks across the Taiwan Strait in more than five

      <P>During his stay in Shanghai, Koo held two rounds of talks with
his mainland counterpart, ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan, in an effort

    <TEXT>
      <P>With half a century of strained
relations separating them, Taiwan and mainland China appear to be
edging back toward common ground with a nudge from the United States,
the Los Angeles Times reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the two sides sought to lower expectations of
any concrete results during meetings that will continue Friday in
Shanghai, but played up the significance of the fact that they were
talking at all.</P>
      <P>Envoy Koo Chen-fu, head of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation,
was reported as pointing out that it was important to start building
mutual trust, saying, "It is better to start talking sooner rather
than later."</P>
      <P>Both sides indicate they are working toward eventual
reunification. For mainland China, now that Hong Kong has returned to
the motherland, pressure is mounting to bring Taiwan back into the
fold. Despite Taiwan's democratic government, Beijing insists on
reunification.</P>
      <P>But Taiwan has vowed not to return to mainland until it becomes
democratic. In the near term, Taiwan is increasingly interested in
bolstering economic ties -- its business people have invested about
US$38 billion in the mainland, according to the report.</P>
      <P>While Koo's spokesman publicly declared that the envoy will stick
to technical issues such as trade restrictions and fishing disputes,
mainland officials insist that the meetings will touch on

    <HEADLINE>CANADA EXPECTED TO CHANGE AIRCRAFT INSULATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct.  15  (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada will likely act in step with a
recommendation made by the US Federal Aviation Administration to
change the type of insulation used in aircraft.</P>
      <P>The FAA recommended Friday that insulation blankets made of Mylar
be replaced with ones made of another material because of the danger
of fire. The recommendation comes after the crash of a Swissair
passenger jet last month off Nova Scotia.</P>
      <P>The FAA said it was making the recommendation in response to the
crash.</P>
      <P>Although investigators are still looking into the cause of the
crash, there is speculation that it may have been due to a fire.</P>
      <P>Mylar insulation is similar to what is used in homes. It is
placed, either in a blanket-like form or as a foam, between the inner
and outer skin of a plane to keep out the cold and to muffle noise.</P>
      <P>The FAA said the insulation can catch fire if exposed to high
heat, like that of a spark from a wiring short.</P>
      <P>The agency has asked that the change be implemented in all
airplanes flying into the United States. This could mean new
insulation for the world's fleet of 12,000 passenger aircraft.</P>
      <P>An official with the Air Transport Association of Canada, which
represents the nation's airline industry, said he expects Canada will
adopt the FAA's recommendations for its planes as well.</P>
      <P>"Airlines fly all over the world, and it's nice to have a global
standard whenever possible," the official said.</P>
      <P>Mylar insulation blankets allowed fires initiated by electrical
shorts to spread rapidly aboard three different aircraft from 1993 to
1995. All fires occurred on the ground, and no one was injured.</P>
      <P>The doomed Swissair MD-11 had undergone a major overhaul in
August 1997, two months before the airline received McDonnell
Douglas' recommendation that the insulation be replaced "at the next
convenient grounding."</P>
      <P>Canadian investigators said the Mylar insulation would be
examined along with several other parts of the airplane, including
its electrical-wiring insulation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADA TOLD NOT TO ACCEPT BLOOD DONATIONS FROM BRITISH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct.  15  (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although there is no evidence that
Creutzfeldt Jakob disease can be transmitted through blood, a
committee on bioethics wants Canada's blood agency not to accept
blood donations from anyone who has lived in Britain since 1980.</P>
      <P>Bayer Corp.'s Advisory Council on Bioethics said Thursday it is
worried that people who ate British beef could carry a new form of CJ
disease -- the human brain disorder linked to mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>New variants of CJ disease from Britain have been found in tonsil
and appendix tissues, which means it is possible that the disease can
be spread by blood, according to scientific reports.</P>
      <P>Burleigh Trevor-Deutsch, the head of the Bayer council, said
people in the United Kingdom may have been exposed to mad cow
disease, which was known to be present in some British beef before
the government took action against it in the mid-1990s.</P>
      <P>Trevor-Deutsch said those people should not be allowed to
contribute blood in Canada. The danger that the disease can be
transmitted through blood has already forced Britain to import all of
its plasma from outside the country.</P>
      <P>Doug Kennedy, a senior adviser on blood issue with Health Canada,
said his department's researchers will look at the Bayer
recommendation in detail.</P>
      <P>Bayer makes most of the blood products used in Canada.</P>
      <P>But the Canadian Blood Services said refusing plasma products
from anyone who has lived in Britain would result in a severe blood
shortage in Canada. A spokesman said the agency would then have to
import blood from the United States, which is still accepting blood
donations from the British.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia is deeply concerned about the
talks between Taiwan and mainland China in Shanghai this week as both
countries are major trading partners, although Canberra maintains a
one-China policy.</P>
      <P>In an editorial titled "China, Taiwan Talks Already a Success" on
Friday, The Australian said the talks "are the subject of intense
scrutiny by Australia and other Asia-Pacific nations keen to see some
progress on what remains one of the most worrying and intractable
security issues for the region."</P>
      <P>"For Australia, both China and Taiwan are important trade
partners," the editorial said.</P>
      <P>"Politically, Canberra's relationship with Beijing turns on a
handful of key issues: Taiwan, Tibet, human rights and Australia's
support of US military policy," it said.</P>
      <P>Australia switched its recognition from Taipei to Beijing in late
1972, but maintains close economic ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While the newspaper said it would be naive to expect much to come
from the talks, the mere fact that the two sides are talking is an
encouraging sign.</P>
      <P>The scheduled meeting between mainland Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and Taiwan's representative, Koo Chen-fu, on Sunday "shows
China is serious about resuming a dialogue that essentially has been
in abeyance for five years. If things go well at the weekend, there
is scope for further progress when the two sides take part in the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Kuala Lumpur next month."</P>
      <P>"A lessening of regional tensions is a first priority, but there
are important economic issues at stake," the editorial said.</P>
      <P>"Given the downturn in foreign direct investment inflows
resulting from the Asian financial crisis, China needs all the fresh
Taiwanese capital it can attract. Likewise, Taiwan needs continued
access to the Chinese market," the editorial said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The US Department of Defense welcomes a
Congressional mandate for a Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system
study and will work closely with Taiwan on the issue, a senior
Pentagon official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Answering questions from Taiwan reporters, Kurt Campbell, deputy
assistant secretary of defense for Asia and the Pacific, also
welcomed the resumption of dialogue between Taiwan and mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Calling it a "good sign," he said he hoped that both Taiwan and
the mainland would conduct the dialogue in a respectful way.</P>
      <P>Regarding the TMD study, Campbell said the Defense Department has
in the past held "very close consultations with Taiwan on all aspects
of its defense needs, including the TMD."</P>
      <P>"So we think that this is a logical step and I welcome it, and we
will work closely with our Taiwan counterparts," he said.</P>
      <P>He made the comments after Congress asked the Defense Department
to study the architectural requirements for the establishment and
operation of TMD system in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>As part of the study, the Defense Department is required to
produce a report before Jan. 1, 1999. Campbell would not comment on
whether the study could be completed on time.</P>
      <P>In response to questions both before and after speaking on
security in East Asia at Johns Hopkins University in Washington,
Campbell also reiterated the United States' commitment to Taiwan's
defense needs.</P>
      <P>He said that the Congressional mandate would "make it very clear
that the United States stands behind its commitment."</P>
      <P>In his speech, Campbell pointed out that North Korea and Taiwan
are two issues that require careful handling.</P>
      <P>While the United States should be active in helping to deal with
the situation in the Korean Peninsula, he said, the right approach to
the Taiwan issue would be for Washington to "keep a hands-off
policy."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The current move toward a resumption of
cross-strait talks has prompted Taiwan's cement industry to make
plans for increased investment in mainland China, according to
informed industry sources.</P>
      <P>With production at home having reached full capacity, and with
domestic demand in decline, Taiwan's cement entrepreneurs have
already been covertly expanding into the mainland market for some
time.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, the Taiwan Cement Corp. intends to
invest in as many as five plants in southern China; Asian Cement
plans to offer its products in the mainland market; while Chia Hsin
Cement's plant in the mainland has already been selling its products
back to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Cement Corp., the island's biggest cement company,
carried out indirect investment in the mainland via its subsidiary in
Hong Kong. Its planned new investments are expected to give the
company total annual production of 5 million metric tons when they go
into production in mid-1999.</P>
      <P>Other cement companies with stocks in the domestic stock market,
such as Universal Cement, Lucky Cement, Hsing Ta Cement, and
Southeast Cement, are also evaluating the possibility of investing in
the mainland.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the discussions on a resumption of talks between
the two sides, and a perceived loosening on the part of the Taipei
authorities of the "no haste, be patient" policy, the cement industry
will surely accelerate their moves toward the mainland, the sources
said.</P>

in its risk rating at this stage," he added.</P>
      <P>The bank rating agency also downgraded its senior debt rating for
the Bank of Taiwan to AA from AA+</P>
      <P>According to the agency, Taiwan's exports are likely to decline
this year for the first time in almost two decades, while several
banks and firms will have to absorb sizable losses on investments in
several Asian countries. Consumer confidence is also falling due to
uncertainty in financial markets.</P>
      <P>"While Taiwanese banks are stronger than many others in the
region, there is generally not a great deal of capacity to absorb
sizable bad loans if the economy slows more than anticipated," the
agency added.</P>
      <P>The financial services company also stressed that Taiwan's AA
rating is supported by the country's substantial foreign exchange
reserves, a sizable current account surplus, low levels of net
external debt, a relatively sound banking sector, and the
entrepreneurial strength of the private sector.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP  APPROVES  OF INVITATION TO ARATS HEAD TO VISIT TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) on Friday responded positively to Koo Chen-fu's invitation to
his mainland counterpart, Wang Daohan, to visit Taiwan to observe the
year-end legislative elections here.</P>
      <P>However, Yen Wan-ching, director of the DPP's Department of China
Affairs, expressed skepticism as to whether Wang will come, and cited
past experience which shows that Beijing has always shied away from
acknowledging the fruits of Taiwan's democratization.</P>
      <P>Koo, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), extended
the invitation to Wang, chairman of the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), during their second round of
discussions on Thursday.</P>
      <P>While Wang accepted the invitation to visit Taiwan at an
"appropriate time," Tang Shubei, ARATS Vice Chairman, said that the
end of the year would be too soon for arrangements for such a visit
to be made.</P>
      <P>Yen said he does not think Wang's trip to Taiwan in December will
take place, and that Tang's statement that more time is needed to
arrange the trip is merely an excuse.</P>
      <P>Yen said that Beijing views Koo's trip to mainland China as a
"journey of political dialogue" and will use every opportunity to
highlight this stance in the international arena. However, Yen added,
as long as Taiwan's delegation states its own position, and stresses
firmly that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are independent of
each other, then it will not fall into "the trap set by the other
side."</P>
      <P>Unlike Wednesday's first round of Koo-Wang discussions that
featured different views on the issue of political status, the
meaning of "one China," and ways of developing cross-strait
relations, Thursday's meeting resulted in some concrete agreements.</P>
      <P>According to Yen, this represented an about-face on the part of
Beijing, and is aimed only at demonstrating a more eased approach
after setting up its basic tone of seeking political dialogue the
previous day, in preparation for Koo's meeting with mainland leaders
scheduled for the coming weekend.</P>
      <P>Koo is scheduled to meet with Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan
Affairs Office under the State Council, Vice Premier Qian Qichen and
Premier Jiang Zemin over the weekend.</P>
      <P>Yen said he believed that the four-point consensus reached on
Thursday has more style than substance, and added that the agreement
reached on increased exchanges between the SEF and ARATS is too
vague, and was basically nothing more that a political gesture.</P>
      <P>Yen also said that it is a pity that both sides have not reached
any tangible result on the protection of the rights of the peoples on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KOO-WANG MEET SIGNIFIES CONTINUED CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE: US EXPERTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Oct. 16 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several US China hands said on Thursday
that the significance of the consensus reached on Thursday between
Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland China, and his
mainland counterpart, is that cross-strait dialogue will continue.</P>
      <P>Koo, chairman of Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), and
Wang, chairman of Beijing's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS), reached a four-point consensus during their
second round of discussion on Thursday, including agreement on
increased exchanges and dialogue.</P>
      <P>Three American scholars -- Ralph Clough, professor at Johns
Hopkins University, and Nancy Tucker and David Brown of Georgetown
University -- described the consensus as a welcome sign.</P>
      <P>They agreed that the resumption of contact and dialogue after a
hiatus of five years is in itself a good development.</P>
      <P>Tucker said that most important purpose of Koo's trip to mainland
China will be to improve the cross-strait atmosphere. Any agreement
reached, therefore, will be a good thing rich in symbolic
significance.</P>
      <P>On Koo's scheduled meeting with mainland leaders in Beijing over
the weekend, Brown predicted that mainland President Jiang Zemin,
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, and Taiwan Affairs Office Director Chen
Yunlin under the State Department, might have some major
announcements to make, pointing out the tendency of Chinese
negotiators to leave the most important thing to the finale.</P>
      <P>Tucker also said he believed that Jiang could use his meeting
with Koo to show goodwill to Taiwan, but she would not speculate on
whether Jiang will say that everything is open to discussion,
including the name and the national anthem of the nation.</P>
      <P>Both Brown and Clough said that in the wake of the high-profile
murder of Kaohsiung City Councilwoman Lin Ti-chuan in the mainland in
late July, the consensus reached on the protection of the personal
safety and property of Taiwan visitors to the mainland is most
noteworthy.</P>
      <P>Koo and Wang agreed that SEF and ARATS will step up assistance
regarding the protection of personal and property safety of Taiwan
people in mainland China, and vice-versa, according to ARATS Vice
Chairman Tang Shubei,</P>
      <P>Brown and Clough also noted that Taiwan has long been asking the
mainland to sign investment agreements, but said that as no details
in this regard were disclosed in the consensus, it will have to wait
until future cross-strait discussions.</P>
      <P>Clough predicted that Koo's meetings with mainland leaders in
Beijing will just be "get acquainted meetings," and said they will
not go beyond the original stance stated earlier.</P>

      <P>Seven people had been killed, one had been
seriously injured, and seven had been reported missing as of Friday
noon, since Typhoon Zeb started battering Taiwan Thursday, according
to the Central Disaster Prevention and Relief Center.</P>
      <P>The center said that a total of 13 counties and cities around the
island have sustained casualties and damage, with at least 10 people
having been slightly injured by falling billboards and collapsing
houses.</P>
      <P>Several hundred people have been trapped by floodwaters and
mudslides triggered by heavy rains and winds which have also
destroyed four houses and damaged many others, the center reported,
adding blackouts had affected 1.15 million households islandwide.</P>
      <P>Citing Taiwan Power Company's reports, the center said that as of
Friday noon, more than 632,000 homes were still without power.</P>
      <P>Changhua County, central Taiwan, was the most seriously affected
area, with over 207,000 households hit by power failure, the center
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, marine police reported that the Taiwan-registered "Yi
Ho" had broken from its mooring in Taichung Harbor, and had drifted
south without power into the seas off the Changhua coast. Rescuers
had been thwarted by the heavy seas.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND NEGOTIATOR DENIES `3 EMPTIES' STRATEGY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Shanghai,  Oct. 16 (CNA)
(By Tseng Chun-liang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior mainland Chinese negotiator has
denied a report that Beijing will adopt a "three empties" strategy to
put an additional squeeze on Taiwan's diplomatic space, a visiting
Taiwan delegate said here on Friday.</P>
      <P>"Tang Shubei, executive vice chairman of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), told me
on Thursday that mainland Chinese authorities have not formulated a
so-called `three empties' diplomatic strategy against Taiwan," said
Prof. Pao Chung-ho, a researcher with Taiwan's National Unification
Council (NUC).</P>
      <P>The "three empties" strategy refers to Beijing's attempts to lure
away all of the Republic of China's diplomatic allies by the turn of
the century, to block any opportunity for Taiwan to join any
international organization or activity, and to eliminate all the
bargaining chips and clout that Taiwan has used to seek an equal
footing with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Pao, a political science professor at National Taiwan University
who is currently accompanying Taiwan's top negotiator with Beijing,
Chairman C.F. Koo of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) on an
ice-breaking visit to mainland China, said he raised the "three
empties" topic when he discussed cross-strait issues with Tang.</P>
      <P>"I proposed to Tang that Beijing stop its diplomatic offensive
against Taiwan and abandon its `zero-sum' tactic in handling
international affairs related to Taiwan," Pao said.</P>
      <P>The professor said he also told Tang that there should be room
for the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to co-exist and even help each
other in the international community.</P>
      <P>Tang was quoted as telling Pao that Beijing has no plan to lure
away all of the ROC's 27 diplomatic allies. "Nevertheless, Tang added
that mainland China cannot reject any other country which wishes to
forge diplomatic ties," Pao said.</P>
      <P>In response to SEF Vice Chairman Shi Hwei-yow's complaint that
mainland China has often criticized ROC President Lee Teng-hui's
remarks about cross-strait affairs, Tang said such criticism is
mainly for domestic consumption.</P>
      <P>Tang was quoted as having assured Shi that mainland China has
taken steps to improve the situation. According to Shi, Tang said
mainland China has recently stopped publishing editorials critical of
Lee.</P>
      <P>Shi is also a member of the entourage accompanying Koo on his
six-day landmark mainland visit aimed at pushing for the resumption
of cross-strait dialogue that Beijing unilaterally broke off more
than three years ago.</P>
      <P>Koo and his 11-member entourage left Shanghai for Beijing on
Friday to continue their mainland visit.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Shanghai, Koo held two rounds of discussions
with his mainland counterpart, ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan, in an
effort to thaw cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>After the meetings on Wednesday and Thursday, Koo and Wang, the
two elder statesmen charged with shepherding Taipei-Beijing ties in
the absence of official channels, managed to reach a four-point
consensus on the improvement of bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>The four-point agreement included that Wang, an 84-year-old
ex-mayor of Shanghai and mentor to mainland President Jiang Zemin,
accepted from Koo an invitation to visit Taiwan at "an appropriate
time."</P>
      <P>The three other key points of the agreement were:</P>
      <P>-- The two government-backed intermediary bodies, SEF and ARATS,
will resume dialogue on political, economic and other matters of
mutual concern;</P>
      <P>-- SEF and ARATS will reinforce bilateral exchanges at various
levels, including exchanges of visits by their staff members;</P>
      <P>-- SEF and ARATS will strengthen cooperation and assistance in
incidents involving the personal safety and property of Taiwan people
visiting the mainland, and vice versa.</P>

(By Herman Pan and Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US exports to Taiwan, mainland China
and Hong Kong will plummet by as much as US$3 billion in 1998, part
of a total drop of US$31 billion in exports to Asia as a whole, US
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The decline of US exports to Asia will result in a threat to the
employment and economic growth of the United States, the trade
representative added.</P>
      <P>In a speech at the National Association of Manufacturers,
Barshefsky remarked that the Asian financial turmoil has become
world's most serious monetary crisis in 50 years.</P>
      <P>She observed that two-fifths of the container ships leaving Los
Angeles at the moment are empty. US exports to Japan alone will slip
by US$8 billion, she said.</P>
      <P>This development is posing as a threat to employment and economic
growth across the US, Barshefsky commented. The priority of
Washington is to collaborate with the International Monetary Fund to
stabilize the foreign exchange rate of the battered Asian countries
and to restore their economies, she added.</P>
      <P>Barshefsky pointed out in her address that because the global
economy is under the shadow of the Asian financial storm, the biggest
challenge to the US trade policy is promoting a more open world
market.</P>

      <P>A decision by BankBoston Corp. to close its
Taiwan office will not ignite a chain reaction among other foreign
banks, Vice Finance Minister Sean Chen said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The US banking corporation announced on Wednesday that it was
closing its Taiwan office, as well as others in India, Japan, and the

      <P>About 111 jobs will be eliminated because of the closures, 99 of
which are in offices located in Asia.</P>
      <P>In response to a question as to why Japanese banks have chosen to
remain in Taiwan although their profits may be lower than those of
BankBoston, Chen said due to bustling two-way trade between Taiwan
and Japan, there are many Japanese businesses in Taiwan. Therefore,
Japanese banks have a greater client base compared to BankBoston, as
there are fewer US companies from the New England area on the island.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said, each bank has a different strategy. He
added that the BankBoston is planning to extend its business in

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) said on Friday it is pleased to see that exchanges between the
two government-backed intermediary bodies on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait have taken a step forward.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Sheu Ke-sheng made the statement after Taipei's
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the Beijing-based Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) reached a four-point
consensus in Shanghai on Thursday on resuming disrupted dialogue.</P>
      <P>"We are delighted to learn that SEF and ARATS have agreed to step
up dialogue on diverse subjects, including both political and
economic matters, and reinforce exchanges of visits by their staff
members at various levels," Sheu said, adding that the consensus will
help thaw the more-than-three-year cross-strait impasse.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies authorized
by their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in
the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>SEF Chairman C.F. Koo and ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan agreed to
work toward repairing their ruptured dialogue in the four-point deal
sealed at a plush Shanghai hotel on Thursday, the most important step
since Beijing unilaterally broke off talks in mid-1995.</P>
      <P>The four-point consensus included that Wang, an 84-year-old
ex-mayor of Shanghai and mentor to mainland Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, accepted from Koo an invitation to visit Taiwan at "an
appropriate time."</P>
      <P>The three other key points were:</P>
      <P>-- SEF and ARATS will resume dialogue on political, economic and
other matters of mutual concern;</P>
      <P>-- The two bodies will reinforce bilateral exchanges at various
levels, including exchanges of visits by their staff members; and</P>
      <P>-- SEF and ARATS will strengthen cooperation and assistance in
incidents involving the personal safety and property of Taiwan people
visiting the mainland, and vice versa.</P>
      <P>Sheu said Koo originally hoped that Wang would visit Taiwan
either in November or early December to observe three critical
elections on the island scheduled for Dec. 5 -- elections for the
Legislative Yuan and for the mayors and city councils of Taipei and
Kaohsiung, Taiwan's two largest cities.</P>
      <P>However, Wang's deputy, ARATS Executive Vice Chairman Tang
Shubei, said a visit by Wang in November or December would be too
soon.</P>
      <P>"We'll respect Wang's opinion and arrange for his visit at his
convenience," Sheu said.</P>
      <P>He further pointed out that under the agreements signed by Koo
and Wang during their historic first meeting in Singapore in April
1993, SEF and ARATS chairmen can meet regularly to discuss matters of
mutual concern.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the vice chairmen of the two bodies should meet once
every six months and their deputy secretaries-general should meet
once every three months to review operations of the two organizations
and practical matters arising from increasing cross-strait civilian
exchanges.</P>
      <P>"We hope that following Koo's current goodwill mainland visit,
Beijing will abide by these previous agreements and gradually resume

the island's bid to become an observer of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</P>
      <P>Wu Nai-jen, a Central Standing Committee member of the Democratic

Bangkok on Friday to attend a two-day annual CALD conference.</P>
      <P>"We hope Taiwan can be admitted into ASEAN as an observer.
If so, ASEAN can serve as an informal channel for dialogue across
the Taiwan Strait," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Mainland China is an ASEAN dialogue partner.</P>
      <P>Wu said more mutual understanding and mutual trust
are needed for cross-strait dialogue to proceed smoothly and
bear fruit.</P>
      <P>He further pointed out that Taiwan can never follow in the
footsteps of Hong Kong to accept the Beijing-initiated "one country,
two systems" unification formula, stressing that Taiwan's history is
completely different from Hong Kong's.</P>
      <P>Wu said Hong Kong has conceded to Beijing over the democracy
issue after it reverted to communist China's rule on July 1, 1997.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan cannot accept the 'one country, two systems' scheme
because it violates the self-determination principle," Wu noted.</P>

The pro-Taiwan independence DPP is a CALD founding member.</P>
      <P>Wu will present a paper on Taiwan's history and the DPP's

      <P>They exchanged views on such issues as WTO and the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. The ROC and the European Union

      <P>Hutton lauded Taiwan's sound industrial structure and well as its

    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Oct.  16  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's chief negotiator Koo Chen-fu
Friday urged "all friends on the mainland" to try to understand
Taiwan's achievement in promoting democracy in the past five
decades.</P>
      <P>Koo, chairman of the semi-official Strait Exchange Foundation
(SEF), said at a press conference in Beijing that he and his
12-member party want to understand the current situation of the
mainland after its 20 years of economic reform. Koo is visiting
mainland China at the invitation of his mainland Chinese counterpart
Wang Daohan, president of the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>"We also want all friends on the mainland to understand Taiwan's
achievement in democratization over the past 50 years," Koo said,
adding that the two sides should have more contacts, more dialogues,
and more opportunities to understand each other. "This is a must for
promoting mutual understanding, cultivating friendship, and building
mutual trust." Koo said he has already invited Wang to visit Taiwan
to see for himself.</P>
      <P>Koo said that SEF and ARATS officials agreed Thursday in
Shanghai to increase contacts and dialogues, and that they would be
busy making arrangements for exchange of visits.</P>
      <P>Koo also said that while in Beijing he and his party hope to have
good opportunities to meet with "the very important misters concerned"
and have candid dialogues with them so that the two sides will
positively and correctly understand each other. "We hope to find out
proper ways to narrow the gap between us and to promote cross-strait
relations in a correct and constructive way." A Beijing leader once
called President Lee Teng-hui of the Republic of China "Mr. Lee" in a
formal statement.</P>
      <P>Koo and his party arrived in Shanghai Wednesday and proceeded to
Beijing Friday for sightseeing and meeting with their mainland
Chinese counterparts. Koo is also scheduled to meet with mainland
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Vice Premier Qian Qichen, and Director
Chen Yunlin of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the communist Chinese
State Council during his three-day stay in Beijing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INDONESIA SAID CONSIDERING CAPITAL CONTROLS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Oct.  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Bankers and traders suspect Indonesia is
considering limited capital controls which may force exporters to
repatriate their earnings.</P>
      <P>Indonesia has faced severe capital flight and a growing trading
surplus has failed to spark an influx of dollars as exporters have
preferred to retain earnings in foreign currency offshore, according
to reports of the Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO) on
Friday.</P>
      <P>Officials would not confirm any decision but one central bank
employee was quoted as saying that Ginandjar Kartasasmita, the
coordinating minister for finance, economy and industry, had
forwarded such a proposal to the central bank.</P>
      <P>However, officials have denied any plans to impose capital
controls similar to those in Malaysia. Many Indonesians feel their
relatively open capital flow system aggravated the rapid collapse of
the currency during the height of the Asian crisis, the WTO report
said.</P>
      <P>Publicly, Ginandjar has toyed only with introducing a reporting
requirement for dollar purchases, but bankers said the government may
feel a forced conversion of export earnings into rupiah at the
central bank would be an alternative to full capital controls.</P>
      <P>Bankers said such a requirement could work in the short run,
costing exporters an added double conversion in and out of rupiah.
But they said it could hurt those who have dollars abroad as
collateral for letters of credit as most Indonesian letters of credit
are no longer accepted.</P>
      <P>More serious, they said, is a risk the introducing of such a
restriction could be interpreted as a first step to more capital
controls, the WTO report said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KOO TO TAKE UP LEE-JIANG MEETING IN TALKS WITH JIANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Oct. 16 (CNA)
(By CNA Reporters &amp; Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>When Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) Chairman Koo Chen-fu meets with mainland President Jiang Zemin
on Sunday, he may propose a meeting between Jiang and ROC President
Lee Teng-hui, Koo told reporters on Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at a Beijing hotel, Koo said both
Lee and Jiang have indicated a willingness for a top-level meeting,
and it would be "a very good thing for them to meet."</P>
      <P>However, he noted that so far no further plan has been worked
out, and there is a need to create some conditions. If convenient,
Koo said, he will discuss this issue during his meeting with Jiang.</P>
      <P>Koo, accompanied by his entourage, flew to Beijing from Shanghai
on Friday afternoon after concluding two days of discussions with his
mainland counterpart, Chairman Wang Daohan of the PRC's Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Replying to reporters' questions, Koo said Lee did not give him a
personal message to deliver to Jiang.</P>
      <P>He also said Jiang is believed to be fully aware of the progress
Taiwan has made in its democratization process, and as "democracy
will be the best way to bring Taiwan and the mainland closer," Taiwan
would be willing to share its experiences with the mainland in this
regard.</P>
      <P>Koo expressed the hope that Beijing will abide by the agreements
reached in the 1993 Koo-Wang talks in Singapore, otherwise, it may
affect the power of any new agreements to be signed in the future.</P>
      <P>On the "three links" issue, the top negotiator for Taiwan pointed
out that both Taiwan and the mainland still have a "sense of
hostility" and there is a lack of mutual trust between the two sides.</P>
      <P>If the "sense of hostility" is removed now, he said, "I think the
three links (a reference to direct cross-strait trade, transport and
communications links) can be realized tomorrow."</P>
      <P>Regarding his meeting with Jiang, Koo said he has previously met
with the leader during informal summits of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forums over the past few years.</P>
      <P>He said, "All sorts of issues can be discussed" during his
meeting with Jiang this time. But "we are not to press the other side
to accept our views. Both sides must be tolerant and speak out what
they really want to say, so as to promote mutual understanding for
the solution of problems."</P>
      <P>Koo evaded the question of whether he would invite Jiang to visit
Taiwan, saying that his invitation to ARATS Chairman Wang to visit
the island will be a first step for other Beijing leaders to follow.</P>
      <P>He said some conditions must be created for the realization of a
Lee-Jiang meeting. For instance, such a meeting must gain the support
of the people from both sides, and their meeting must bear
guiding and substantive significance.</P>
      <P>Koo and Wang held two rounds of discussions in Shanghai on
Wednesday and Thursday. Koo defined the discussions merely as
dialogues which covered a wide range of topics including practical,
economic and political issues.</P>
      <P>Koo admitted the two sides still have different interpretations
over the "one China" issue. He said this issue cannot be immediately
solved, but instead will be solved gradually through discussions
based on "reality" and "historical truth."</P>
      <P>Koo and his delegation will visit several historical and cultural
sites in Beijing on Saturday. They will meet with President Jiang on
Sunday and leave for Tokyo on Monday as they make their way back to
Taipei.</P>

    <DATELINE>Beijing,   Oct.   16   (CNA)
(By Huang Wen-chung &amp; Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing must show with greater
sincerity that it harbors no hostility towards the people of
Taiwan, Chang Jung-kung, a researcher with the National Unification
Concil (NUC), said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Chang is a member of the Strait Exchange Foundation (SEF)
delegation visiting the mainland led by SEF Chairman Koo
Chen-fu. Chang made the suggestion after Koo briefed the media
following the delegation's arrival in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Koo's remarks that after the removal of
cross-strait hostility, the "three-links" can be carried out the
next day, Chang said it was a methaphor to highlight the serious
nature of Beijing's hostility.</P>
      <P>Since 1991, Chang noted, Taiwan has renounced the use of force
in settling cross-strait impasse. However, up to the present, the
move has yet to obtain goodwill response from Beijing, he added.</P>
      <P>Especially during 1995 and 1996, Beijing has shown particularly
strong military hotility towards Taiwan. In addition to exhibiting
no hostility as a goodwill gesture, Beijing must show more
sincerity in its intentions to the people of Taiwan, Chang said.</P>
      <P>In addition to military hostility, He added that Taiwan people
often feel they have suffered as a result of Beijing's pressure on
the international community, therefore, possitive cross-strait
interaction should include military, political and diplomatic
aspects.</P>
      <P>As for the so-called "three-links" (a reference to direct
cross-strait trade, transport and communications links), Chang said
the issues should be discussed after Beijing eliminates "hostility"
towards Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ZEB TO LEAVE TAIWAN FRIDAY NIGHT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After hammering Taiwan with torrential
rainfall and strong winds, Typhoon Zeb is expected to leave the
island Friday night and ground warnings are expected to be lifted
early on Sunday, forecasters said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Zeb, which has weakened and been downgraded to a light typhoon,
carried maximum wind speeds of 33 meters per second. The center of
the storm was located at sea 170 kilometers east-northeast of Yinan
in eastern Taiwan and was moving in a north-northeasterly direction
at 7:00 p.m., the Central Weather Bureau said.</P>
      <P>Typhoon ground warnings have been lifted in areas south of Tainan
City and in the offshore island of Penghu on Friday afternoon, but
the warnings are still in effect in other areas.</P>
      <P>Zeb has brought down more than 700 millimeters of rain to the
mountainous areas of the island, and 448 millimeters in downtown
Taipei. Flooding has occurred in low-lying areas especially in
Hsichih, Taipei County, a town situated by the Keelung River.</P>
      <P>Nearly half of the town was submerged in waters three- to
five-meters deep. Scheduled trains on the cross-island railway, which
travels through Hsichih, was disrupted as segments of the rail line
and the train station were submerged under flood waters.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew inspected the flood-stricken areas of
Hsichih on Friday morning. He blamed some of the most serious
flooding in the area in a decade on the blockage of the Keelung River
caused by the dumping of waste soil and gravel by nearby construction
projects.</P>
      <P>After Hsichih, Siew toured Liotu, a part of Keelung City, which
has also been inundated by flood waters.</P>
      <P>Although the government recently built a pump station in Liotu to
help avoid flooding, the pump did not work during the storm and was
instead overwhelmed by the heavy rainfall. Also submerged were the
Liotu Industrial Area and a sewage treatment plant.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Siew visited a typhoon shelter at the
National Fire Administration under the Ministry of Interior.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Mayor Chen Shui-bian also made his rounds throughout
the city on Friday. He visited low-lying areas in Nankang, and Neihu
districts, comforting evacuees whose houses were either submerged in
water or damaged by mud slides.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 23 people were killed, 14 were
reported missing, and at least 41 others were injured as Typhoon Zeb
swept through Taiwan on Thursday and Friday, the Central Typhoon
Monitoring Headquarters reported on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Zeb, the strongest of eight tropical storms to visit Taiwan this
year, has pounded the entire island with gusting wind and torrential
rain over the last 60 hours, leaving in its wake a record number of
deaths, and devastating property damage islandwide, according to the
headquarters, established under the Ministry of Interior.</P>
      <P>Of the dead and missing, five were in the Taipei suburb of Neihu,
where two hillside households were buried by a landslide. Rescuers
spent more than 24 hours unearthing the victims' bodies.</P>
      <P>Eight crewmen of a Singaporean freighter which sank on Friday
morning off Chuwei in the northern county of Taoyuan were still
missing as of Saturday noon, and were presumed drowned.</P>
      <P>Two other freighters, both Panama-registered, were grounded off
Tamshui, in Taipei County, and Lukang, central Taiwan, respectively.
All the crew of the two ships were rescued and reported to be in good
condition, according to officials from the monitoring headquarters.</P>
      <P>According to the Central Weather Bureau, Zeb, which killed 74
people in the Philippines before raging across Taiwan, was charted
about 60 kilometers south of the main Japanese island of Kyushu as of
11:45 a.m. on Saturday, and was moving northeast at a speed of 35
kilometers per hour, posing a great threat to Japan.</P>
      <P>Zeb brought more than 700 millimeters of rainfall to mountainous
areas of Taiwan, and 450 millimeters fell in Taipei. Flooding has
occurred in low-lying areas, especially Hsichih, Taipei County, a
town situated on the banks of the Keelung River. As of Friday night,
more than 10,000 Hsichih households were inundated.</P>
      <P>Local authorities there announced that government offices and
schools would remain closed on Saturday, making it one of only two
towns islandwide to suspend normal operations a day after the typhoon
left the island, along with the northernmost city of Keelung.</P>
      <P>Islandwide, nearly 500,000 households were left without power on
Friday, and some 95,000 telephone lines were out of order.</P>
      <P>The typhoon has so far caused an estimated NT$1.9 billion
(US$57.5 million)-worth of agricultural and fishery losses in Taiwan
since Thursday. Of the total, crops suffered some NT$1.6 billion in
damage. Average wholesale prices of local vegetables shot up 24
percent on Saturday to NT$24.6 per kilogram from NT$19.9 posted three
days ago.</P>
      <P>Southern Pingtung, central Changhua, and eastern Hualien and

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  16  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton has been
urged by a US analyst to seek a new location for the upcoming Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum summit.</P>
      <P>Richard Fisher, acting director of the Asian Studies Center at
the Washington-based Heritage Foundation, said this would send a
strong message to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed regarding
both his brutal treatment of former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim and his economic policies that violate free-market ideals.</P>
      <P>Mahathir is ill-suited to host the upcoming APEC summit, because
he has long criticized free trade and Western values, and his
treatment of Anwar, who had earned respect throughout Asia and in the
United States for his efforts, has upset many APEC members, noted the
senior policy analyst.</P>
      <P>Anwar's trial, scheduled to end just two days before the
beginning of the APEC meeting, will be a distraction for the summit's
participants if it is held in Malaysia, Fisher said.</P>
      <P>Beset by domestic distractions, the Clinton administration has
not adequately protested the treatment of Anwar or responded to
Mahathir's challenge to America's leadership role in APEC. In the
midst of the most serious Asian economic crisis since World War II,
the United States and APEC cannot afford to let their interests in
Asia be threatened by Mahathir's protectionist policies, added
Fisher.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the presidents of the Philippines and
Indonesia have reportedly considered boycotting the summit to protest
Mahathir's treatment of Anwar. Changing the summit venue would send a
firm message to Mahathir about his actions and allow Washington and
APEC to focus on advancing APEC's goals, such as lowering trade
barriers, Fisher added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC URGES BEIJING TO CLARIFY 3 DIPLOMATIC INCIDENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Foreign Minister David Lee on Saturday
asked mainland Chinese authorities to clarify three incidents
concerning their diplomatic strangulation strategy against the
Republic of China on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee made the appeal on the eve of a scheduled meeting in Beijing
between Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland China, C.F. Koo, and
mainland President Jiang Zemin, in the highest-level contact on
Chinese soil between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait since 1949.</P>
      <P>Lee said the call is not expected to have any impact on the
Koo-Jiang meeting scheduled for Sunday.</P>
      <P>"We felt compelled to request mainland China's diplomatic
authorities to clarify some recent incidents after learning that a
senior mainland negotiator with Taiwan said Beijing has no plans to
lure away all of the ROC's diplomatic allies before the year 2000,"
Lee said.</P>
      <P>Tang Shubei, executive vice chairman of Beijing's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), said in Shanghai on
Thursday that Beijing has not formulated a so-called "three empties"
diplomatic strategy against Taiwan, nor does it intend to lure away
all of Taiwan's 27 diplomatic allies by the turn of the century.</P>
      <P>Tang reportedly made the remarks while meeting with a Taiwan
delegate who is accompanying Chairman Koo of Taipei's Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) on a Shanghai-Beijing visit aimed at
thawing cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Responding to Tang's denial, Lee said the ROC government should
give mainland Chinese authorities due recognition if they can truly
abandon their "zero-sum" thinking in handling issues related to
Taiwan's activities in the international arena.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lee said, factual developments seem to contradict
Tang's statement.</P>
      <P>The senior diplomatic official said he hopes mainland authorities
will clarify a report that immediately prior to Koo's
departure for his mainland trip, they had used every possible means
to tempt one of the ROC's allies to forge official ties with Beijing
within two weeks of Koo's return to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee said mainland China had even told the ROC ally that forging
diplomatic ties with it would not affect exchanges between SEF and
ARATS, the two quasi-official intermediary bodies authorized by their
respective governments to handle cross-strait ties in the absence of
official channels.</P>
      <P>Lee would not divulge the name of the country that Beijing is
wooing strenuously. "We must protect the source of our information,"
he said, adding that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is fully
aware of the terms offered by the mainland, as well as many other
technical details relating to the proposed deal.</P>
      <P>Lee said his ministry has made every possible effort to shore up
relations with the ally in question. However, it remains uncertain
whether or not the ally will switch its diplomatic recognition in the
near future.</P>
      <P>MOFA sources said the incident represents just the tip of the
iceberg of mainland China's double-faced strategy toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While the media over the past few weeks has focused mainly on the
preparations for Koo's landmark mainland visit, the sources said,
MOFA has received information that Beijing is stepping up wooing
Taiwan's diplomatic allies, in an attempt to persuade them to switch
their diplomatic allegiance.</P>
      <P>The two other incidents Lee asked Beijing to clarify were:</P>
      <P>-- Did mainland Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen ask all mainland
diplomats at the Aug. 24-29 mainland overseas mission chief
conference to launch an all-out campaign against Taiwan on the
diplomatic front and to do their utmost to lure away all of Taiwan's
diplomatic allies as soon as possible?</P>
      <P>-- Did the mainland authorities order their delegation to a
women's affairs ministerial-level meeting sponsored by the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Manila on Oct. 16
to demand the organizers delete the official title of the chief ROC
delegate to the conference?</P>
      <P>The ROC representative at the meeting was Lin Cheng-chih,
chairperson of the Cabinet-level Council for Cultural Affairs.</P>
      <P>Both Taiwan and mainland China are APEC members. Taiwan joined
the regional economic cooperation forum under the name "Chinese
Taipei." According to Lee, the mainland delegate to the
just-concluded APEC women's affairs meeting had also demanded the
organizers delete the word "Taiwan" in Lin's home address listed in
the roster of the participants.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  16  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The consensus between Taiwan and
mainland China to continue dialogue and exchanges is helpful to
"building trust and reducing tension," the US government said on
Friday.</P>
      <P>"The White House welcomes reports that the two sides have reached
consensus to discuss political and economic issues, to strengthen
exchanges, and to work together on cases involving safety and
property," a National Security Council (NSC) spokeswoman said.</P>
      <P>The White House also welcomes reports that Wang Daohan, head of
mainland China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait,
has agreed to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"These steps should help the process of building trust and
reducing tension between the two sides," the spokeswoman said.</P>
      <P>The consensus was reached during meetings in Shanghai on Thursday
between Wang and his Taiwan counterpart, C.F. Koo, chairman of the
Straits Exchange Foundation.</P>
      <P>The NSC spokeswoman said that President Bill Clinton has urged
both sides publicly and privately to "resume a constructive dialogue
and to develop contacts and exchanges designed to reduce tensions."</P>
      <P>"The administration's policy has been designed to create an
atmosphere favorable to such contacts and exchanges," she said.
"We're pleased by this step forward."</P>
      <P>In a statement issued earlier this week, the US State Department
also welcomed the resumption of cross-strait dialogue after mainland
China postponed talks scheduled for June and July, 1995.</P>
      <P>No further comments are expected from the State Department until
next Monday, after Koo has concluded his visit to the mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US CHINA HAND GLAD TO SEE THAW IN CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles,  Oct.  16 (CNA)
(By Chu Lusheng and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The meeting between top negotiators
across the Taiwan Strait in Shanghai is providing Taiwan and mainland
China with an opportunity to help thaw the cross-strait impasse, an
expert with a US-based think-tank said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Michael Swaine, a China expert with the Rand Corporation, a Los
Angeles-based defense think-tank, said that while the Clinton
administration is promoting a "fourth no" policy -- no force against
Taiwan by mainland China -- the meeting between Koo Chen-fu, chairman
of Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation, and Wang Daohan, chairman of
Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, has
come at the right time.</P>
      <P>The Koo-Wang meeting is a good start which is conducive to
reducing tension across the Taiwan Strait and resuming long-stalled
dialogue, Swaine said during an interview with the CNA.</P>
      <P>Swaine, director of the Rand Corp.'s Asian-Pacific policy
research, said that according to his assessment, mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin is unlikely to renounce the threat of force
against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Jiang, however, is definitely pondering the viability of
resorting to "less force" against Taiwan, because peaceful resolution
of the cross-strait conflict is the one and only resolution that
Washington has so far supported, and also the international
community's common expectation of Jiang, Swaine noted.</P>
      <P>Swaine said Koo's trip to Shanghai and Beijing is conducive to
easing the cross-strait impasse. If the landmark visit can initiate
channels for normal and regular communication across the Taiwan
Strait, it is beneficial to peaceful resolution of the conflict, he
added.</P>
      <P>Although he does not foresee Koo's visit resulting in any major
breakthrough in cross-strait relations, Swaine said Wang's agreement
to visit Taipei was a breakthrough.</P>
      <P>Wang, the 84-year-old ex-mayor of Shanghai, and mentor-friend of
Jiang, has a certain degree of influence on the mainland president,
Swaine said.</P>
      <P>Koo's current mainland China tour, which features
person-to-person contacts between high-level officials from both
sides, is sure to have a positive and far-reaching impact on
cross-strait relations, Swaine concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHOULD HAVE SELF-DETERMINATION: COLUMNIST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,    Oct.    16   (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has the right to
self-determination, but the international community is timid in the
face of mainland China's bluster, according to an Australian
columnist.</P>
      <P>In an article titled: "Bullying Taiwan is Irrational
and Counter-productive," Greg Sheridan says the chief constraint on
Taiwan is the implacable hostility of mainland China, which still
regards Taiwan as a renegade province that must be brought under
Beijing's rule.</P>
      <P>"Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan
under mainland rule," he says.</P>
      <P>"Really, the international community is grotesquely timid in the
face of Chinese bluster," he said, adding: "Taiwan deserves the right
to self-determination. Instead, in order to curry favor with Beijing,
the world persists with the charade of the `one-China' policy."</P>
      <P>He notes the main constraint on mainland China's behavior is the
United States, which, under its Taiwan Relations Act, is committed to
maintaining Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>He believes the recent remarks by US President Bill Clinton, in
which he explicitly repeated Beijing's "Three Noes" policy -- no
independence for Taiwan, no "two Chinas," and no Taiwan membership of
international organizations requiring statehood -- have distressed
the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Sheridan believes China's bullying of Taiwan costs the rest of
the world, including Australia.</P>
      <P>"Beijing, for example, has prevented Taiwan from joining the
World Trade Organization, so the 14th-largest trading economy in the
world is not integrated into the global trading system," he says.</P>
      <P>"Similarly, Beijing has prevented international organizations
from accepting generous Taiwanese offers of financial assistance to
victims of the Asian economic crisis."</P>
      <P>"Further, if Taiwan itself were to get into trouble, the
International Monetary Fund could not assist it because Beijing has
blocked its membership," he adds.</P>
      <P>He notes that mainland China wants reunification to result from
the current discussions between representatives from Taiwan and
mainland China in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>"But Taiwan wants less tension, more international space, and the
postponement of reunificaiton forever," said Sheridan, who also
stressed that "absolutely no one in Taiwan desires unification."</P>
      <P>"There are few things less attractive than bootlicking dressed
up as high principle, which is what we mostly get when we hear
blather about `one-China,'" he says, adding: "Taiwan's people have
every right to determine their future, and we all have a stake in
their decision."</P>

    <HEADLINE>THREE LINKS NEGOTIATIONS TO COME AFTER PEACE PACT: MAC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei will weigh opening the three
currently banned direct links with mainland China only after Beijing
agrees to sign a peace agreement with Taiwan and ends attempts to
isolate the island, a top official said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Sheu Ke-sheng, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council,
Taipei's top agency in charge of policy toward the mainland, was
referring to direct transportation, communication and trade links
between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Sheu's comments come after Koo Chen-fu, chairman of Taipei's
semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), said at a news
conference upon his arrival in Beijing on Friday that the three links
can immediately open after hostility between Taipei and Beijing ends.</P>
      <P>Koo is in the middle of a visit to the mainland and is scheduled
to meet with mainland President Jiang Zemin on Monday.</P>
      <P>Sheu dismissed the issues of how many members of Koo's delegation
will attend the meeting, where it will take place, and in what
capacity Jiang will be meeting with Koo as irrelevant.</P>
      <P>Instead, Sheu emphasized that a meeting between Koo and Jiang
will be a step toward the positive development of cross-strait ties
as it provides Koo with a rare opportunity to convey Taiwan's
perspectives to Jiang.</P>
      <P>Jiang reportedly intended to meet only with Koo and his wife, but
Taiwan has insisted that others be included in the meeting to avoid
criticism from those in Taiwan who are suspicious of a possible
secret deal between the ruling Kuomintang and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Although details of the Koo-Jiang meeting are still under
negotiation, Taiwan will not insist on a specific number of
attendees, but the Koos will definitely be accompanied by others,
Sheu said.</P>
      <P>At the invitation of Beijing's semi-official Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), Koo and his delegation
arrived in Shanghai for a six-day mainland visit on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>During a meeting between Koo and ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan, a
series of agreements were made in addition to an invitation by Koo
for Wang to visit Taiwan, which Wang has accepted.</P>
      <P>Koo suggested that Wang visit Taiwan during its legislative and
city council elections slated for early December, but ARATS officials
said it was not an appropriate period for Wang's visit and there was
not enough time to arrange such a visit. Sheu said Wang could visit
at another more convenient time for both sides.</P>

Saturday bade farewell to Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore at
the end of Compaore's nine-day state visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under sunny skies on the tail end of Typhoon Zeb, Lee hosted a
grand farewell ceremony at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall complex
in downtown Taipei. Compaore was accorded with full military honors,
complete with a 21-gun salute followed by the national anthems of the
ROC and its African ally.</P>
      <P>Prior to the ceremony, Lee met with his Burkina Faso counterpart
at the Presidential Office to discuss issues of mutual concern. The
leaders then signed a joint communique to reiterate the two
countries' common wish of expanding mutual cooperation.</P>
      <P>According to the joint communique, Lee vowed that the ROC
government would seek peaceful unification of those on the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait through negotiations.</P>
      <P>The communique also touched on the Asian financial crisis. Taiwan
has shared with its ally what steps it has taken to avert disaster

      <P>Compaore expressed his full recognition of the ROC's key role in
Asia's economy, encouraged Lee to continue in joint effort with other
Asian leaders to boost confidence of the people in the region and
those in other regions around the world.</P>
      <P>The joint statement noted that each country's respective foreign
ministers have signed two agreements on the mutual promotion and
protection of investments as well as visa application issues in the
hopes of promoting future exchanges.</P>
      <P>The African president also reiterated that his government and all
people of Burkina Faso support the Republic of China's complete
membership of all international organizations of the world, including
the United Nations.</P>
      <P>In the interest of a peaceful and harmonious existence, Lee and
Compaore both stressed the importance of respecting the principle of
national independence, sovereignty and territorial rights as a part
of the joint communique.</P>
      <P>Compaore and his entourage arrived in Taiwan on Oct. 8 to attend
the ROC's Double-Ten National Day celebrations at Lee's invitation.</P>
      <P>During his stay on the island, the African leader met with

    <TEXT>
      <P>C. F. Koo, Taiwan's top negotiator with
mainland China, paid a visit to a memorial hall dedicated to Dr. Sun
Yat-sen, the Republic of China's national founding father, on
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by his wife and several members of his entourage,
Koo arrived at the Biuen Temple in suburban Beijing at around 9 a.m.</P>
      <P>Koo laid a wreath before a statue of Dr. Sun to pay his tribute
to the late ROC national leader. He then browsed through
Dr. Sun's manuscripts and calligraphic works exhibited in the
memorial hall.</P>
      <P>The billionaire tycoon charged with shepherding Taipei-Beijing
ties in the absence of official channels said Dr. Sun was a great
patriot and the vanguard of China's democratization and
modernization.</P>
      <P>"To push for China's modernization, Dr. Sun advocated the Three
Principles of the People, offering a rightful direction for China's
development," Koo said.</P>
      <P>As the Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are
pursuing modernization, Koo said, they should base on Dr. Sun's
ideals in establishing a democratic system and developing economy to
realize Dr. Sun's goals of popular sovereignty and equitable
distribution of wealth.</P>
      <P>Koo went on to say that Taiwan has evolved into a full-fledged
democracy, with its senior leaders, from the president down, elected
by all of its citizens. "Taiwan has also protected private
ownership and promoted economic liberalization in an effort to
realize Dr. Sun's ideal of equitable prosperity."</P>
      <P>Koo said Taiwan is more than willing to share its experience in
implementing Dr. Sun's thoughts and ideals so as to lay a solid
foundation for positive interaction across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Koo and his wife visited Beijing University.
The first president of the university, Yen Fu, was the grandfather
of Koo's wife Koo-Yen Chou-yun.</P>
      <P>The Koos laid a wreath before a statue of Yen Fu at the
university's library to express their respect and remembrance to
their ancestor.</P>
      <P>Yen Fu was the first Chinese scholar to translate British
biologist Thomas Henry Huxley's writings about organic evolution into
Chinese to help advance scientific development in China.</P>
      <P>Koo and his 11-member entourage flew to Beijing from Shanghai on
Friday to continue their six-day ice-breaking mainland visit aimed
at thaw long-stalled cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Koo, a senior adviser to ROC President Lee Teng-hui, is

    <TEXT>
      <P>Notaries public and related judicial
officials from Taiwan and mainland China met Friday and Saturday in
Beijing for a cross-strait notarization workshop.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's top negotiator, Koo Chen-fu, and his delegates are
visiting Beijing, the cross-strait notaries public's meeting is of
special significance, said Wang You-feng, a counselor and public
relations director of the Republic of China's Judicial Yuan. Wang is
leading the Taiwan notaries public group to the mainland meeting.</P>
      <P>Wang said during the last two days, participants from the two
sides have exchanged views on notarization and related affairs,
particularly on the notarization of marriages and inheritances across
the Taiwan Strait, the authority and liability of notarized
documents, and problems involving defected notarized items.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was represented by 15 delegates, from the Judicial Yuan as
well as the high and district courts around the island for the

    <HEADLINE>QIAN QICHEN TO BE REPLACED IN TAIWAN AFFAIRS GROUP: REPORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Oct.  16  (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu &amp; Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Qian Qichen, mainland Chinese vice
premier, is expected to be replaced as the current deputy head of the
Central Leading Group for Taiwan Affairs in the Communist Party of
China (CPC), sources said.</P>
      <P>Qian is scheduled to meet in Beijing with Taipei's top envoy Koo
Chen-fu, who is visiting the mainland.</P>
      <P>However, Qian's meeting with Koo is said to be his last
appearance in the capacity of the CPC's top policy-making official
for Taiwan affairs. Zeng Qinghong, director of the General Office of
the CPC Central Committee, has been tipped to replace Qian, sources
said.</P>
      <P>Huang Wenfang, former director of the Taiwan Affairs Department
in the Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong, said professional diplomats
are not usually considered the ideal personnel for Taiwan affairs.</P>
      <P>Professional diplomats are seen as having an "occupational
disease," they insist too much on principles and have a lack of
dexterity, Huang said. Qian was foreign minister before he assumed
the post in the Central Leading Group for Taiwan Affairs.</P>
      <P>The difficult and harsh experiences across the Taiwan Strait over
the past couple of years, only serves as evidence of how a
professional diplomat typically deals with Taiwan affairs, Huang
added.</P>
      <P>As Zeng, a favorite of mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin,
will likely replace Qian, there are high expectations that the
mainland's handling of Taiwan affairs will be more smooth, remarked
the former official of Xinhua's Hong Kong branch office.</P>

      <P>The Federal Reserve's slashing of key US
interest rates on Thursday will be beneficial to world economic and
financial stability, said senior official of the Central Bank of
China.</P>
      <P>Fed's move, the second time within half a month, highlighted the

      <P>The US central bank cut the federal funds overnight bank lending
rate to 5 percent from 5.25 percent. It also cut the discount rate
to 4.75 percent from 5 percent. That move brought official rates to
their lowest level in four years.</P>
      <P>The loose money policy adopted by the Fed, is likely to exert
much pressure on primery industrial countries such as Germany and

    <HEADLINE>ROC REGARDS KOO-JIANG MEETING AS CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Oct. 17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China deems the scheduled
meeting in Beijing between its senior envoy C. F. Koo and mainland
Chinese President Jiang Zemin as "constructive dialogue," a
negotiator said here on Saturday.</P>
      <P>"The Koo-Jiang meeting is expected to be meaningful
communications without a specified agenda," said Shi Hwei-yow, vice
chairman of Taiwan's semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
who is accompanying Koo on a six-day mainland visit aimed at thawing
relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Koo, an elder statesman and billionaire tycoon, is scheduled to
meet Jiang at the Diaoyutai State Guest House on Sunday afternoon,
in the highest-level cross-strait contact on Chinese soil
since 1949.</P>
      <P>"We think it will be helpful and conducive to the development of
cross-strait relations if both sides can frankly express their
stances on matters of mutual concern," Shi said, adding that candid
exchanges of views can help foster mutual understanding.</P>
      <P>For instance, Shi said the four-point consensus reached between
SEF Chairman Koo and his mainland counterpart, Wang Daohan, was a
constructive development in cross-strait engagement.</P>
      <P>Koo and Wang, the two octogenarian charged with shepherding
cross-strait ties in the absence of official channels, sealed the
four-point deal in Shanghai on Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Even though the consensus has yet to be codified, it will
serve as a guidepost for the future interchange between the two
government-backed intermediary bodies that Koo and Wang head," Shi
explained.</P>
      <P>According to the deal, Wang, an ex-mayor of Shanghai and
mentor to Jiang, agreed to visit Taiwan at an appropriate time.
Meanwhile, SEF and its mainland counterpart, the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), will step up dialogue,
increase exchanges at various levels and assist each other in
handling incidents involving personal safety and property of the
people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Shi said the consensus marks a step forward toward the resumption
of systematic SEF-ARATS dialogue and consultations, broken off by
Beijing in mid-1995.</P>
      <P>Shi further said he hopes SEF-ARATS dialogue channels codified in
the agreements reached in the first Koo-Wang meeting in Singapore in
1993 can resumed normal operations as soon as possible to facilitate
bilateral exchanges and ease cross-strait situation so as to create
a favorable climate and conditions for a summit meeting between ROC
President Lee Teng-hui and mainland President Jiang.</P>
      <P>Koo and his 11-member entourage flew to Beijing from Shanghai on
Friday. Sunday's Koo-Jiang meeting will be a climax of Koo's current
mainland trip, which will end on Oct. 19.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of mainalnd

    <HEADLINE>CHINA BOOSTING ITS MILITARY AS IT TRYS TO ANNEX TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  17  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While Beijing seeks to reunify with
Taiwan, it continues to bolster its military strength through
boosting its high-technology weaponry, the Sydney Morning Herald
reported.</P>
      <P>The People's Liberation Army (PLA) has reportedly spent US$800
million to buy Sovremenny-class guided missile destroyers from
Russia. These 7,200-tonne warships are armed with 50 Sunburn
supersonic anti-ship missiles that naval experts say are extremely
difficult to intercept, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>When these warships are deployed, mainland China will immediately
raise the stakes in any future conflict over the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In addition, the PLA has also bought four advanced kilo-class
conventional submarines from Russia. Those along with the PLA's
Chinese-made Song-class submarines could form the core of a dangerous
threat to Taiwan or US naval forces, the paper reported.</P>
      <P>Beijing is pressing for the reunification issue with Taiwan as it
sees the island as the final target once it gets both Hong Kong and
Macau back in its fold. Hong Kong was returned to Beijing rule in
July 1997, and Portugal will hand over Macau in December 1999.</P>
      <P>While representatives make efforts to meet and discuss political
and practical issues, China's military modernization is aimed at
allowing the PLA to deter any declaration of independence by Taiwan
and allow them to dominate key sea lanes that carry the bulk of East
Asia's trade, the paper said.</P>
      <P>Analysts continue to believe that the 160-kilometer waterway
between mainland China and Taiwan will remain one of the most
dangerous flash points in Asia, it concluded.</P>

    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Oct.  17  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's semi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) believes the Republic of China is "one China,"
although it refrains from referring to it in correspondence with its
mainland counterpart, a SEF official said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>SEF Vice Chairman Shi Hwei-yow, who is accompanying SEF Chairman
Koo Chen-fu on a ice-breaking mission to Beijing, was speaking to
Taipei-based journalists covering the visit.</P>
      <P>He said the thorny issue of "one China" emerged several times in
the 1992 negotiations between SEF and its the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Both sides agree there is only one China. However, Beijing
believes it is the sole legitimate representative of the one China,
while Taipei insists that the one China is divided into two parts --
the mainland and Taiwan. Meanwhile, SEF believes the ROC is the one
China.</P>
      <P>As no consensus was reached on the issue and the 1993 meeting
between Koo and ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan went ahead anyway, Shi
said SEF believed ARATS "agreed to disagree" over the definition of
one China by allowing the meeting to go ahead.</P>
      <P>Although SEF refrains from referring to "one China" in its
correspondence with ARATS to avoid any awkwardness, it has never
shifted away from its stance that the ROC is the "one China," Shi
added.</P>
      <P>SEF did not hesitate to refer to Sun Yat-sen as "the founding
father of the Republic of China," when Koo visited Sun's tomb in
Beijing early on Saturday, Shi noted. Even the mainland acknowledges
Sun as the founder of the ROC, he added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's main opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said on Saturday it does not expect to see
any consensus reached in Sunday's meeting between a senior Taiwan
envoy and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>Chairman C. F. Koo of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), who
is currently on an ice-breaking visit to mainland China, is
scheduled to meet Jiang on Sunday afternoon at Beijing's Diaoyutai
State Guest House.</P>
      <P>"The Koo-Jiang meeting will be yet another climax of
cross-strait political dialogue. We hope Koo and other Taiwan
delegates present at the meeting will not hesitate to express
Taiwan's basic stances on various political issues," said Yen
Wan-chin, director of the DPP's China Affairs Department.</P>
      <P>Yen said the Taiwan delegation should not be afraid to
dispute Jiang's views about Taiwan's independent sovereignty
or any other related issues.</P>
      <P>"If Jiang mentions Beijing's one-China policy, Koo should
never hesitate to make it clear that the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait have been separately ruled by two equal governments," Yen
said.</P>
      <P>The senior executive from the pro-independence party said Koo
should even take the initiative to push for China's democratization
and the "internationalization" of cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>Yen said Koo can also take up such topics as Taiwan's demands
for President Lee Teng-hui to attend the annual leadership meeting
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, and
for joining the ASEAN Regional Forum and the Council on Security
Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislator Chou Po-lun, the DPP whip in the
Legislative Yuan, said the government has not authorized Koo to make
any promises on political issues.</P>
      <P>"The government has just authorized Koo to conduct
'constructive dialogue' with Beijing," Chous stressed, adding that
Koo should focus on discussing with Jiang such issues as protection
of Taiwan investors' personal safety, property and other
legitimate rights as well as ease of cross-strait animosity.</P>
      <P>Chou further said need not rush to touch on any political
issues with Jiang. "More important, he should not make any concession
that might undermine Taiwan's sovereign status," he added.</P>
      <P>Koo, accompanied by an 11-member entourage, left for Shanghai on
Wednesday for a six-day mainland visit aimed at thawing bilateral
ties. The delegation arrived in Beijing on Friday following its

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>National Unification Council (NUC)
researcher Chang Jung-kung warned mainland China on Sunday of the
widening gap between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, urging the
mainland to hasten its democratization if it wishes to unify with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang, vice spokesman of an 11-member delegation accompanying
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Koo Chen-fu on his current
mainland tour, stressed that Taiwan is willing to discuss any subject
with mainland China as long as the mainalnd becomes a democracy.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks at a news conference after a meeting
between Koo and mainland Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen Sunday
morning. During the meeting, which lasted more than one hour, Qian
reiterated Beijing's "one China" policy, while Koo criticized
Beijing's efforts to isolate Taiwan internationally.</P>
      <P>In addition to Chang, SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Shi
Hwei-yow, NUC member Kang Ning-hsiang and NUC researcher Pao Chung-ho
were also present at the occasion.</P>
      <P>Rebutting Qian's remarks during the meeting that the mainland has
never done anything to isolate Taiwan in the international community,
Chang said that time will tell whether this is true, adding that
Taiwan will "listen to Beijing's words and watch its deeds" in the
future.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the mainland's bullying of Taiwan has made the
people of Taiwan feel increasingly adrift from the "one China"
claimed by Beijing, Chang warned that the problem will worsen if
Beijing continues to employ such a strategy to counter Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang called on Qian to pay greater heed to the development, as
the mainland Chinese vice premier is the chief proponent of Beijing's
use of military force, diplomatic battles and economic links to deal
with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Pao lamented Beijing's insistence on sticking to its "one China"
principle, which claims that the People's Republic of China is the
sole legitimate government representing the whole of China.</P>
      <P>Pao also disagreed with Qian's contention that Taiwan's narrowed
space in the international arena is a result of international trends.</P>
      <P>Calling on the mainland to face the reality that the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait are two independent political entities under
separate rule, he said Koo's declaration that "China is still
divided" is by no means aimed at promoting Taiwan independence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND'S REFUSAL TO RECOGNIZE ROC HARMFUL TO CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Oct.  18  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A spokesman for a high-level Taiwan
delegation in mainland China said on Sunday that mainland China's
campaign to isolate Taiwan diplomatically is harmful to cross-strait
relations.
	Shi Hwei-yow, vice chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation.(SEF), said that before the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
can unify under a system of democracy, each side should have its own
space in the international community.</P>
      <P>He made the statement after SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's
top negotiator with the mainland, met with mainland Chinese Vice
Premier Qian Qichen Sunday morning in the Diaoyutai State Guest House
in Beijing.</P>
      <P>According to Shi, Koo told Qian that if the mainland deliberately
refuses to acknowledge the existence of the Republic of China, it
would not only be impossible for both sides of the Taiwan Strait to
engage in political dialogue, it would elicit negative feelings from
the people of Taiwan toward the mainland.</P>
      <P>While Qian stressed that there is only one China, of which Taiwan
is a part, and that the sovereignty of China is indivisible, Shi, in
a conference after the Koo-Qian meeting, said that mainland China
still has not accepted the fact that the two sides of the strait are
under separate rule and has refused to recognize the existence of the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Shi mentioned Beijing's "three empties" strategy toward Taiwan.
The strategy refers to Beijing's attempt to lure away all the ROC's
allies by the turn of the century, to block Taiwan from joining any
international organizations and to eliminate all the bargaining chips
and clout that Taiwan has amassed in its efforts to seek an equal
footing with Beijing.</P>
      <P>In addition, Shi said that those mainlanders visiting the
Republic of China have not paid due respect to its system, which he
said has incited aversion toward the mainland and has become an
hurdle to the development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Shi said that before the unification of the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait under democracy, both sides should learn to cooperate
with each other, saying that this would make the Chinese on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait stronger and more powerful
internationally.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that Beijing would forego zero-sum
thinking, which would mark the first step in terminating hostilities
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and create favorable
conditions for future unification under a democratic system.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the atmosphere in the Koo-Qian meeting was
volatile, Shi said the ROC delegation firmly stated its stance in a
peaceful manner.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING URGED NOT TO OBSTRUCT TAIPEI'S JOINING KEDO</HEADLINE>

(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), said on Sunday that the Republic of China
is interested in joining the Korea Peninsula Energy Organization
(KEDO) and that he hopes Beijing will not obstruct the ROC's efforts
to join the organization.</P>
      <P>Koo made the remarks when meeting with mainland Chinese Vice
Premier Qian Qichen. He told Qian that several countries have
suggested that Taipei join KEDO to fulfill its duty as part of the
Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>"We are actively considering the feasibility of joining KEDO at
the suggestion of some members of the international community," Koo
was quoted as saying by SEF Vice Chairman Shi Hwei-yow, who relayed
Koo's remarks to the media at a press conference after the meeting.</P>
      <P>Shi said Koo's remarks drew only a brief response from Qian, who
pointed out that KEDO was organized by the United States and that
Beijing had no involvement with it.</P>
      <P>Set up by the United States, Japan, South Korea and North Korea
in 1995, KEDO was intended to build two nuclear reactors for North
Korea to provide Pyongyang with energy resources and to halt its
nuclear development program.</P>
      <P>Koo pointed out that Japan and South Korea, both affected by
Asia's financial turmoil, have suspended their contributions to the
project. Some countries have suggested Taiwan join the organization
to help foot the bill.</P>
      <P>To avoid the possibility of nuclear proliferation in northeast
Asia, Koo said, Taipei is willing to consider the suggestion that it
join KEDO.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman
Koo Chen-fu said in Beijing on Sunday that investments by Taiwan
businessmen have become an important source of hard foreign currency
for mainland China.</P>
      <P>Koo made the remarks at a luncheon given in his honor by Taiwan
businessmen in the capital city.</P>
      <P>He said that statistics from Beijing indicate total projected
investment by Taiwan businessmen in mainland China as of the end of
June stood at US$39.3 billion, of which US$18.4 billion has already
been put into practice.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile some 1,500 Taiwan enterprises have announced
investments in the city of Beijing totaling US$2 billion, of which
US$1.3 billion has already been invested. That figure makes Taiwan
the fourth-largest foreign investor in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Koo said that many Taiwan businessmen have complained about being
investigated by mainland authorities as part of the
mainland's efforts to combat smuggling and tax fraud. Koo said he
has indicated Taiwan's concerns over these investigations to
Beijing on several occasions.</P>
      <P>The SEF chairman expressed the hope that his mainland trip would

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's chief negotiator Koo Chen-fu said
here Sunday that Taiwan and mainland China should respect each other,
tolerate each other, and try to gradually improve their relations
through exchanges, cooperation, and consultations so as to create
favorable conditions for future democratic reunification of China.</P>
      <P>Koo, chairman of the semi-official Strait Exchange Foundation,
made the remarks when he met with mainland Chinese Vice Premier Qian
Qichen.</P>
      <P>Koo said Beijing should recognize the historical fact that China
has been under separate rule since 1949, and refrain from isolating
Taiwan from the international community, so as to alleviate Taiwan
people's aversion to Beijing.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that in the world there are many opportunities for
the Chinese on the mainland and Taiwan to support and cooperate with
each other. "If we do so, it will not hinder the future democratic
reunification of China. On the contrary, it will help increase the
strength of Chinese in the world community," he added.</P>
      <P>Koo, who is on a six-day visit to Shanghai and Beijing at the
invitation of his mainland Chinese counterpart Wang Daohan, pointed
out that Taiwan was reverted to the Republic of China in 1945 in
accordance with the Potsdam Declaration, and that the mainland and
Taiwan have been under separate rule since the end of civil war in
1949. Beijing has to recognize the undeniable historical fact that
"China has been under separate rule since then," he said.</P>
      <P>Koo and several members of his 12-member delegation are
scheduled to meet with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin later
in the day.</P>

      <P>They began their meeting with friendly conversation, talking
about the weather in Beijing and Chinese opera, of which Koo is a

      <P>Jiang also asked Koo, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation

it has been 55 years since he has been to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Photographers were given five minutes to take pictures of the
meeting between the two, the culmination of Koo's "ice-breaking"
mission to the mainland before the photographers were led out of the
meeting hall of the Diaoyutai State Guest House.</P>

Koo, as Koo has previously met with Jiang on several occasions and as
the mainland respects Koo's contributions over the years to the
promotion of cross-strait relations, according to Tang.</P>
      <P>The meeting, Tang said, was not officially connected with Koo's

      <P>SEF had suggested that Control Yuan member Kang Ning-hsiang be

    <TEXT>
      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman
Koo Chen-fu told the media in Beijing on Sunday that mainland China's
democratization will be "the key to China's reunification."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with the mainland met the press after an
hour-and-a-half meeting with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin
at the Diaoyutai State Guest House.</P>
      <P>Koo said he expressed at the meeting his views on important
issues related to cross-strait relations, while Jiang voiced his
opinions as well.</P>
      <P>Koo said each side listened to the other with a "frank, sincere
and tolerant" attitude and that the talks were conducted in a
"friendly and free atmosphere."</P>
      <P>If both Taiwan and the mainland are on the road of
democratization, "China's reunification will not constitute a threat
to neighboring Asia-Pacific countries," Koo said.</P>
      <P>Koo said his delegation went to the mainland with goodwill to
witness the fruits of reforms enacted by the mainland over the past
two decades and to make the mainland aware of the results the
political and economic reforms Taiwan has carried out over the past
50 years.</P>
      <P>Koo said he explained to Jiang the process of Taiwan's
democratization and indicated the willingness of the Taiwan people to
share with the mainland their democratization experiences.</P>
      <P>During his talks in Shanghai with Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) Chairman Wang Daohan last week, Koo
invited Wang to visit Taiwan at an appropriate time. Wang accepted
the invitation.</P>
      <P>During his meeting with Koo, Jiang said Wang's Taiwan trip is
"feasible."</P>
      <P>Other members of Taiwan's visiting delegation present at the
Koo-Jiang meeting were Koo's wife, Shi Hwei-yow, Chang Jung-kung and
Tsan Chih-hung.</P>
      <P>Koo told the media that because Taiwan and the mainland have been
under separate rule for half a century, the two sides have different
views on vital issues. "We are not afraid of different opinions. We
want to continue making contacts. This is a conclusion reached
through the exchange of views," he said.</P>
      <P>Koo led a 12-member delegation to the mainland on Oct. 14 for
what he called an "ice-melting trip."</P>
      <P>Through his talks with Jiang and other Beijing officials in the
past few days, Koo has come to understand the importance of
"constructive dialogues" and the need for "continued and higher-level
dialogues," he said.</P>
      <P>Koo and his entourage will depart for Tokyo on Monday and will
return to Taipei Monday night.</P>

Chairman Koo Chen-fu's Beijing trip marked another peak with his
talks with mainland Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen and President
Jiang Zemin on Sunday.</P>
      <P>In his morning talks with Qian, the SEF chairman stressed that
the major obstacle to the improvement of cross-strait relations is
the mainland's policy of denying the existence of the Republic of
China on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Koo urged Beijing to acknowledge the historical fact that Taiwan
and the mainland have been under separate rule for 50 years. He
said Beijing should stop quelling Taiwan's international activities.
Otherwise, it will cause the Taiwan people's aversion and distrust
toward Beijing.</P>
      <P>Koo expressed the hope that both sides will be able to
participate in international affairs for the sake of world peace, and
to forgo zero-sum thinking as the first step to
terminate hostility.</P>
      <P>Qian reiterated Beijing's "one China" principle, and called on
Taiwan to engage in political negotiations and to realize direct
cross-strait trade, transport and communication links as soon as
possible.</P>
      <P>He said Koo's mainland trip carried some "positive significance"
because face-to-face talks could help dispel misunderstanding and
boost mutual understanding.</P>
      <P>In his talks with Jiang at the Diaoyutai State Guest House on
Sunday afternoon, Koo explained the process of Taiwan's
democratization and indicated the willingness of the Taiwan
people to share with the mainland their democratization
experiences.</P>
      <P>The top negotiator for Taiwan later told the media that the
mainland's democratization is the "key to China's reunification."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that if Taiwan and the mainland are on the road
of democratization, "China's reunification will not constitute a
threat to neighboring countries."</P>
      <P>The Koo-Jiang meeting was conducted in a "friendly and free
atmosphere," and each side listened to the other with a "frank,
sincere and tolerant" attitude.</P>
      <P>Almost all major important issues related to cross-strait
relations were taken up at the meeting.</P>
      <P>Koo also proposed cross-strait cooperation to help solve the
Asian financial crisis and suggested a meeting between ROC President
Lee Teng-hui and President Jiang at international conferences, such
as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.</P>
      <P>Koo led a 12-member delegation to Shanghai from Taipei on Oct.
14 to start what he called "ice-melting trip."</P>
      <P>After two rounds of talks in Shanghai between Koo and Chairman
Wang Daohan of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS) on Oct. 14-15, a four-point consensus was reached.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, the SEF and ARATS will engage in
dialogues, step up bilateral exchanges of visit and strengthen
mutual assistance for the solution of incidents. Wang also accepted
Koo's invitation to visit Taiwan at an appropriate time.</P>
      <P>Koo said on Sunday that his mission came to the mainland with

      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman
Koo Chen-fu's mainland China trip marks a breakthrough in
Taiwan-mainland China relations, which have been at an impasse for
more than three years, a Kuomintang official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, director-general of the Kuomintang's Mainland
Research Department, said the visit is a breakthrough in cross-strait
relations, coming at a time when regular and systematic dialogue
between the two government-backed intermediary bodies on the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait remains stalled.</P>
      <P>Chang, who accompanied Koo to the mainland, is also a researcher
with Taiwan's National Unification Council.</P>
      <P>Like a meeting five years ago in Singapore between Koo and Wang
Daohan, chairman of Beijing's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS), Koo's current mainland visit is breakthrough
in cross-strait relations, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang, who was present at a meeting between Koo and mainland
Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Sunday, said three things have
become clear as a result of Koo's visit.</P>
      <P>First, Koo's visit represents a breakthrough in relations, even
though the two sides of the strait have never formally ended
hostilities and there has been no regular dialogue between SEF and
ARATS, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Over the past five days, Koo, who is Taiwan's top negotiator with
the mainland and a senior adviser to ROC President Lee Teng-hui, has
met with Jiang; mainland Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen; Chen
Yunlin, a top mainland Chinese official in charge of Taiwan affairs;
and ARATS' Wang.</P>
      <P>Second, the visit has marked the emergence of a constructive
cross-strait dialogue. Taipei took the initiative, pushing for Koo's
mainland visit as early as one year ago. Despite the fact that it
took 11 months for the visit to be realized, Koo has met with key
mainland leaders and has talked with them in an atmosphere that Koo
has described as "friendly and free," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Despite a lack of agreement in the Koo-Jiang meeting, both sides
have fully expressed their respective positions, which is conducive
to further understanding between the two sides, Chang said. This
development is in line with a call made by ROC President Lee in his
National Day speech on Oct. 10 for constructive cross-strait
dialogue, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Third, Taiwan, which is widely known as a full-fledged democracy,
is awaiting the democratization of the mainland. "The mainland's
democratization is the key to China's reunification, and only by
accelerating their steps will conciliation between the two sides be
possible," he noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATURE ASKS SIEW TO REPORT ON KOO'S MAINLAND VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan decided on Monday to
invite Premier Vincent Siew to report on Friday on a just-concluded
landmark visit to mainland China by Taiwan's top negotiator with
Beijing, C. F. Koo.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Chang King-yuh, the
Cabinet's chief mainland policy planner, and Chairman Koo of the
quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) are also expected
to field questions at Friday's legislative session about Koo's
meetings with senior mainland leaders during his Oct. 14-19
"ice-melting" visit.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucuses of the three major domestic political
parties gave different evaluations to the performance of the
12-member Koo delegation during its Shanghai-Beijing visit aimed at
thawing a more-than-three-year hostile freeze in relations across
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Wang Ling-lin, the ruling Kuomintang's legislative whip, said
Koo and his entourage managed to clearly express the Republic of
China's basic stance on many critical issues.</P>
      <P>"We are satisfied with the delegation's performance. We
believe the visit will help Beijing better understand Taiwan's basic
stance," Wang said.</P>
      <P>New Party whip Chen Yi-hsin criticized senior mainland leaders'
stiff, tough attitude in discussing some sensitive political issues
with Taiwan negotiators.</P>
      <P>"Beijing's high-handed attitude would only hinder cultivation of
mutual trust for further engagement," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chou Po-lun, head of the legislative caucus of the main
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said it was
regrettable that issues related to the protection of personal
safety, property and legitimate rights of Taiwan investors and
tourists in mainland China had not been discussed during Koo's
visit.</P>
      <P>Chou cautioned local people not to hold overly optimistic
expectations of future development of cross-strait relations after
Koo's mainland trip.</P>
      <P>"China remains a risky place for Taiwan investors. Local
business people should not lightly launch new ventures there to
avoid possible financial losses," Chou said.</P>
      <P>The legislative whip of the pro-independence party also blasted
the ruling party for failing to recruit any DPP member in Koo's
entourage.</P>
      <P>Chou said mainland China's President Jiang Zemin met Koo in his
capacity as the Chinese Communist Party's general secretary. "As Koo
is a member of the KMT's decision-making Central Standing Committee,
Sunday's Koo-Jiang talks appeared to be a party-to-party meeting," he
said, adding that such arrangements were very inappropriate.</P>
      <P>"The two sides of the Taiwan Strait should conduct
government-to-government dialogue, not party-to-party
(KMT-to-communist party) talks," he insisted, adding that the DPP
will ask Premier Siew on Friday to explain why Chang Jung-kung,
director of the KMT's mainland research department was included in
the Koo's entourage while no DPP representative was
included.</P>

    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Oct.  19  (CNA)
(By CNA reporters and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's top negotiator
with mainland China, Koo Chen-fu, left Beijing Monday for home via
Tokyo after a six-day, landmark visit to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Koo, chairman of Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), said
he went to the mainland with Taiwan's "goodwill" and was returning
with the mainland's "friendship."</P>
      <P>He has called his mainland visit an ice-melting, as opposed to an
ice-breaking, one, as whatever ice may have existed was broken during
Koo's earlier meeting with Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) Chairman Wang Daohan in Singapore in 1993.</P>
      <P>Koo, 81, accompanied by his wife, their two adult children and
SEF officials, departed from Beijing International Airport at 10:30
a.m. for Tokyo, where they will transit for about four hours before
heading for Taipei at around 6:30 p.m.</P>
      <P>Koo will meet with members of the Chinese, Japanese and Western
media while in Tokyo to explain the purpose of the group's visit to
the mainland and the ROC's position on cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Along with senior SEF officials, including SEF Vice Chairman Shi
Hwei-yow, Koo will proceed to the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council immediately after arriving in Taipei to report on the visit.</P>
      <P>A successful business tycoon, Koo is Taiwan's veteran
ambassador-at-large, having represented President Lee Teng-hui at
leadership meetings held within the framework of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in the past three years.</P>
      <P>During his visit in Beijing, Koo met with mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin at the Diaoyutai State Guest House on Sunday
for a talk that lasted for an hour and a half.</P>
      <P>According to Koo, he indicated during the meeting with Jiang
Taiwan's willingness to share with the mainland its democratization
experiences. He also proposed cross-strait cooperation to help solve
the Asian economic crisis, and suggested a meeting between President
Lee and President Jiang at an international conference, such as an
APEC summit meeting.</P>
      <P>In Beijing, Koo also met with mainland Chinese Vice Premier Qian
Qichen and Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of
mainland China's State Council for talks on issues of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Shanghai on Oct. 14 and 15, Koo met three
times with his mainland counterpart, ARATS' Wang. They reached a
four-point consensus on cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, SEF and ARATS will resume their long-stalled
dialogue, accelerate bilateral exchanges and visits, and work to
ensure the safety of people from one side of the strait while
visiting or living on the other. Wang also accepted an invitation by
Koo to visit Taiwan at an appropriate time.</P>
      <P>In addition to meeting mainland Chinese officials for talks, Koo,
who has lived in both Shanghai and Beijing, also toured scenic,
historical and economic establishments in the two major Chinese
cities.</P>

(By Timothy Sun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>To help minimize the adverse effects of
typhoons in the Philippines, the United Nations (UN) has offered to
enhance the Estrada administration's weather forecasting capabilities
with the use of its hi-tech satellite system.</P>
      <P>Secretary Orlando Mercado of the Department of National Defense
(DND) said the United Nations plans to hook up its satellite system
with that of the National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC),
enabling the government to better track the paths of future storms.</P>
      <P>The United Nations is providing the service free of charge, said
Mercado, who is also chairman of the NDCC.</P>
      <P>"They want to help because a similar initiative in China was able
to minimize the number of casualties with the use of satellite
forecasting," Mercado said in a recent radio interview.</P>
      <P>Mercado was referring to the abnormal swelling of the Yangtze
River in mainland China last August, which killed some 2,000 people.</P>
      <P>The UN proposal would be a great help to the government's
disaster-relief operations, considering that the recent La

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  19  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fresh from his victory in federal
elections Oct. 3, Prime Minister John Howard reshuffled his Cabinet,
introducing six new faces and dumping three ministers in a bid to
focus his administration on jobs, rural and regional services,
reconciliation with the country's Aborigines and the Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>In a press conference on Sunday night, Howard described the
changes as a significant renewal of the federal government to "take
on the challenges of a new term and a new century."</P>
      <P>Tim Fischer remains unchanged as deputy prime minister and trade
minister. Other ministers retaining their positions are Foreign
Minister Alexander Downer and Treasurer Peter Costello.</P>
      <P>Two of the new faces are Defence Minister John Moore, who took
over from the retiring Ian Machlahlan, and Industry, Science and
Resources Minister Nick Minchin, who is replacing Warwik Parer, who
resigned. Meanwhile, Andrew Thompson has been replaced as sports
minister by Jackie Kelly.</P>
      <P>Howard won a second three-year term in the Oct. 3 election, in
which the coalition government comprising Howard's Liberal Party and
the National Party managed to fend off a challenge by the Labor
Party. The coalition's majority in Australia's House of
Representatives, however, dropped from 41 seats to 15.</P>
      <P>There are now 65 Liberal members of parliament (MPs) and 16
National MPs, compared with 66 Labor MPs and one independent in the
148-seat House of Representatives.</P>
      <P>Political analysts said Howard has reshaped his Cabinet with one
main aim and one main constraint. The aim is to win the next
election. But he faces the challenge of figuring out how to win back
the one million votes lost to the One Nation Party during the Oct. 3
election.</P>
      <P>The Howard government will also face opposition from other
parties in getting passed his tax reform package, especially a
proposed 10 percent goods and services tax, by the Senate later this

      <P>European institutional investors believe
Australia is losing its status as a "safe haven," according to a new

      <P>The report by EuroScan 98 has found that European institutional
investors with a combined investment total of US$15 billion in
Australia no longer consider the country a safe haven for investment.</P>
      <P>The proportion of respondents who expressed a willingness to

    <TEXT>
      <P>Giant snails the size of a man's fist are
a threat to Australia, as they are likely to invade the country and
devastate the environment and the nation's rice industry, according
to Australian scientists.</P>
      <P>They said the golden apple snail, which varies in size from that
of a golf ball to a tennis ball, could pose a threat to Australia as
great as those of cane toads or carp.</P>
      <P>Golden apple snails are the world's largest freshwater snails and
many Australians regard them as a popular aquarium pet, according to
the scientists working with the Commonwealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO).</P>
      <P>They said the golden apple species, native to South America, has
proved to be highly adaptable, devouring everything from fish tank
algae to rice to taro roots. The snails have done as much as US$1.2
billion worth of damage to rice crops in the Philippines.</P>
      <P>Geoff Baker, one of the snail experts at the CSIRO, said golden
apple snails are a voracious, uncontrollable pest that have arrived
at Australia's northern doorstep and can enter the country at any
time.</P>
      <P>The snails are now present in parts of Papua New Guinea,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, mainland China, Vietnam, Laos,
Cambodia and Japan.</P>
      <P>Golden apple snails were imported from South America as "Asian
escargot," but proved an unpopular dish. The snails ultimately
escaped into rice fields, Baker said.</P>
      <P>"If it is established in Australia ... it has the potential to
spread across the continent, invading and ravaging our native river
systems and the A$500 million (US$312 million) rice export industry,"

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND TO OVERTAKE US GDP BY 2015: OECD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Oct. 19 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is likely to overtake the
United States as the world's largest economy in about 15 years,
according to a new study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD).</P>
      <P>In 2015, mainland China's gross domestic product (GDP) will reach
US$9.41 trillion, surpassing the US$9.34 trillion GDP of the United
States. By then, the mainland will regain its historical position as
the world's largest economy, projects the OECD study.</P>
      <P>Using OECD quantitative measurement techniques never before
applied to the mainland and "rather conservative forecasts" of 5.5
percent annual GDP and 4.5 percent per capita growth, "China would
probably reach US levels of total GDP by 2015," accounting for about
17 percent of world's GDP, said the study.</P>
      <P>The projected 4.5 percent capita growth, the study stresses, is
conservative in that it was the average growth rate achieved by Hong

    <HEADLINE>US WILL DISCUSS TAIWAN'S PARTICIPATION IN KEDO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There are signs that the United States
is not ruling out Taiwan's participation in an international project
to build two nuclear reactors for North Korea, sources indicated.</P>
      <P>The Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) was
launched in 1995 by the United States, Japan and South Korea in a bid
to halt future possible development of nuclear programs by Pyongyang.</P>
      <P>Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's top negotiator with the mainland, said
Taiwan is interested in joining KEDO during his meeting with mainland
Vice Premier Qian Qichen on Sunday in Beijing. Koo also said he hoped
Beijing would not obstruct Taiwan's efforts to join the organization.</P>
      <P>In recent testimony before the US Congress, US special envoy to
the Korean Peninsula Charles Kartman said the United States would
discuss the possibility of Taiwan helping to finance KEDO. He added
that he wanted to continue discussing the issue.</P>
      <P>Kartman was responding to questions by Benjamin Gilman, chairman
of the House Committee on International Relations, on whether Taiwan
will contribute to KEDO.</P>
      <P>Kartman said KEDO is facing financial problems. The economic
turmoil that has swept through Asia since mid-1997 has also depleted
potential financial sources.</P>
      <P>Japan suspended its promised US$1 billion to the project after
North Korea fired what was believed to be test missiles over Japan in
late August. But the United States and South Korea persuaded Japanese
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi to resume contributing to the
organization.</P>
      <P>Outsiders have known very little about the discussions in the US
about Taiwan's possible financing of KEDO. Observers are intrigued
that Koo would sound out the mainland's reaction to such a
possibility in his meeting with Qian. Koo's remarks in the meeting
were made public by his aide, Shi Hwei-yow.</P>
      <P>The United States has stated that it would not support Taiwan's
bid to join international organizations in which statehood is a
requirement. While KEDO's ultimate purpose is political, it has been
a three-party organization concerned with economic activities -- the
building of nuclear reactors as its main task.</P>
      <P>Although a nod from the United States could almost translate into
the participation of Taiwan in KEDO, Washington must take into
account Beijing's reaction as it holds sway in the four-way talks on
the two Koreas.</P>
      <P>KEDO was established with the goal of building two light-water
nuclear reactors for North Korea by 2003 in exchange of North Korea's
promise to scrap its nuclear development program. It has been
estimated that the project will cost US$4.6 billion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHANCES FOR LEE-JIANG MEETING AT APEC SUMMIT ARE SLIM: OFFICIALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite a thaw in relations across the
Taiwan Strait, the top leaders from both sides are not expected to
meet any time soon, not to mention at an upcoming regional summit
meeting, a senior official said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said although
both ROC President Lee Teng-hui and mainland Chinese President Jiang
Zemin have expressed a desire to meet each other, the prospects for
such a meeting remain unclear.</P>
      <P>During a meeting with Jiang in Beijing on Sunday, Taiwan's top
negotiator with mainland China C. F. Koo proposed that the two
leaders meet at the 1998 informal leadership meeting of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum scheduled for
mid-November in Malaysia. Jiang, however, didn't make any response to
the proposal.</P>
      <P>Judging from Beijing's consistent tough policy toward
Taiwan, the official said, a Lee-Jiang encounter in an international
setting like the annual APEC summit meeting is not likely in the
near future.</P>
      <P>Both Taiwan and mainland China are APEC members. Because of
Beijing's opposition, President Lee has been barred from attending
the annual APEC informal leadership meeting.</P>
      <P>In the past three years, Lee consistently appointed Koo to
represent him at the annual APEC summit meeting. The official
predicted that the president may continue to name Koo, chairman of
the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) to attend the
upcoming APEC meeting in Kuala Lumpur on his behalf.</P>
      <P>As for the possibility of Lee and Jiang exchanging visits, the
official said the proposal has not yet entered a planning stage.</P>
      <P>"The prospects for a Lee-Jiang meeting will not become clear
until after Wang Daohan, top mainland negotiator with Taipei, visits
Taiwan some time next year," the official said.</P>
      <P>Wang, an 82-year-old ex-mayor of Shanghai and mentor to mainland
President Jiang, has accepted an invitation from Koo to visit Taiwan
at an appropriate time.</P>
      <P>Koo originally hoped that Wang, chairman of the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS) would visit Taiwan in the run-up to the island's
Dec. 5 elections for the Legislative Yuan and the mayors and city
councils of Taipei and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>"As mainland authorities have been reluctant to recognize
Taiwan's achievements in democratization, Wang is not expected to
visit the island until the first half of next year," the official
said.</P>
      <P>Before Wang's visit, ARATS Executive Vice Chairman Tang Shubei
is expected to come to Taiwan to set the stage for Wang's arrival.
"Tang may visit the island early next year to discuss technical
details concerning Wang's visit," the official said.</P>
      <P>Tang visited Taipei for the first time in May 1995 to arrange
for a planned second Koo-Wang meeting. Although the two sides
managed to reach consensus on several key points, Beijing
unilaterally suspended the proposed Koo-Wang meeting in anger at
Taiwan's efforts to break out of diplomatic isolation.</P>
      <P>Koo's just-concluded mainland visit marked the first high-level
cross-strait contact in more than three years. Even though the two
sides still failed to bridge their wide differences, Koo's Oct. 14-19
visit marked a new beginning in cross-strait engagement after a long
impasse.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT LAWMAKERS HAIL TOP ENVOY'S PERFORMANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  19  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang legislators on Monday hailed
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Koo Chen-fu for his
efforts as he winds down his ice-breaking mainland China tour.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Chen Hung-chi said the six-day trip was successful
because Koo had firmly conveyed Taiwan's position in meetings with
top Chinese leaders.</P>
      <P>Koo met with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Vice
Premier Qian Qichen on Sunday in separate meetings.</P>
      <P>The atmosphere during the Koo-Jiang meeting was cordial, with the
two sides falling short of discussing any concrete issues such the
"one China" dispute. However, in Koo's earlier meeting with Qian, the
mainland vice premier reiterated that Beijing is the sole legitimate
Chinese government representing the whole of China, while Koo
criticized Beijing's attempts to isolate Taiwan in the international
community.</P>
      <P>Judging from Qian's remarks, Chen said it was obvious the
mainland is continuing with its hard line toward Taiwan. Chen said
Taiwan should take a "business as usual" attitude in face of such a
situation as the long-running stalemate in cross-strait relations
cannot be resolved in the short term.</P>
      <P>As long as Taiwan and the mainland continue exchanges and contact
by forswearing their prejudices and differences, the two sides are
likely to find a common ground between them, he said.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Cheng-tse said it was nothing new that Beijing has
maintained its traditional hard line toward Taiwan because there have
always been hard liners in the Communist Party favoring such a
strategy to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan and mainland China have been separated for nearly half
a century, it is normal that there are misunderstandings between both
sides, Lin noted. Because of this, it would take time for the
relationship to be mended, adding that Koo's historical trip
represents a breakthrough in bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>"I am personally optimistic about the future development of
cross-strait ties," he said.</P>
      <P>Both Chen and Lin contended that Taiwan cannot give way to
pressure from Beijing even in the face of a hardline policy. Taiwan
should continue to improve its relations with the mainland while
promoting substantive ties with other foreign countries, they said.</P>
      <P>"Don't expect your rival to be kind to you. A country must count
on the support of its people to be able to protect them," Lin
stressed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The New Party's candidate for Taipei mayor
on Monday hailed the performance of Taiwan's top negotiator with
mainland China, saying the meetings with mainland leaders have helped
ease tension between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Wang Chien-shien said he approved of Koo Chen-Fu's performance as
the chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation's historical meeting
with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Beijing on Sunday was
conducted in a cordial atmosphere. Koo also met mainland Chinese Vice
President Qian Qichen earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>As the two sides have shown they are able of maintaining a
cordial climate and have agreed on future exchanges, Koo's trip to
the mainland can be considered a success, Wang said. The New Party
candidate also called on the public to not judge the SEF delegation's
performance too harshly.</P>
      <P>However, Wang warned that it is too early to predict any change
in cross-strait ties, stressing that the most important thing for
Taiwan to do is observe subsequent developments.</P>
      <P>The pro-unification party heavyweight said the New Party favors
maintaining the current status quo under the "unification" framework,
but it does not support imminent unification with mainland China. He
urged the public not to misunderstand the New Party's stance on the
issue.</P>
      <P>Wang said he would be willing to debate the issue with mayoral
contenders from the other political parties as the topic is of
paramount importance to Taiwan's future.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan food producers are eyeing the
European market where only fine or gourmet foreign foods have
succeeded.</P>
      <P>A total of 18 leading food companies from Taiwan began their
promotional drive in the International Fair of Food in Paris on
Sunday with displays of their high-end food products which include
confectionary, tea, green algae, ready-to-serve food, frozen seafood
and frozen vegetables.</P>
      <P>Taiwan food products have stolen part of the show in the first
day of the largest food exposition in Europe. More than 40 European
food companies and importers have registered to attend a Taiwanese
food workshop scheduled at the fair on Wednesday, said the China
External Trade Development Council (CETRA), which organized the
Taiwan food makers and exporters delegation to Paris.</P>
      <P>The Food Processing Industrial Association of France hosted a
lunch in honor of the Taiwan delegation on Sunday. During the
gathering, food processing manufacturers and exporters from both
sides reached a consensus on promoting technology cooperation and
exhibition exchanges, according to CETRA officials.</P>
      <P>The International Fair of Food in Paris takes place once every

companies from 88 countries and areas, and is expected to attract

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  19  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Amid some criticism, the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on Monday expressed generally
positive statements about the first top-level contact between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait in three years.</P>
      <P>Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation, wrapped
up a six-day tour to the mainland in which he met with high-level
officials such as Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier Qian
Qichen.</P>
      <P>Yen Wan-chin, director of DPP's Department of Chinese Affairs,
said Koo's trip has helped re-establish cross-strait exchanges. He
said that such exchanges are a positive development for the
international community and for both sides of the strait, adding that
it is also in line with the DPP's policy of multi-directional
cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>Yen said it was a good thing that the Koo delegation, in its
meetings with the mainland officials, highlighted cross-strait
differences.</P>
      <P>The thinking and stance on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are
different, and the meetings were a chance to let the other side
understand the differences, which would be helpful to future
dialogue, Yen said.</P>
      <P>Yen was most positive about Koo's meeting with Jiang in Beijing
on Sunday, during which Koo spent much time discussing the democratic
progress in Taiwan. Koo stressed that if the mainland wants to
further develop, it has to bravely chose the road to democracy.</P>
      <P>If both sides all tread the road of democracy, a unified China
will not pose a threat to Asian neighboring countries, Koo told Jiang
in the meeting which capped his ice-breaking mission to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Yen also said Koo's trip has let the other side of the Taiwan
Strait know that Taiwan has excelled in its democratization and
international cooperation.</P>
      <P>However, Yen criticized Koo's trip as unsatisfactory because Koo
has set "a China under separate rule" as the basic tone of talks,
which he believed could mislead the world to think that Taiwan is
supporting Beijing's "one China" concept.</P>
      <P>The DPP has repeatedly said that both sides of the Taiwan Strait
should be independent of each other, that democratic progress will
replace unification progress, and supported the use of international
cooperation to break away from the diplomatic blockade imposed by
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Koo, at the invitation of his mainland counterpart Wang Daohan,
visited Shanghai and Beijing from Oct. 14-19. Koo and his delegation
returned home via Japan on Monday night.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
Chairman Koo Chen-fu's mainland China trip has raised the curtain for
cross-strait political talks, a Chinese political observer said in
Hong Kong on Monday.</P>
      <P>Huang Wenfang, former director of the Taiwan affairs department
under the Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong bureau, made the comment in
an interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>He said although Koo and Chairman Wang Daohan of Beijing's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) indicated
their different views on the "one China" issue, both sides achieved
better than expected results.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan, Huang said, Koo's mainland trip virtually revived the
channels for cross-strait communications that had been suspended for
three years. Beijing, meanwhile, got to engage in political talks
with Taipei in the Koo-Wang meeting.</P>
      <P>Huang said the difference over the "one China" issue emerged
again during Koo's talks with mainland Vice Premier Qian Qichen on
Sunday. He said political differences between the two sides can not
be narrowed in a short time, and the best way for this to be achieved
is to let history solve the differences.</P>
      <P>The political observer said the Koo-Wang talks clearly
indicated that Taiwan and the mainland had sincerity to hold
political discussions. But he said that the two sides have not yet
removed their hostilities and there is still a lack of mutual trust.</P>
      <P>Huang said Beijing holds the key to the improvement of
cross-strait relations, and better understanding toward Taiwan by
Beijing can help the promotion of bilateral relations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A rally on major Asian stock exchanges
on Friday has attracted the attention of US and European investors to
the region, The Business Times reported.</P>
      <P>While the 8 percent surge has made fund managers take notice
after months of slides, few are ready to jump back in and load up on
Asian equities in a big way.</P>
      <P>European-based fund managers, fearing that the surge reflects a
"dangerous" rally in a global bear market, are particularly cautious
and prefer to sit on cash for now.</P>
      <P>However, some US funds have pointed out that the recent heavy
fund redemptions have created pools of liquidity which are just
waiting for the dust to settle before they move back in, the report
said.</P>
      <P>"Friday's gains, along with the signing into law of Japan's bank
rescue bill should give measure of confidence that Asia is finally
working its way through its problems," said Albert Golding,
international investment strategist at Worthington Management in the
US.</P>
      <P>"People are slowly starting to show an interest in putting money
into these markets again," he said.</P>
      <P>Still, many traders said Friday's rally did not signal that
foreign investors were returning to the region. Instead, they
attributed the bulk of the buying to local retail investors.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEHMAN PUTS REGIONAL BANKS' PROBLEM LOANS AT US$1.2T</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct.  19  (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Problem loans in Asian banks has been
estimated at over US$1.2 trillion, not including banks in mainland
China and India, The Business Times cited a Lehman Brothers report as
saying.</P>
      <P>While Japan accounts for the lion's share of the bad or doubtful
banking debts at US$1.1 trillion, the percentage of problem loans to
total loans is vastly higher in Association for Southeast Asian
Nations countries and the burden of recapitalizing banking systems
there will be far greater relative to the size of the economies
concerned than in Japan, the report said.</P>
      <P>Lehman Brothers analysts said Asian governments will need to play
a major role to help meet the cost of what is estimated to be a
US$386 billion bill for recapitalizing regional banking systems. Even
then, the problem of tackling a huge burden of corporate debt outside
the local banking system, in Indonesia and elsewhere, remains to be
tackled.</P>
      <P>The 60 trillion yen banking rescue package passed last week by
Japan's Parliament allows 25 trillion yen or US$212 billion for
recapitalizing banks, but the Lehman report suggests that Japanese
banks will require US$386 billion for recapitalization purposes.</P>
      <P>Other analysts suggest at least US$300 billion and the
implication is that either the government will have to provide more
funds or the banks will continue laboring under bad debt for some
time.</P>
      <P>For Asia, the outlook is far more bleak, the report suggests.
While Japan's official bank recapitalization package amounts to
around 5 percent of GDP (or 12 percent if the cost of rescuing failed
banks is included) the cost of recapitalizing banks in Indonesia and
in Thailand will amount to a massive 31 percent of GDP in both cases.
In South Korea, the preemption will be 19 percent of GDP and in
Malaysia 17 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN REFUTES QIAN'S REMARKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Government spokesman Chen Chien-jen on
Monday refuted Beijing's claim that Taiwan's linking of national
unification to mainland China's democratization is unrealistic.</P>
      <P>Noting that economic liberalization, political democratization
and market globalization are three prevailing international trends,
Chen said mainland China should take concrete steps to improve
bilateral relations and pave the way for eventual unification of the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait under freedom and democracy.</P>
      <P>Chen also rebutted mainland Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen's
allegation that Taiwan's suffering of diplomatic setbacks is an
"international trend."</P>
      <P>In the post-Cold War era, Chen said, the general world trends
are characterized by freedom, democracy, detente, reconciliation
and peace.</P>
      <P>"The hostile diplomatic suppression and strangulation strategy
adopted by Beijing against Taiwan is by no means a historical trend,"
Chen stressed, adding that Beijing's continued diplomatic offensive
against Taiwan will only hinder the development of cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say that the Republic of China government
basically recognizes the just-concluded mainland visit by its top
negotiator with Beijing C. F. Koo as a "new beginning" for
long-stalled cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>"Koo's Oct. 14-19 mainland visit has helped open a door for the
resumption of cross-strait dialogue broken off by Beijing more than
three years ago," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen said, more concrete actions other than
dialogue should be done in bridging wide differences and forging
cross-strait rapprochement.</P>
      <P>"Deeds speak louder than words. We hope Beijing will take
positive steps to show its sincerity to improve cross-strait
relations in the wake of Koo's 'ice-melting' mainland visit," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>The career-diplomat-turned-spokesman further said pointed
rhetoric voiced by mainland negotiators concerning the ROC's
status during Koo's visit betrayed Beijing's persistent hostility
toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Beijing's denial of the ROC's existence is a principal obstacle
to the development of bilateral ties," Chen said, adding that the
ROC, as an independent sovereign state, must safeguard its national
identity, dignity and safety.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the ROC has become a full-fledged democracy, Chen
said Beijing cannot force Taiwan to accept its "one China"
definition. "Our country's future can be decided only by our

    <HEADLINE>KMT SUBMITS CANDIDATE LISTS FOR LEGISLATIVE ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 19 (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After a six-hour meeting, the Kuomintang's
screening committee on Monday approved the name lists for candidates
vying for Legislative Yuan seats reserved for national constituencies
and overseas Chinese communities.</P>
      <P>Both name lists will be submitted to the ruling party's Central
Standing Committee meeting to be held on Tuesday for approval.</P>
      <P>For the legislative election, the single nontransferable vote
(SNTV) will be employed. Normally, several representatives are
elected from a single constituency which is demarcated essentially on
the existing administrative boundaries. In a given constituency, each
voter casts only one vote and several of the leading candidates are
selected.</P>
      <P>Since the Legislative Yuan election in 1992, a certain number of
seats have been reserved for a national constituency and overseas
Chinese communities. These seats are allocated by proportional
representation.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan voters do not vote directly for candidates on the
party lists. They instead vote in SNTV districts, and the votes
obtained by the candidates are aggregated nationally according to
party affiliation.</P>
      <P>The seats for the national constituency and overseas Chinese
communities are then distributed proportionally among the parties
which capture at least 5 percent of total valid votes nationwide. At
present, 22 percent of the seats in the Legislative Yuan are filled
this way.</P>
      <P>The quota for the year-end legislature election for national
constituency is 41. The KMT estimated that it should be able to
capture more than 50 percent of total valid votes nationwide and win
22 to 24 of the 41 seats.</P>
      <P>A total of 155 KMT members had applied to be listed. Of the
total, 40 were approved by the screening committee. They include:</P>
      <P>Yao Eng-chi, Chen Chien-chih, Kao Yu-jen, Hung Chao-nan, Lee
Min-kao, Chen Chung-tsan, Cheng Feng-shih, Hung Hsiu-chu, Wong
Chung-chun, Lin Kuo-lung, Wang Ling-lin, Tseng Chen-nung, Chen
Chieh-ju, Yang Chi-hsiung, Chin, Tseng Chen-li, Chou Cheng-chih, Yu
Huai-yin, Hsu Su-yeh, Liu Kwang-hua, Lee Cheng-chung, Tsai Lin-li,
Liao Feng-teh, Lee Chuan-chiau, Yao Kao-chiau, Hung Jui-chih, Su
Huo-teng, Chen Seng-suen, and Cheng Mei-lan.</P>
      <P>A total of 16 incumbent KMT legislators are on the list, while
other incumbents, such as Ke Yu-chin and Tsai Pi-huang, are
excluded.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ruling party estimated it will win five seats
reserved for overseas Chinese communities and recommended eight
candidates out of a total of 70 contenders.</P>
      <P>They are: Hung Tu from San Francisco, Fan Yang-sheng from New
York, Yang Chuo-chou from Japan, Kuan Wo-nuan from New Orleans, Wu
Sung-po from South Africa, Huang Lin-chih from Germany, Shueh
Sheng-hua from Canada, and Sun Kuo-hua from San Francisco.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>His Majesty King Mswati III of the Kingdom
of Swaziland is scheduled to visit the Republic of China from Oct. 22
to 27, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) press release said on
Monday.</P>
      <P>Swaziland has been actively enhancing its relations with Asian
countries in recent years, it said. King Mswati III will visit
Malaysia and Japan before arriving in the ROC.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Taiwan, His Majesty will exchange views with
President Lee Teng-hui on current international affairs and matters
of common concern to the ROC and Swaziland. His Majesty will also
meet ROC government officials and visit cultural and economic
facilities.</P>
      <P>The ROC has had a close and friendly relationship with Swaziland,
said the MOFA, adding that in September, President Lee sent Ding
Mou-shih, secretary general of the National Security Council, as his
special envoy to attend the celebrations marking the 30th anniversary
of independence of the Kingdom of Swaziland and the 30th birthday of
His Majesty the King.</P>
      <P>At 1998's UN general assembly session, Swaziland again spoke in
support of the ROC's bid to join the UN and other international
organizations.</P>
      <P>This year is also the 30th anniversary of the establishment of
diplomatic ties between the ROC and the Kingdom of Swaziland. His
Majesty Ming Mswati III's visit at this time therefore carries great
significance.</P>
      <P>King Mswati III's delegation to the ROC will include Albert H.
Shabangu, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Absalom M. Dlamini,
Minister of Economic Planning &amp; Development; Dr. Sishayi S. Nxumalo,

    <HEADLINE>ROC FOREIGN MINISTER REBUTS BEIJING'S CLAIM OF NON-INTERFERENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 19 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Foreign Minister Jason Hu
on Monday rebutted mainland Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen's claim
that Beijing has not tried to suppress the ROC in the international
arena.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister also said that if the Beijing authorities do
not stop circulating rumors, Taipei "will consider revealing the
facts."</P>
      <P>Hu was responding to remarks made by Qian on Sunday to Chairman
Koo Chen-fu of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) that "Taiwan
always says its international space is suppressed. In fact, it is an
unavoidable result of the development of an impartial situation."</P>
      <P>Hu revealed to the media that the ROC Foreign Ministry has asked
Beijing to explain several issues, including the "three empties"
policy (referring to a Beijing plot to lure away all the ROC's allies
by the turn of the century).</P>
      <P>He said he was hoping for a "friendly response" from Beijing, but
added that his ministry was still awaiting an answer.</P>
      <P>Hu said that the purpose of seeking the explanation from Beijing
is to let the international community see that Beijing is
inconsistent in words and actions, and has been playing a
"double-faced" strategy against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Questioned on the proposed ROC participation in the Korean
Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO), Hu said that some
foreign countries have expressed the hope that Taiwan will be able to
make some contribution.</P>
      <P>He said that joining KEDO would be consistent with ROC government
policy, and would be good for all the countries of the region.
However, he added that the matter is still in the planning stages,
and that no concrete proposal has been worked out.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) on Monday acknowledged the achievements of Taiwan's top
negotiator with Beijing C. F. Koo during his just-concluded visit to
mainland China.</P>
      <P>The council, however, expressed regret over Beijing's refusal to
bravely face up to the reality that the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait are separately ruled by two equal governments.</P>
      <P>"Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Koo's Oct.
14-19 mainland visit has been fruitful," MAC Vice Chairman Sheu
Ke-sheng said, adding that the visit has allowed for a
resumption of high-level face-to-face communications to avoid the
misunderstandings that can easily arise from the dissemination of
second-hand information.</P>
      <P>In addition, Sheu said, Koo has managed to reach a four-point
consensus with his mainland counterpart, Wang Daohan, on the
promotion of exchanges between the two government-backed
intermediary bodies they head.</P>
      <P>According to the four-point deal sealed in Shanghai on Oct. 15,
Chairman Wang of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) agreed to visit Taiwan at an appropriate
time.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS have also agreed to step up consultations on
a range of issues of mutual concern, increase exchanges at various
levels and reinforce assistance in handling incidents involving
personal safety and property of Taiwan visitors to the mainland, and
vice versa.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are semi-official organizations authorized by
their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in the
absence of official channels. SEF is under MAC's supervision.</P>
      <P>"General speaking, Koo has accomplished the goals set forth by
our government concerning his landmark mainland visit," Sheu said,
adding that the government has expected Koo to push for a resumption
of regular and systematic SEF-ARATS dialogue, foster an amiable
atmosphere and improve cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Sheu went on to say that even though the two sides still failed
to bridge their wide differences over some critical political issues,
Koo's visit has helped forge a foundation for constructive
bilateral dialogue in the future.</P>
      <P>"We hope systematic dialogue channels between SEF and ARATS
set forth in the agreements signed during the first Koo-Wang
meeting in Singapore in April 1993 will gradually resume normal
operations to facilitate further upgrading and improvement of
cross-strait ties for mutual benefits," Sheu added.</P>
      <P>The senior mainland policy planner also reiterated that the ROC
has been an independent sovereign state since 1912. "The ROC has
continued to exist even after its seat moved to Taiwan in 1949. This
is a historical fact that nobody can deny. We hope mainland China
will pragmatically face up to this cold reality and recognize the
state of separate rule on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to pave
the way for closer cross-strait relations and cooperation," Sheu
urged.</P>

    <DATELINE>Bangkok,  Oct.  19 (CNA)
(By Kuo Fang-chih)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A trip to mainland China by a top Taiwan
negotiator indicated that mainland President Jiang Zemin's position
in power is not stable, a Bangkok-based English daily said.</P>
      <P>Koo Chen-fu, chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation,
concluded his much-anticipated trip on Monday. Koo's trip must not be
overplayed because there are still major constraints inside China.
One of them is the position of President Jiang, The Nation said</P>
      <P>Jiang can not appear to be too soft on Taiwan, even though he has
become more flexible as he continues to further consolidate his
leadership and power in the party and the powerful People's
Liberation Army. That helps explain the current radical shift in
China's policy, said Kavi Chongkittavorn, executive editor-in-chief
of The Nation.</P>
      <P>"Apparently, the better the China-Taiwan ties, the lesser
constraints it would have on Bangkok's relations with the two
Chinas," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Titled "Beijing swaps missiles for manners," the article said
that such a drastic turnaround, which came without Taiwan having to
accept that it is a part of mainland China, is due to political
developments backed by public opinion in China and Taiwan and coupled
with international pressure, mainly from the US and Europe, on
pressing for less tension in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Beijing's military exercises and missile tests in the Taiwan
Strait three years ago tarnished China's reputation and its efforts
to promote an image of a benign power, the article said. It also
confirmed the Taiwanese public sentiment that Beijing leaders can not
be trusted.</P>
      <P>Discussing on the democratic atmosphere in Taiwan, he said the
Taiwanese are debating their future more openly and vigorously.
"Politicians, including President Lee, have to take into account such
public sentiments when negotiating Taiwan's future."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Shea Jia-dong, deputy governor of the
Central Bank of China in Taipei, Monday urged all commercial banks
in Taiwan to lower the interest rates on loans to their customers in
accordance with the actual market situation.</P>
      <P>He said the central bank believes the time is ripe to lower the
interest rates. This the first time a high-ranking central bank
official has made such remarks since the central bank lowered the
discount rates and bank reserve requirements on Sept. 28.</P>
      <P>The central bank will gradually lower bank reserve requirements
in the future in order to stimulate domestic demand, he said.</P>
      <P>Addressing a meeting of high-ranking managing officials of
commercial banks, Shea also said that the central bank wants to
keep the exchange rates of Taiwan currency stable, but it will not
take intervention measures unless it is absolutely necessary to do
so.</P>
      <P>He predicted that the economic growth rate will reach 5.0
percent in the least this year, and reach somewhere between 5.3
percent and 5.5 percent next year due to the increase in domestic

    <TEXT>
      <P>An American publisher's association is
retaining a local lawyer to defend against copyright violations by
Taiwan universities and students, according to a university
newsletter.</P>
      <P>"University Journal," published by National Chengchi University,
said that in a letter relayed by the Ministry of Education to local
universities, The Association of American Publishers (AAP) warned
that it has retained a local lawyer to raid copy shops around
campuses to find out if they are photocopying publications of AAP
members in violation of Taiwan's copyright law.</P>
      <P>Noting that copyright infringement is punishable by jail terms
ranging from six months to three years and a fine of up to NT$300,000
(US$9,090.9) under local law, the AAP, which represents some 200 US
publishing firms, professed its determination to enforce its members'
copyrights.</P>
      <P>Although schools and teachers are permitted to photocopy in part
copyrighted work to use as teaching materials, the law prohibits
excessive or complete reproduction without copyright approval.</P>
      <P>Complete reproduction of foreign textbooks is rampant among
Taiwan university students who want to save money, especially in the
wake of the NT dollar's depreciation against the greenback over the
last year. They generally sidestep the law by copying a book in
installments, a practice which fuels the booming photocopy industry
around the nation's campuses.</P>
      <P>The AAP warned in its letter that its lawyer will be visiting
photocopy stores without notice, and will hire private detectives to
conduct surveillance.</P>
      <P>In addition to the massive infringement of foreign copyright by
photocopying, the University Journal pointed out that the illegal
reproduction of computer software is another crime widespread among
university students, and could be another issue of concern to foreign
copyright owners.</P>

      <P>"The ROC government is positive of the agreement reached between
Koo and Wang, and is willing to develop cross-strait ties under this
framework," the MAC statement read.</P>
      <P>In the statement, the MAC spoke highly of the performances of Koo
and his delegation, saying they have properly expressed Taipei's
stance on several key issues, and have successfully disseminated
Taiwan's democratization and economic development experience.</P>
      <P>"The visit has paved the way for a resumption of the
institutionalized cross-strait negotiations which have been suspended
for three years, and we welcome this development," it added.</P>
      <P>However, the MAC expressed regret over Beijing's failure to
respond to several Taipei proposals, such as those for cross-strait
democratic exchanges at the grassroots level, agricultural
cooperation, and a joint Taiwan-mainland role in regional affairs.</P>
      <P>"We also understand that serious differences still exist between
the two sides on some fundamental issues, such as the definition of
the `one China' principle, Beijing's refusal to face up to the
reality of a divided China, and Taiwan's international stature," it
said.</P>
      <P>The statement reiterated that Beijing in the future should
renounce its attempts at diplomatic suppression and military menace
against Taiwan, and respect the fact that the two sides are now under
the rule of two separate governments.</P>
      <P>"It is our deep hope that both sides will from now on enter into
`frank consultations,' through which the shelved institutionalized
negotiations can be resumed, and peace and cooperative relations be
established between the two sides," the MAC statement said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF CHAIRMAN REVEALS IMPRESSIONS OF SIX-DAY MAINLAND CHINA TRIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 19 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman
Koo Chen-fu told assembled media in Taipei on Monday night that
during his talks with Beijing officials, each side presented its
opinions frankly and without hesitation.</P>
      <P>Despite this, Koo said that each side was "very tolerant" of the
opinions of the other side. "This will be helpful to the future
development of cross-strait relations," he noted.</P>
      <P>The SEF chairman said that both sides admitted that there are
differences between them, but stressed: "We will not retreat, but
will instead continue to make contact to try to solve these
difficulties."</P>
      <P>Koo's 12-member delegation left Taipei for Shanghai on Oct. 14
for a six-day "ice-melting trip" to the mainland with the aim of
resuming the formal cross-strait consultations that had been
suspended for three years.</P>
      <P>The mission returned to Taipei via Tokyo on Monday night. Koo met
the media, accompanied by Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Chang
King-yuh, shortly after his return.</P>
      <P>During his stay on the mainland, Taiwan's top negotiator with
Beijing held talks with Chairman Wang Daohan of the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), Vice Premier Qian Qichen,
and President Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>He told the media that his mission had attained the two
objectives set forth prior to the trip -- to engage in dialogue
toward reviving systematic cross-strait consultations, and to create
a harmonious atmosphere to improve cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Koo said that a four-point consensus was reached during his talks
with Wang in Shanghai on Oct. 15, and that Jiang had also indicated
his approval for the consensus.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the consensus, the SEF and ARATS will engage
in dialogue, step up exchanges of visits at various levels, and
strengthen mutual assistance to solve problems concerning the safety
and property of the people from both sides of the straits while
visiting the other side. Wang also accepted Koo's invitation to visit
Taiwan "at an appropriate time."</P>
      <P>Koo also disclosed that during this talks with Jiang on Sunday,
the mainland president indicated his deep interest in cross-strait
agricultural cooperation.</P>
      <P>When asked about the possibility of a meeting between ROC
President Lee Teng-hui and Jiang at November's Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum conference, Koo said that there is a need to create
better conditions, and that more time is required before this can be
achieved.</P>
      <P>Summing up the results of his mainland trip, Koo said the most
important point is that relations have now returned to the state of
three years ago, and that exchanges of views in a frank and open
manner are once more possible.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The US State Department on Monday welcomed
the four-point consensus reached in the just-concluded talks between
the top negotiators from both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The State Department said in a statement that Taiwan envoy Koo
Chen-fu's landmark visit to mainland China and the top mainland
negotiator Wang Daohan's consent to visit Taiwan at an "appropriate
time" were positive developments.</P>
      <P>Koo, chairman of Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF),
struck the four-point deal with his mainland counterpart, Chairman
Wang of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS), in Shanghai on Oct. 15 to pave the way for gradual
resumption of regular dialogue broken off by Beijing more than three
years ago.</P>
      <P>During his Oct. 14-19 "ice-melting" mainland trip, Koo also met
with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier Qian
Qichen for frank talks on issues of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>Although the two sides failed to bridge their wide gaps on some
fundamental issues, Koo's visit has helped thaw bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>The Department of State statement reads as follows:</P>
      <P>"We welcome the positive development from Mr. Koo's visit to the
People's Republic of China. We understand that the two sides have
reached a four-point consensus, which include the visit of the PRC's
top negotiator Wang Daohan to Taiwan at an appropriate time and
increase exchanges between SEF and ARATS.</P>
      <P>"We welcome this consensus and the decision by Wang Daohan to
visit Taiwan. We believe dialogue, contacts and exchanges between the
two sides provide important means toward the peaceful resolution of
differences between Taiwan and the PRC. Mr. Koo's meetings not only
with his direct counterpart but also with President Jiang Zemin and
other PRC leaders demonstrate the seriousness being attached to this

    <HEADLINE>FORMER DPP CHAIRMAN HAILS KOO'S PERFORMANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should not be afraid of holding
political talks with the mainland, former chairman of the leading
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Hsin-liang also hailed Koo Chen-fu's efforts during his
recent tour of the mainland and meetings with top-level officials in
his capacity as Straits Exchange Foundation chairman.</P>
      <P>Koo, Taiwan's first top envoy to visit the mainland in nearly 50
years, successfully conveyed Taiwan's friendliness to the mainland
and has brought back friendship during his six-day, ice-breaking
mission, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the government had long neglected to foster
friendship with the mainland, Hsu urged the government to recruit and
cultivate more talent like Koo for future cross-strait negotiations.</P>
      <P>Koo's meetings with top Beijing leaders on Sunday in Beijing
showed that Taiwan does not have to be worried about conducting
political talks with the mainland, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>He added that a meeting between President Lee Teng-hui and
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin should be set as the prime
task for the next phrase of relations. A Lee-Jiang meeting would help
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait further ease tension between them,
he noted.</P>
      <P>Koo met with Jiang and vice deputy Qian Qichen in separate
meetings on Sunday. The atmosphere in Koo-Jiang meeting was cordial,
but Koo and Qian had a pointed exchange on the "one China" issue.</P>
      <P>As Koo and Qian touched on political issues during their meeting,
the former DPP head said this should boost Taiwan's confidence.
Taiwan's democratization and political reality will put the island in
an advantage in cross-strait discussions, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>But he predicted that the focus of cross-strait talks will shift
back to negotiations on technical issues such as economic affairs as
it will take a long time for the two sides to reach any consensus on
the political front.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Beijing's demand that Taiwan allow direct "three
links" -- trade, transport, and communications -- with the mainland,
Hsu said the government should handle the three issues separately.</P>
      <P>The government can commission the private sector to negotiate
postal services with the mainland, Hsu suggested. Taiwan should also
seek Beijing's agreement not to block the island's entry to the
World Trade Organization in exchange for the easing of Taipei's
restrictions on Taiwan investments in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who stepped down from the top post in the DPP, favors a
broad engagement with mainland China.</P>

Taipei's top negotiator and Chinese President Jiang Zemin marks the
highest level of contact between the two sides in 50 years, the Los
Angeles Times reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>In its second story on Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman
Koo Chen-fu's mainland visit, the paper described the tour as a
cautious rapprochement between Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>"The ice is not completely broken, but we hope it has melted a
bit," Koo told a packed news conference after his meeting with Jiang.</P>
      <P>Koo, 81, told reporters that he and Jiang frankly exchanged views
on key issues. They talked about democracy extensively, and Koo
expressed the hope that mainland China will eventually be able to
"share Taiwan's experience" in promoting democracy. Beijing described
Sunday's 100-minute meeting as cordial.

    <HEADLINE>FOUR COUNTRIES SEEN AVOIDING RECESSION IN 1998</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan, China, Australia and Vietnam are
the only four countries that will likely avoid economic recession by
the end of 1998, a prominent Australian economist predicted.</P>
      <P>In a speech to a meeting of Australian and Japanese business
leaders in Melbourne on Monday, Professor Ross Garnaut, director of
the Asia Pacific School of Economics and Management at the Australian
National University in Canberra, said the Asia-Pacific's economic
crisis bore uneasy parallels to the 1930s Great Depression.</P>
      <P>While the two events are not identical, both were sparked by the
"implosion" of import trade, he said.</P>
      <P>"By the end of this year, only China, Taiwan, Australia and
perhaps, precariously, Vietnam among western Pacific economies will
have avoided recession," he predicted. The economist described the
current crisis as a western Pacific crisis rather than an Asian or
East Asian crisis.</P>
      <P>He noted that the economies of Malaysia, Thailand, South Korea,
Indonesia and Japan were hit badly since the middle of 1997.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The meetings between Taiwan's top
mainland negotiator and mainland officials mark a political coup for
the Taipei government, the Sydney Morning Herald said in an
editorial.</P>
      <P>The fact that Beijing has resorted to courting Taipei instead of
bullying it into submission and reunification, is more significant
than any results produced from negotiations, the paper said. The
talks could never have been expected to produce very tangible
results, it added.</P>
      <P>"Nothing could have shown the government in Taipei to better
advantage than to have it projected in such direct contrast with the
government in Beijing," the editorial stated.</P>
      <P>Koo Chen-fu, Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) chairman and
Taiwan's senior envoy, had only to insist that reunification was
impossible until China reaches Taiwan's state of democratic
development. Such insistence forced Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen
to acknowledge Taiwan's interests.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan now practices capitalist system and after the
reunification Taiwan may retain the capitalist system while the
mainland of the motherland practices socialist system," Qian was
quoted as saying. "By reunification, we mean to safeguard the state
territorial integrity and sovereignty, not to argue over systems."</P>
      <P>The editorial noted that Qian's remarks were profoundly
pragmatic, unimaginable only a few years ago when Beijing railed
against the "renegade province" in the most strident terms and
denounced the Kuomintang as "brigands" who ruled it.</P>
      <P>"Last week's talks help Taiwan, especially by making clear how
different is its position compared with Hong Kong's. The more Beijing
relies on the Hong Kong comparison, the more it underlines the
difference," the paper stated.</P>

(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While the latest round of cuts in bank
prime lending rates here has given a psychological boost to the stock
market, it alone cannot help Singapore as recovery hinges on external
factors beyond its control, economists said.</P>
      <P>With domestic demand accounting for one-third of gross domestic
product, Singapore's economy is driven by external demand and
multinational corporations that do not fund their operations locally
and are not sensitive to domestic interest rates, they said.</P>
      <P>Economists expect Singapore's economy to expand just 0.4 percent
in 1998. Estimates for 1999 range from a contraction of 1.5 percent
to a growth of 0.6 percent. Most of these calculations are based on a
further fall in interest rates.</P>
      <P>Over the last month, the local Big Four banks cut their prime
lending rates twice to 7 percent, but economists point out that real
interest rates, which are adjusted for inflation, are still high
because the inflation rate has turned negative.</P>

    <DATELINE>Singapore, Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's external trade remained weak
in September as total trade at current prices fell by 9.2 percent,
reflecting declines in both imports and exports -- 16.9 percent and
0.9 percent respectively.</P>
      <P>As in preceding months, the sluggish performance was due to
lackluster market conditions for electronic and related products, as
well as fallen demand from Asian economies hit by the financial
crisis.</P>
      <P>Non-oil domestic exports expanded marginally by 1.4 percent in
September, half the growth rate in August 1998. The overall growth
was due to the 6.0 percent increase in non-electronic exports which
offset the 0.6 percent decline in electronics exports.</P>
      <P>Of the key electronic products, personal computers, printers and
consumers electronics bore the brunt of the sluggish global demand
conditions, contracting by double-digit rates.</P>
      <P>Although exports of disk drives grew by 10.5 percent, there are
no clear indications if this can be sustained. The main
non-electronic exports which performed well in September were disc
media products up by 14.7 percent, compounds for pharmaceuticals at
50.7 percent growth, and medical apparatus with 28 percent growth.</P>
      <P>The domestic export of oil continued to decline in September. It
fell by 15.3 percent due to depressed oil prices and weak demand from
major Asian markets such as Hong Kong and Malaysia.</P>

      <P>Beijing has made unification with Taiwan a
priority now that talks between the two sides have been restarted, a
Bangkok-based English daily said in its editorial on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>With Hong Kong back in its fold and Macau returning to its

attention to Taiwan, The Nation said.</P>
      <P>Talks between Taiwan's top negotiator Koo Chen-fu and mainland
President Jiang Zemin took place on Sunday in Beijing. Koo met with
his Beijing counterpart Wang Daohan last week and forged a four-point
agreement on future meetings among other issues.</P>
      <P>Entitled "More Talks Better Than No Talks," The Nation editorial
said the resumption of talks is a pivotal confidence-building measure
which will lead to a true ironing-out of differences. However, a
meeting between Jiang and ROC President Lee Teng-hui is premature at
the moment because neither side is willing to give way to the other,
the paper said.

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATORS' REACTIONS TO KOO'S MISSION MIXED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Reactions were mixed in the Legislative
Yuan on Tuesday to Taiwan's top negotiator Koo Chen-fu's recent
meetings with high-level mainland officials.</P>
      <P>Koo, chairman of the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation,
returned on Monday from a six-day ice-breaking trip to the mainland.
During his visit, Koo met with his mainland counterpart Wang Daohan,
Vice Premier Qian Qichen and President Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsai Ming-hsien of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Koo failed to convey the public opinion
of Taiwan people. He cited public polls showing that 76 percent of
the Taiwan public do not approve of Beijing's "one country, two
systems" formula, while 83 percent believe the fate of Taiwan should
be decided by Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>New Party Legislator Chen Yi-hsin said the KMT tried to highlight
the fact that Taiwan was not a troublemaker nor the culprit in soured
cross-strait relations, but the aim obviously fell through.</P>
      <P>Chen said the most noteworthy result of the highest-level contact
between the two sides in three years was the clarification that "one
China" refers to "the Republic of China."</P>
      <P>Yang Chi-hsiung of the ruling Kuomintang said the most important
element in the meetings was that Koo clearly stated the stance of
Taiwan people to mainland leaders which will help ease cross-strait
tensions and have a far-reaching impact on the development of
relations between the two sides.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lin Cheng-tze also said constructive cross-strait
dialogue should not fear differences, saying that Koo's delegation
will help ease cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lee Wen-lang said if the nation cannot formulate a
consensus on mainland policy, then it will be problematic when
Beijing's top Taiwan negotiator, Wang Daohan, visits the island. Wang
promised to visit Taiwan at an "appropriate time," during his meeting
with Koo in Shanghai last week.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Tuesday welcomed
a Russian parliamentary delegation visiting Taiwan and expressed the
hope that the visit will help boost cooperation and exchanges between
Russia and the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks as he welcomed the delegation, headed by
Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky, at the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Zhirinovsky extended an invitation for Lee to visit Russia. Lee
said he appreciated the invitation and would go at an appropriate
time.</P>
      <P>Zhirinovsky said that Russia is well aware of the political and
economic developments achieved by the Republic of China and greatly
admires the nation, especially its ability to implement reform
gradually and in a way that takes into account the need for political
stability and economic development. He said it would be worthwhile
for Russia to emulate this approach.</P>
      <P>Russia is currently in the midst of enacting painful political
and economic reforms, he said. But with its abundant natural
resources and solid industrial base, the country expects to weather
its present difficulties, he added.</P>
      <P>Zhirinovsky said the Republic of China and Russia could
complement each other and that there is ample room for the further
development of their economic and cultural relations.</P>
      <P>The Russian ultranationalist, invited to visit Taiwan by
Kuomintang Secretary-General John Chang, arrived Sunday aboard a
chartered Russian Vnukovo Airlines jet.</P>
      <P>It is believed to be the first direct flight between Moscow and
Taipei in half a century.</P>
      <P>After leaving Taipei, the delegation will visit Kaohsiung before
concluding its five-day visit and returning to Moscow on Thursday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HAS TAKEN DELIVERY OF 103 F-16S</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Fort  Worth,  Texas,  Oct. 19 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lockheed Martin Corp. said on
Monday it has delivered a total of 103 F-16 jet fighters to the
Republic of China on Taiwan, including 30 twin-seater F-16Bs.</P>
      <P>Eighteen of those planes are now at the Luke Air Base in Arizona
for training ROC Air Force pilots, two other F-16s are at an air base
in California for further flight tests.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the American warplane manufacturer said the
delivery of the remaining 47 F-16s ordered by Taiwan will be
completed by October 1999.</P>
      <P>Former US President George Bush announced the sale of 150
F-16s to Taiwan in September 1992, including 120 single-seater F-16As
and 30 twin-seater F-16Bs.</P>
      <P>The US$5.8 billion deal is part of Taiwan's 10-year military
modernization plan aimed at upgrading the island's defense
capabilities in the face of persistent military threat from communist
China.</P>
      <P>When the first Taiwan-ordered F-16 rolled off the assembly line
some two years ago, Lockheed Martin Corp. rejected Taiwan media's
request for coverage. But the company took the initiative to invite
Taiwan journalists stationed in the United States to tour its
warplane production facilities in Fort Worth, Texas on Monday.</P>
      <P>Joseph W. Stout, communications director at Lockheed Martin's
Fort Worth plant, said the company rejected Taiwan media's
coverage two years ago mainly because of the US State Department's
demand for a low-profile approach to the F-16 deal in an apparent
attempt to avoid offending Beijing. Mainland China has consistently
opposed arms sales to Taiwan by any other country.</P>
      <P>Stout pointed out that F-16s are high-performance warplanes.
"However, it seems to us that most Taiwan people are not fully
aware of F-16's merits and advantages. Some Taiwan media have even
given misleading reports. Therefore, we decided to brief Taiwan
journalists on F-16's merits by inviting them to visit our plant,"
he explained.</P>
      <P>Troy Pennington, a test pilot at the Fort Worth plant, said the
F-16 Block 20 fighters purchased by Taiwan can compete with any other
model now in service in countries around the world, including
Russian-made Su-27 fighters that mainland China is deploying.</P>
      <P>Pennington, a former US Marine Corps F/A-18 pilot, said F-16
fighters have five times replaced engine models since they were
first marketed in the late 1970s.</P>
      <P>Noting that F-16s have undergone continued mid-life upgrades,
Pennington said the Taiwan purchased F-16 Block 20 model is equipped
with a cockpit radar color monitor and many other sophisticated
devices. "Some of their facilities are even more advanced than
those installed on F-16 C/D models now in service in the US Air
Force," he added.</P>
      <P>Dain M. Hancock, chief manager at the Fort Worth plant, said he
will visit Taiwan later this year to probe whether the ROC Air
Force has encountered any problems after taking delivery of the
F-16s.</P>
      <P>Hancock said F-16 is the safest, single-engine and multi-role
fighter plane in the US Air Force history. In 1997, the F-16
accident rate in the United States was 2.7 mishaps per 100,000 flight
hours, while the fighter's world average accident rate was 3.7
mishaps per 100,000 hours.</P>
      <P>Hancock said he still didn't know the cause of the crash of an
ROC Air Force twin-seater F-16B earlier this year.</P>
      <P>George York, a cockpit integration program leader, said Taiwan
has not informed the Fort Worth plant of any problems concerning the
search for the wreckage of the ill-fated fighter and the bodies of
the two pilots on board.</P>
      <P>Taiwan launched extensive search and rescue operations after the
F-16B lost contact with the military flight control center on March
20 when the plane was on a routine training flight over the skies of
the Penghu Islands off the southwestern Taiwan coast. Neither the
wreckage of the plane nor the bodies of the two pilots aboard have
ever been recovered.</P>
      <P>A total of 3,900 F-16s have so far been produced and hundreds
more are expected to roll off the assembly line before 2010. By
then, F-16 will become the most widely used advanced warplanes.
Nineteen countries around the world, including the United States,
have deployed F-16s. Asian countries that have deployed F-16s
include South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore and Taiwan.
Japan has deployed F-2 jet fighters which were patterned after F-16s.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S 1998 ECONOMIC GROWTH REVISED UPWARD BY RESEARCH INSTITUTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A fourth quarter economic forecast issued
by the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research on Tuesday
adjusted upward the ROC's annual economic growth rate in 1998 to 5.25
percent.</P>
      <P>The institute attributed the ROC's economic gains to the
government-planned stimulation of domestic demand. The increase in
demand will likely boost economic growth for the fourth quarter to
5.08 percent, which in turn may lift growth for the year to 5.25
percent, according to the forecast.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead to next year, the institute said the economic
declines being experienced by most east Asian nations would likely
bottom out and that they would begin to rebound.</P>
      <P>The institute forecast economic growth next year of 5.35 percent
for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Among the economic growth forecasts offered for Taiwan, the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics predicted in
August that Taiwan's economy would grow 4.8 percent this year. If the
effects of the stimulation of domestic demand were taken into
account, however, that figure could stand as high as 5.3 percent.</P>
      <P>The Council of Economic Planning and Development, meanwhile,
predicted in September 5.11 percent growth; the Taiwan Institute of
Economic Research estimated in July 5.5 percent growth; and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted in October growth of 4
percent for Taiwan this year.</P>
      <P>Next year's economic growth has been put at 5.32 percent by the
Council for Economic Planning and Development, while the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics estimated 5.75 percent
growth for the upper half of 1999. The IMF, however, has predicted
growth of only 3.9 percent for Taiwan next year.</P>

      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister Jason Hu on
Tuesday categorically denied that Panama and Costa Rica will sever
their diplomatic ties with the Republic of China at the end of this
year.</P>
      <P>Hu called groundless rumors that the two countries would

metropolitan Taipei and Kaohsiung will be elected in the three-in-one
elections.</P>
      <P>He promised to take responsibility if the defections occur.</P>
      <P>Hu made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan in response to
questioning about the rumors by Legislator Chien Hsi-chieh of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister admitted that Beijing has tried to lure
Panama and Costa Rica away from the Republic of China over the past
several years.</P>
      <P>So far, he said, the two longtime ROC allies have shown great
friendship toward Taiwan. He said cordial and close relations between
Taiwan and the two countries will remain unchanged, at least in the

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HAS TAKEN DELIVERY OF ALL 60 MIRAGE 2000-5S</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC Air Force has taken delivery of
all the 60 Mirage 2000-5 jet fighters ordered from France and will
hold a ceremony at the Hsinchu Air Base in northern Taiwan on Nov.
26 to mark the formation of its first Mirage wing, military sources
said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Air Force Commander-in-Chief Gen. Chen Chao-min will personally
preside over the Mirage wing commissioning ceremony, the sources
said.</P>
      <P>Under a project dubbed "Flying Dragon," the Air Force struck a
deal with France in 1993 for purchasing 60 Mirage 2000-5s and 960
MICA medium-range air-to-air missiles and 480 short-range Magic
air-to-air missiles to arm the advanced fighters.</P>
      <P>The deal cost a total of NT$167.6 billion (about US$5 billion).</P>
      <P>The delivery was originally scheduled to be completed by the
year 2000. In consideration of Taiwan's combat preparedness, the
French contractor Dassault Corp. has sped up production and advanced
its delivery schedule.</P>
      <P>The last batch of Mirage 2000-5s arrived in Taiwan earlier this
month and the Air Force has finalized all delivery formalities with
French authorities, military sources said.</P>
      <P>In the course of delivery, the Control Yuan once launched an
investigation into suspected irregularities involving the Ministry of
National Defense's speedy payment to the Mirage supplier. The
investigation didn't uncover any irregularities. As the New Taiwan
dollar has depreciated significantly against the US dollar over the
past year, the Defense Ministry's speedy payment has saved a large
amount of money from the exchange rate fluctuation.</P>
      <P>The first Taiwan-ordered Mirage 2000-5 rolled off the assembly
line in May 1996 and was shipped to the eastern Hualien port in May
1997. The first Mirage squadron was commissioned in last
October.</P>
      <P>Mirage 2000-5 fighters are high-performance warplanes
suitable for high-altitude air combat. The Mirage deal is part
of Taiwan's 10-year military modernization plan aimed at beefing
up the island's air defense capabilities and ensure its air
supremacy.</P>
      <P>The commissioning of the 60th Mirage plane and the first
Mirage wing on Nov. 26 will mark a new milestone in Taiwan's
military build-up.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Mirage deal, Taiwan has also purchased 150
US-made F-16s and 130 locally built Ching-kuo Indigenous Defense
Fighters to replace its aging fleet.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW YORK BASED MAINLAND DISSIDENTS HAIL KOO'S MAINLAND CHINA TRIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York, Oct. 19 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang and K.C. Huang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The trip to mainland China by top Taiwan
envoy Koo Chen-fu represents a new beginning in cross-strait ties, a
group of mainland pro-democracy activists based here said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Describing Koo's recent visit to Shanghai and Beijing as
heralding a new starting point in bilateral ties after a hiatus of
more than three years, the "China Peace" group said it welcomes the
replacement of confrontation with dialogue between Taiwan and the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Koo, in his capacity as chairman of the Straits Exchange
Foundation, returned from the mainland late on Monday after
concluding his historic six-day visit. While there, he met with top
mainland Chinese leaders, including President Jiang Zemin, Vice
President Qian Qichen, and his mainland counterpart, Chairman Wang
Daohan of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The group, however, urged mainland China to hasten its
democratization, pointing out that Beijing's leaders should realize
that the mainland's democratization is a prerequisite for Taiwan to
agree to unification.</P>
      <P>Because of wide differences in the political systems and the ways
of life between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, "China Peace"
contended that unification will take a long time, and added that
before the two sides start official negotiations on the issue, both
should first meet the following requirements:</P>
      <P>-- recognize each other as a distinct political entity, forswear
historic burdens and hatreds, and set no preconditions before
starting formal negotiations on unification;</P>
      <P>-- renounce the use of force as a means of resolving the
unification problem, and open bilateral talks as soon as possible on
ending the state of hostility between the two sides;</P>
      <P>-- respect each other's position in the international community
in order to avoid damaging the well-being of the people of both
sides;</P>
      <P>-- democratize the territory under the jurisdiction of each side
by implementing multi-party systems and popular elections at all
levels, including the presidency; and</P>
      <P>-- conduct negotiations on peaceful unification only after the
majority of people on both sides approve the move via public
referendum.</P>

      <P>The majority of Taiwan people are

      <P>The telephone poll of 2,401 adult residents throughout the
island, conducted by the ruling Kuomintang on Oct. 17-19, found that
73 percent of the respondents said they are satisfied with the SEF
delegation's performance during its Oct. 14-19 Shanghai-Beijing
visit.</P>
      <P>SEF is a quasi-official intermediary body authorized by the
government to handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence of

      <P>Eighty-three percent of those interviewed said they know

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth hinges to a great
extent on the effectiveness of a government-backed plan to spur
domestic demand, the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research said
on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>If the plan works, Taiwan could achieve economic growth of 5.44
percent this year and 6.12 percent next year. Those figures, however,
could drop to 5.06 percent and 4.57 percent, respectively, if the
plan does not work, according to institute researchers.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, issued by the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, public investment would increase by NT$18.4 billion
this year and NT$73.2 billion next year. Before issuing the plan,
the council had predicted economic growth for Taiwan of 5.25 percent
this year and 5.35 percent next year.</P>
      <P>If the plan goes awry, however, the consequences will be severe,
the researchers said, as total investment in Taiwan next year could
grow by a mere 2.6 percent over this year. Such scant investment
growth would likely be accompanied by recession in Taiwan's civil
consumption and import sectors, the researchers said.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The fourth annual meeting of the World
Electronic Forum (WEF) opened in Taipei on Tuesday, attended by 30
representatives of electronic information business associations from
13 countries and areas.</P>
      <P>This is the first time that the annual meeting has taken place in
Taiwan since it began in 1995 with the aim of discussing world trade
policies in electronic information and information exchanges around
the globe.</P>
      <P>In an address delivered at the opening ceremony of the two-day
conference, Vice Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said that despite its status
as an unofficial international organization, the WEF plays a key role
in the cooperation of the electronic and information sector
worldwide.</P>
      <P>Liu revealed to those attending his prediction that the future
trend of the electronic industry will focus on the development of
products which are not only personalized, digitized and multi-media,
but are also endowed with all the characteristics of the so-called
three-C products -- computer, communications and consumer products.</P>
      <P>Later in the opening ceremony, chairman of the Taiwan Electrical
and Electronic Manufacturing Association (TEEMA), Wu Si-chung, called
for the prevention of "overblown trade disputes."</P>
      <P>Citing instances in which the European common market has
complained about alleged dumping of Taiwan-made 3.5-inch floppy
disks, optical fibers, and several other electronic products, Wu said
that some of Taiwan's products happen to be very competitive in
Europe, just as the cellular phones sold in Taiwan adhere to European
frequency standards.</P>
      <P>But he has never seen any Asian countries enacting anti-dumping
measures against cellular phones or systems from Europe, despite
their overwhelming presence in the region, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The first WEF annual meeting took place in the United States in
1995. Since then, 34 countries and areas have joined the

      <P>President Lee Teng-hui said Monday that
cross-strait relations can be improved with sincerity and goodwill,

improve the relations.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he received Taiwan's chief
negotiator Koo Chen-fu and members of his delegation, which visited
Shanghai and Beijing Oct. 14-19.</P>
      <P>Lee said that, since it will take quite a long time to resolve
some of the basic differences between the two sides, it will be wise
for them to respect each other, increase their exchanges and
constructive dialogues on an equal footing, gradually step up their
cooperation, and recognize the reality that China is now under
separate rule. The two sides should hold dialogues on all matters
involving the safety and interests of the people, he added.</P>
      <P>Lee expressed deep appreciation to Koo, chairman of the
semi-official Strait Exchange Foundation, and members of the
delegation for the good job they did during the visit. Koo and his
delegation visited mainland China at the invitation of his mainland
Chinese counterpart Wang Daohan, Chairman of the Association for

      <P>Koo and Wang reached a four-point agreement on Oct. 15 in
Shanghai, under which the two sides will continue to hold dialogues

glad to share its experience in promoting democracy with the

    <HEADLINE>ACER HEAD PROPOSES TAIWAN-MAINLAND CHINA IT COOPERATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Stan Shih, founder of the Taiwan-based Acer
Computer Co., on Tuesday proposed a strategy of cooperation between
the information technology (IT) sectors of Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Shih said Taiwan makers of electronic products should stop
worrying about their weakening market hold in the face of increasing
mainland Chinese competition. Instead, he said, they should think
about relocating part of their operations to the mainland, to take
advantage of the mainland's inexpensive land and rich human
resources.</P>
      <P>By joining hands, he added, Taiwan and mainland China can expect
their competitiveness to double, enabling them to cut into world
markets more decisively.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks in a keynote speech to the fourth World
Electronics Forum which opened in Taipei on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>He said the greatest challenge to Taiwan's IT industry is its
lack of a huge domestic market. Although Taiwan-made IT products are
marketed worldwide, owning a market as vast as the Chinese mainland
is the only way to make any Taiwan product a world-renowned brand
name, he continued.</P>
      <P>Noting that major IT businesses around the world, including
dynamic random access memory chip makers and IC silicon wafer
manufacturers, are approaching their lowest ebb, he said Taiwan
makers should learn to stay cool, and conserve their energy to tide
them over the cold winter, adding that the only way out in the face
of the current worldwide recession is to try to cut overhead costs.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The textile industries in Taiwan,
mainland China and Hong Kong are facing difficult times with falling
exports in 1998 as a result of the Asian economic crisis, according
to a leading ROC exporter.</P>
      <P>In a speech at a meeting of the International Textile
Manufacturers Federation in Melbourne on Tuesday, William Shan,
president of the Chung Hsing Textile Corp., said the Asian crisis has
affected the textile industries in Taiwan, mainland China and Hong
Kong, and that it could take some time before they recover.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's textile exports were worth US$16.6 billion in
1997, while its imports remained at the 1996 level, giving the
country a surplus of US$13 billion from its textile and apparel
trade.</P>
      <P>But the Asian crisis has caused Taiwan's textile exports to drop
at a rate of 5 percent to 20 percent in different sectors, including
man-made fiber, yarn, fabrics and garments, he said.</P>
      <P>He estimated mainland China's total losses in textile exports at
US$240 million in 1997 and said the figure could be much higher this
year.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong' textile industry also is facing a hard time, with a
drop in the number of factories and workers due to the impact of the
Asian crisis, Shan said.</P>
      <P>In addition, he went on, a number of importing countries,
including the European Union, Turkey, and Mexico, have filed dumping
allegations against Hong Kong exporters, causing exports to fall this
year.</P>
      <P>In 1997, Hong Kong's textile exports were worth US$38.5 billion,
Shan said, but warned that the figure will drop this year.</P>
      <P>About 200 delegates from 28 countries are taking part in the

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will raise at least seven major
issues during the forthcoming bilateral consultations with the United
States on the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA), an ROC
trade official said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) Director-General Chen Ruey-long
will head the Taiwan delegation at the consultations, while the
United States will be represented by Bob Cassidy, an assistant trade
representative in charge of Southeast Asian affairs.</P>
      <P>The meeting is scheduled to be held in Washington, D.C. from Oct.
26-29. Taiwan and the United States signed the TIFA agreement in
September 1994.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan will seek US support for its bid to join the
World Customs Organization; try to persuade the US to sign an
agreement on customs affairs cooperation with Taiwan; and ask
Washington to review related policies so that Taiwan can be removed
from its Special 301 watch list of countries with unfair trade
practices.</P>
      <P>Other topics Taiwan will broach for discussion include: the
signing of an agreement on toxic waste transshipment; the US
cancellation of an import ban on Taiwan shrimp; and an intensive US
probe of anti-dumping charges, Chen added. He said the Taiwan
delegates will try to gain further understanding of whether related
US anti-dumping investigations are violating World Trade Organization
rules.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will also discuss issues concerning intellectual property
rights protection, since the US has accused Taiwan semiconductor
manufacturers of counterfeiting, and has demanded that
Taiwan-originating silicon wafers be engraved with special
identifying marks, Chen noted.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  19 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A World Bank report shows that Taiwan
has enjoyed an average 6.4 percent annual economic growth rate over
the past eight years, a record which ranks the island 18th in the
world.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was defined by the World Bank as a country enjoying high
income in 1990, since which time the "Asian tiger" has never recorded
double-digit growth rates in its economy, according to the report on
global development.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1990, Taiwan astonished the world with remarkable
economic growth rates, which surpassed 10 percent annually on 14
separate occasions during the 40-year period which ended in 1990.</P>
      <P>The figures seem to prove that the more economic development a
country achieves, the less economic growth it will enjoy, the report
said. It expanded on this conclusion with figures pointing out that
in the 1980's, the world average economic growth amounted to 3.1
percent, while the number fell to 2.3 percent during the period from
1990 to 1997.</P>
      <P>It is also expected that the 1998 figure will drop to the lowest
ever, due to the impact of the Asian financial meltdown, the report
said.</P>
      <P>According to the International Monetary Fund's latest prediction,
the average economic growth rate of developing Asian economies will
register at 1.8 percent this year, while that of the four Asian
tigers -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan -- will post
negative 2.9 percent growth, the lowest since the end of World War
II.</P>
      <P>The World Bank report also indicates that mainland China enjoyed
the world's largest average economic growth rate -- 11 percent --
over the past eight years, ahead of Malaysia, with 8.7 percent;
Vietnam, with 8.6 percent; and Singapore, with 8.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Among the four Asian tigers, Singapore ranked first, followed by
South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, the report said.</P>

      <P>Mainland China has struck back at Chris

of Hong Kong promotes his best-selling book in Australia.</P>
      <P>"From vilifying Chinese leaders and leadership and accusing the
world of kowtowing to China for economic benefits, to diminishing the
importance of the China market and toadying to those who fervently
spread the `China threat,' the retired governor has done everything
he can to hurt the feeling of the Chinese people with extremely

      <P>The commentary described Patten's account of his time in Hong
Kong as a "portrait of a narrow-minded, retired politician who vents
his spleen over those who opposed his perverse actions."</P>
      <P>In a speech in Sydney on Monday, however, Patten said his book is
not "a kiss-and-tell memoir," but an ambitious examination of the
challenge presented by the emergence of mainland China, and a
demolition of the idea that there was an "Asian miracle" driven by

    <HEADLINE>DIALOGUE WITH MAINLAND CHINA HAS WIDESPREAD SUPPORT: ROC PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite Beijing's increasingly strident
calls for political negotiation with Taipei, the two sides should for
the moment continue with their constructive dialogue, ROC President
Lee Teng-hui said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A continuation of constructive dialogue is the most practical way
of handling thorny cross-strait relations, and this idea has gained
widespread support among the Taiwan public, Lee said during a meeting
with Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland China, Koo Chen-fu, and
the members of the delegation which accompanied him on his landmark
visit to Shanghai and Beijing from Oct. 14-19.</P>
      <P>Great differences still exist between Taiwan and mainland China
from almost every point of view, and perfect resolutions to these
differences are unlikely in the near future, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Taking the "one China" issue as an example, he said, since the
two sides are unlikely to reconcile and reach a consensus on the
issue in the short term, the most pragmatic way to solve the issue at
the moment is to face the reality of "a separated China," treat each
other with respect, and continue exchanges and dialogue on an equal
footing.</P>
      <P>Lee suggested that both sides of the Taiwan Strait should expand
and enlarge their cooperation on points of agreement while respecting
each other's differences.</P>
      <P>He urged both sides to accelerate exchanges on one hand, but to
try to maintain stability across the Taiwan Strait on the other.</P>
      <P>The president expressed sincere gratitude toward Koo and his
delegation for their commendable performances in the just-concluded
trip. He was particularly effusive in his appreciation of Koo, his
senior adviser, for his calm, sagacious, yet firm attitude when
talking with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin and other
political leaders in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that although mainland China can boast of remarkable
economic achievements over the last several years, any economy which
is solid and sustainable should be backed up by democratic politics.
In this regard, he said, if the mainland embarks on democratic
reforms, negotiations on any subject will be much easier to realize.</P>
      <P>Lee reiterated that the cross-strait differences are unlikely to
be redressed overnight, but stressed that Koo's mainland trip
symbolizes the beginning of a new era in cross-strait relations.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 20 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign orders received by Taiwan companies
are declining because of the Asian financial meltdown, and the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) expects orders for this year to
post negative growth.</P>
      <P>If the expectations prove to be founded, it will be the island's
first negative growth in foreign orders since 1982, MOEA officials
said on Tuesday. However, they added that the value of foreign orders
for September is expected to hit US$10 billion.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, the MOEA is to soon release statistics on foreign
orders for Taiwan businesses for September. Officials pointed out
that it is presently the island's traditional high season for
exports, which means that more orders can be expected over the next
few weeks.</P>
      <P>In August, Taiwan received about US$9.98 billion-worth of foreign
orders, down 2.18 percent from the year-earlier level. This was the
sixth consecutive drop since March, the MOEA officials said.</P>
      <P>Although orders for September are expected to be higher in
comparison to August figures, they are not expected to surpass the
US$10.89 billion recorded last September, the officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S TOURISM MAP RESHAPED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's tourism map has been reshaped this
year as a result of a variety of factors both at home and abroad,
sources from the Tourism Bureau reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The number of overseas leisure trips taken by ROC nationals this
year has declined substantially, while the numbers of foreigners
visiting the island and domestic travelers have increased, a bureau
official said.</P>
      <P>Asia's economic woes, the depreciation of the Taiwan currency and
the introduction of a five-day work week have all contributed to the
changes, the official said.</P>
      <P>In the first nine months of this year, Taiwan people made 4.53
million trips overseas, down 6.77 percent from the 4.85 million
posted in the corresponding period last year. Overseas spending
declined a whopping 17.29 percent or US$715 million, the official
noted.</P>
      <P>The dip in the number of overseas trips and spending by Taiwan
travelers marks the first negative growth in 11 years.</P>
      <P>The officials attributed the decline mainly to the depreciated
New Taiwan dollar and booming domestic tourism development, thanks to
the five-day work week.</P>
      <P>According to Tourism Bureau statistics, Taiwan travelers made
45.92 million visits to 110 tourist attractions islandwide in the
January-August period this year, up 10 percent from the year-earlier
levels.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the number of foreign visitors coming to Taiwan in
August and September grew a slight 0.39 percent compared to the same
period last year, the official said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's exports to the United States
accounted for 3.5 percent of the US market in the January-August
period, the latest statistics of the US Department of Commerce (DOC)
indicated.</P>
      <P>Although the figure showed a drop from the same period last year,
it was the highest among the four Asian tigers -- Taiwan, Hong Kong,
South Korea and Singapore.</P>
      <P>South Korean products took 2.6 percent stake of the US market,
Singapore 2 percent, and Hong Kong 1.1 percent, the statistics show.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong exports to the United States in the first eight months
of the year surged 8.6 percent from the same period last year, ahead
of Taiwan's 3.3 percent and South Korea's 2.6 percent.</P>
      <P>Singapore's exports to here during the eight-month period dropped
15.8 percent from the same period of last year, the figures said.</P>
      <P>Effected by the Asian financial meltdown, which has resulted in a
serious economic recession in the region, the report said, US exports
to Asian countries, with the exception of Japan and mainland China,
dropped 2 percent in the January-August period against the same
period in 1997.</P>
      <P>The DOC figures also showed that mainland China's market share in
the United States during the first eight months of this year climbed
to 7.4 percent from the 6.7 percent of last year, a new high record.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite a recent landmark trip to mainland
China by top Taiwan envoy Koo Chen-fu, Beijing has not eased its
attempts to bully Taiwan in the international arena, Foreign Minister
Jason Hu said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Hu said Taiwan must
let the international community know that despite the perceived thaw
in cross-strait relations, Beijing is still trying to isolate Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Hu, Beijing began stepping up its diplomatic war
against Taiwan since last summer. Beijing aims to lure away all of
the island's diplomatic partners before the end of this century, and
is pumping up its military to intimidate Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>Improved ties are important to both sides of the Taiwan Strait,
but it will not produce any concrete results if the mainland lacks
sincerity, Hu said.</P>
      <P>He urged Beijing not to use its "one China" definition to block
Taiwan's activities in the international arena, as Beijing should
realize that it would only cause resentment among the people of
Taiwan, leaving Beijing responsible for the possible consequences in
the long run.</P>
      <P>In addition, Hu also reaffirmed that ties with Costa Rica and
Panama remain solid. He attributed the stable relations to a visit to
both countries by Vice President Lien Chan earlier this year.</P>

an increase of 7.02 percent, or US$240 million, over the year-earlier
levels. Machinery, information technology products and
telecommunications equipment made up the bulk of the orders.</P>
      <P>September orders from Europe posted an increase of 7.28 percent,
or US$140 million, over the same month of last year, with electronics
products topping the list, ministry officials said.</P>
      <P>However, orders from mainland China, South Korea and Southeast
Asia all diminished in September.</P>
      <P>Although the value of orders received in September was higher
than those of July and August, it represented a decline of 4.7
percent, or US$420 million, from the same month of 1997, when the
monthly export orders totaled US$10.9 billion, said Chang Yao-tsung,
director-general of the MOEA's Statistics Department.</P>
      <P>Owing to the Asian economic crisis which has battered most of
Asia's economies, Taiwan's export orders received this year may post
the first annual negative growth in 16 years, Chang noted. Taiwan's
export orders have continued to record negative growth for seven
consecutive months since March, he added.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that October, November, and December are
supposed to be peak months in terms of exports, Chang said he does
not expect export orders to pick up significantly in the last quarter
because the impact of the Asian economic turmoil is still being felt.
In addition, he pointed out, the US dollar continues to depreciate,
which will drive down America's domestic demand, and in turn, export
orders.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   21  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Typhoon Babs has expanded to 250
kilometers, and its outer rim is expected to affect Taiwan by Friday,
bringing torrential rain to the north and northeast, the Central
Weather Bureau reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The medium-sized tropical storm was centered some 510 kilometers
east-southeast of Manila on Wednesday morning, or 1,100 kilometers
south-southeast of Hengchung, the southernmost tip of Taiwan, the
bureau reported.</P>
      <P>The typhoon, packing maximum center winds of 43 meters per
second, is moving north at a speed of 15 kilometers per hour.
Weathermen said Babs is taking a course similar that taken by typhoon
Zeb, which left a trail of destruction through the Philippines,
Taiwan and Japan last week, killing more than 100 people.</P>
      <P>Meteorologists predicted that if Babs remains on its present
course, it is expected to hit Taiwan by Sunday, adding, however, that
its outer rim will reach the island by Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is now under the influence of the autumn northeasterly
monsoon winds from the Pacific, which bring moisture and cool air,

      <P>The cancellation of a meeting between

      <P>Philippine President Joseph Estrada defended
his personal support for former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim and said he is not interfering in that country's internal

      <P>Anwar was fired from his post and arrested last month on charges
of treason and sexual deviance. He appeared in court with bruises on
his face and arm which caused an outcry from the international

      <P>Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad lashed out at Estrada

Anwar's release and threatened to boycott the Asian-Pacific Economic

      <P>Xiamen has become mainland China's main hub
for Taiwan affairs as over 2,000 organizations have set up offices to
handle exchanges between Taiwan and the port city in Fujian province,
a radio station reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The mainland's Strait Voice said Taiwan travelers have paid a
total of 1.7 million visits to Xiamen since Taiwan lifted the ban on
travel across the Taiwan Strait in 1987. The number would be over 2
million if transit stops were added, accounting for about one sixth
of overall visits to mainland China by Taiwan travelers.</P>
      <P>Xiamen has always been among the top five mainland destinations
for Taiwan visitors, and one of the busiest ports in cross-strait
exchanges, the report said.</P>
      <P>As of the first half of this year, Xiamen residents have paid
3,783 visits to Taiwan for private purposes. Meanwhile, 703 persons
from around 180 Xiamen-based groups have visited Taiwan since 1992.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA SHOULD VALUE TAIWAN'S DEMOCRACY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia should value its economic ties
with Taiwan and the island's democracy because it is the future of
all of China, the Australian Financial Review said in an editorial on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is in almost every sense a country. It elects its own
government, raises its own taxes, has its own armed services -- which
would be a match for mainland invaders -- and prints its own
currency," the editorial said. "It holds the world's fourth-largest
reserves and is the 14th largest trading nation."</P>
      <P>Beijing has not had a long history of direct rule over Taiwan,
any more than Port Moresby has over Bougainville, or London over the
Falklands, it added.</P>
      <P>Because of Taiwan's accomplishments, Beijing's "one country, two
systems" principle which is applied to Hong Kong, would never work
for Taiwan, the editorial noted.</P>
      <P>"Now, more than ever, Asia needs the models of success that both
China and Taiwan hold out. They need to find ways to live together
more comfortably," it said. "China must renounce its right to use
force and Taiwan must permit direct communications, even though this
would be a blow to Hong Kong."</P>
      <P>"Pressure on Taiwan will increase next year as China prepares to
celebrate the 50th anniversary of the People's Republic of China on
Oct. 1. President Jiang Zemin -- who was not amused to receive a mild
lecture on democracy from his Taiwanese guest, Mr. Koo Chen-fu --
views taking over Taiwan as his great potential claim to historical
greatness," the editorial added.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan may be small by comparison with China, but it has a
bigger population than Australia and (its) trade with Australia is
booming. It is important that Australia is seen to value not just
those growing economic links but the model that Taiwan holds out to
the emerging mainland of a thriving, pluralist democracy, whose
leading high-tech sector symbolizes its role as a China of the
future," the editorial concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FRENCH PRESIDENT IMPRESSED BY BEAUTY OF CHINESE OBJETS D'ART</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By M. J. Tzou and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>French President Jacques Chirac visited the
Grand Palais in Paris on Sunday to view the ancient Chinese art
treasures from Taiwan's National Palace Museum, the European First
Radio Station reported on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chirac reportedly spent more than three hours browsing the
dazzling art collection from the Republic of China on Taiwan,
including calligraphic works, paintings, jade items, bronze pieces,
porcelains and other artifacts.</P>
      <P>The report said Chirac was deeply impressed by the beauty and
exquisiteness of the Chinese art objects on display.</P>
      <P>Chin Hsiao-yi -- director of the National Palace Museum, who is
in Paris to prepare for the exhibition of selected Chinese art
treasures -- reportedly accompanied Chirac on the tour of the
exhibits.</P>
      <P>Chin confirmed the report and said Chirac is well-versed in
Chinese culture and arts, particularly in Sung Dynasty jade pieces,
calligraphy and paintings.</P>
      <P>"Some 30 calligraphic and brush painting masterpieces from the
Sung Dynasty (960-1279 A.D.) were selected at Chirac's suggestion for
the current Grand Palais exhibition," Chin said.</P>
      <P>The exhibition of priceless art treasures from Taiwan, called
"Memoirs of an Empire: Treasures of the National Palace Museum,"
officially opened on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chirac chose to privately view the exhibition ahead of the formal
opening of the show in an apparent effort to avoid offending Beijing,
which is extremely sensitive to official contact with Taiwan by any
country which maintains diplomatic ties with it, the radio report
said.</P>
      <P>The inaugural ceremony for the exhibition of the 344-item
collection of art works from the National Palace Museum was jointly
presided over by French Culture Minister Catherine Trautmann,
Chairperson Lin Cheng-chih of the ROC's Council for Cultural Affairs
and Chin.</P>
      <P>More than 4,000 well-wishers, including French officials, art
connoisseurs and celebrities attended the grand opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the occasion, Trautmann said this was the first time
France has exhibited the most precious cultural and artistic legacies
from Asia.</P>
      <P>"The items on display are not only treasures but also
symbolize the essence of thousands of years of Chinese culture," the
French minister said.</P>
      <P>She thanked the ROC government, its representative office in
Paris and the National Palace Museum for helping organize the
exhibition, the first of its kind in Europe in more than 60 years.
A collection of selected ancient Chinese art objects was exhibited
in London in 1935 when the National Palace Museum was still in
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Trautmann said the exhibition marks yet another step forward in
cultural exchanges between the ROC and France. On behalf of the
French government, Trautmann conferred a cultural medal to Chin in
recognition of his contribution to the promotion of bilateral
cultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>The exhibition at the Grand Palais, the venue for the 1900 World
Expo, will last thorugh Jan. 25 next year. The rare arts show is
expected to attract 300,000 art lovers in France and even
neighboring European countries to take a glimpse into Chinese
cultural and arts heritage.</P>
      <P>Before the exhibition was officially opened, the ROC
representative office in Paris invited reporters from 11 French
papers and 60 major news organizations in other European countries to
view the precious art collection.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Tensions are expected to mount if
Malaysia proposes new rules designed to control international capital
flow at an APEC leaders summit in Kuala Lumpur next month, according
to political analysts.</P>
      <P>The analysts said Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is expected to
raise the issue at the summit because Malaysia is one of the Asian
countries hit hardest by the free capital flow during the Asian
financial crisis last year.</P>
      <P>But several countries, including Australia, would oppose
too-heavy international regulation.</P>
      <P>However, Australia is expected to agree with some sort of
compromise involving greater scrutiny of the behavior of hedge funds.</P>
      <P>The United States has openly criticized Malaysia's domestic
capital and currency restrictions, and has argued against the need
for a new international system of controls.</P>
      <P>Australia is expected to send a high-level delegation to the
summit scheduled to begin on November 12, to be led by Prime Minister
John Howard.</P>
      <P>Howard, who has played a low-key role in APEC activities in the
past, is expected to change his attitude toward the regional
organization, which was initiated by Australia in the late 1980s.</P>
      <P>"Our fundamental goal is to preserve APEC -- to keep it as a
vigorous and active and credible regional organization," one
Australian government official told reporters.</P>
      <P>He said APEC is regarded as a crucial regional economic
organization, and added that Australia is pushing to prevent a loss
of momentum and stalling -- particularly by Japan and mainland China
-- over the liberalization of key markets such as food, fisheries and
forestry.</P>
      <P>APEC has so far failed to play a major role in providing
financial help to any of its members hit by the Asian crisis. Only
the International Monetary Fund has played a major role in that
respect. But the IMF now finds it difficult to come to the rescue
because the crisis has spread to Russia and Latin America.</P>

Oksenberg, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Asia/Pacific
Research Center.</P>
      <P>The meetings between Koo and mainland Chinese President Jiang

because they started to deal face-to-face with political issues that

      <P>It is always better talking about political issues in person than
shouting across the strait, said the expert on Chinese affairs.</P>
      <P>Oksenberg said he believes that eventually, "leaders of the two

decided by the two sides themselves.</P>
      <P>Admitting that two sides of the Taiwan Strait are deeply divided
on many issues, Oksenberg said he remains confident that both sides

(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan manufacturing production index
in September 1998 registered 139.14, second only to the historic high
of December 1997, according to figures issued by the Statistics
Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The figures highlight the fact that Taiwan's capital-intensive
and high-tech industries have fared quite well, despite last year's
financial turmoil.</P>
      <P>Chang Yao-tsung, director-general of the Statistics Department,
said that this can be primarily attributed to the health of the
telecommunication industry, and to the resumption of normal
production in the petrochemical industry, as well as its newly
developed production capacity.</P>
      <P>However, Chang pointed out that although there was a rise in
September's manufacturing production index, skirmishing over market
price has been harsh and unforgiving.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, a number of factors are outwith Taiwan's
control, such as the weaker US currency, which has caused a decline
in US demand.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Southeast Asian countries still need time to recover

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  21  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's democratization is
crucial to the unification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, a
senior mainland affairs official said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), made the statement while briefing 47 foreign
ambassadors or representatives stationed in Taipei on the
just-concluded visit to the mainland by Taiwan's top negotiator with
Beijing, Koo Chen-fu.</P>
      <P>Lin told the foreign diplomats that Koo, chairman of the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), has managed to achieve three concrete
results during his Oct. 14-19 Shanghai-Beijing visit.</P>
      <P>For one thing, Lin said, Koo's ice-melting visit marked the
beginning of constructive dialogue across the Taiwan Strait. "Such
dialogue enabled the two sides to face up to their fundamental
differences and agree to continue face-to-face consultations,"
said the mainland affairs expert-turned-technocrat.</P>
      <P>Secondly, Lin said, the two sides have agreed to reinforce
dialogue and exchanges.</P>
      <P>"Thirdly, the two sides reached a four-point consensus,"
Lin said.</P>
      <P>The four-point deal was sealed by Koo and his mainland
counterpart, Chairman Wang Daohan of the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), in Shanghai on Oct. 15.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the consensus, Wang agreed to visit Taiwan at
an appropriate time. The three other key points include that the two
intermediary bodies respectively headed by Koo and Wang -- SEF and
ARATS -- agreed to resume dialogue, increase exchanges at various
levels and strengthen mutual assistance in handling incidents
involving the lives and property of Taiwan people visiting the
mainland, and vice versa.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are quasi-official organizations authorized by
their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in the
absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Lin also briefed the foreign envoys on Koo's meetings with
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier Qian Qichen,
as well as on the ROC's stances on some fundamental cross-strait
disputes.</P>
      <P>Lin said while mainland China insists that the so-called "one
China" refers to the People's Republic of China, Taipei stresses
that the one China refers to the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>"Basically, we hope Beijing will bravely face up to the reality
of a 'separately ruled China,'" Lin said, adding that the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait have been separately ruled by two equal
governments for the past five decades.</P>
      <P>Lin said Koo had briefed mainland President Jiang on Taiwan's
experience in economic development and democratization. "We hope
mainland China will democratize to narrow the gaps in political
systems between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>The senior mainland policy planner told the foreign envoys that
democracy is what mainland China needs badly. "Mainland China has
undergone economic reforms for nearly two decades. Its economy is
now at a crucial juncture. If it fails to democratize, its
economic development will hit snags and be stalled," Lin explained.</P>
      <P>He further stressed that mainalnd China's democratization will
provide a common basis for the unification of the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait. "This is why ROC President Lee Teng-hui has said if
mainland China democratizes, everything can be discussed," Lin said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DIALOGUE WITH MAINLAND CHINA SHOULD BE CONTINUED: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should continue having constructive
dialogue with mainland China, in order to overcome the long-running
stalemate in bilateral ties, ROC President and Kuomintang Chairman
Lee Teng-hui said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>As the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are still widely divided on
many basic issues, Lee said the major task for current cross-strait
relations is to continue constructive dialogue.</P>
      <P>The ruling KMT, Lee pointed out, must adopt a flexible policy to
keep up with the latest trends to help resolve the problems of major
concern to the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks at a weekly meeting of the party's elite
Central Standing Committee after hearing a report by Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) Chairman Koo Chen-fu on his recent landmark visit to
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Praising Koo's performance and hard work, which he described as
clearly conveying Taiwan basic stance on many key issues to mainland
China's leaders, Lee said that Koo's visit has paved the way for a
resumption of institutionalized communication channels between the
two sides after a hiatus of more than three years.</P>
      <P>Turning to the four-point consensus reached during Koo's meetings
with top mainland Chinese leaders, Lee said it is a good beginning,
and encouraged KMT members to continue working hard on the issue to
create a "win-win" situation for both sides.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Premier Vincent Siew said mainland
China's democratization is a prerequisite for Taiwan to consider
unification with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan is deeply concerned about mainland China's
democratization, Siew said that Taiwan is willing to share its
experience in this aspect in an effort to build a constructive
relationship with the mainland.</P>
      <P>The premier also hailed the performance of Koo's delegation in
mainland China. The historic visit has set a new benchmark in
bilateral ties, and has opened the way for future constructive
dialogue between the two sides, he said.</P>
      <P>Koo returned to Taiwan on Monday after concluding a six-day
ice-melting tour to Beijing and Shanghai at the head of a 12-member
delegation. The SEF chairman is the first top Taiwan envoy to visit
the mainland in nearly 50 years.</P>
      <P>Although the two sides remain sharply divided on many crucial
fronts, such as the "one China" dispute and "separate rule on the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait," Siew said the two sides must continue
their communications and dialogue in order to better deal with new
developments.</P>
      <P>Koo, for his part, said his visit has buttressed the reality that
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are two independent political
entities under separate rule. He said his frankness in spelling out
Taiwan's stance in this vein can be viewed as a watershed in
cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>According to Koo, his talks with mainland Chinese leaders about
Taiwan's democratization and the invitation to observe Taiwan's
December elections which he extended to his mainland Chinese
counterpart, Wang Daohan, chairman of the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait, should have had an impact on the Beijing
leadership.</P>
      <P>SEF Secretary-General Shi Hwei-yow, a member of Koo's delegation,
said Wang's agreement to visit Taiwan, probably in spring rather than
December, is of great importance to both sides.</P>
      <P>The delegation's trip has successfully guided cross-strait ties
onto the track of constructive dialogue, which is additional proof
that the KMT is capable of adequately handling cross-strait affairs
and exchanges, Shi asserted.</P>
      <P>Citing a public opinion poll released on Tuesday by the Far
Eastern Economic Review, Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Lin
Chong-pin said the KMT is Taiwan's most trustworthy political party
to deal with mainland China.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the survey found that 42 percent of the Taiwan
people have confidence in the KMT's ability to handle mainland China
affairs, in contrast to 9 percent which support the major opposition
Democratic Progressive Party. Only 1 percent of the respondents have
the same confidence for the pro-unification New Party.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui pledged on Wednesday
that the government of the Republic of China will continue to enhance
its services to overseas Chinese in order to improve their rights,
interests, and well-being.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks in a written speech delivered at a meeting
in celebration of the 46th Overseas Chinese Day.</P>
      <P>The president pointed out that over the last 50 years, the ROC,
with the joint efforts of all its compatriots at home and abroad, has
succeeded in creating a world-famous economic miracle, and a
political reform miracle, laying a solid foundation for future
national development.</P>
      <P>Looking at the coming millennium, Lee said national modernization
construction and a restructured government will consolidate the
island's democratic system, raise national competitiveness, safeguard
economic prosperity, speed up industrial development, and increase
the quality of life for the people.</P>
      <P>He added that the government will also promote world peace,
cooperation and prosperity, develop pragmatic diplomacy to expand its
international profile, and work for peaceful and equal cross-Taiwan
Strait exchanges to create lasting well-being for all Chinese people.</P>
      <P>The president gave high praise to overseas Chinese for their
outstanding contributions to the nation over the years.</P>
      <P>He expressed his hope that at the crucial moment of facing the
challenges of a new millennium, overseas Chinese everywhere will
continue to support the ROC government in its various construction
projects, and work hand-in-hand and with one heart with their
compatriots at home for a more brilliant future for the country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S FOREIGN TRADE RECOVERING GRADUALLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  21 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign trade recovered slightly
in the first half of October, but was still far away from the level
of last year, according to customs statistics.</P>
      <P>In the 15-day period, the island registered exports of US$4.81
billion, imports of US$4.42 billion, and a surplus of US$387.5
million, which are 29.4 percent, 24.1 percent, and 60.7 percent
lower, respectively, than the same period of last year, said Hsu
Kuo-chung, director of the Statistics Department at the Ministry of
Finance.</P>
      <P>Given the economic recession prevailing in the international
community, the plunge in Taiwan's foreign trade was natural, and the
extra good performance last October has only contributed to the sharp
percentage slide, said Hsu.</P>
      <P>Another reason behind the plunge is the fact that customs offices
were only open for 11 days in the first half of October, compared to
12.5 days in the corresponding period of last year, said Hsu.</P>
      <P>However, Hsu said there is a sliver lining, in that the average
value of goods clearing customs per day during the period, at
US$437.7 million, has continued an upward trend from US$396 million
in June, US$397 million in July, US$402 million in August, and US$413
million in September. Hsu said this is a solid sign of recovery in
exports.</P>
      <P>If the pace can be maintained for the rest of the month, the gap
in exports between this October and last October will have narrowed
to 13 percent, compared to 12.4 percent recorded for September, said
Hsu.</P>

(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The mere fact that Taiwan and mainland
China have started talking again, instead of hurling insults at each
other, is itself an achievement, Singapore's The Business Times said
in its editorial on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Given their history, it would have been too much to expect any
breakthrough in the reunification process in the just-ended
unofficial talks between the two sides, the paper said.</P>
      <P>So the promise of further exchanges -- including a dialogue on
political issues hitherto anathema to Taiwan -- is the most
significant outcome of the six-day visit to the mainland by Koo
Chen-fu, chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), it
went on.</P>
      <P>Koo's historic trip marked the highest level of exchange between
the two sides in almost 50 years, and represented the end of the
period of confrontation that began in July 1995, when the mainland
conducted a series of missile tests across the Taiwan strait.</P>
      <P>Koo's discussions with his mainland hosts saw some straight
talking. If anything, both sides stuck to their respective criteria
for reunification, the paper said.</P>
      <P>Their positions may remain intractable, but other factors are

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT ISSUES INSTRUCTIONS ON SOIL CONSERVATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  21  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Wednesday
demanded the restoration of areas damaged as a result of Typhoon Zeb,
and a thorough investigation of the floods and landslides that killed
several people around the island last week.</P>
      <P>Lee issued the instruction after being briefed by Interior
Minister Huang Chu-wen on typhoon Zeb, which left a trail of
destruction across the island, killing 23 people and causing more
than NT$2 billion (US$60.98 million)-worth of agricultural losses.</P>
      <P>Of the victims, five were killed in two hillside houses buried by
a mudslide in the Taipei suburb of Neihu. That incident, as well as
floodwater that inundated Hsichih township of Taipei County and many
other low-lying areas in northern Taiwan, shocked the head of state.</P>
      <P>Lee, who has expressed grave concern over soil conservation on
hillside land, said he feels sorry for the people who have lost lives
and property because of the typhoon.</P>
      <P>Lessons must be learned, the president said, stressing that
effective improvements in disaster relief capabilities, and stringent
measures to ensure soil conservation, must be put into effect.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Justice Minister Cheng Chung-mo inspected damage
caused by illegal logging and agriculture on hillside land around
Wulai village of Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Cheng was accompanied by State Public Prosecutor-General Lu
Ren-fa and Public Prosecutor-General Wu Ying-chao, as well as Taipei
County Magistrate Su Chen-chan.</P>
      <P>Looking at the blatant evidence of illegally logged hillside
areas on the outskirts of Taipei, where soil conservation has been
listed as the top priority, Cheng declared his solid determination to
crack down on those responsible.</P>
      <P>He stressed that punishment will be imposed to those damaging the

    <HEADLINE>US CONGRESS REITERATES SUPPORT FOR TAIWAN'S WTO BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By Bear  Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US Congress has urged State
Department officials to publicly support Taiwan's membership to the
World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>The US Congress made the call in the fiscal 1999 authorization
bill it passed on Monday.</P>
      <P>The bill noted that mainland China, by taking over the rule of
Hong Kong in 1997, has enjoyed substantial WTO privileges through the
WTO membership of the former British colony. Mainland China is still
far from being admitted to the world trade body as progress in
negotiations is slow.</P>
      <P>Since the US administrative branch has made public its intention
to make mainland China a WTO member, the US government should also
support the WTO admission of Taiwan, which is better qualified than
mainland China, it added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has nearly completed all the scheduled WTO negotiations
with other countries, and is the eighth largest trading partner of
the United States, the bill noted.</P>
      <P>But despite having made significant progress in negotiations for
its accession to the WTO, Taiwan has yet to offer acceptable trade
terms in the agricultural and certain other market sectors, it said.</P>
      <P>"It is in the economic interest of the United States consumers
and exporters to Taiwan to complete those requirements for accession
to the World Trade Organization at the earliest moment," the bill
said.</P>
      <P>The US administration has publicly said that it would throw its
support behind Taiwan's WTO bid, adding that it would not oppose the
membership of the island simply because mainland China is not
admitted to the WTO.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has insisted that its membership must come one
step ahead of Taiwan's.</P>
      <P>Taiwan applied to join the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade
(GATT), the predecessor of the WTO, under the name of "the Customs
Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu" in 1990, and was
awarded observer status in 1992. The mainland submitted its GATT
application 11 years ago, but progress has been slow due to its
failure to meet WTO requirements.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEXT KOO-WANG TALKS SHOULD TAKE PLACE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE: RESEARCHER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  20 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung &amp; Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The top two negotiators on both sides
of the Taiwan Strait should resume their talks as soon as possible in
order to normalize relations, a researcher suggested on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, researcher of National Unification Council, told
a news conference at the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative
Office in the United States that Taiwan is waiting for democracy to
take root in Chinese mainland. He added that the speed of future
cross-strait unification will depend on economic and democratic
developments on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chang's comments came after Taipei's Koo Chen-fu, chairman of
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), and Beijing's Wang Daohan,
chairman of Association of Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS)
met in Beijing and forged a four-point agreement last week.</P>
      <P>Only when the mainland speeds up its democratization that
unification of the two sides of the strait can be realized,
benefiting the Asia-Pacific region, the researcher said.</P>
      <P>Chang, who was a member of Koo's delegation which visited the
mainland recently, stressed that although Taiwan's democratic
structure is not perfect, it still has significance to the
development of China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's experiences are valuable to the mainland which is why
Koo suggested sharing them, particularly its democratic experiences,
with the mainland at a grassroots level, Chang said.</P>
      <P>In April 1993, Koo met Wang in Singapore and held talks in what
was the first contact between Taipei and Beijing since 1949. Beijing
severed ties when they postponed the second round of Koo-Wang talks
scheduled for June 1995.</P>
      <P>Koo's visit to the mainland and subsequent meetings with Wang and
other top-level officials including mainland Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, was a breakthrough step in the development in cross-strait
relations, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, who also served as deputy spokesman in Koo's
delegation, the recent meeting between Koo and Wang was the latest
example showing Taiwan's sincerity in its continued efforts to
improve the cross-strait relationship.</P>
      <P>Chang said that both Jiang and Vice Premier Qian Qichen have
expressed affirmation for the four points Koo and Wang forged during
their meeting. He added that since both sides has resumed contact,
they should continue their engagement in constructive dialogue.</P>
      <P>The mainland affairs expert pointed out that although enhanced
exchanges between SEF and ARATS will be conducive to reducing tension
across the Taiwan Strait, the next Koo-Wang talks should take place
as soon as possible in order to systemize negotiations. In this way,
he added, the cross-strait relationship can develop further.</P>

      <P>Canada's annual inflation rate was the
lowest since last December, hitting 0.7 percent, down from 0.8
percent in August, Statistics Canada (Statscan) reported on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The annual rate compares the month's consumer price index (CPI)
with that of the same month in the previous year. The last time a
lower annual price increase was recorded was in May 1962.</P>
      <P>Consumer prices fell 0.2 percent month-on-month, or between
August and September, marking the largest monthly decline this year.
The latest drop is not unique as monthly declines were seen five
times last year.</P>
      <P>The annual increase in the CPI has slowed since June 1998. The
modest CPI increase in September was due primarily to moderate
increases in fresh fruit prices and in travel accommodation rates,
Statscan noted.</P>
      <P>Officials attributed the 0.2 percent decline in the CPI from
August to September to lower prices for fresh fruit and vegetables,

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An economic recession will not likely occur
in Taiwan, nor is the term "Asian economic crisis" applicable to the
island, a senior official of the Bank of America (BOA) said on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Andrew F. Freris, a board director and president of BOA Asia,
said traditionally an economy can be considered in recession if it
undergoes negative growth for two consecutive quarters. To date, the
economies of Taiwan, mainland China, the Philippines, Singapore and
India have not been plagued by the phenomenon.</P>
      <P>Freris said it is not practical to view Asia as one country when
assessing investment climate and prospects. "You have to make the
assessment based on the respective economies' individuality."</P>
      <P>In his speech made at the American Chamber of Commerce on the
prospects of the Asian finances, Freris forecast that Taiwan's
economy will grow by 5 percent in both 1998 and 1999 despite the
regional economic woes.</P>
      <P>Freris discounted the usual stereotype of the Taiwan economy with
exports being the backbone of its growth. He said domestic
consumption and investments are virtually the prime movers of the
island's economic growth.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's pragmatic diplomacy policy
remains unchanged after the recent high-level contact between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait, Foreign Minister Jason Hu said on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hu said the government will not unilaterally cut nor increase
overseas visits by ranking officials simply because the highest-level
talks across the strait were held after a hiatus of three years.</P>
      <P>Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's top negotiator to the mainland, met with
his mainland counterpart Wang Daohan in Shanghai during the first leg
of his mainland visit which took place from Oct. 14-19.</P>
      <P>The two reached a four-point agreement which included increased
exchanges between the two intermediary agencies they head. Koo also
spoke with President Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier Qian Qichen in
separate meetings in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Hu said public perception that the two sides reached
rapprochement in Koo's "ice-melting" trip was misleading as Beijing's
attempt to squeeze Taiwan diplomatically has only increased unabated.</P>
      <P>The number of official government overseas visits will not be
affected by the Koo-Wang meeting, the foreign minister said, adding
that such visits will not be deliberately decreased or increased.</P>
      <P>Hu said amid Beijing's relentless suppression of Taiwan, many
considerations must be made in the overseas visits by ranking
officials. Visits may be cut in the run up to the year-end elections
as officials will be busy with their duties as well as stumping for

    <DATELINE>Manila  Oct.  21  (CNA)
(By Timothy Sun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A postponed joint defense meeting between
the Philippines and Malaysia has been rescheduled for Nov. 8-10 in
Manila, Philippine presidential spokesman Jerry Barican announced on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Kuala Lumpur earlier canceled the meeting amid speculation that
diplomatic relations between the two were strained by the war of
words over the jailing of former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim. Philippine President Joseph Estrada had been vocal in
his support for Anwar while Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
accused Estrada of meddling in Malaysia's internal affairs.</P>
      <P>Barican expressed confidence that diplomatic relations between
the two countries remain intact. "The president will go to Malaysia,
confer with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and the other
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders," he stated.</P>
      <P>"President Estrada is looking forward to a very productive visit
to Malaysia," Barican said.</P>
      <P>Kuala Lumpur has notified Estrada and Defense Secretary Orlando
Mercado that the earlier cancellation of the meeting was in no way
related to the issue over Anwar's arrest, the press secretary noted.</P>
      <P>According to the Malaysian Defense Ministry, the meeting was
canceled due to financial and scheduling constraints.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA'S ECONOMY SAID LIKE A FORCED-FED DUCK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's economy has been
compared to a forced-fed duck as Chinese and Western economists
challenge the rosy official statistics Beijing has projected, the
Sydney Morning Herald reported.</P>
      <P>Government spending and increased lending to state-owned
enterprises could only further damage a debt-ridden banking system
which is already technically insolvent, the report said. This in turn
could increase the risk of a financial crash in China.</P>
      <P>Despite this threat, a spokesman for the State Statistical Bureau
said the mainland's economy had picked up speed in the third quarter
to reach 7.6 percent and now had the momentum to reach the official
target of 8 percent for the full year.</P>
      <P>However, some economists point to conflicting figures and flaws
in the method of calculating output and question the likelihood that
China can achieve the 8 percent growth target authorities have
forecast to avert an economic crisis.</P>
      <P>"I think it is utterly impossible. Some foreign experts think
China's economic growth is at most 3 percent, but I don't think that
is correct either. China's economy is like a forced-fed duck,"
economic commentator Peng Ming was quoted as saying. He added, "It's
bloated. The real rate of growth is negative."</P>
      <P>Peng and other economists point to misleading growth figures that
include huge stockpiles of unsalable goods, mountainous bad debt in
banks that should be written off, poorly planned public works and
empty commercial and residential developments.</P>
      <P>Industrial output had grown 8 percent in the first three quarters
of this year, but electricity generated rose only 2 percent. Experts
questioned the validity of Chinese growth figures because industry is
reliant on electricity. Consumer spending jumped 6.3 percent in the
first nine months compared with the same period last year, but retail
prices fell 2.5 percent, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>Economists believe officials and regional leaders in China have
submitted bogus figures just to match the target set by Premier Zhu
Rongji, who wants the growth rate to create more jobs and absorb
workers from collapsing state-owned industries, the paper said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN BUILDERS SEE DOWNTURN IN HOUSING INDUSTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,   Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's US$32 billion housing
industry is shrinking, residential contract construction is declining
and a 10 percent goods and service tax threatens further uncertainty,
the Australian Financial Review reported.</P>
      <P>Large builders in Sydney, Queensland and other states expect a
drop in their business and are prepared to lay off workers and
reshape their organizations to cope with the downturn in demand, the
paper said.</P>
      <P>BIS-Shrapnel's director of building services Bob Mellor said he
expected new housing activity across Australia to drop from about
160,000 starts in 1999-2000 to just 120,000 in the "pretty tough
year" of 2000-2001, the Review said.</P>
      <P>Mellor and other builders said the 10-percent goods and service
tax (GST) -- to be introduced July 1, 2000 -- is a wild card for the
housing industry because buyers will have an additional financial
burden when buying homes.</P>
      <P>The booming housing sector in Sydney from 1996 to 1999 is
expected to slow after the end of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games as
demand is expected to weaken.</P>
      <P>In New South Wales, transactions of all types of residential
property -- new and old houses, units and land -- have continued to
slide. In Queensland and other states, the boom is non-existent and
builders are already forecasting a downturn in housing business.</P>
      <P>The only city still active in housing construction is Melbourne.
But builders expressed doubt as to whether such strong gains would
continue momentum in the months to come.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan, facing a record trade deficit with
Japan, is planning to send a large trade delegation to Japan to
address the problem.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan reached nearly US$13.32 billion
in the first three quarters this year, up 7.3 percent from the same
period last year, statistics released by the Board of Foreign Trade
(BOFT) showed. Last year's trade deficit with Japan was US$17.33
billion.</P>
      <P>The figures were presented in a government-sponsored conference
on the promotion of trade with Japan in Taipei on Thursday. Other
discussion topics included case studies of successful businesses
operating in Japan and the introduction of technology from that
country.</P>
      <P>Lee Shang-Chia, secretary general of Sino-Japanese Economic Trade
Foundation, said the most effective way to address the trade deficit
issue was to send a large delegation to Japan to promote increased
trade with Taiwan, and allow local businessmen to meet with their
Japan counterparts.</P>
      <P>Noting that many of the key technologies of Taiwan manufacturers
have been in Japan's hands, he said introducing Japanese technology
to the domestic businessmen would help reduce the trade deficit at
its source.</P>
      <P>The government is planning to send a delegation to Japan on Nov.
15 to learn more about their technology.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>King Mswati III of the Kingdom of Swaziland
arrived in Taipei on Thursday for a six-day state visit, according to
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).</P>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister Jason Hu met King Mswati III and his
entourage at the Chiang Kai-shek International Airport upon their
arrival.</P>
      <P>Swaziland has been actively enhancing its relations with Asian
countries in recent years, a MOFA official said. King Mswati III
visited Malaysia and Japan before arriving at the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Taiwan, the King will meet with President Lee
Teng-hui to exchange views on current international affairs and
matters of mutual concern. He will also meet ROC government officials
and visit cultural and economic establishments.</P>
      <P>The ROC and Swaziland have maintained close ties, the MOFA
official said. In September, President Lee sent Ding Mou-shih,
secretary general of the National Security Council, as his special
envoy to attend the celebrations marking the 30th anniversary of
independence of the Kingdom of Swaziland and the 30th birthday of the
King.</P>
      <P>At the recent UN General Assembly session, Swaziland again spoke
in support of the ROC's bid to join the UN and other international
organizations.</P>
      <P>This year also marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of
diplomatic ties between the ROC and the Kingdom of Swaziland. The
King's visit to Taipei at this time therefore carries great
significance, the official noted.</P>
      <P>Members of King Mswati III's entourage include Albert H.
Shabangu, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Absalom M. Dlamini,
Minister of Economic Planning and Development; Dr. Sishayi S.
Nxumalo, Chairman of the Swaziland Investment Promotion Authority;
and several business leaders.</P>
      <P>The Swaziland delegation is scheduled to conclude its visit on Oct.

    <HEADLINE>ROC FIRST LADY ON EUROPE VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
on Thursday confirmed a press report that the Republic of China's
first lady is currently on a visit to France.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Roy Wu said Tseng Wen-hui, wife of President Lee
Teng-hui, left for France on Wednesday for a four-day visit.</P>
      <P>"During her stay in Paris, Mrs. Lee will attend a Sino-French
Cultural Award presentation ceremony and visit the Grand Palais
where a collection of selected ancient Chinese art treasures
from the ROC's National Palace Museum is being exhibited," Wu said.</P>
      <P>The spokesman stressed that Mrs. Lee's France visit focuses on
sightseeing and cultural activities.</P>
      <P>The annual Sino-French Cultural Award is jointly sponsored by the
ROC's Council for Cultural Affairs and the Institute of France, the
highest French academic body, to honor European organizations or
individuals dedicated to research of Chinese culture and
language.</P>
      <P>The award went to the Ricci Institute this year for its
compilation of a grand French dictionary of the Chinese language.</P>
      <P>As the ROC does not maintain formal diplomatic ties with France,
Mrs. Lee's visit is kept at a low profile.</P>
      <P>Wu said Mrs. Lee is scheduled to leave France for the Vatican on
Oct. 26 in the company of a 33-member Taiwan aboriginal music chorus.
Mrs. Lee will present felicitations, on behalf of President Lee, to
Pope John Paul II on the 20th anniversary of his coronation. The
Taiwan aboriginal chorus will perform before the pope to pay tribute
to him.</P>
      <P>Wu said Mrs. Lee and her entourage will stay in Italy for four
days. The Vatican is the ROC's only diplomatic ally in Europe.</P>
      <P>On her return trip, Wu said, Mrs. Lee will make a transit stop
in Vienna.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Lee's current visit marks the ROC first lady's first trip
to Europe. Diplomatic observers said although the trip is of a
private nature, it still carries much significance to the
government's efforts to break out of the diplomatic isolation
imposed by Beijing.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China on Taiwan has become
one of the most important markets for Thai imports, as the Southeast
Asian nation is struggling to battle back against a regional economic
crisis.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, the United States, the European Union, Australia and
Africa imported increased quantities of Thai products from January to
August of this year, while Japan, Hong Kong, mainland China, South
Korea, Association of Southeast Asian Nation member states, Eastern
Europe and the Middle East are among the countries and territories
that have brought in fewer Thai goods during the period, officials
with the Thai Ministry of Commerce said.</P>
      <P>The report noted that the regional crisis in Asia has lowered
Asian countries' purchasing power, while Russia's financial crisis
has weakened imports from East Europe.</P>
      <P>The prices of several key Thai industrial goods, such as gems and
jewelry; shoes and accessories; and integrated circuits were reduced
significantly to enable them to compete with products from South
Korea and mainland China, the ministry said in a report.</P>
      <P>Earnings from integrated circuit exports totaled US$1.47 billion,
from gems and jewelry US$888 million and from shoes and accessories
US$613 million.</P>
      <P>The ministry said that the average price of exports, especially
farm and agro-industrial goods, saw a 15 percent decline over the
first eight months of this year, despite rising export volumes.</P>
      <P>The export value of frozen and processed chickens fell by 20.5
percent over the period, while the export value of rubber dropped
36.8 percent. Export volumes, meanwhile, rose 46.4 percent and 10.6
percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Exports from Thailand in the first eight months of this year have
declined by 5.2 percent to US$35.96 billion compared with the same
period last year.</P>
      <P>Imports to Thailand have dropped during the period by 36.8
percent to US$28.49 billion. This has resulted in a trade surplus of
US$7.4 billion for the eight-month period.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's "great strength" will ensure
a quick recovery from what will prove only a temporary economic
downturn, said former US Defense Secretary Casper Weinberger.</P>
      <P>Now chairman of Forbes magazine, Weinberger was in Singapore
Wednesday to gather information for a column he writes for the US
business magazine.</P>
      <P>Weinberger, along with the grandson of the magazine's founder,
met Wednesday with Prime Minister Goh Chok tong and attended meetings
with the Trade Development Board and the National Science and
Technology Board.</P>
      <P>"Singapore has accomplished so much and has such great strength
that I can't believe it will be down for very long," said Weinberger.</P>
      <P>He said that Singapore's present condition is due mainly to the
problems of some of its neighbors. He also cited developments in
mainland China as affecting the region's ability to recover from its
present economic slump.</P>
      <P>"A lot will depend on whether China remains intent on sustaining
economic growth, or whether it moves towards an aggressive foreign
policy -- though I don't believe they will do that.</P>
      <P>"There will be differences, too, in the rates of recovery around
the region, and those governments that encourage and reward growth
and are eager to have foreign trade with countries that are strong
and follow free market principles, will succeed," he said.</P>

      <P>As Taiwan's frozen food industry is experiencing difficulty in
exporting its goods to industrially advanced nations with stringent
environmental protection laws, the French businesses promised to send
experts to Taiwan to help businesses improve the quality of their
frozen food storage techniques.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Another locally built 500-ton-class
naval patrol vessel was christened and launched on Thursday at the
state-run China Shipbuilding Corp.'s (CSBC's) shipyard in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Navy Deputy Commander-in-Chief Shen Fang-hsiang personally
presided over the christening and launching ceremony for the new
CSBC-built offshore patrol ship.</P>
      <P>The vessel, christened the Feng-chiang (Phoenix River), was the
third Chin-chiang-class coastal patrol ship built under the ROC
Navy's Kuanghua No. 3 warship building program.</P>
      <P>The Feng-chiang will undergo a series of navigation tests and
weaponry installation following its launch , naval officials said,
adding that the Navy will take delivery of the ship only after it
ascertains that the craft's quality and overall equipment meet its
requirements.</P>
      <P>The officials said the Chin-chiang-class patrol boat, standing
61 meters long and nine meters wide, possesses high mobility and
requires neither a large crew nor large maintenance costs.</P>
      <P>The vessel, armed with advanced image scanning and sonar
systems, will be responsible for offshore surveillance and regional
patrol after it is commissioned into service, the officials said.</P>
      <P>During wartime, the officials said, the ship can be armed with
additional weaponry systems and coordinate with mainstream warships
in conducting interception and anti-landing operations.</P>
      <P>The ship can also be charged with rescue missions and
protection of local fishermen.</P>
      <P>Under the Kuanghua No. 3 program, the Navy has commissioned the
CSBC to build a total of 11 offshore patrol ships patterned after
the locally-designed, 500-ton-class Chin-chiang vessel, which was
commissioned on Dec. 1, 1994.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER SAYS CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS ENTERING NEW STAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 22 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In the wake of a trip to mainland China by
Taipei's top envoy, Koo Chen-fu, cross-strait relations are entering
a new stage of development, in which the government should be in
control and forge a plan accordingly, said Premier Vincent Siew on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan is scheduled to hold a meeting on mainland
affairs operations on Nov. 2, and Siew said he is willing to hear
suggestions from all administrative quarters aimed at achieving
mutually-beneficial cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>The premier made his remarks after the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) delivered a report on Koo's mainland trip at the Cabinet's
weekly meeting. Koo, chairman of the quasi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), returned Monday from a landmark six-day visit to
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Siew said that the success of Koo's delegation is beneficial to
the normalization of the operations between the two sides and that it
lays the groundwork for the resumption of institutionalized
communication.</P>
      <P>Siew said he appreciated the efforts of the delegation, and he
praised MAC and SEF as well.</P>
      <P>Since cross-strait relations are entering a new stage of
development after Koo's mainland visit, and as a constructive
dialogue is being started, exchanges between Taipei and Beijing will
take on a new form, said Siew.</P>
      <P>The government should do its best to resolve matters concerning
the rights and interests of people from both sides, Siew added.</P>
      <P>The activities of and opinions expressed by Koo's delegation
while in the mainland should be explained to Taiwan's domestic sector
at an appropriate time, Siew said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ADMINISTRATIVE GUIDELINES FOR FISCAL 2000 MAPPED OUT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan on Thursday passed
administrative guidelines for fiscal 2000, giving top priority to a
comprehensive policy to beef up national strength, democratic
politics and social stability.</P>
      <P>"The plan will push for governmental restructuring and the
strengthening of relations between the central and local
governments," an Executive Yuan official said in the preface to the
administrative guidelines. Fiscal year 2000 begins July 1, 1999.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, the official said, Taiwan has managed to
achieve stable economic growth in the face of the Asian economic
crisis and has witnessed higher-level democratic politics and social
stability.</P>
      <P>For the upcoming year, the government will continue to bolster
national security, enhance democratic reforms, accelerate
cross-strait interactions, win more support from the international
community and explore greater business opportunities for the private
sector, the official noted.</P>
      <P>The plan, which contains guidelines in 18 sections, will help
secure national survival and sustainable development; promote
cross-strait exchanges; accelerate economic growth; bolster social
security; raise the public's standard of living; reasonably clarify
the rights and responsibilities of the central and local governments;
and promote educational reforms, the official continued.</P>
      <P>In the face of Beijing's stepped-up schemes to isolate Taiwan,
the Executive Yuan will continue to seek participation in
international organizations and activities through more effective
channels.</P>
      <P>As to the much-talked-about national pension system, the
government will provide payments of NT$2,000 a month to those ROC
citizens 65 years old or older starting in 2000. So-called smart
cards, which will function as combination identity and national
health insurance cards, will be introduced by then also, the official
said.</P>
      <P>On the upcoming return of Macao to mainland Chinese rule, the
official said the government will work to promote trade and cultural
exchanges between Taiwan and the Portuguese enclave.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP POLL FINDS WIDE SUPPORT FOR 'ONE TAIWAN, ONE CHINA'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of local people support the
use of "one Taiwan, one China" to describe the current relations
across the Taiwan Strait, the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Quoting the results of a public opinion poll conducted by the
party on Oct. 19-20, the DPP said 52 percent of the respondents
favor using "one Taiwan, one China, and two countries" to portray the
current state of cross-strait relations, while 31 percent disagree
with such a concept.</P>
      <P>The pro-con ratio for using "two Chinas, two countries" to
depict cross-strait relations was 48 percent to 32 percent,
according to the poll.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 42 percent gave a thumbs-up to the statement that the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait now exist two equal governments, but
an almost equal 40 percent said they oppose using such a concept to
describe current cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Only 4 percent agreed with the statement that Taiwan is a local
government under China, but an overwhelming 79 percent said they
cannot accept such a concept.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the poll results, the DPP said most Taiwan people
perceive Taiwan and China as two countries on an equal footing. As
for the various descriptions of cross-strait ties, such as "one
Taiwan, one China," "two Chinas" and "two equal governments," most
people do not precisely discern their differences.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 991 adults residing across the island also
found that 47 percent felt mainland Chinese leaders showed a hostile
attitude toward Taiwan during top Taiwan envoy Koo Chen-fu's
high-profile visit to mainland China; only 31 percent said they felt
mainland leaders were friendly.</P>
      <P>According to the same survey, 26 percent said they felt the Koo
delegation had clearly expressed that the current state of
cross-strait relations is "one country, two equal governments"
during its mainland visit; 14 percent said they felt the Koo
delegation had conveyed the message of "one Taiwan, one China;" 5
percent said the delegation had conveyed the message of "two Chinas;"
6 percent said the delegation expressed a message of "Taiwan is a
local government under China;" while 47 percent said they don't know
what message the delegation has convened during it Oct. 14-19
mainland visit.</P>
      <P>Quoting the poll results, DPP Secretary-General Chiou Yi-jen
said the Koo delegation apparently has not accurately
conveyed most local people's perception of the current
state of cross-strait to Beijing leaders -- "Taiwan and China are two
separate countries on an equal footing."</P>
      <P>Chiou further said the ruling Kuomintang's "one China"
policy has made local people unable to think clearly about Taiwan's
identity and status.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRC ABLE TO HARASS TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  Oct. 22 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The military of mainland China is now able
to badly harass Taiwan's shipping and economic activities, although
it is still unable to invade the island successfully, the
International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) in London said.</P>
      <P>The IISS said in the latest issue of Military Balance that
mainland China's military strength is growing, but it will take
several more years to make a significant advancement. Its ability to
project conventional forces beyond its borders is still limited, too.</P>
      <P>The yearly report said however that mainland China can easily
harass Taiwan's shipping and economic activities and is able to seize
Taiwan's small offshore islands near the mainland.</P>
      <P>Mainland China could be able to significantly increase its
military strength in the next 10 years because of its efforts to
acquire foreign military technology, it added.</P>
      <P>The report pointed out that Taiwan is also trying to increase
its defense capability. Taiwan has acquired a new generation of
weapons, including US-made F16 jet fighters, French-made Mirage
2000-5 warplanes, high speed frigates and other warships, and the
Patriot air-defense missile system.</P>
      <P>Because many of the new weapons were delivered last year, Taiwan
ranked second on the list of the world's major arms importers with
US$7.7 billion in 1997. Saudi Arabia ranked first with US$11
billion in the year. The two countries accounted for 39 percent of
the world's arms trade last year, the report said.</P>

      <P>Female candidates from the opposition New
Party (NP) for the year-end elections on Thursday formed the "New
Women's Alliance" in Taipei, and denounced "hereditary politics based
on male chauvinism."</P>
      <P>Incumbent legislators Kao Huei-yu and Chu Huei-liang, incumbent
Taipei City Councilor Chin Li-fan, along with Huang Shan-shan and
Chen You-hsueh, both of whom will seek city council seats in the
upcoming elections, jointly set up the alliance, and pledged to sweep
aside barriers to women in political society built from the male
perspective.</P>
      <P>They criticized hereditary politics, blaming the system for
allowing corruption, bribery and dishonest behavior in politics, all
of which, they claim, are rotting the island's democratic political
environment. They pointed out that although many different people are
chosen to represent the people, most of them come from just a few
families.</P>
      <P>These few families control the island's politics, the NP members
alleged, adding that not only the ruling Kuomintang, but also the
major opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), suffer from this
problem, which is damaging the democracy that the island has been
striving for.</P>
      <P>The New Women's Alliance will try to eliminate the problem and
stamp out dishonest behavior in society, according to Kao,
spokeswoman for the alliance.</P>
      <P>The New Party is Taiwan's third-largest opposition party. It was
established as a result of opposition to the so-called "undemocratic
practices of the KMT and the DPP in their advocacy of Taiwan
independence."</P>
      <P>NP candidate for Taipei mayor Wang Chien-shien attended the press
conference called to announce the establishment of the alliance, and
lent his support to the group. He also spoke of his policies relating
to women's affairs, and pledged that if elected as mayor of Taipei

    <HEADLINE>KMT MOST TRUSTED TO HANDLE CROSS-STRAIT AFFAIRS: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 40 percent of the people of Taiwan
think the ruling Kuomintang is most capable of handling cross-Taiwan
Strait affairs, according to the results of a survey made public on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the public opinion poll carried out by the KMT, only
7 percent and 1 percent, respectively, of the respondents think the
major opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the
pro-unification New Party are up to the task.</P>
      <P>About 32 percent of Taiwan's people believe that the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait are more widely divided in terms of democratic than
in economic development, while 20 percent think the two sides are
sharply divided in economic development, according to the survey.
Some 30 percent said they think there is a big gap between the two
sides on both the political and economic fronts.</P>
      <P>As to the question of the best venue for a meeting of the leaders
of the two sides, around 54 percent said Taiwan and mainland Chinese
leaders should meet in an international setting or in a third
country. Some 11 percent favor a meeting in Taiwan, ahead of 6
percent and 3 percent who would prefer such a meeting to take place
in Hong Kong and mainland China, respectively.</P>
      <P>Some 34 percent of the respondents think the two sides should
first clinch a peace agreement if a systemic negotiation mechanism is
set up, followed by 24 percent who said the two sides should first
address issues related to investment guarantees and travel security,
the survey found. About 20 percent contend that Taiwan and the
mainland should cooperate in crime fighting, battling the financial
crisis, and agriculture.</P>
      <P>On the issue of Taiwan's unification with mainland China, 46
percent said Taiwan should discuss the issue with the mainland only
after the other side of the Taiwan Strait becomes a full democracy.
Twenty-one percent said Taiwan can conduct talks on unification while
at the same time pushing the mainland toward democratic reform,
according to the poll.</P>
      <P>Only 4 percent said they could accept unification with the
mainland before it becomes a democracy, in contrast to 8 percent who
said Taiwan need not unify with the mainland.</P>
      <P>As to the question of whether Taiwan and mainland China should
discuss unification under the "one China" framework, 72 percent said
"no," while 13 percent said "yes." Only 7 percent said it depends on
the definition of "one China."</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by telephone on Oct. 17-19 among 1,087
people islandwide over the age of 20.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOWNSIZED PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT WILL REMAIN PUBLIC ENTITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Provincial Government will
remain a public juristic person, or legal entity, after being
downsized, the Council of Grand Justices said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>With its interpretation of the Republic of China's Constitution,
the council delivered a blow to the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and its
"ally of convenience" at the legislature, the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), both of which advocate the abolishment of the Taiwan
Provincial Government.</P>
      <P>Council Interpretation No. 467 said that although the Ninth
Article of Additional Articles of the Constitution provides for the
streamlining of the Taiwan Provincial Government, and rids it of its
legislative and administrative powers under the Constitution, the
provincial government is still a part of the hierarchy of autonomy,
and that giving it a status as a public entity of non-autonomous
organization is out of the question.</P>
      <P>That means the provincial government is a subject capable of
exercising rights and bearing responsibility within the scope of its
authority which is not transferred by law to the central government
or the local government under the streamlining program, according to
the interpretation.</P>
      <P>The council decision has raised as many questions as it has
answered, with provincial government supporters hailing it as a
victory, while its opponents either denounced it as flawed, or vowed
to press for modification of the law.</P>
      <P>The interpretation clashed with a statute railroaded through the
Legislative Yuan by the KMT and DPP on Oct. 9 under the auspices of
the government's modernization program which strips the provincial
government of its status as a legal entity.</P>
      <P>The statute on streamlining the provincial government denied it
any capacity as a functioning individual, despite the Additional
Articles of the Constitution which provided to the contrary.</P>
      <P>The minor opposition New Party, which sees the marginalization of
the provincial government as a step toward de facto Taiwan
independence, turned to the Council of the Grand Justices for an
explanation after it failed to scuttle the statute at the
legislature.</P>
      <P>New Party Legislator Hau Lung-ping, who initiated the motion for
constitutional interpretation, lauded the decision, saying that it
vindicates the New Party's claim that the downsizing of the
provincial government is not the same as abandoning it altogether.</P>
      <P>Party leader Chen Kuei-miao said the statute on streamlining the
provincial government which was contradicted by the grand justices
should be declared null and void unless it can be revised in line
with the council's interpretation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DPP denounced the interpretation as
"unconstitutional."</P>
      <P>The head of the DPP working group on the issue at the
Legislature, Lin Chu-shui, chastised the council as "unwise and
dodging its constitutional role" as the final arbitrator of
constitutional disputes.</P>
      <P>"Instead of being a troubleshooter, the council is whipping up
more disputes by this interpretation," said Lin.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislative Whip Chou Po-lung vowed to push ahead with the
party's program to "get rid of the provincial government" by moving
to alter the rules concerning local self-government, in defiance of
the interpretation.</P>
      <P>The KMT leader at the legislature, Jao Ying-chi, took the setback
in his stride, however, saying that the statute on provincial
downsizing will be modified according to the Constitution, rather
than being shelved as demanded by the New Party.</P>
      <P>"The KMT will abide by the decision of the Council of Grand
Justices, but the statute will not be scrapped totally," he said.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Interior, which is spearheading the government's
efforts to downsize the provincial government, and has insisted all
along that the reformed provincial government should no longer be a
public legal entity, emphasized that the task of transferring the
business of the provincial government to central and local government
agencies is already under way and will not be affected by the
interpretation.</P>
      <P>The government spokesman, Director General of the Government
Information Office Chen Chien-jen, refused to comment on the issue,
saying only that the Executive Yuan is studying the implications of
the interpretation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Provincial Governor and KMT member James Soong, an
outspoken critic of the party's advocacy of cutting down the
provincial government, also maintained his silence, while the
Director of the Information Office at the Taiwan Provincial
Government, Chen Wei-Jen, said the provincial government will have no
comment until the full implication of the interpretation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HUNGARIAN PRIEST IN TAIWAN TO BE HONORED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bonn,  Oct. 22 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Dr. Imre Zsoldos, a Hungarian priest who has
spent nearly 40 years teaching and doing missionary service in
Taiwan, will be cited by Hungarian Prime Minister Vikto Orban on
Friday in recognition of his lifelong devotion to education.</P>
      <P>The Hungarian government is scheduled to hold a ceremony Friday
marking the country's 1956 Uprising Day. Zsoldos' being cited on
Friday carries great significance to him because he himself was a
victim of that civil uprising and had to flee the country as a
result.</P>
      <P>After the eruption of Hungary's civil war in 1956, Zsoldos
studied in Austria, the United States and France. He then traveled to
Taiwan, where he has spent almost all his adult life.</P>
      <P>Prime Minister Orban became acquainted with Zsoldos in June of
1997 when he visited Taipei as an opposition political leader from
Hungary. Zsoldos was invited by the ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs
to act as an interpreter between Orban and the Taipei government.
Orban has said that he was profoundly impressed by Zsoldos' language
skills.</P>
      <P>Zsoldos speaks seven languages: Hungarian, French, German,
Russian, Spanish, English and Mandarin.</P>
      <P>Orban met Zsoldos again this year when Zsoldos returned to his
hometown for a vacation in August.</P>
      <P>Orban, who was named prime minister in June, wants Zsoldos to
return to Hungary eventually so that he can share his expertise and
experiences in international affairs to help the Hungarian people.</P>
      <P>Zsoldos, who holds a Ph.D. in linguistics from Georgetown
University in the United States, was assigned by his Catholic
superior to Taiwan in 1964 to help found Fu Jen Catholic University
in the Taipei suburb of Hsinchuang.</P>
      <P>He founded the French department and a graduate institute for
French studies at Fu Jen, and headed the French department for 11
years before being appointed dean of the university's College of
Foreign Languages.</P>
      <P>Zsoldos said he likes Taiwan and is particularly moved by the
warmth, patience and perseverance the Chinese living on the island
have shown.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has long recognized Zsoldos' devotion to his "second
fatherland." President Lee Teng-hui received him and several other
foreign missionaries in May in recognition of their unselfish
contributions to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RELATIONS WITH HAITI REMAINS FIRM: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Relations between the Republic of China and
the Caribbean nation of Haiti remain firm and solid, a senior
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-cheng, deputy director of the MOFA's Department of
Information and Cultural Affairs, made the statement in response to
reports that mainland Chinese Ambassador to the United Nations Qin
Huasun made a secret visit to Haiti earlier this week.</P>
      <P>Chen said MOFA has ordered the ROC Embassy in Haiti to look into
the main purposes of Qin's visit.</P>
      <P>"We are concerned about Qin's move. Nevertheless, we don't think
that Qin's visit would jeopardize our relations with our longtime
ally," Chen said, adding that ROC-Haiti relations have remained
strong and show no signs of weakening.</P>
      <P>"Haiti's President Rene Preval just made a state visit to the ROC
in April and its Foreign Minister Fritz Lonchamps also voiced
explicit support for the ROC's bid to rejoin the United Nations
during the just-concluded UN General Assembly debate session," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chen said, scores of cooperative programs struck
during Preval' Taipei visit have proceeded smoothly.</P>
      <P>The senior MOFA official went on to say that the ROC is
currently assisting Haiti in building an export processing zone,
undertaking a nationwide forestation program, establishing a
vocational training center and expanding agricultural production.</P>
      <P>"All these programs have made headway. We see no signs that our
relations with Haiti are facing a crisis as some media have
reported," Chen stressed.</P>
      <P>Chen said although Taiwan's top negotiator with Beijing, Koo
Chen-fu, made a goodwill visit to mainland China earlier this month
to forge cross-strait rapprochement, Beijing has not eased its
diplomatic offensive against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the contrary, Chen said, Beijing has stepped up efforts to
lobby the ROC's 27 diplomatic allies to switch diplomatic
allegiance. Panama, Costa Rica and Haiti are all Beijing's priority
targets.</P>

      <P>In California's heated race for the
US Senate, Republican candidate Matt Fong received a huge boost on
Thursday as The San Francisco Chronicle publicly endorsed him,
calling Fond "the real fighter that California needs in the US

      <P>Citing Fong's position on issues ranging from taxes to the
environment to abortion, the Chronicle editorial said a senator from
the nation's largest state should be reaching for major
accomplishments.</P>
      <P>Fong's opponent, incumbent Democrat Barbara Boxer, has failed to
do so, according to the paper. "Her influence on Capitol Hill never
really reached a level commensurate with the size and economic clout
of this state."</P>
      <P>Perhaps the most telling sign of Boxer's lack of major
accomplishments is that, after six years in the Senate, her campaign
relies heavily on negative ads against Fong, it added.</P>
      <P>With his moderate politics and engaging style, Fong stands a good
chance of being an effective voice on issues important to California
in the GOP-controlled Senate,/the editorial said of its decision to

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN OFFICIAL SPEAKS AGAINST TRADE BARRIERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian Prime Minister John Howard has
called on Asian leaders not to be tempted into raising trade barriers
just because their countries are suffering from the Asian financial
crisis.</P>
      <P>In a plea to regional governments, the private financial sector
and international organizations, Howard on Thursday night called for
the region to trade its way out of the current crisis through growth,
not protectionism.</P>
      <P>"We confront an unprecedented degree of instability in
international financial markets. The impact on Australia's region has
been colossal," he told an international banking meeting in Sydney.</P>
      <P>He said the crisis had caused massive unemployment, food
shortages, family hardships and malnutrition.</P>
      <P>"The internal political pressures created by these developments
are immense. Relationships between countries are tested," he said.</P>
      <P>The key to resolving the Asian crisis is through sustainable
growth, and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum summit
meeting in Kuala Lumpur next month should focus on addressing the
problems, Howard said.</P>
      <P>"The first thing APEC can do is make sure regional economies and
markets stay open," he said. He said APEC must stand against the view
that trade barriers must be raised in bad times.</P>
      <P>"Open markets provide the opportunity for economic growth and the
enormous benefits from it. The worst possible response to the crisis
would be to put up the shutters. We saw the consequences of this sort
of policy in the Great Depression of the 1930s," Howard said.</P>
      <P>"I would like APEC to challenge others to enter a new broad-based
round of trade negotiations in the World Trade Organization," he
said. "The second vital step for APEC economies is to take decisive
action to improve the transparency and accountability of government
and corporate decision making. The third vital step for APEC is to
put its weight behind proposals for reform of the international
financial architecture," he added.</P>

      <P>The prospect of Australia's economy is
looking increasingly gloomy, but the country is expected to escape

      <P>Asia's economic woes appear to be taking
a toll on Taiwan's port business, even though the country has
suffered less than most others in the region, according to The
Business Times.</P>
      <P>The volume of container cargo processed in Taiwan during the
first eight months of 1998 registered a scant 4.8 percent growth over
the same period last year, figures from the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics show.</P>
      <P>Total box shipments equaled 5.77 million 20-foot containers
(TEUs). Exports totaled 1.86 million TEUs, down 1.6 percent from the
same 1997 period. Imports, at 1.75 million TEUs, were off nearly 6
percent.</P>
      <P>Transshipments jumped 23 percent to 2.16 million TEUs. Some
analysts say that reflects the still small but growing indirect trade

    <HEADLINE>SIEW REPEATS CALL FOR JAPAN NOT TO HARM TAIPEI TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Friday repeated his
call for Japan not to harm the interests of the Republic of China as
it increases engagement with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Siew said Taipei's
stance of not accepting the so-called "three noes" policy toward
Taiwan voiced by US President Bill Clinton cannot be made more
clearly. To Siew's knowledge, he said, Japan fully understands
Taipei's position.</P>
      <P>Siew said Taipei has tried through many channels to convey to
Tokyo its wish that Japan does not engage itself with Beijing at the
expense of Taiwan when mainland Chinese Jiang Zemin visits Japan in
late November.</P>
      <P>He made the call amid concern that Japan will adopt a policy
identical or similar to the one expressed by the United States.</P>
      <P>Noting that Washington has repeatedly assured Taiwan that there
has been no change in its policy toward the island, the premier vowed
not to accept the so-called "three noes" policy. The policy's three
provisions are no support for Taiwan's independence, no support for
"two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" and no support for Taiwan's
membership in international organizations that require statehood.</P>
      <P>Siew gave a thumbs-up to the recent meeting between Chairman Koo
Chen-fu of Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation and Wang Daohan,
chairman of Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait, saying that it was a step forward in cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Relations still have a long way to go, however, as there are
still huge differences between the two sides, Siew noted.</P>
      <P>He stressed the importance of Beijing's respect for the fact that
Taiwan and mainland China are two distinct political entities under
separate rule.</P>
      <P>Beijing's recalcitrant "one China" sovereignty concept and its
reluctance to face up to the reality of a "separated China" has made
it difficult for the two sides to redress their basic differences, he
noted.</P>
      <P>If Beijing continues its schemes to isolate Taiwan in the
international community and to intimidate Taiwan militarily, chances
for a breakthrough in redressing cross-strait differences are slim,
Siew said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW SENEGAL AMBASSADOR PRESENTS CREDENTIALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ahmed Tijane Kane, Senegal's new ambassador
to the Republic of China, presented his credentials to President Lee
Teng-hui on Friday at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Kane was accompanied by John Feng, director-general of the
Department of Protocol under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the
ceremony was witnessed by Huang Kun-huei, secretary-general of the
Presidential Office, and David Lee, Vice Foreign Affairs Minister.</P>
      <P>Lee welcomed Kane to his new post, and said that both nations
have enjoyed cordial relations since the establishment of diplomatic
ties in 1996. He expressed the hope that Kane's arrival will further
boost bilateral cooperation.</P>
      <P>Touching on the just-concluded highest-level contacts between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait in five years, Lee said that
engagement with mainland China is based on two principles: that the
ROC, as a sovereign state, is on an equal footing with mainland
China; and that mainland China should be given a better understanding
of Taiwan's democratization.</P>
      <P>The president said the ROC cannot accept the attempts by the
mainland to isolate the ROC internationally, and added that
cross-strait problems should be solved through dialogue rather than
through military confrontation.</P>
      <P>Kane said that he identified with Lee's stance and offered his
support. He pointed out that he has worked in the mainland, and has
some understanding about the mainland's double-faced way of handling
situations.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that over the last decade, the ROC has been
treading the path of democratization and economic development, and
said he hoped to work with Senegal in this regard. He also expressed
admiration for Senegal's democratic achievements.</P>
      <P>Kane said the ROC's friendship is very important to his African
nation, and added that with cooperation between the two nations
already showing some substantial results, both sides should be able
to strengthen cooperation and exchanges in the future.</P>
      <P>Kane reaffirmed Senegal's support for the ROC's bid to join
international organizations, and said he believes the ROC's efforts
in the international arena will win it more support and friendship.</P>
      <P>Kane, 57, has been a roving ambassador since 1996. He has
previously served as ambassador to South Korea, Thailand, Australia,
Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, and Niger.</P>

      <P>Cross-Taiwan Strait agricultural exchanges
should not affect domestic agricultural development, Council of
Agriculture (COA) Chairman Peng Tzou-kuei said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Peng made the remarks on proposed cross-strait agricultural
exchanges as he accompanied President Lee Teng-hui on a visit to a
national agricultural technology exhibition held at National Taiwan
University.</P>
      <P>Peng said that cross-strait agricultural exchanges should be
implemented in a gradual manner under the premise that Taiwan's
agricultural development should not be affected.</P>
      <P>Peng also said that the government's stance on the issue is
stated clearly in Lee's six-point peace proposal of 1996, which says
Taiwan would use its experience in agricultural development to help
mainland farmers.</P>
      <P>During his tour of the exhibition, Lee said that agricultural
technology should be combined with agricultural production for the
benefit of farmers islandwide.</P>
      <P>The president, himself an expert in agroeconomics, showed keen
interest in exhibits on biotechnology, and automation system. He also
spent a great deal of time at a booth demonstrating the technique of
implanting computer chips in pets, and at various innovative
poultry-raising exhibits.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate stood at 2.98
percent in September, marking a slight decline of 0.07 percentage
points from August, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting &amp;
Statistics (DGBAS) reported on Friday.</P>
      <P>During September, a total of 285,000 people were out of work,
7,000 less than in the previous month, DGBAS officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials said the nation's overall workforce hit nearly 9.26
million in September, up about 92,000 from the same month of 1997,
and down 29,000 from August this year.</P>
      <P>According to the latest DGBAS tallies, the number of first-time
job seekers who failed to obtain work in September was 13,000 less
than the figure posted in August.</P>
      <P>Although both the unemployment rate and the number of jobless
dropped in September, the number of people who lost their jobs in
September because of workplace closure or business downsizing
increased by 17,000 over the year-earlier levels, the officials
noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's jobless rate in September was relatively lower than the
other major economies in Asia, the DGBAS officials said. Japan's
unemployment rate was 4.3 percent in August, while Hong Kong's stood
at 5.0 percent, and South Korea suffered 7.4 percent, they noted.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS statistics also show that Taiwan's labor participation
rate stood at 57.83 percent in September, 0.26 percentage points
lower than that of August.</P>
      <P>On average, the island's labor participation rate was 58.01
percent between January and September this year, the lowest level in
16 years, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>The labor participation rate is the ratio of the working

    <HEADLINE>CEPD CHIEF TO REPRESENT PRESIDENT LEE AT APEC SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>P. K. Chiang, the ROC's chief economic
planner, will represent President Lee Teng-hui at the 1998 summit
meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) announced on Friday.</P>
      <P>"Chairman Chiang of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) will attend the Nov. 17-18 APEC
informal leadership meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's capital, on
behalf of President Lee," said MOFA spokesman Roy Wu.</P>
      <P>The Malaysian government sent a special envoy to Taipei earlier
this month to forward an invitation to President Lee, Wu said,
adding that Lee had told the Malaysian envoy his decision to name
Chiang to represent him at the annual APEC summit meeting.</P>
      <P>Wu said Lee has made the decision in respect of the host
country's desire and with a view to maintaining a harmonious,
amiable atmosphere at the meeting.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's opposition, Lee has been unable to
personally attend the annual APEC gathering. Instead, he has to name
a surrogate to attend the meeting.</P>
      <P>In the first two APEC summits held in 1993 and 1994,
respectively, Lee appointed then-CEPD Chairman Vincent Siew to
represent him on the occasions.</P>
      <P>From 1995 through 1997, Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's top negotiator with
Beijing, served as Lee's surrogate at the annual APEC summit.</P>
      <P>As Koo, chairman of the quasi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), just concluded an ice-melting visit to mainland
China, Lee decided to name Chiang to take part in this
year's APEC leadership meeting on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Koo, an 81-year-old billionaire tycoon and seasoned
ambassador-at-large, met with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and Beijing's top negotiator with Taipei, Wang Daohan, during his
Oct. 14-19 landmark mainland visit.</P>
      <P>Wu denied that the government's decision to name Chiang instead
of Koo to the APEC summit has anything to do with consideration of
the new situation across the Taiwan Strait in the wake of
recent Koo-Wang talks.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu said the ROC delegation to the annual APEC senior
officials meeting will be headed by Andrew L. Y. Hsia, director
of the MOFA's Department of International Organizations. And the ROC
delegation to the APEC ministerial meeting will be led by Economics
Minister Wang Chih-kang and Finance Minister Paul Chiu. Both
meetings will be held Kuala Lumpur ahead of the informal leadership
meeting.</P>
      <P>APEC is a regional economic cooperation forum dedicated to
promote free trade, investment and capital flow. It currently
has 18 full members -- Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, mainland China, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan,
Thailand and the United States.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI AND BEIJING SHOULD CONDUCT ECONOMIC EXCHANGES: FOUNDATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Rising People Foundation (RPF), a
private non-profit organization, suggested on Friday that Taipei
should demonstrate its goodwill toward Beijing by initiating a
discussion on Taiwan's "three links" ban.</P>
      <P>The discussion could be raised during a proposed visit to Taiwan
next year by Wang Daohan, Beijing's top negotiator with Taiwan. In
exchange, the RPF suggested, mainland China agrees that Taiwan could
become a member of the World Trade Organization before mainland
China.</P>
      <P>RPF director Sisy Chen of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) unveiled the proposal at a RPF conference held in Taipei
to discuss cross-strait relations in the wake of the just-concluded
Koo-Wang discussions in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Beijing should first conduct negotiations on trade and
economic issues as a way of fostering constructive interaction, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>She suggested that the "three-links" issue could be "torn apart"
and each point negotiated separately, and that Taiwan could formulate
various negotiation strategies to prepare for a resumption of the
cross-strait dialogue suspended by Beijing in 1995.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland China, Koo Chen-fu, made an
"ice-melting" visit to the mainland on Oct. 14-19. During the visit,
his mainland counterpart Wang informed him of Beijing's demand for
political talks between Taiwan and mainland China, and for talks on
Taipei's lifting of the ban on direct trade, postal, and transport
links with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Koo responded to Wang's demands by saying that as soon as mutual
trust has been established between the two sides, the "three links"
issue can be taken up.</P>
      <P>Citing the Koo's remarks, RPF Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang said at the
RPF conference that he believes the best way to change the mainland
is to forge friendly links with the authorities there and to make
peaceful efforts to change them into an organization which respects
human rights and democracy.</P>
      <P>The former DPP chairman stressed that the issues of human rights
and democracy is expected to play a more and more important role on
the international political stage. Taiwan is at an advantage in this
situation because it has achieved democracy, while Beijing has not,
Hsu said.</P>
      <P>He added he believes international trends will force mainland
China's leaders to come to the negotiating table to resolve
cross-strait disputes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARATS CHAIRMAN MIGHT VISIT TAIWAN LATE 1999: MAINLAND CHINA SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A visit to Taiwan by Wang Daohan, chairman
of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS),
might occur by the end of 1999, according to an expert from mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong's Da Kung Pao newspaper carried an article on the
just-concluded discussions between Wang and Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) Chairman Koo Chen-fu by Xu Shiquan, director of the
Institute of Taiwan Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, and one of those responsible for advising Beijing on policy
decisions regarding Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Xu gave the following four-point summary of the results of the
Koo-Wang meetings:</P>
      <P>-- Differences still remain between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait;</P>
      <P>-- The atmosphere has improved somewhat;</P>
      <P>-- Some new hope has emerged from the meetings; and</P>
      <P>-- There is still a long way to go on the road to conciliation.</P>
      <P>He expanded on his summary by saying that the new hope refers to
the consensus reached between the two sides, which leaves the way
ahead open for the discussion of any topic. It also refers to Wang's
acceptance of an invitation from Koo to visit Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>The form of Wang's visit to Taiwan should be similar to that of
Koo's trip to the mainland, so that the two men can exchange views in
a free and unrestrained style, Xu continued.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that mainland China's President Jiang Zemin was
acting in his capacity as the General Secretary of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China during a meeting he had
with Koo. Likewise, he said, ROC President Lee Teng-hui could meet
with Wang in his capacity as chairman of the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the intense speculation regarding the likelihood of
a meeting between Lee and Jiang, Xu predicted that a direct meeting
between the two leaders seems unlikely in the near future, due to the
lack of a clear objective for any such meeting.</P>

      <P>Dissident Chen Zengxiang of Shandong
Province was sentenced Tuesday to seven years in prison because he
tried to collect information about political prisoners, a dissident
group said Friday.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China said in a press release that Chen was
sentenced on charges of "divulging state secrets," and that the
authorities concerned did not disclose the nature of the secrets
divulged by him. The real reason for his imprisonment is that he
tried to collect information about political prisoners in the
province in eastern China, the information center said.</P>
      <P>It pointed out that many Shandong students and workers who took
part in the 1989 Tiananmen pro-democracy movement are still in
prison, and Chen wanted to collect information about them. For
example, Chen Lantao is still imprisoned, because he was sentenced to
18 years after he was arrested for making a speech on the street
during the Tiananmen incident.</P>
      <P>Another Shandong dissident, Li Hai, was sentenced to nine years
in prison after he was found in possession of a list of political
prisoners in the Second Prison of Beijing. The mainland Chinese
government has long classified information about political prisoners
as high secret, the center said.</P>
      <P>Chen, 44, was nabbed by police on May 23. His family has been
barred from seeing him since then. He was tried in secret, the

    <HEADLINE>M'LAND SECURITY OFFICER SAID INVOLVED IN SMUGGLING DRUG TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Law enforcement authorities have managed
to break two cases involving smuggling contraband drugs to Taiwan
from mainland China over the past week, the Taichung Prosecutor's
Office in central Taiwan reported on Friday.</P>
      <P>Tu Ta-jen, a chief prosecutor with the office, said initial
investigations show that the two drug traffic cases were masterminded
by the same ring and that at least a mainland Chinese public security
officer was suspected of involvement in the illegal operations.</P>
      <P>"We hope mainland authorities will pay more attention to the
illegal narcotics trafficking across the Taiwan Strait and cooperate
with Taiwan to stem such criminal activities," Tu said.</P>
      <P>Under Tu's leadership, a special team composed of Ministry of
Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) agents, police officers and
military police, intercepted a 50-year-old man Chang Liang-chiang at
Chiang Kai-shek International Airport Thursday night, who intended to
smuggle 20 kilograms of amphetamines from the mainland into Taiwan.
The drugs were hidden in Chang's baggage.</P>
      <P>Investigators said this was the sixth time that Chang tried
to smuggle amphetamines into Taiwan from the mainland. He had been
targeted for intensive monitoring since he managed to smuggle a
fifth batch of amphetamines into Taiwan on Sept. 25. He left for the
mainland on Oct. 19 and returned to Taiwan last night.</P>
      <P>Chang confessed to investigators that he had successfully
smuggled a total of 50 kilograms of amphetamines into Taiwan in
five installments so far this year. Each time he could earn
NT$50,000 for his trafficking services.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, a public security officer in the southern
mainland city of Guangzhou personally escorted Chang to board a
passenger plane for returning to Taiwan via Hong Kong on Thursday to
shun mainland customs inspection.</P>
      <P>On Monday, investigators also arrested a Taiwan man, identified
as Yang Chun-shen, at a northern Taiwan port, who intended to
smuggle 11 kilograms of amphetamines into Taiwan from the mainalnd
by a fishing boat.</P>
      <P>MJIB agents said they managed to uncover underground amphetamine
factories in Taiwan in 1996 and 1997. However, no such production
facilities have been uncovered on the island so far this year.</P>
      <P>"We have been tipped off that all local amphetamine plants have
been relocated to the mainland and that many experienced
amphetamine production workers have also moved to the mainland,"
said an MJIB official.</P>
      <P>He said the ring which masterminded the latest two drug
trafficking cases has consistently recruited jobless middle-aged
Taiwan men with no criminal records to "transport" amphetamines into
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Law enforcement authorities said they will make further
investigation into the ring's operations and bring to justice all
masterminds and accomplices in order to completely topple the drug
trafficking ring.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA PLANNING ANTI-DUMPING MONITORING SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
said on Friday it will set up a monitoring system to help Taiwan
businesses head off dumping charges by foreign competitors.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials said the ministry has commissioned the Chinese
National Federation of Industries to devise a system as part of the
government's efforts to help local enterprises take preventive
measures to avoid potential dumping charges.</P>
      <P>US-based Micron Technology has filed a complaint with the US
Department of Commerce and the US International Trade Committee
accusing nine Taiwan dynamic random access memory (DRAM) circuitry
makers of selling their products at below fair market prices in the
United States.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics by the US Commerce Department, Vice Economic
Affairs Minister Lin Yi-fu said Taiwan is the third largest source of
DRAMs in the US with a 7 percent market share, behind Japan and South
Korea.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exported US$242 million worth of DRAMs to the US in the
first half of this year. The figure stood at US$427 million for the
whole of 1997, up from US$349 million in 1996 but down from US$455
million in 1995.</P>
      <P>Lin has urged the nine Taiwan companies to collect evidence and
information to defend themselves as the US Commerce Department will
decide whether to investigate Micron's charges within 20 days.</P>
      <P>According to MOEA officials, ROC trade officials stationed in the
US alerted the local industry in May and June to the greater number
of Taiwan-made DRAMs being sold to the US at lower prices for three
months in a row.</P>
      <P>The officials said the government is also unhappy with the
situation since increased competition in the international community
has forced Taiwan firms to slash product prices to maintain a
competitive edge.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THAI GOVERNMENT TO HELP LOCATE FIRE VICTIMS' FAMILIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bangkok,  Oct.  22  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Thai Labor and Welfare Ministry is
trying to locate the families of four Thai workers who were killed in
a factory fire in Taoyuan in Taiwan, ministry officials said on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Thongphoon Wanprasert, Chamlieng Prachian, Julawan Rithaisong and
Saeksan Lensantia were killed in a 10-hour fire which destroyed the
Laiwei Textile Co. Ltd.</P>
      <P>The owners of the factory are willing to pay the victims'
families more compensation than the law requires. They have offered
to pay 475,200 baht (NT$12,505) to the families of the first three
workers who were off duty at the time of the fire. The amount is five
times their salary to cover funeral expenses plus 20 times the amount
fixed for compensation, Somchai Wattana, director general of the
Ministry's Job Placement said.</P>
      <P>The family of Saeksan Lensantia, who was on duty, will receive
five times his salary plus 40 times the amount fixed for
compensation, he added.</P>
      <P>In addition, the 70 Thai workers who survived the fire will
continue to receive a salary until the factory resumes operations.
Each will also receive 2,000 baht for clothing and other expenses.</P>
      <P>Somchai said that the families of the four Thai workers should
present a letter of consent, marital certificate, identity card, and
house registration papers in English and endorsed by the Thai Foreign
Ministry and the Taipei Economic and Trade Office In Thailand.</P>
      <P>According to Thai statistics, there are 150,000 Thai workers in
Taiwan. Between January and September alone, some 78,648 Thais
arrived in Taiwan to work.

    <HEADLINE>BOFT CHIEF TO DISCUSS DRAM DUMPING CHARGES WITH US OFFICIALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said on
Friday it will assist local computer chip makers in persuading the
US government not to accept a dumping charge against them.</P>
      <P>Micron Technology Inc., the world's largest dynamic random
access memory (DRAM) semiconductor manufacturer which accounts for
50 percent of total annual US DRAM production, filed a petition with
the US federal International Trade Commission (ITC) and the
Department of Commerce (DOC) on Thursday, asking the US government
to levy anti-dumping taxes on Taiwan-made DRAMs.</P>
      <P>Micron accused nine Taiwan DRAM manufacturers and four chip
designing companies of exporting their products to the United
States at prices below fair market value or production costs.</P>
      <P>According to the US anti-dumping regulations, the DOC must
decide before Nov. 10 whether or not to launch an investigation
into Micron's dumping charges against the 13 Taiwan companies.
Meanwhile, the ITC is required to mete out an initial ruling by
Dec. 7 on whether the alleged dumping practices have afflicted any
damage to the US DRAM industry. And a final decision on whether to
impose anti-dumping taxes on Taiwan products will be available by
next July.</P>
      <P>Responding to Micron's dumping charges, BOFT Director-General
Chen Rui-lung said he will discuss the issue with relevant American
officials during his upcoming visit to the United States.</P>
      <P>Chen will be the chief ROC delegate to an annual meeting under
a Taiwan-US Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) to be
opened in Washington, D.C. on Monday.</P>
      <P>During the four-day meeting, Chen said he will exchange views
with US Assistant Trade Representative Robert Cassidy on the dumping
charge issues.</P>
      <P>"We'll remind American authorities that their anti-dumping
investigation process must meet the requirements of the World Trade
Organization and complies with the principles of transparency,
fairness and reasonableness," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen said he was not surprised by Micron's accusations. However,
he said, Micron's action will only deal yet another blow to the
battered global semiconductor industry.</P>
      <P>Noting that key problems facing the world DRAM industry are
a shrinking market demand and overproduction, Chen said the most
effective way to tackle the industry's woes is coordination among
major manufacturers around the world. "Dumping charges cannot help
resolve the industry's problems," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Micron also filed dumping charges against Taiwan's static random
access memory (SRAM) chip makers two years ago which eventually
prompted the US government to levy punitive anti-dumping taxes on
major Taiwan SRAM makers.</P>
      <P>Local manufacturers said Micron's accusation was unfair because
Taiwan accounted for a mere 6.7 percent of total US DRAM imports
last year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is America's third largest DRAM import source, but its
sales to the US market lag far behind the top two suppliers --
Japan and South Korea. Taiwan exported US$427.01 million worth DRAMs
to the United States in 1997.</P>
      <P>The 13 Taiwan companies listed in Micron's dumping petition
are Vanguard, Nan Ya Technology, Mosel-Vitelic, Winbond, Acer,
Powerchip, United Microelectronics Corp., Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Corp., Macronix International Co., Alliance, Etron
Technology, Taiwan Memory Technology, and G-Link Technology.</P>

(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The representative President Lee Teng-hui
chose to represent him in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum in Malaysia next month, vowed on Friday to do his best
at the meeting scheduled for Nov. 17-18.</P>
      <P>Council for Economic Planning and Development Chairman P.K.
Chiang told reporters he has attended five APEC ministerial-level
meetings since 1993, but this will be the first time he will
represent President Lee at the informal leadership meeting.</P>
      <P>Chiang described it as a good opportunity for him to exchange
views with the leaders of the member countries on behalf of President
Lee, and said that he will do his best.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang, the four major topics to be discussed at the
meeting are as follows:</P>
      <P>-- the impact of the Asian financial crisis on the region and the
world as well as concrete steps to overcome the on-going
difficulties;</P>
      <P>-- how to realize the promise for liberalization in some
specified sectors ahead of schedule;</P>
      <P>-- how to step up exchanges of human resources and scientific and
technical cooperation, so as to solidify the economic development
basis of the member countries; and</P>
      <P>-- foster electronics industry exchanges and cooperation.</P>
      <P>Chiang said it was regrettable that Lee is unable to attend the
APEC meeting as the government had tried hard to convince the host
country to invite Lee to the annual gathering.</P>
      <P>The chairman said he will take advantage of the meeting to share
with foreign leaders Taiwan's experiences in riding out the current
wave of Asian financial storms.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Lee offered any instructions on his expected
meeting with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Chiang did not
give a direct reply.</P>
      <P>He noted that he will have the opportunity to chat with the
leaders of other member countries, but said cross-strait affairs
should be handled by Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and
Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In the past three years, Lee sent SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu as his
representative at the APEC informal leadership meeting.</P>
      <P>Ahead of the gathering, ROC Economic Minister Wang Chih-kang and
Finance Minister Paul Chiu will represent the ROC at the
ministerial-level meeting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WTO REJECTS US APPEAL OVER SHRIMP IMPORT BAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Oct.  23  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The World Trade Organization (WTO) has
rejected a US appeal to ban the import of shrimp caught in nets that
ensnare and kill thousands of endangered sea turtles every year, the
Geneva-based organization said.</P>
      <P>The WTO Appellate Body stated that a US embargo on shrimp imports
from India, Malaysia, Pakistan and Thailand amounted to arbitrary and
unjustifiable discrimination.</P>
      <P>In April, the WTO ruled that the restrictions were an illegal
attempt to impose US standards on other countries. The four named
Asian nations claimed that the US ban was being applied in a
discriminatory manner and represented an unfair trade barrier.</P>
      <P>The countries have declined to stop measures that safeguard
turtles. Environmentalists say failure to equip shrimp nets with
US$75 turtle-excluder devices causes the deaths of 150,000 turtles a
year worldwide.</P>
      <P>Although faulting the United States for the way its rules were
carried out, the WTO panel upheld the right for members to adopt
conservation laws.</P>
      <P>The US government insisted that the law was implemented in an
even-handed manner, and said the ruling would not affect US efforts
to promote sea turtle conservation.</P>
      <P>The WTO decision was denounced by environmental groups including
the Sierra Club, the Earth Island Institute and the Earthjustice
Legal Defense Fund.</P>

from the group's holdings, according to the Ministry of Justice
Investigation Bureau (MJIB).</P>
      <P>Taipei District Prosecutor Chiang Tong-yuan, who led the MJIB

      <P>Concerned that Fan may have colluded with his younger brother Fan
Fang-kuei, president of the group, who has disappeared recently, and

first international conference on human rights.</P>
      <P>Henry Chu of the Los Angeles Times indicated that the Beijing

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLAR WARNS AGAINST BEIJING'S ATTEMPT TO MILK KOO-WANG MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing is trying to get the maximum
propaganda mileage from its just-resumed contacts with Taiwan, in
order to dilute its image on the international stage as hostile
toward the island, a local scholar warned on Friday.</P>
      <P>In a seminar on the impact of the meeting between Taipei's top
negotiator with mainland China Koo Chen-fu and his mainland
counterpart Wang Daohan, Chiu Chao-lin, a researcher at the Academia
Sinica, said that although Taipei has pulled its own weight in
organizing the meeting, Beijing is trying to snatch all of the
credit, misleading the world into believing that it made greater
concessions to accommodate Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Alerting the ROC government to Beijing's attempt to put its own
spin on the Koo-Wang meeting, Chiu said that Beijing may try to
dissuade Taiwan's major supporter in the world, the United States,
from selling arms to Taiwan by creating a false perception of
rapprochement brought about by the meeting.</P>
      <P>She also warned that Taiwan will back itself into a corner if it
resists political dialogue with Beijing, because that will give the
international community an impression of stubbornness which will make
it difficult to win allies' endorsement. She pointed out, however,
that political dialogue does not necessarily mean talks on
reunification.</P>
      <P>Wu Rong-i, president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research, said at the seminar that economics is still an important
factor that glues the two sides together despite their political
rivalry.</P>
      <P>Although cross-strait trade has slowed recently, Wu pointed out
that Taiwan pumped US$16.3 billion-worth of investment into mainland
China in the first eight months of this year.</P>
      <P>In addition to the political disputes which strain bilateral
ties, mainland China's stalling on reform of state enterprises,
rising unemployment, and the absence of investment protection, have
also raised concern among Taiwan investors in mainland China, said
Wu.</P>
      <P>Wang Ming-yi, a political reporter for the China Times newspaper,
described the Koo-Wang meeting as the beginning of a political
dialogue between Taipei and Beijing, and said it represents a bold
step which marks Taiwan's new self-confidence.</P>
      <P>He predicted that Beijing will not halt its attempt to isolate
Taiwan from the rest of the international community, since diplomatic
competition has become a traditional part of the contest between the
two sides.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada's Environment Minister Christine
Stewart was scheduled to announce on Friday a dramatic reduction in
the level of sulfur in gasoline.</P>
      <P>The amount of sulfur in a liter of Canadian gasoline varies from
540 parts per million (ppm) in Ontario to 200 ppm on the prairies.</P>
      <P>Ontario government sources said Stewart would announce a cut in
the sulfur content to 150 ppm by the year 2002.</P>
      <P>However, environmental groups want sulfur content cut to 30 ppm
in three years. Sulfur is a major component of smog. They cite
studies that conclude that smog induces lung diseases which are
killing hundreds of Canadians a year and that smog has led to a
growing number of people suffering from asthma.</P>
      <P>On Oct. 19, Canada's federal, provincial, and territorial energy

progress in their fight against air pollution by signing the

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Haitian Foreign Minister Fritz Lonchamps on
Saturday telephoned his Republic of China counterpart Jason Hu to
clarify speculation about his country's engagement with mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Lonchamps was quoted as having assured Hu of Haiti's firm
commitment to the ROC and its support for Taiwan's bid to rejoin the
United Nations.</P>
      <P>The Haitian foreign minister also briefed Hu on a recent trip to
Haiti by mainland Chinese Ambassador to the United Nations Qin
Huasun.</P>
      <P>Lonchamps said Qin visited Haiti from Oct. 19 through Oct. 21 in
his capacity as mainland China's permanent representative to the
United Nations.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Haiti, Qin inspected the UN peacekeeping
corps which is operating there. Mainland China once threatened to
veto the proposal to dispatch the peacekeeping force to Haiti simply
because Haiti maintains formal diplomatic ties with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Lonchamps assured Hu that Haiti will maintain only commercial
ties with mainland China. "This stance will not change," he was
quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>He also invited his ROC counterpart to visit Haiti. Hu reportedly
accepted the invitation, and promised to try his best to make the
trip early next year.</P>
      <P>Lonchamps said the Haitian government has formally expressed its
views on the relationship between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
at the UN General Assembly session.</P>
      <P>At this year's UN General Assembly debate session, Lonchamps
voiced explicit support for the ROC's UN bid. Meanwhile, Haitian
President Rene Preval made a state visit to the ROC in April this
year.</P>
      <P>Foreign Ministry officials said relations between the ROC and
Haiti have been cordial, and pointed out that the two countries
forged scores of cooperative agreements during Preval's visit, all of
which have been proceeding smoothly.</P>
      <P>The officials stressed that they see no signs to support some
media reports that ROC-Haiti relations are facing a crisis.</P>
      <P>With its status as a permanent member of the UN Security
Council, mainland China managed to tempt Saint Lucia, the Bahamas
and several other ROC allies to switch diplomatic allegiance from
Taipei to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's top negotiator with Beijing, Koo Chen-fu, made
a goodwill visit to mainland China earlier this month to forge
cross-strait rapprochement, Beijing has not eased its diplomatic
offensive against Taiwan. On the contrary, Beijing has stepped up
efforts to lobby the ROC's 27 diplomatic allies to switch diplomatic
recognition. Panama, Costa Rica and Haiti are all Beijing's priority
targets.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The issue of dumping charges against
Taiwan DRAM makers will not be on the agenda of forthcoming
consultations between Taiwan and the United States on the Trade and
Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA), US sources said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Officials from the US Trade Representative (USTR) Office said no
officials from the federal International Trade Commission (ITC) or
the Department of Commerce in charge of dumping and related affairs
will be present at the upcoming TIFA meeting slated for Oct. 26-29 in
Washington.</P>
      <P>It would in any case be inappropriate for the TIFA meeting to
discuss an isolated anti-dumping-charge case filed by a single
company, USTR officials said.</P>
      <P>The Taipei delegation to the TIFA meeting has not asked that an
anti-dumping charge filed by US maker Micron Technology Inc. against
Taiwan makers be brought up at the meeting, ROC liaison officials in
Washington said.</P>
      <P>Micro Technology Inc., the world's largest DRAM manufacturer
which accounts for 50 percent of total annual US DRAM production,
filed a petition with the US federal ITC and the Department of
Commerce on Thursday, asking the US government to levy anti-dumping
taxes on Taiwan-made DRAMs.</P>
      <P>The US giant accused nine Taiwan DRAM manufacturers and four chip
designing companies of exporting their products to the United States
at prices below fair market value or production costs.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will raise at least seven major issues during the TIFA
meeting, including seeking US support for its bid to join the World
Customs Organization; trying to persuade the US to sign an agreement
on customs affairs cooperation with Taiwan; and asking Washington to
review related polices so that Taiwan can be removed from its Special
301 watch list of countries with unfair trade practices.</P>

for the year-end Legislative Yuan elections, from Oct. 14-20. The
results were based on 104 valid replies from 1,150 questionnaires

contacting Taiwan business people on the mainland and their
reluctance to media exposure.</P>
      <P>Over 56 percent of the respondents said they believed a meeting

      <P>Nevertheless, 62 percent said they felt the "go slow, be patient"
policy should be adjusted.</P>
      <P>As for problems facing Taiwan business people on the mainland, 76
percent said they are troubled by mainland China's constant tax
probes; 65 percent said their factories were once forced to suspend
operations because of such tax probes; and 23 percent said mainland
authorities once confiscated their production contracts simply
because of alleged tax evasion.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 51 percent said they have encountered

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang candidate for Taipei mayor Ma
Ying-jeou accused incumbent Mayor Chen Shui-bian of being "all talk,
and little action" in terms of urban development in Taiwan's capital
city.</P>
      <P>During a television debate involving Ma, the Democratic
Progressive Party's Chen, and the New Party's Wang Chien-hsien, Ma
targeted urban renewal projects in older communities as an example.
He noted that of the 160 planned projects, Chen's administration has
completed only seven in the last four years.</P>
      <P>If elected mayor, Ma said he would make old-community renewal
projects a central theme in his urban development plans, giving new
life to less-developed old communities, particularly areas adjacent
to the Taipei Railway Station.</P>
      <P>He also said he would turn the suburban Neihu and Nankang areas
into Taipei's "Silicon Valley," making it a new industrial hub with
clean manufacturing.</P>
      <P>Non-performance public lands would be released to be used as
locations for public retirement homes or places for community
activities, Ma added.</P>
      <P>For his part, Mayor Chen Shui-bian highlighted his blueprint
plans to develop Taipei into a multi-core international city. Chen
said a plan to develop old communities was passed two days ago by the
Taipei City Council.</P>
      <P>As long as another city-wide development plan was passed, the
number of residential units around the city are expected to be
increase three-fold, he added. Top features of the plan include the
development of five sub-metropolitan hubs and the renewal development
of the traditional Wanhua District.</P>
      <P>Wang Chien-hsien, the New Party candidate who is running a
distant third in the polls, was nonetheless a formidable performer in
the television debate.</P>
      <P>He said he was against the idea of overturning all development
projects which have been laid out by the current administration.</P>
      <P>"As long as the development projects are viable and meant to take
care of the interests of all of the city residents, I will follow
suit if I am elected," he noted.</P>

      <P>Kuomintang candidate for Taipei city mayor
Ma Ying-jeou promised on Saturday to make Taipei a world-class city
by improving the standard of living of city residents if elected.</P>
      <P>In the first live broadcast public debate among the three mayoral
candidates, Ma criticized incumbent Mayor Chen Shui-bian for
preferring a short-run, "show-off" agenda to a long-term and
far-reaching program.</P>
      <P>After four years under Chen's administration, Taipei is still a
regional city rather than an international one, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Citing surveys by publications such as Hong Kong-based Asiaweek
and the local monthly Commonwealth, Ma said Taipei lags behind other
cities in both the world and Taiwan in terms of traffic, security and
the environment.</P>
      <P>Ma went on to blast Chen for a lack of vision in governing the
city and for cutting corners in enforcing the law. This has often
resulted in lawsuits over the infringement of civil rights, he added.</P>
      <P>Ma described Chen's policy as an ill-thought out patchwork
designed to earn votes instead of benefiting the public. He urged
voters to elect him, a candidate with the capability and willingness,
to lead the city into the next century.</P>
      <P>The debate began at 1:00 p.m. and ended at 3:40 p.m. It was the
first of five televised debates planned for the run-up to the Dec. 5
elections. Another debate which includes all three candidates will be
featured as well as three debates in which each candidate faces off
against one other candidate.</P>
      <P>Each candidate was given 10 minutes to present their campaign
platform then they fielded questions from three journalists.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General John Chang praised Ma's performance in the
debate as the best of the three after the encounter.</P>
      <P>Chang said he was initially worried that Ma would encounter
difficulty as he was unfamiliar with city issues, but Ma's

      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said on
Saturday it welcomes mainland China's plans to post journalists in
Taiwan for long-term news coverage.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level council was responding to a newspaper report
that said Beijing plans to allow state-owned news media, including
Xinhua News Agency, the People's Daily and China Central Television
Station, to post resident correspondents in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We would be delighted to see such a plan become a reality," MAC
Chairman Chang King-yuh said, adding he hopes mainland China will
cooperate with Taiwan in promoting normalized bilateral information
and news exchanges.</P>
      <P>Chang said the MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland
China, has long planned to allow mainland media professionals to
cover news in Taiwan on a long-term basis.</P>
      <P>"As mainland China has never shown a positive attitude toward
regular cross-strait news exchanges, the idea has remained on the
drawing board," the nation's top mainland policy planner said. "We
hope mainland authorities will come up with more detailed measures
for our reference."</P>
      <P>Local news reports also said mainland China will allow Taiwan
media to post resident journalists on the mainland for news coverage
when relations across the Taiwan Strait make substantive progress.</P>
      <P>In response, Chang said he sees no need for the mainland to set
such a precondition. He stressed that Taiwan has adopted an
open-minded attitude toward cross-strait news exchanges. "We only
hope that cross-strait news exchanges can be conducted on a
reciprocal basis."</P>
      <P>Chang further said Taiwan has never banned mainland reporters
from applying to cover news on the island, adding that mainland
journalists are welcome to cover the island's three critical
elections scheduled for Dec. 5. -- voters around the island will vote
for legislators while those in Taipei and Kaohsiung will elect a

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei's traffic was the hot issue in the
first mayoral debate on Saturday, with all three hopefuls presenting
their ideas to solve the city's traffic problems.</P>
      <P>New Party candidate Wang Chien-shien, favored the use of mass
transit vehicles on chessboard-like routes to ease the jammed traffic
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Double-decker buses can carry over 80 passengers while private
cars within the city carry an average of only 1.5 passengers, he
noted. Wang also proposed levying an extra tax on private cars to
finance city bus systems which would deter private car use and
encourage public transportation.</P>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou, who is running on the Kuomintang's ticket, promised
to combine city bus and mass rapid transit system fares and fix the
prices at NT$15 for at least eight years.</P>
      <P>Ma balked at Wang's idea of curbing the number of private cars
through tax.</P>
      <P>Incumbent Mayor Chen Shui-bian noted the success of the
buses-only lanes around the city and promised to open one mass rapid
transit line a year until 2000.</P>
      <P>He questioned Ma's proposal of freezing the city bus fare at
NT$15 for eight years saying it would require substantial government

    <HEADLINE>KOO CHEN-FU TO GIVE BENEFIT CHINESE OPERA PERFORMANCE IN JAPAN</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Koo Chen-fu, chairman of Taiwan's
semiofficial Straits Exchange Foundation, is scheduled to visit Japan
next month to give a series of benefit Chinese opera performances.</P>
      <P>Koo, a lifelong Chinese opera devotee, will perform to raise
money to establish scholarships to encourage young men in Taiwan to
go to Japan for advanced academic studies.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland China, Koo just concluded a
visit to the mainland. He was invited there by his cross-strait
counterpart, Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
Chairman Wang Daohan.</P>
      <P>Koo was entertained with Chinese opera performances during his
mainland visit, and he also sang parts of the operas during the
performances.</P>
      <P>Worried that so many young men in Taiwan have gone to the United
States for advanced academic studies in recent years, Koo believes it
is important that there be more exchanges with Japan, which is closer
to Taiwan geographically, sources said.</P>
      <P>Koo's daughter, Koo Huai-chun, who is an executive official with
Koo's cultural and educational foundation, said that about 70
performers and stage workers, including her father and famous Chinese

      <P>Koo will give three performances Nov. 2-4 at the Tokyo
International Convention Center, opposite the Tokyo Railway Station.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN MINISTRY SAYS LITTLE REGARDING TONGA TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  25  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC Foreign Ministry said little
regarding the country's ties with the Kingdom of Tonga on Sunday,
except that the situation is under control.</P>
      <P>Roy Wu, spokesman for the ministry, neither confirmed nor denied
local media reports that there will be changes in relations between
the two countries. He stressed that the Foreign Ministry has done
"everything it should" to cement its ties with the South Pacific
island nation.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's top negotiator with the mainland, Koo Chen-fu,
returned from a landmark visit there last week, Wu said, Beijing has
never relaxed its attempts to bully Taipei in the international
community.</P>
      <P>Beijing has claimed that it will lure away all of Taipei's 27
diplomatic partners before the end of this century and has spared no
efforts to undermine Taipei's relations with its diplomatic allies,
he said, pointing out that Beijing has launched a diplomatic
offensive to court several of the ROC's diplomatic partners in Latin
America.</P>
      <P>Beijing tried to entice Costa Rica early this year by purchasing
its bananas at prices several times higher than their market value.
Meanwhile, Qin Huasun, mainland China's permanent envoy to the United
Nations, paid a visit to Haiti recently.</P>
      <P>Although the two countries have explained to the ROC government
that the scope of their engagement with the mainland was limited to
business, Wu said the government must pay more attention to Beijing's
attempts to cut Taipei's ties with its diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu promised to visit Haiti early next year
after receiving an invitation from his Haitian counterpart, Fritz
Lonchamps, on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lonchamps telephoned Hu to explain that Qin visited Haiti from
Oct. 19 to 21 mainly to inspect a UN peacekeeping force operating
there.</P>
      <P>Beijing had threatened to veto a plan by the United Nations to
send peacekeeping forces to Haiti because the Caribbean nation
maintains formal diplomatic ties with Taipei.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC  OFFICIAL  WARNS  AGAINST  BEIJING'S 'DOUBLE-DEALING'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  25  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If mainland China continues to squeeze
Taiwan diplomatically, it will only drive Taiwan further away from
the mainland, a government official in charge of mainland policy said
on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), made the remarks as the results of a public poll on
"democratization in the mainland and cross-strait relations" were
unveiled Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that the poll showed that 82.7 percent of Taiwan people
disagreed with mainland Vice Premier Qian Qichen's remarks that the
squeezing of Taiwan diplomatically is a "global trend." Qian, a
former mainland foreign minister, made the remarks when he met with
Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's top negotiator with the mainland, in Beijing
earlier this month.</P>
      <P>Lin said that if Beijing really wants to understand the feelings
of the Taiwan people and to win their favor, it must review its
attempts to isolate Taiwan in the international community.</P>
      <P>Otherwise, Lin said, Beijing's double-dealing -- simultaneously
seeking to advance cross-strait relations and isolate Taiwan
internationally -- will only distance Taiwan from the mainland even
further.</P>
      <P>Lin also noted that nearly 80 percent of the public believes it
is necessary for Beijing to renounce the use of force against Taiwan
before the so-called "three links" -- direct trade, postal and
transportation links -- with the mainland can be established. Lin
said that the results concur with those from past polls conducted by
MAC, showing that national security is the top concern of the people
of Taiwan in regard to the three links.</P>
      <P>Yen Wan-chin, director of the Department of Chinese Affairs of
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), commented on
another poll finding: 70 percent of respondents said that even if
both sides of the Taiwan Strait reach a peace agreement, they do not
believe Beijing would abide by the agreement.</P>
      <P>Yen said that with the majority of the public distrustful of
Beijing, and in light of the fact that the differences across the
Taiwan Strait cannot be resolved in a short period of time, there is
a need for continued cross-strait dialogue. The DPP, he added, would
like to take an active part in that dialogue.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's "one China" principle has become a wedge to
isolate Taiwan internationally, he said, adding that it has become
the source of tensions across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Yen stressed that, in the future, differences over "one China"
will make it more difficult for Taiwan to gain international
understanding and support.</P>
      <P>Exchanges between Taipei and Beijing will require the
participation of the DPP, he said, reaffirming five party principles
in dealing with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Those principles state that the two sides are independent of each
other; public opinion in Taiwan will be the basis for dialogue with
the mainland; Taiwan will use its democratic and policy-making
experience to counter Beijing's unification campaign; Taiwan will
seek international cooperation projects to break away isolation; and
it will stress the need for the proper handling of cases involving
the rights and interests of Taiwan people in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Among the other major findings in the poll, conducted by the
Public Administration Society of the ROC, were:</P>
      <P>-- Nearly 70 percent of the public said that Beijing lacks
sufficient sincerity to conduct negotiations with Taiwan. Only 18
percent said that the mainland has enough sincerity to do so;</P>
      <P>-- About 70 percent of those polled said that they support the
government's policy of banning investment of more that US$50 million
in the mainland, while 15 percent said they disapprove of the ban;</P>
      <P>-- Sixty-six percent said they were satisfied with the
performance of Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's top negotiator with the
mainland, during his recent mainland visit, while 9.5 percent said
they were dissatisfied;</P>
      <P>-- Forty-six percent said that Koo's delegation was "too
accommodating," while 3.3 percent said it was "too tough" and 31
percent said it acted "appropriately"; and</P>
      <P>-- Sixty-six percent said that the mainland has to undergo
democratization before both sides could talk about unification, while
only 25 percent said they did not agree.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between Oct. 21 and 23 by telephone, and
responses were obtained from ROC citizens aged 20 or older. Some
1,070 effective responses were obtained, and the poll's margin of
error was 3 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S DOUBLE-HANDED APPROACH MAY HURT BILATERAL TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  25 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's double-handed diplomatic
approach toward Taiwan may eventually hurt the development of
bilateral ties, a ranking official with the ruling Kuomintang warned
on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, director of the KMT's Mainland Affairs Research
Department, made the remarks while answering questions from reporters
about local media reports that the Kingdom of Tonga may shift
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Beijing's diplomatic strategy toward Taiwan, masterminded by
mainland Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen, seeks to block the island
in the international community. It has negatively affected bilateral
exchanges and is likely to damage the future of two-way ties, Chang
pointed out.</P>
      <P>He said Beijing's continued bullying of Taiwan may eventually
destroy bilateral relations, adding that such a result is one
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin does not wish to see.</P>
      <P>Chang, a member of the Taiwan delegation that accompanied Koo
Chen-fu, Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland China, on a historic
trip to the mainland last week, was also present during the Koo-Jiang
meeting last Sunday in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Rejecting Qian's recent remarks that Taiwan's narrowed
international space is a result of international trends, the mainland
affairs expert claimed that the development is the result of
Beijing's attempts to isolate Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's democratization has won widespread recognition in the
international community. But its squeezed international presence is
effectively a result of Beijing's persistent efforts to block
Taiwan," he said.</P>
      <P>Expressing his hope that mainland China's democratization will
help stabilize cross-strait ties, Chang contended that only a fully
democratic mainland China would honor a peace agreement with Taiwan
if the two sides were to ink such an accord.</P>

      <P>Several heavyweights of the ruling
Kuomintang, including President Lee Teng-hui and Vice President Lien
Chan, went to the campaign headquarters of KMT Taipei mayoral
candidate Ma Ying-jeou on Sunday to drum up support for him.</P>
      <P>More than 3,000 supporters, braving the winds and heavy rains
approaching Typhoon Babs is visiting upon the island, gathered at 9
a.m. at Ma's campaign headquarters, located near the intersection of
Hsinsheng South Road and Hsinyi Road.</P>
      <P>President Lee, in his capacity as KMT chairman, expressed his
appreciation of the enthusiasm of Ma's supporters and appealed
personally for support for Ma.</P>
      <P>Lee said wars of words tend to erupt whenever elections take
place, but he added that the race is for Taiwan mayor, not ROC
president, and that "there is no use" in discussing issues not
related to the city.</P>
      <P>Lee, who himself once severed as Taipei mayor, said that he knows
best what a mayor of Taipei must do and what kind of man will best
serve the interests of Taipei city.</P>
      <P>Lee's remarks drew cheers and big applause from Ma's supporters.</P>
      <P>Lee, clasping the hands of both Ma and Lien, said action speaks
louder than words, dismissing rumors that his support for Ma was not
wholehearted.</P>
      <P>Lien criticized the lack of public construction and a dearth of
space for public activities in Taipei city. He also lauded Ma as a
man with vision and the one best poised to turn Taipei into a
metropolis.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Provincial Governor James Soong and his wife, Chen
Wan-shui, visited Ma's headquarters ahead of Lee and Lien. Soong
stayed briefly before leaving for the provincial government's
Chunghsing New Village, where he presided over festivities marking
Restoration Day, the day on which Japan's occupation of Taiwan ended.</P>
      <P>The KMT has shown solidarity amid a tight race for Taipei mayor.

      <P>The diplomatic policy of mainland China to
isolate Taiwan from the international community, masterminded by
Vice Premier Qian Qichen, may damage the development of cross-strait
relations, a high-ranking Kuomintang official said here Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, director of the Department of Mainland Research

Kingdom of Tonga from Taiwan. The report said Tonga will soon switch
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. The Ministry of
Foreign Ministry neither denied nor confirmed the report Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chang, a member of the Taiwan delegation led by chief
negotiator Koo Chen-fu to the mainland earlier this month, said
he believed mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin would be
reluctant to see the damage to cross-strait relations being caused by
the diplomatic drive masterminded by Qian. "Jiang and Qian may have
different views on it," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Jiang and Qian separately received Koo, Chang, and two other
members of the Taiwan delegation in Beijing on Oct. 18. During his
meeting with the Taiwan delegation members, Qian described Beijing's
efforts to "suppress" the diplomatic activities of Taiwan as a

      <P>Taiwan Governor James
Soong on Sunday stressed the importance of Taiwan Province's
achievements to the development of the Republic of China in the past
half a century.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a ceremony marking Taiwan's Retrocession Day, Soong
also lauded the contributions of provincial government employees.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was returned to the Republic of China in 1945 after 50
years of Japanese occupation.</P>
      <P>Under a newly enacted bill, the Taiwan Provincial Government
(TPG) will be downsized and made an institution under the
administration of the Executive Yuan starting in December.</P>
      <P>As the last governor of Taiwan Province, Soong expressed his hope
that TPG employees will celebrate this significant day with joy.</P>
      <P>"In the 53 years since its restoration," he said,
"Taiwan Province has turned prosperous everywhere. Politics have
become democratic and have made remarkable achievements and progress,
and these achievements are called the 'Taiwan miracle.'"</P>
      <P>The governor mentioned the province's outstanding progress in
railway and highway construction, as well as developments in the
fields of education and medicine. "These achievements are the results
of the joint endeavors of the provincial government, the provincial
inhabitants and the central government," he said.</P>
      <P>Soong borrowed a phrase from a national "Retrocession Day" song
-- "Not to forget, but to think always" -- in reminding people not to
forget that if there were no Republic of China, there would have been
no Taiwan, and vice versa.</P>
      <P>Because Taiwan and the Republic of China are intertwined, the
TPG's endeavors and the hardships of its employees should not be
forgotten, he said.</P>
      <P>The governor quoted a portion of President Lee Teng-hui's
Retrocession Day message in which Lee said the people of Taiwan must
have the will to pursue democracy and liberty, to resist Communist
rule and to dedicate their love to their families and the country.</P>
      <P>The Retrocession Day ceremony, presided over by Soong, was held

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should consider skipping
altogether this year's summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum to protest the organization's refusal to
allow President Lee Teng-hui to attend the event, said a lawmaker
with the major opposition Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>In a bid to buttress Taiwan's discontent and the country's
character, DPP Legislator Chang Chun-hsiung said the government
should consider not taking part in this year's APEC summit, slated
for November in Malaysia, if Taiwan cannot take part in the gathering
on a footing equal to those of other member states.</P>
      <P>A Malaysian envoy came to Taiwan on Saturday to extend APEC's
invitation to attend the summit, in which Council for Economic
Planning and Development Chairman P. K. Chiang would participate on
behalf of President Lee as a result of pressure from Beijing.</P>
      <P>Over the past four years, Taiwan has had to dispatch envoys to
represent Lee at the annual APEC summits.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's inability to be present at this year's meeting on an
equal footing with other member states would be a setback for Taiwan
in its bid to improve its international standing and could serve as a
bad example, one that may hinder Taiwan's efforts to join the United
Nations, Chang argued.</P>
      <P>Judging from the current situation, it is obvious that many
countries, including the United States, Japan and the Philippines
will accept only the representation of mainland China, not Taiwan, at
international meetings higher in status than ministerial-level, he
said.</P>
      <P>Chang said Taiwan should prevent this from becoming a model,
calling on the government not to send any representative to this
year's APEC summit. "This is a question of principle," he stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING SHOULD DEMONSTRATE SINCERITY: HU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 25 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister Jason Hu on Sunday
asked Beijing to demonstrate its sincerity by ending its attempts to
isolate Taiwan in the international community.</P>
      <P>Hu made the remarks in response to media reports that Tonga, one
of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in the South Pacific, is to switch
official recognition to mainland China soon.</P>
      <P>Foreign Ministry Spokesman Roy Wu earlier in the day said his
ministry "would neither confirm nor deny the report."</P>
      <P>"Didn't they (the mainland) say that cross-strait relations would
improve after the meeting between the heads of both sides'
intermediary bodies earlier this month? The new development will just
allow everyone to see the truth," he said.</P>
      <P>Koo Chen-fu, chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation,
visited the mainland Oct. 14-19 to meet his mainland counterpart,
Wang Daohan, chairman of the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait, a meeting that paved the way for the resumption of
cross-strait negotiations after a three-year hiatus. Koo also visited
mainland President Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier Qian Qichen,
separately, during his mainland trip.</P>
      <P>"It would be totally wrong for those who have, after the Koo-Wang
meetings, harbored the illusion of a rapprochement between Taiwan and
the mainland," Wu said.</P>
      <P>The fact is that Beijing has not shown a trace of sincerity and
goodness toward Taipei even after the meetings, an angry Hu said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has accused mainland China of launching a new round of
offensives against the island, also known as the "three empties"
strategy -- to lure away all of Taiwan's diplomatic allies, to
squeeze Taiwan out of all international organizations and to strip
Taiwan of its bargaining chips.</P>
      <P>Vice Foreign Minster David Lee revealed days ago that Beijing was
wooing a diplomatic ally of Taiwan, seeking to have the ally shift
formal recognition within two weeks of the Koo-Wang meetings.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ESPOUSES 'HUMANITARIAN CARE' AT APEC MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco, Oct. 25 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's chief delegate to a recent
science and technology ministers meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum espoused the idea of making humanitarian
care the core of high-tech development.</P>
      <P>Huang Chen-tai, chairman of the Cabinet-level National Science
Council (NSC) of the Republic of China, who represented Taiwan at the
meeting held last week in Mexico City, said he introduced Taiwan's
policy on humanities-centered high-tech development.</P>
      <P>Other ministers were apparently impressed by the introduction,
and many of them were "stunned" by the fact that Taiwan not only has
the idea but has taken concrete measures to implement it, including
the creation of measures to help the handicapped develop high
technology, Huang said.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Huang pointed out that the progress of the
world's science and technology development should be aimed at raising
people's standard of living and improving their well-being.</P>
      <P>At a time when the 21st century is right around the corner, with
humans being the primary rulers of the Earth, people should bear in
mind that science and technology development is incomplete without
humanitarian care, Huang said during his remarks.</P>
      <P>Participants at the APEC meeting unanimously recognized Huang's
comments and agreed to include them into the meeting's minutes.</P>
      <P>Ministers and top officials in charge of science and technology
development from Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, mainland China,
Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the
Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan,
Thailand, the United States, Russia, Vietnam and Peru took part in
the meeting.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, Taiwan is highly interested in hosting the
next APEC science and technology ministers meeting, scheduled to be
held in 2001. During the just-concluded meeting, the issue of the
sponsorship of the next meeting was not discussed, he said.</P>
      <P>Meeting participants decided only that Mexico will be responsible
for conducting a survey on the willingness of member states to
sponsor the next meeting, he noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP TO HOLD SEMINAR TO DISCUSS COALITION GOVERNMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) is planning to hold a seminar to discuss the issue of the
formation of a coalition government in Taiwan, DPP officials said on
Monday.</P>
      <P>The officials said that after year-end legislative elections, the
political map in Taiwan is bound to change and that the ruling
Kuomintang will lose its dominant position as Taiwan moves toward a
truly multi-party political system.</P>
      <P>They said that the seminar aims to dispel any misgivings the
public may have on the possible formation of a coalition government.
Such assurances may make the public more willing to vote for DPP
candidates, officials said.</P>
      <P>The KMT has said that if none of Taiwan's major political parties
-- the KMT, the DPP and the New Party -- win more than half the seats
being contested, the nation will be plunged into chaos.</P>
      <P>The seminar, to be held Nov. 1, will center on three topics: the
systems used by those nations that have formed coalition governments
and their suitability to Taiwan; the possibility of Taiwan having a
coalition government, based on its constitutional system; and the
likely political landscape that will emerge after year-end elections.</P>
      <P>Most of the seminar participants will be scholars, DPP party
officials said.</P>
      <P>Chang Chun-hung, campaign manager of the DPP, said the upcoming
election will result in an end to the dominance of the KMT.</P>
      <P>It is time for the DPP to consider Taiwan's political picture and
the development of multi-party politics, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TOP MAINLAND ENVOY MAY VISIT TAIWAN NEXT MARCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wang Daohan, Beijing's top negotiator with
Taipei, may visit Taiwan next March, his Taiwan counterpart Koo
Chen-fu predicted on Monday.</P>
      <P>Koo, chairman of the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF), made the forecast at a joint meeting of the Legislative Yuan's
foreign, interior, transportation and economic affairs committees.</P>
      <P>Koo invited Wang, chairman of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), to visit Taiwan at an
appropriate time when the two elder statesmen met in Shanghai
earlier this month.</P>
      <P>"I think Wang should be able to visit Taiwan before the end of
March next year," Koo told lawmakers, adding that if Wang can
smoothly visit Taiwan next March, it will mark yet another big step
forward in cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>The composed, soft-spoken billionaire tycoon said he is convinced
that a Koo-Wang meeting in Taipei will score even more achievements
than their first meeting held in Singapore in April 1993.</P>
      <P>Koo said he hopes Wang's Taiwan visit will herald a resumption of
regular, systematic consultations between SEF and ARATS -- the two
semi-official intermediary bodies authorized by their respective
governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence of
official channels.</P>
      <P>Turning to his nearly-two-hour meeting with mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin in Beijing on Oct. 18, Koo said Jiang spent
much time explaining the democratic development on the mainland as
well as experimental democratic elections in Anhui Province in
central China.</P>
      <P>"In Jiang's opinion, democracy can be implemented only at
grassroots levels and the central government must maintain strong
leadership," Koo said.</P>
      <P>For his part, Koo said he told Jiang that the essence of
democracy is party politics. "Therefore, I suggested that the Chinese
Communist Party abandon its one-party dictatorship, respect the
public opinion and allow its people to make choices at their free
will."</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Chairman Chang King-yuh acknowledged the achievements of Koo's
Oct. 14-19 mainland visit.</P>
      <P>"We appreciate Koo's devoted service and his achievements in
reaching a four-point consensus with his mainland counterpart during
his landmark trip," said the ROC's chief mainland policy
planner.</P>
      <P>The four-point deal included that ARATS Chairman Wang agrees to
visit Taiwan at a proper time; SEF and ARATS will gradually resume
dialogue, reinforce bilateral exchanges at various levels, and
strengthen mutual assistance in handling incidents involving the
lives and property of Taiwan people visiting the mainland and vice
versa.</P>
      <P>Chang said the Cabinet-level MAC, which oversees SEF's
operations, set three goals for Koo's ice-melting mainland visit --
pushing for an early resumption of regular SEF-ARATS dialogue and
exchanges; fostering an amiable atmosphere to facilitate improvement
of cross-strait relations; and publicizing Taiwan's basic platform
and its developmental experience to help promote mainland China's
democratization.</P>
      <P>During his mainland visit, Koo managed to exchange views directly
and frankly with senior mainland leaders, clearly explain the ROC's
basic stance on some critical issues and introduce Taiwan's
achievements in political democratization and present concrete steps
for the resumption of regular dialogue and future cross-strait
cooperation.</P>
      <P>"We think Koo's mainland visit has largely accomplished
our original goals," Chang said, adding that the visit has
laid a foundation for the restoration of cross-strait
communications channels and the opening of cross-strait constructive
dialogue.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chang said it is regrettable that mainland China
has not made any positive response to some of Koo's
valuable suggestions, such as immediate opening of talks on several
critical issues related to the legitimate rights and interests of the
people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait; promoting grassroots
democratic exchanges, agricultural cooperation; and strengthening
cross-strait cooperation in regional affairs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASIAN FINANCIAL CRISIS NOT FULLY REFLECTED YET IN TAIWAN: THINK-TANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If Taiwan appears to have escaped the
region's economic crisis -- as many government officials have claimed
-- it is only because the full impact of the crisis on the island has
not been seen yet, the head of a private economic think-tank said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Wu Rong-I, president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research
(TIER), said how deeply Taiwan's industrial sector has been affected
by the Asian economic crisis will be revealed in the next six months.
The number of domestic manufacturing plant closings has hit a record
high, he said, as more checks are bouncing and more bankruptcies are
being reported.</P>
      <P>Citing government statistics, Wu said Taiwan's foreign trade has
borne the full brunt of Asia's economic woes. In September the
island's exports were down 12.4 percent from year-earlier levels, he
said. Exports to Southeast Asia were down sharply, and even those to
the United States declined 1.8 percent in September from year-earlier
levels.</P>
      <P>As for imports, the only sector to register an increase was
capital equipment, which rose a year-on-year 14.9 percent in
September. Imports of consumer goods and agricultural products fell a
combined 13.7 percent to US$8.41 billion, Wu quoted government
statistics as indicating.</P>
      <P>Wu predicted Taiwan's trade sector will remain in the doldrums in
the first second half of 1999 as economic growth in both Europe and
the United States is expected to slow. Asian economies, meanwhile,
are not expected to recover in the short term, he said.</P>
      <P>He said that unless the government can spur demand, domestic
growth will stagnate, at least until the second quarter of 1999.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tung Ruei-ping, a TIER division chief, forecast that
Taiwan's economic growth in 1999 will be no better than in 1998.</P>
      <P>An island economy closely linked to international developments,
Taiwan cannot expect rosy prospects next year, as economic growth in
the United States and Europe is slowing and as Japan's economy begins
to sag, Tung said, noting that the US economy is expected to grow by
only 2.5 percent in 1999 compared with an expected 3.5 percent this
year.</P>
      <P>Tung, a monetary expert, said the Central Bank of China should
take a hands-off policy toward Taiwan's currency, letting the New
Taiwan dollar appreciate unhindered. By doing so, foreign currency
holdings will be quickly liquidated and more funds will be released
into circulation, driving down interest rates, he said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Oct.  26  (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Japanese government has rejected a
mainland Chinese demand for codifying the so-called "three noes"
policy against Taiwan, the Sankei Shimbun reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>The Japanese economic daily quoted an unnamed Japanese Foreign
Ministry official as saying that Japan will not accept Beijing's
request to include the "three noes" into a new joint communique to be
issued during mainland President Jiang Zemin's planned visit to Tokyo
in late November.</P>
      <P>The "three noes" refer to no support for Taiwan independence, no
support for "two Chinas or one China, one Taiwan," and no support for
Taiwan's membership in international organizations in which statehood
is a requirement.</P>
      <P>The "three noes" came to the limelight after US President Bill
Clinton said in a speech delivered in Shanghai during his
high-profile June 25-July 3 mainland visit that the United States
will uphold the "three noes" policy.</P>
      <P>The Japanese official said since the United States has never
enshrined the "three noes" in any official document, Japan will not
yield to Beijing's pressure to codify such a policy.</P>
      <P>The Sankei Shimbun said mainland China has been pressuring Japan
to explicitly throw its support behind the "three noes" policy in
the new joint communique to be issued at the end of Jiang's
upcoming Tokyo visit.</P>

      <P>Australia has welcomed the interim
agreement reached between Israeli and Palestinian leaders through the
mediation of US President Bill Clinton and Jordan's King Hussein.</P>
      <P>"Although this is an interim accord and therefore important steps
remain to be taken, it is a crucial milestone on the road to peace,"

hope that a just, secure and comprehensive peace in the Middle East
is at last within sight," he said.</P>
      <P>He said Australia had been increasingly concerned at the lack of
progress in the peace process over the past year and at the
increasing likelihood that the Middle East will slide back into a
climate of mistrust characterized by the rhetoric confrontation.</P>
      <P>"This agreement will breathe new life into that process and
hopefully rebuild lost confidence on both sides," Downer said.</P>

lasting peace in the Middle East. "We hope, and believe, that today's
agreement has made that peace substantially more obtainable," he

    <DATELINE>Canberra,   Oct.  26  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia needs a small flow of
immigration to keep its population growing because the country's
reproduction rate is low at 1.7 per fertile couple, Immigration
Minister Philip Ruddock said.</P>
      <P>Without immigration, Australia's current population of about 18.5
million, would begin to contract over time, he added.</P>
      <P>"Now, the impact of that with smaller immigration programs, means
that Australia in about 30 years time can be expected to have a
population of around about 23 million people and stable," he said.</P>
      <P>Most Australians would not object to this type of immigration
policy because "I don't think that most people would find that an
alarming prospect," the minister said.</P>
      <P>He defended the government's lower annual immigration of 68,000
since fiscal 1997-98 plus another 12,000 for humanitarian category.
The 68,000 intake was much lower than the nearly 100,000 accepted in
1996-97.</P>
      <P>Ruddock also said the lower quota was not influenced by One
Nation leader Pauline Hanson, who in 1996 demanded that the
government cut immigration intake.</P>

banks are more healthy than those in other Asian nations, the Central
Bank of China (CBC) said.</P>
      <P>The CBC made the remarks as officials from Moody's Investors
Service arrived in Taiwan to visit 10 domestic banks to access their
credit rating.</P>
      <P>It is understood that Moody's visit will center on past-due loans
and the effect of the region's financial crisis on domestic
enterprises.</P>
      <P>The past-due loan ratios of domestic banks in the first and
second quarters this year stood at 4.16 and 4 percent respectively,
or in the range of too high compared with the conventional normal
level of 3 percent.</P>
      <P>Moody's noted that Taiwan is now facing a sharp decline in its
trade surplus, and a slowdown of economic growth. If the New Taiwan
dollar continues to depreciate, it will not only undermine the
capacity of CBC to intervene in the financial market, but will also
be another blow to those beleaguered enterprises that have a high
ratio of debts.</P>
      <P>The bank rating service also said Taiwan's financial institutions
have continued to receive support from the government, adding that it
is confident Taiwan, with its low foreign debt and high foreign
exchange reserves, is capable of supporting a viable development of
its banking system.</P>
      <P>Moody's officials will also visit the CBC on Tuesday to gain a
better understanding of the economic and financial situation in
Taiwan, which they plan to use as reference in delivering the credit
rating.</P>
      <P>Moody's officials visited three Taiwan provincial government
banks -- The Chang Hwa Commercial Bank, Hua Nan Commercial Bank, and
the First Commercial Bank -- on Monday.</P>
      <P>They will call on Bank SinoPac, E. Sun Bank, Bank of Overseas
Chinese, and United World Chinese Commercial Bank on Tuesday; Bank of
Taiwan and Chiao Tung Bank on Wednesday; and The International
Commercial Bank of China and Chinatrust Commercial Bank on Thursday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER SOUTH AFRICAN MILITARY ATTACHE MISSES TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Johannesburg, Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By J. H. Chang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former South African military attache
to Taiwan McGill Alexander, who along with his family was held at
gunpoint by a wanted fugitive last November, said recently in an
interview with CNA that he missed Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Alexander said he and his family hoped to return to Taiwan
sometime to see their old friends.</P>
      <P>The Alexanders were hailed for their courage in an ordeal which
gripped Taiwan media and audiences as the events played out on live
television.</P>
      <P>On Nov. 19, 1997, Chen Chin-hsing, who was wanted for the kidnap
and murder of the daughter of local celebrity Pai Ping-ping, sneaked
into the Alexander residence in suburban Taipei and held the family
hostage before surrendering to police.</P>
      <P>Col. Alexander retired from his post at the embassy and returned
to South Africa early this year. He was stationed in the northern
border area of South Africa and was recently transferred to Richmond,
a region plagued by political unrest in the eastern region of South
Africa to help maintain order.</P>
      <P>Alexander, 51, said both he and his eldest daughter Melanie still
suffer from pain from the gunshot wounds they received in the
incident. Alexander was shot in the leg and he recently underwent
surgery to remove blood clot in his leg while Melanie was shot in the
back.</P>
      <P>Despite the lasting effects of the hostage situation, the
Alexanders are celebrating Melanie's impending marriage which is to
take place in the United States in December.</P>
      <P>Alexander's youngest daughter Christine, whose courage during the
24-hour standoff between Chen and the police was particularly admired
by people across the island, also said she wanted to return to Taiwan
to see friends and the home they lived in Tienmu.</P>
      <P>Alexander, a career soldier who was assigned to the post of
military attache of South African Embassy in 1996, said although he
and his family had been taken hostage in Taiwan, he thought social
order in Taiwan was a hundred times better than that of in South
Africa.</P>
      <P>He said that during his stay in Taiwan, he traveled around the
island, day and night, taking pictures without any fears. But now in
South Africa, he is afraid to stop his car while driving, for fear of
being robbed.</P>
      <P>After the hostage incident, Alexander said he received hundreds
of letters of support from friends and strangers alike. He has kept
two huge piles of these letters as they offered so much encouragement
and comfort that he would treasure them forever.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER SIEW CALLS EMERGENCY MEETING ON FLOODS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Monday called an
emergency meeting with relevant ministers to work out countermeasures
against flooding in Taipei County's Hsichih township and the northern
city of Keelung.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Babs, the second tropical storm to affect Taiwan in 10
days, brought torrential rains to northern Taiwan over the weekend,
submerging Hsichih and many areas of Keelung with flood waters at
levels not seen in decades.</P>
      <P>Siew, after learning of the disastrous flooding on Sunday,
ordered the military, police and fire fighting sectors to stand by to
render the quickest and every possible help to neighborhoods and
residents in flood-stricken areas.</P>
      <P>In Hsichih, a town situated by the Keelung River, people moved
around with rubber boats after their ground-floor homes and cars were
submerged. Television reporters who were at the scene for live
coverage, delivered their reports with only their microphones, heads
and chests appearing above water.</P>
      <P>Hsichih residents suffered from a serious landslide last year
after a hillside residential building collapsed, leaving several
dozen residents killed and many families homeless.</P>
      <P>Less than 10 days ago, Typhoon Zeb swept through Taiwan with
heavy rains and wind. Zeb hit Hsichih with the worst floods seen in
the old township where a number of new residential buildings have
been developed over the last several years.</P>
      <P>After barely finishing cleaning their homes which were either
submerged in water or damaged by mudslides, Hsichih residents were
battered by Typhoon Babs which brought a second-wave of flooding
since late last week.</P>
      <P>Justice Minister Cheng Chung-mo said there were many reasons
behind the heavy flooding in Hsichih. A high-tech investigation is
needed to determine which agencies should be held responsible for the
unprecedented disaster, he noted.</P>
      <P>In Keelung, more than 100 low-lying districts close to the
Keelung River were inundated, with Wutu, Liutu, and Chitu being the
most seriously affected. Tracks at Wutu Train Station were submerged
underwater, forcing the nearby railway service to suspend operations.</P>
      <P>In Chitu, an 11-year-old school girl who was reported missing in
flood waters mid-Monday was found. As schools closed in the morning
due to the floods, all students were sent home. However, the girl
went home with a teacher after her parents failed to pick her up at
the school. The teacher was unable to contact the girl's family after
phone lines were cut by the calamity.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Liu Chao-shiuan inspected Hsichih Sunday on behalf
of Premier Vincent Siew. Liu was earlier stranded in the southern
port city of Kaohsiung by Typhoon Babs, said the over-development of
residential projects is the culprit of the recent flooding in
Hsichih.</P>
      <P>Taipei County Magistrate Su Chen-chang on Monday urged the
Ministry of the Interior to stop approving development projects up
stream from the Keelung River and the adjacent hillside areas.</P>
      <P>Su said during 1989 and 1997, the former Magistrate Yu Ching
administration approved 1,064 projects of development in hilly areas
where previously were prohibited. Of the total, 32 percent or 348
projects were in Hsichi.</P>

      <P>Lee-Tseng Wen-hui, wife of President Lee
Teng-hui of the Republic of China, is scheduled to arrive in the

      <P>The Vatican, the ROC's only diplomatic ally in Europe, is the

      <P>The ROC Embassy in the Vatican said on Sunday that Mrs. Lee will

President Lee, present felicitations to the pontiff on the 20th
anniversary of his coronation, an embassy official said.</P>
      <P>During her stay, Mrs. Lee will tour the Vatican Museum, the
Sistine Chapel and St. Peter's Basilica, in addition to meeting with
Chinese community leaders and representatives of ROC students in
Italy.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, a 33-member Taiwan aboriginal choir will sing
indigenous tribal songs to pay tribute to the pope in a weekly public

      <P>Mrs. Lee's current visit marks the first visit to Europe by an

    <HEADLINE>KMT CONFIDENT OF BIG WIN IN YEAR-END LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the successful conclusion of a meeting
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait last week, the ruling
Kuomintang is increasingly confident of a decisive win in the
year-end legislative elections, political observers said.</P>
      <P>Although the elections for mayor in Taipei and Kaohsiung --
Taiwan's two largest cities -- have so far commanded greater public
attention, political analysts said the legislative elections slated
for Dec. 5 islandwide will be of tremendous significance to the
country's development in the new millennium.</P>
      <P>The KMT has attached a great deal of importance to the
legislative polls early on. President Lee Teng-hui, who is also
chairman of the KMT, began campaigning for KMT candidates three
months ago in the hope of grabbing an early advantage for the party.</P>
      <P>The KMT's dismal showing in last year's elections for city mayors
and county and township chiefs served as a warning signal, pushing it
to make an all-out effort to defend its seats at the legislature this
year, political observers pointed out.</P>
      <P>Many people predicted that the KMT might lose its majority at the
Legislative Yuan in the coming elections, but the overall situation
seems to have turned in its favor a year later, observers said.</P>
      <P>Now it is a unified KMT countering a splitting DPP and New Party.
The two major opposition parties have both seen their members split
or forge new parties over the past several years, while the KMT has
seen former members return to their camp.</P>
      <P>According to observers, many elements may influence the coming
legislative elections.</P>
      <P>First, there is an increase of representation in the Legislative
Yuan. There will be a total of 225 seats up for grabs this year, up
from 165 four years ago. This allows the KMT to field more qualified
candidates while opposition parties struggle to present adequate
contenders.</P>
      <P>Second, there is the so-called "the swing of the pendulum"
phenomenon among voters, analysts said. The DPP was the big winner in
last year's local government elections, but voters may turn for KMT
candidates this year, they noted.</P>
      <P>Other external factors, such as the state of cross-strait ties
and the country's financial and diplomatic situation, will also play
a role in the legislative polls.</P>
      <P>The smooth conclusion of a landmark trip to mainland China last
week by Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's
top negotiator with the mainland, should have injected a boost to the
ruling KMT, the analysts said. In contrast, the DPP and the New Party
have no bargain chip in this vein to garner votes.</P>
      <P>Koo's meetings with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
his mainland Chinese counterpart, Wang Daohan, chairman of the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, earlier this
month in Beijing and Shanghai were the highest level of contacts
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in nearly 50 years.</P>
      <P>According to reliable sources, Koo's meetings with Jiang and Wang
have helped stabilize cross-strait relations. Recent surveys
indicated that about 40 percent of the people of Taiwan think the KMT
is the most capable political party to handle cross-strait affairs,
while only 7 percent and 1 percent voiced the same opinion for the
DPP and the New Party.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's relatively favorable performance amid the Asian
financial crisis is another area which the KMT can draw support from,
while the opposition lack such resources, analysts said.</P>

will meet on Oct. 28 to discuss how to harness the Tamsui River and

Economics Minister Chang Chang-pang said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan when answering

      <P>After inspecting Hsichih township, which was flooded on Sunday
due to heavy rains brought by Typhoon Babs to northern Taiwan over
the weekend, Vice Premier Liu Chao-shiuan ordered the MOEA and other
related government agencies to submit a project plan to control
flooding within two weeks.</P>
      <P>Chuan pointed out that the flooding problem in Hsichih has
existed for 10 years. He expressed doubt whether the MOEA can solve
the problem within two weeks.</P>
      <P>Lin, who resides in Hsichih, noted that his home suffered from
damage in the flooding. He wanted to know whether the Water Resources
Bureau under the MOEA was determined or capable of solving the
problem and whether there were any problems in funding.</P>
      <P>In response, Chang said both Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang
and Vice Economics Minister Yin Chi-ming have made site inspections
of the damage-stricken Hsichih.</P>
      <P>He added that his ministry will obey instructions by Vice Premier
Liu, actively study and discuss how best to solve the problem, and
submit the project plan within two weeks.

      <P>Taiwan made a total of US$7.9 billion-worth
of computer monitors in 1997, making it the world's biggest monitor
producer, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>Citing its latest statistics, the bureau said that Taiwan
produced more than 40.7 million monitors last year, accounting for
53.7 percent of the world's production volume in the 12-month period.</P>
      <P>From January to June this year, Taiwan's total monitor production
volume reached 20.96 million, a 12.9 percent surge compared with the
same six-month period of last year.</P>
      <P>However, the impact of a strong world trend toward lower-priced
computers resulted in a 14.4 percent decline in Taiwan's monitor
production value in the first six months of this year against the
year-earlier level, with production value totaling US$3.2 billion.</P>
      <P>Of the total 20.96 million monitors produced in the six-month

    <HEADLINE>JAPAN URGED NOT TO GET INVOLVED IN CONTENTION OF TAIWAN'S SOVEREIGNTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman
Koo Chen-fu said on Monday his recent remarks about Taiwan's
sovereignty were made to remind Japan not to get involved in the
cross-strait issue over the island's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>During his Oct. 14-19 "ice-melting trip" to the mainland, Koo
told Beijing leaders that Taiwan's sovereignty is in the hands of the
Republic of China because Japan returned it to the ROC government
after World War II in accordance with the 1945 Potsdam Declaration.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a joint meeting of four committees of the Legislative
Yuan, Koo said he made the statement to let both Beijing and Tokyo
understand that Taiwan's sovereignty undoubtedly belongs to the ROC
government.</P>
      <P>He told the lawmakers that mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin
is scheduled to visit Japan next month which led him to make the
remarks to remind the Japanese government to avoid getting tangled in
this issue.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was ceded to Japan in 1895. In the 1943 Cairo Declaration
issued by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, US President Franklin
Roosevelt and UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill, the return of
Manchuria, Taiwan and the Pescadores was promised to the ROC.</P>
      <P>In August 1945, Japan announced its formal surrender to the
Allies in accordance with the terms of the Potsdam Declaration of
July 1945. Taiwan was returned to the ROC later that year. The
People's Republic of China was established four years later in 1949.</P>
      <P>Koo said when Japan normalized its diplomatic relations with
mainland China in 1972, the Japanese government did not indicate its
recognition of Beijing's claim that Taiwan is an inalienable part of
the PRC and that the PRC government is the sole legitimate government
of China.</P>
      <P>Instead, he said, the Japanese government only mentioned that it
"respects" and "understands" the Beijing government's stance, and
reiterated that it will abide by the eighth article of the 1945
Potsdam Declaration.</P>
      <P>Koo pointed out that he raised the Potsdam Declaration during his
recent mainland trip because he wanted Japan not to give up its
original stance on Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Japan would accept Beijing's "three noes" policy,
the SEF chief said that his personal view was that Japan may agree to
only "two noes" -- no support for Taiwan independence and no support
for "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan."</P>
      <P>He said Japan may not accept the third "no" -- no support for
Taiwan membership in international organizations that requires
statehood.</P>

pay his visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He has chaired a German business association for wholesale and

hours of interrogation.</P>
      <P>The information center said the aim of the union, which was

development of mainland China in peaceful ways. It claims to have
4,000 members.
 The center also said that the union held a national congress in
Beijing on Oct. 5, and that it has set up a research office, an
organization department, and a publicity department to facilitate
its operations. It plans to hold a seminar on "the current

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING TO CONTINUE TO BAN NEW POLITICAL PARTIES: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong   Kong,   Oct.   26   (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing will not permit the
establishment of new political parties, but will instead encourage
the existing eight "democratic parties" to play a more active role,
the South China Morning Post reported Monday.</P>
      <P>The report said all of the eight "democratic parties" accept
subsidies from the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC).</P>
      <P>The report quoted an informed source in Beijing as saying that
officials at the office of mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin
were stupefied recently by the efforts of dissidents to establish
branches of an unborn independent political party (the China
Democracy Party) in more than ten provinces and cities.</P>
      <P>It also quoted the informed source as saying that in 1997 some
"liberal" members in Jiang's think-tank urged Jiang to lift the ban
on the establishment of new political parties. But the Beijing
leadership, led by Jiang, has decided that the most they can do is to
allow the eight parties to increase their political participation.
For example, leaders of the "democratic parties" may appear more
often in news reports and give their opinions on the policies of the
communist party and the government, the report added.</P>
      <P>The eight "democratic parties" will likely be asked to confirm
their willingness to follow the leadership of the communist party
and to cooperate with "liberal intellectuals," it added.</P>
      <P>The report quoted a Western diplomat as saying that Jiang has
revealed his intention to initiate political reforms after the first
plenary session of the 16th CPC Central Committee is held in the year
2002, when Jiang's heir apparent Hu Jintao becomes the general

    <HEADLINE>TYPHOON BABS DOWNGRADED, BEARING DOWN ON TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Light typhoon Babs, which was over the seas
southwest of Taiwan on Monday, has altered course to head
north-northeast in the direction of the island, the Central Weather
Bureau (CWB) announced on Monday.</P>
      <P>A storm warning was issued on Monday evening for areas south of
central Taichung County in the west, and Hualien County in the east,
where the storm was forecast to hit sometime after 8 p.m., and the
CWB warned that northern Taiwan could also be affected if Babs shifts
its course a little to the north.</P>
      <P>Weathermen stressed that areas spared a direct attack should
remain vigilant against the heavy seas and torrential rain brought by
the outer rim of the storm.</P>
      <P>The CWB said that at 3 p.m., the storm, with maximum sustained
winds of 30 meters per second, was centered over the sea some 110
kilometers to the north of the Pratas islands, which lie 444
kilometers southwest of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The storm, with a diameter of 250 kilometers, was clocked at nine
kilometers per hour and moving in a north-northeasterly direction.</P>
      <P>Although it had not yet made landfall on the island, Babs dumped
heavy rain on northern and eastern parts of Taiwan from late Sunday
until early Monday, and triggered flooding in many areas, especially
in Hsichih, Taipei County, which was still reeling from heavy
flooding of Keelung River caused by Typhoon Zeb on Oct. 15.</P>
      <P>The weather forecasters said the rain could continue and
intensify throughout the night, and called on the public to be on the
alert against possible further flooding.</P>
      <P>A storm warning was already in effect for the islands of Kinmen
and Penghu, and for seas of the Taiwan Strait and the Bashi Channel.</P>
      <P>Girdling for possible further storm-related disasters, Taiwan's
Cabinet had an emergency meeting on Monday afternoon, at which
Premier Vincent Siew announced a five-point set of instructions:</P>
      <P>-- A rescue center at Hsichih should be established immediately
by the Taiwan Provincial Government;</P>
      <P>-- The Ministry of National Defense should place personnel and
vehicles at the disposal of the rescue center to rescue those trapped
by floodwaters, and help ferry and distribute relief goods;</P>
      <P>-- The Ministry of Justice should prosecute to the full extent of
law those who develop or cultivate illegally hillside land around the
island which contributes to the frequent flooding and landslides;</P>
      <P>-- All those who suffered property damage during the last two
typhoons will receive tax relief; and</P>
      <P>-- A comprehensive program to dredge the Keelung River should be
speeded up.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26 (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Hungarian business group Grabplast is
set to visit Taiwan for the first time to spend millions of US
dollars on plastics and chemical raw materials, the China External
Trade Development Council (CETRA) revealed on Monday.</P>
      <P>Frank Wu, director of the Taiwan Trade Center at CETRA's Budapest
office, pointed out that high-level buyers from Grabplast will
come to Taipei to purchase PVC powders, wallpaper, fibers, and other
plastics and chemical products.</P>
      <P>Wu said that CETRA is arranging business meetings between
Grabplast personnel and major local businesses such as Formosa
Plastics Corporation, Yuen Foong Yu Paper, China General Plastics,
and Union Petrochemical Corp.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that as a result of the Asian financial turmoil,
Asia's major plastics and chemical raw materials exporters, including
Japan and South Korea, have reduced their prices, prompting the
Hungarian company, which used to buy its raw materials from European
countries, to change its raw material suppliers.</P>
      <P>According to CETRA, although South Korean producers have
continued to cut their prices since last year, some of their products
still cannot compete with Taiwan products, which are higher in both
quality and stability of supply.</P>
      <P>Wu said the Hungarian business group, the first major Eastern
European enterprise to purchase raw materials in Taiwan, is preparing
to spend nearly US$10 million. He added that CETRA is planning to use
the case as a touchstone for development of the Eastern European
market, to try to enlarge Taiwan's market share in the region.</P>

      <P>An official from Taiwan's Presidential

activities will not be affected by the island's yearend elections.</P>
      <P>The official disclosed that following the Oct. 14-19 trip to

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Lien Chan
said on Monday that it is unfair for the ROC to be shut out of the
international community because of its disbelief in and rejection of
communism.</P>
      <P>In a courtesy call to visiting Swaziland King Mswati III at his
Taipei hotel, Lien ridiculed communism as an "endangered" ideology,
and said Taiwan has been excluded from the international community
because of its refusal to accept it.</P>
      <P>Lien was referring to Taiwan's banishment from most international
bodies because of its refusal to merge with mainland China under
communism. This has angered Beijing, and has caused it to go great
lengths to block Taiwan's access to the international community.</P>
      <P>Citing the World Heath Organization (WHO) as an example, Lien
said that the ROC's ostracization from the non-political organization
deprives its 21 million people of the right to the improved health
care which comes from the sharing of medical information and
expertise with other countries.</P>
      <P>In response to questions from Mswati III about the just-concluded
mainland China trip by Taiwan's top negotiator with Beijing, Koo
Chen-fu, Lien said Beijing should conduct dialogue with Taiwan
peacefully and with sensitivity, and should give up any attempts to
take the island through the use of force.</P>
      <P>Replacing confrontation with negotiation is a worldwide trend,
according to Lien, and Taiwan is willing to improve its ties with
Beijing, as long as this takes place from a position of equality, he
said.</P>
      <P>Mswati III arrived in Taiwan last Thursday for a six-day state
visit. He is scheduled to leave on Tuesday.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the devastation caused by a series
of typhoons this year, Taiwan's economic growth will not be affected,
a government economic planning official said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Thomas M.F. Yeh, director of the Economic Research Department of
the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development, said
while typhoons may cause losses by way of property damage, economic
growth is built on the increase of individual salary income.</P>
      <P>Citing mainland China's flooding this summer as example, Yeh said
Beijing has poured at least 200 billion renminbi into its relief
package to help stimulate the mainland's economic recovery.</P>
      <P>It is expected that mainland China's economy, fueled by relief
operations, will grow by more than 7 percent in the third and fourth
quarters this year. The figure for the whole of 1998 is also very
likely to reach the government target of 8 percent, Yeh noted.</P>
      <P>The ROC Ministry of Economic Affairs was cited in local media as
saying that Typhoon Babs will not effect Taiwan's consumer prices or
exports.</P>
      <P>According to the Council of Agriculture, Typhoon Babs has caused
about NT$140 million in losses in Taiwan's agricultural sector. Farm
damage is estimated at NT$72 million while agricultural and
fishery losses are expected to hit NT$50 million and NT$ 16 million,

    <HEADLINE>US-PRC STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP CRITICIZED BY ANALYST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  26  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington's "strategic partnership"
with mainland China has left India feeling insecure, Taiwan betrayed,
and Japan ignored, which will cause long-term repercussions for US
political and military roles in Asia, an analyst said.</P>
      <P>Ted Galen Carpenter, vice president for defense and foreign
policy studies at the Washington-based Cato Institute, wrote in the
recent issue of Foreign Affairs that in trying to defrost its chilly
relationship with China, the Clinton administration has overshot the
mark. Its rapprochement with Beijing has sent political tremors
through East and South Asia.</P>
      <P>Attributing New Delhi's decision to conduct nuclear tests and
move toward "weaponizing" its atomic program solely to the evolving
US-Chinese relationship is an oversimplification. The 50-year feud
with Pakistan, as well as domestic politics, clearly played a role.</P>
      <P>However, Washington's insensitivity may intensify, rather than
reduce, Delhi's determination to build a nuclear deterrent and adopt
a more assertive foreign policy, Carpenter said.</P>
      <P>Warming US-Chinese relations have naturally worried Taiwan. In a
brief statement during his trip to the mainland, President Bill
Clinton affirmed the "three noes" policy toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>ROC Premier Vincent Siew reacted harshly, asserting that China
and the United States were not entitled to negotiate Taiwan's
political status. This can only be determined by the people in
Taiwan, he asserted. Parris Chang, a member of Taiwan's legislature,
even accused Clinton of "selling out" Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan worried, first, that China would exploit Clinton's comment
and the newly strengthened relationship with the United States for
leverage in any cross-strait dialogue about Taiwan's future. Those
fears proved well founded, noted Carpenter.</P>
      <P>Barely a week after Clinton's Shanghai statement, Beijing
expressed confidence that Taipei would "get a clear understanding of
the situation." Lest anyone fail to appreciate the substance of the
new reality, the official newspaper China Daily quoted a high-level
Chinese official as saying that Clinton's comments had "provided
favorable conditions" for resolving the Taiwan issue.</P>
      <P>Second, the analyst added, Taipei worried that the new rhetorical
tilt toward Beijing presaged reductions in -- and ultimately
elimination of -- US arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Carpenter said the growing lack of confidence in US willingness
to defend Taiwan from Chinese aggression or intimidation is pushing
Taiwan to become more militarily self-reliant. Like India, it is
seeking to protect its security in the context of a US-Chinese
strategic partnership.</P>
      <P>Unlike their counterparts in India and Taiwan, Japanese officials
have not yet moved assertively to counter the US-Chinese partnership.
But there are indications that Japanese leaders are becoming
impatient with their country's dependence on the United States,
Carpenter wrote.</P>
      <P>Tokyo has been unusually resistant to US pressures to change its
economic policies. Similarly, when North Korea conducted its test of
the intermediate-range Taepo Dong-1 missile -- flying over Japan in
the process, Tokyo showed uncustomary hostility to US attempts to
dampen the crisis.</P>
      <P>Indeed, the analyst wrote, Japan immediately sought to stem
financial outflow to North Korea and hinted that it might conduct a
missile test of its own to launch a satellite -- something that would
upset Japan's neighbors and the United States.</P>
      <P>Whatever the mix of motives, the Clinton administration's China
policy is misguided, opined Carpenter. Clinton rightly insists that
isolating China would be foolish and counterproductive. Indeed, the
United States should seek opportunities to work with China when the
interests of the two countries overlap.</P>
      <P>Containing North Korea's nuclear program and otherwise reducing
tensions on the peninsula would seem like such an opportunity. But
engaging China and maintaining a cordial relationship is one thing --
forming a strategic partnership is quite another.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DALAI LAMA SEEN BOWING TO CHINA'S DEMAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Dalai Lama is expected to make a
ground-breaking statement on the status of Tibet to clear the way for
a visit to China to meet with President Jiang Zemin, the Sydney
Morning Herald reported.</P>
      <P>Tsewang Tethong, foreign minister of the Tibet government in
exile in India, said in an interview the Dalai Lama is ready to bow
to Beijing's demand that he acknowledge that Tibet is a part of the
mainland.</P>
      <P>The groundwork for such an admission came during US President
Bill Clinton's visit to the mainland in July. Clinton urged Jiang to
meet with Tibet's spiritual leader in exile. Jiang responded by
saying the door to dialogue was open if the Dalai Lama acknowledged
that Tibet was a part of China, the Herald reported.</P>
      <P>"We don't want to miss this opportunity for dialogue," Tethong
told the daily through a telephone interview.</P>
      <P>Since the Clinton visit, the Tibetan government in exile has been
in indirect contact with Beijing leaders "through mutual friends,"
Tethong admitted.</P>
      <P>He said the Dalai Lama -- in his capacity as a Buddhist monk --
wanted to travel to Mount Wutai, a revered Buddhist pilgrimage site
in China's Shanxi province. It was hoped a meeting with Jiang could
take place there or in Beijing, but the Tibetan leader would not
visit Tibet itself, the daily reported. "We believe, at this early
stage of the dialogue, going to Tibet would be too sensitive,"
Tethong said.</P>
      <P>Sources within the Tibetan government in exile said the Dalai
Lama's statement would probably be issued in the United States to
maximize its international impact.</P>

      <P>Australia is caught in the middle of a
squabble between the United States and European Union over which
international organization should control the agenda for talks on the
resolution of the global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Australia is fighting to maintain a seat in international
negotiations on the creation of a new global financial system,
according to the Australian Financial review on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The US is keen for an expanded G7 grouping to take the primary
role, but the EU wants responsibility returned to the Interim
Committee of the International Monetary Fund.</P>
      <P>Australia is pushing for the continuation of the recently formed
G22 (the Willard group) and could lose much of its clout in
international negotiations under both the US and EU models.</P>
      <P>Federal Treasury international adviser Neil Hyden said there had
been a shift in the relative importance of particular international
organizations as the global financial crisis unfolded.</P>
      <P>He said the focus had shifted from the G7, the G10 and the
Interim Committee of the IMF towards the Willard Group and its even
newer, expanded version -- the G26, which was designed to accommodate
some of the EU's concerns.</P>
      <P>The EU is worried about the shift in focus and is keen to push
negotiations back into the Interim Committee of the IMF. While EU
members are well represented in the G7, the G10 and the Interim
Committee, the G22 is more heavily weighted in favor of countries hit
hard by the Asian financial crisis, Hyden said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Corruption in mainland China is worse now
than 50 years ago under the rule of the late President Chiang
Kai-shek, according to a report by the Australian Financial Review.</P>
      <P>The paper's Beijing correspondent Rowan Callick
reported that government corruption springs from the very core of the
country's political structure: officials are unelected, opaque and
unaccountable.</P>
      <P>When overseas investors form a joint venture, usually the major
and often only contribution of the Chinese partners is the premises.
However, the process through which the land is obtained is always
complex, and sometimes simply fraudulent, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>In some cases, managers of a state enterprise use guanxi with
bureaucrats to have a section of the property excised and re-assigned
to them personally or to a company they have formed. So long as no
one probes or questions the process -- that is so long as everyone
involved is rewarded -- the joint venture proceeds unimpeded on
premises that are in effect stolen, the paper reported.</P>

      <P>The operations and profits of foreign bank

of this year, said the Bureau of Monetary Affairs (BOMA) under the
Ministry of Finance (MOF) on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>There are no signs Asia's financial turmoil has affected foreign
banks in Taiwan, said BOMA, adding that the turnover of the banks'
trust operations increased 21 fold from July 1997 to July 1998.</P>
      <P>A total of 46 foreign banks were operating in Taiwan as of last
July, two more than in July 1997. Meanwhile, the total number of
branch offices of foreign banks operating in Taiwan increased from 67
to 73, while the number of people employed at them increased 14
percent, from 7,124 to 8,118.</P>
      <P>The combined turnover of foreign banks' in Taiwan in July of this

      <P>The recent killings in East Java are
politically motivated, a member of a parliamentary fact-finding team
in East Java was quoted by The Straits Times as saying.</P>
      <P>The source, who is in East Java with seven other legislators to
investigate the more than 150 murders in the southeastern tip of
Java, said criminal intent was responsible for the early stages of a
"witch hunt" of traditional practitioners of black magic.</P>
      <P>But he maintained that black magic was subsequently used as a red
herring or ruse to kill several Muslim figures and supporters of
Nadhlatul Ulama (NU).</P>
      <P>"One of our findings is that this is aimed at instilling terror
in East Java and emasculating NU's power base," he said.</P>

occurred in 18 out of 21 subdistricts in Banyuwangi, an area with a
population of about 2 million.</P>
      <P>Murders later spread to other parts of Java, including Jember,
Pasuruan, Malang and Madura.</P>
      <P>From January to July this year, black magic practitioners or
shamans were targeted as a result of what a senior military officials
has called "witch hunts" or revenge killings by families cursed by
the shamans. The pattern broadened from July to the end of August, as
victims came to include prominent Muslim preachers and teachers.</P>

      <P>The third working-level meeting under
the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) between the
Republic of China and the United States opened in Washington, D.C.
on Monday.</P>
      <P>The ROC delegation is headed by Chen Ruey-long, director-general
of the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT), while Assistant Trade
Representative Robert Cassidy serves the chief US delegate.</P>
      <P>Chen paid a courtesy call on Cassidy before the opening of the
four-day meeting to foster a good atmosphere for resolving some
trade disputes between the two countries.</P>
      <P>During the Monday session, the two sides exchanged views on a US
complaint that the Kaohsiung City Government has failed to pay an
American engineering consulting firm which has won a construction
contract for the southern Taiwan port city's mass rapid transit
system. The two sides failed to work out concrete measures for
settling the dispute.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and American negotiators also discussed issues related to
the opening of Taiwan's cable television market and the signing of
an agreement on mutual recognition of electro-magnetic
compatibility.</P>
      <P>Other topics to be mulled over the next three days include
intellectual property rights (IPR) protection and the pharmaceutical
pricing system under Taiwan's national health insurance program.</P>
      <P>The ROC delegation is expected to present a package of measures
for improving Taiwan's IPR protection systems in hopes that the
United States will drop it from a Special 301 "watch list" for
alleged failure to eradicate commercial piracy.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Taiwan has failed to effectively enforce its IPR
protection law, the US Trade Representative Office again put Taiwan
on an annual Special 301 "watch list" earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said before the meeting that he will express
Taiwan's concern about dumping charges filed by an American
computer chip firm against 13 Taiwan DRAM makers.</P>
      <P>"I'll take advantage of the current meeting to express our
concern and ask American authorities to abide by the World Trade
Organization anti-dumping regulations in handling the case. We hope
relevant US authorities will follow the principles of transparency,
openness and reasonableness," Chen added.</P>
      <P>Micron Technology Inc., the world's largest dynamic random

      <P>Politicians and land developers who collude
in speculative land deals are to blame for the recent flooding in the
township of Hsichih, Taipei County, according to the result of a
public opinion poll released on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey of 1,082 residents of the greater Taipei
area, including 101 Hsichih residents, was conducted by New Party
National Assembly Deputy Liu Ming-lung on Oct. 25-26.</P>
      <P>"The survey is aimed at understanding the public perception of
the cause of the inundation of Hsichih by floodwaters brought by
typhoons Zeb and Babs in the past 10 days," said Liu, also chairman
of the non-profit Environmental Quality and Cultural Foundation.</P>
      <P>The poll results showed that 76.7 percent of those interviewed
said they believe that speculative land deals by politicians and land
developers are the main culprit of the flooding in Hsichih, a newly
developed township situated on the banks of the Keelung River.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 68.3 percent of all respondents and 70.4
percent of the Hsichih residents interviewed said they think the
government should ban completely the development of hillside plots in
Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 46 percent of the Hsichih residents interviewed said
poor design of several sections of dikes along the Keelung River was
also a factor in the township's recent flooding.</P>
      <P>Nearly 60 percent of all those interviewed and about 70 percent
of the Hsichih respondents said the government should offer financial
compensation for Hsichih residents affected by the flooding.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN DELEGATION BRIEFS JAPANESE ON KOO-WANG MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A three-member Taiwan delegation on Tuesday
met with Japanese officials and lawmakers to brief them on relations
across the Taiwan Strait following the recent high-level talks.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan group, which included presidential adviser Tseng
Yung-hsien, the ruling Kuomintang's Mainland Research Department
director-general, Chang Jung-kung, and Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) Deputy Secretary-General Jan Jyh-horng, called at the
Interchange Association of Japan and met with association Chairman
Toshio Goto for talks on cross-Taiwan Strait relations and the
political situation in East Asia.</P>
      <P>The Interchange Association, which maintains offices in both
Tokyo and Taipei, has represented Japanese interests in Taiwan since
Japan severed formal diplomatic relations with the Republic of China
in 1972.</P>
      <P>According to Tseng, Goto and other Interchange Association
officials had high praise for SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu's Oct. 14-19
"ice-melting" visit to Shanghai and Beijing, during which Koo reached
a four-point consensus with the mainland's top negotiator with
Taiwan, Wang Daohan, and also met with mainland Chinese President
Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier Qian Qichen.</P>
      <P>Tseng said the Japanese officials considered it an "advantageous
move" that Taiwan espoused democratization and expressed willingness
to share its experience in democratic development with mainland
China.</P>
      <P>They also considered President Jiang's dodging of many questions
raised by Koo and his delegation as "insincere," Tseng added.</P>
      <P>The presidential advisor said the Japanese officials, who
expressed great concern over cross-strait relations, urged the SEF
and its mainland counterpart, the Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) to resume regular and systematic dialogue.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, who is also a researcher for Taipei's National
Unification Council, said the Japanese officials attach great
importance to the easing of cross-strait tensions, which they said
will benefit the stability of the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, the delegation also met with key figures of the
Democratic Party, Japan's largest opposition party, and another
opposition party, the Komei Party, to exchange views on the latest
situation in the Taiwan Strait and the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>The delegation arrived in Tokyo on Monday on a five-day visit to
Japan. The group will meet with members of the supra-party Japan-ROC
Dietmen's Council and other friendly organizations on Wednesday for
talks on cross-strait relations and other issues of mutual concern.</P>

      <P>Mainland Chinese public security officers
continue to detain and interrogate dissidents in various parts of

told to move away from his house before Nov. 1. His wife has been
deprived of her teaching job. Of the 50 dissidents, at least 20 have
been interrogated by policy, the information center said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's China Airlines (CAL) on Monday
received the first of an order of Boeing 737-800 jetliners.</P>
      <P>The plane, the newest of Boeing 737 series, is the first of its
type in Asia. The delivery was the first step of the former flag
carrier's efforts to upgrade flight services and flight safety, CAL
Vice President Liu Ko-yia said.</P>
      <P>CAL has ordered 10 of the new planes in order to enhance its
existing fleet of Boeing 737-400s. The company will receive the rest
of the planes over the next two months, said Liu.</P>
      <P>The aircraft, bearing the serial number B-18601, is being flown
to Taiwan by pilots from CAL and Boeing, via Hawaii and Saipan. It
will arrive in Taipei on Thursday, and begin service by Nov. 6.</P>
      <P>The Boeing 737-800 is the third generation of the 737 series. Its
large wings and the CMF-56-7 engines which give high thrust mean the
airplane can uses 10 percent less fuel than the 373-400, according to
Boeing.</P>
      <P>The new airplane is capable of making a six-hour flight without
refueling, and has been contracted for use as new presidential plane
of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has bought a total of 49 passenger planes from the United

    <HEADLINE>LEADING INDEX  OF TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC  PROSPECTS UP IN SEPTEMBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The leading index of Taiwan's economic
prospects increased in September for the first time in eight
consecutive months, the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning
and Development (CEPD) announced on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The index of leading indicators, which is designed to forecast
economic prospects three to six months in advance, rose 1.7 percent
from August to 97.6 points in September.</P>
      <P>The CEPD has devised a color-coded rating to define Taiwan's
economic status. Blue represents recession, yellow-blue means
economic slowdown, green is steady growth, yellow-red indicates an
economy that is heated, and red is one that has overheated.</P>
      <P>CEPD figures released on Tuesday indicate the island's present
condition falls within the yellow-blue range for the sixth
consecutive month.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the CEPD in September showed that four
finance-related indicators, including the check-default rate, the M1B
money supply, stock prices and bank lending, all received a bleak
blue rating.</P>
      <P>While three other indicators, including industrial production,
new export orders, and non-agricultural employment received green,
red, and green ratings, respectively, the export value indicator
dropped from red in August to blue in September.</P>
      <P>According to a recent CEPD poll of domestic manufacturers, 15
percent of those surveyed think business will pick up in the next
three months, compared with 14 percent in a similar poll in August.</P>
      <P>As high as 22 percent of the respondents say business will take a
turn for the worse, against 33 percent in the previous month.</P>
      <P>Thomas M.F. Yeh, director of the CEPD's Economic Research
Department, said on Tuesday that the International Monetary Fund has
estimated that Asia's economy will start to recover in the middle of
next year.</P>
      <P>He added that since Taiwan has suffered relatively little during
the Asian financial turmoil, its economic slowdown is expected to
bottom out in the fourth quarter of this year, and will start to
climb at the beginning of next year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan said on Tuesday
that the Republic of China cherishes its cordial friendship with
Belize, and would like to contribute further to bolster bilateral
cooperation.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks during a meeting with Belize Prime Minister
Said Wilbert Musa, who is currently visiting Taiwan with his wife.</P>
      <P>Lien and Musa were nostalgic when they recalled that nearly a
decade ago, when they were both foreign affairs ministers, they
represented their respective governments in signing an agreement to
establish formal diplomatic relations in 1989.</P>
      <P>Introducing Taiwan's economic development since then, Lien said
high-end information technology industries are now the backbone of
Taiwan's economic growth, while traditional labor-intensive
manufacturing industries have mostly relocated abroad. At present,
half of the island's exports are high-technology products, he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is also the seventh-largest investing country in the
world, with numerous Taiwan-invested companies providing job
opportunities around the globe, Lien told Musa.</P>
      <P>Lien said he hoped Musa will take time during his visit to
contact more government officials and private company executives with
the aim of bringing new cooperative projects back to his country for
the mutual benefit of both sides.</P>
      <P>Musa, who is on his fourth visit to Taiwan, invited Taiwan
businesses to invest in his Central American country, and welcomed
more Taiwan tourists to visit the tiny nation on the shores of the
Caribbean Sea.</P>
      <P>The Musas were accompanied by Ralph Fonseca, Belize's minister of
budget, management, development, investment and trade.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Tuesday evening hosted a dinner in honor
of Musa and his entourage.</P>
      <P>During the dinner, Siew expressed Taipei's gratitude toward
Belize for its long-term support for Taiwan's bid to join
international organizations. Siew was particularly effusive in his
appreciation of Musa for his efforts to push for the establishment of
formal ties with the ROC during his tenure as foreign minister.</P>

      <P>Taiwan businesses had better prepare

merchandise will be priced by the euro, Europe's new single currency,
a former German government adviser said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Dr. Michael Fuchs, a former economic adviser to the German

enhance economic activity in Europe by eliminating the need for the
exchange of currencies.</P>
      <P>Fuchs, who was invited to Taiwan by the Taipei-based Euro-Asia
Trade Organization, also said Germany is in urgent need of Taiwan's
hardware and machinery.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that Taiwan's computer manufacturers should
make Germany its European maintenance center to boost sales in
Europe.</P>
      <P>He predicted that the worst of the Asian financial crisis is
over, and said the possibility of a rerun of the depression of the
early 1930s is dim, although Russia is still mired in recession, with
no sign of an upturn in sight.</P>
      <P>Fuchs said that because Taiwan and Germany are at different
stages of economic development, their industries can supplement each
other.</P>
      <P>According to government statistics, 114 German firms had invested
a total of US$435 million in Taiwan, while 200 Taiwan firms had
invested US$97 million in Germany as of the end of May.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING PUTS WTO MEMBERSHIP ON BACK BURNER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Twelve years after Beijing signaled its
wishes to join the World Trade Organization (WTO), negotiations for
its accession continue in fits and starts, according to reports from
the Geneva-based world trade regulatory body on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Several occasions seen as most appropriate for Beijing's entry --
including the inauguration of the WTO in 1995, and the 50th
anniversary of its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, in May this year -- have come and gone.</P>
      <P>Now it is hoped that accession negotiations between mainland
China and its major trading partners, as well as with the WTO working
party, will be completed in time for its entry by the next
ministerial meeting, scheduled for the end of next year. This would
allow mainland China to participate in the next round of multilateral
negotiations.</P>
      <P>Of course, there is no real reason for having such deadlines. The
simple fact is that bringing mainland China -- the world's
10th-largest trading nation -- into the rules-based organization
would itself be something of a momentous occasion.</P>
      <P>More to the point, mainland China's accession will be followed --
perhaps just minutes later -- by the accession of Taiwan, which has
already almost completed negotiations with its trading partners and
the WTO working party.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been frustrated by the length of time taken for its
entry into the world body, believing that the conclusion of its own
negotiations has been drawn out for political reasons -- to
accommodate mainland China, the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>It is true there is understanding in the terms of reference of
the working party set up to negotiate with mainland China, that while
the two sets of negotiations would proceed independently of each
other, Beijing would be admitted first.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has concluded its bilateral negotiations with all but
three trading partners, and WTO sources say a large number of
Taiwan's commitments are being implemented -- making it much easier
to advance the process.</P>
      <P>The key outstanding issues with Taiwan, say the source, are in
subsidies (incentives or promotions) to both the industrial and
agricultural sectors.</P>
      <P>Other issues include harmonizing of standards with international
standards, tariff quota rates on certain commodities (including
rice), and amendment of laws like the foreign trade act and companies
law to bring them into conformity with WTO rules.</P>
      <P>Some WTO members want Taiwan to amend those laws at least six
months before accession, while Taiwan says it will change them once
it becomes a member. Mainland China, by contrast, is not as focused
as Taiwan in its pursuit of WTO accession.</P>
      <P>The WTO report said that right now, mainland China is not as
fired up as it has been in the past. "Beijing is distracted by its
own domestic problems: the reform of heavily-indebted state-owned
enterprises; reconstruction of wide areas damaged by recent floods;
and the impact of the Asian financial crisis."</P>

      <P>Russia is seeking to create business

technologies to local industries, economic officials said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will sponsor a
presentation on Oct. 28 to introduce these technologies to local
businessmen, the officials said, adding that the development is a
result of a European trip undertaken last September by Chen
Ruey-long, director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade.</P>
      <P>More than 150 local businessmen will attend the two-day
presentation which is to be jointly presided over by Vice Minister of

      <P>Five Russian experts will give presentations on purification of

not refer to the Taiwan issue, according to a Japanese newspaper
report on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Jiang is scheduled to arrive in Japan for a state visit on Nov.
25. At present, Tokyo and Beijing are negotiating the content of the
joint statement which will be signed on the occasion.</P>
      <P>The mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun cited foreign officials as
reporting that the two countries have yet to decide on the exact
wording of the statement.</P>
      <P>The mainland side has revealed on many public occasions that the

mainland Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan has told Japanese journalists
stationed in Beijing that mainland China expects Tokyo to declare its
"three noes" policy more forcefully than did US President Bill
Clinton during his mainland trip in June.</P>
      <P>The "three noes" refers to no support for Taiwan independence, no
support for the "one Taiwan, one China," or "two Chinas" formulas,
and no support for Taiwan's membership of any organization for which
statehood is a requirement.</P>
      <P>The Japanese daily pointed out that although Japan switched
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1972, it did not
indicate its recognition of Beijing's claim that Taiwan is an
inalienable part of the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Instead, the newspaper said, Tokyo only mentioned that it
"respects" and "understands" the stance of the Beijing government,
and that it respects the 1945 Potsdam Declaration, in which Japan
declared it will give up the right to participate in discussions
related to Taiwan sovereignty.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HIJACKED MAINLAND PLANE LANDS AT CKS AIRPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A hijacked mainland Chinese passenger plane
landed at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in northern Taiwan at
11:17 a.m. on Wednesday, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
reported.</P>
      <P>The Air China CA905 plane was hijacked by its pilot,
identified as Yuan Bin, on a flight from Beijing to the southwestern
city of Kunming. A total of 95 passengers, including 20 foreign
nationals, and nine crew members were aboard the Boeing 737.</P>
      <P>CAA officials said the Beijing-based Civil Aviation General
Administration of China informed the CAA at 10:20 a.m. that the plane
was hijacked and would land at CKS Airport. At that time, the plane
was flying over the Fuzhou Flight Information Zone in southeastern
China.</P>
      <P>Four ROC Air Force jet fighters -- two F5Es and two IDFs --
scrambled to escort the mainland plane to land at a special runway at
CKS Airport.</P>
      <P>Mainland authorities have asked Taiwan to repatriate the plane
and all passengers and crew as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The pilot and his wife were taken to an airport office for
questioning shortly after the plane landed.</P>
      <P>Following previous practices in such cases, the pilot will stand
trial in Taiwan while the plane and all other people on board will be
permitted to leave Taiwan after finalizing certain formalities.
Investigators are still probing whether the pilot's wife was
involved in hijacking.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's flagship China Airlines has offered refueling and
catering services for the hijacked mainland plane.</P>
      <P>CAA officials said they may ask mainland China to send a pilot
to Taiwan to fly the hijacked plane back to the mainland.</P>
      <P>The hijacker was quoted as saying that he had hijacked the plane
mainly because he was dissatisfied with mainland China's civil
aviation system and his living conditions.</P>
      <P>It was the 13th mainland passenger plane hijacked to Taiwan
over the past five years. As 10 cross-strait hijacking cases occurred
in 1993 alone, the ROC government unveiled a package of regulations
governing the handling of hijacking cases in August that year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CBC CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Bank of China (CBC) on Tuesday
said it will maintain a loose monetary policy to prop up Taiwan's
economy and that it is cautiously optimistic about Taiwan's economic
prospects.</P>
      <P>Shih Chun-hua, deputy director general of the CBC's Economic
Research Department, said the bank will continue to maintain the
stable value of the New Taiwan dollar.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks in a meeting with a team of financial
researchers from the US-based Moody's Investors Service. The two
sides exchanged opinions on the CBC's monetary policy, the CBC's view
of the Asian financial crisis and the future of the local banking
industry.</P>
      <P>Regarding the impact of Asia's financial problems on the local
banking institutions, Shih admitted that financial institutions from
the grassroots level have encountered more problems. However, the
overall operating structure of the local banking sector remains sound
as the overdue loan problem in Taiwan's banking system is more slight
compared to other Asian countries, he added.</P>
      <P>Citing CBC statistics, Shih told Moody's that the rate of overdue
loans in South Korean banks averaged at around 50 percent, while the
ratio for Taiwan's banks stood at only 4 percent.</P>
      <P>Tseng Kuo-lie, deputy director general of the CBC's Banking
Examination Department, pointed out that the impact of the global
financial woes has been limited in Taiwan banks and the overall
situation in the local financial system has not showed signs of
deterioration.</P>
      <P>Although Northeast Asia, Russia and Latin America sank
successively amid the financial turmoil which originated in Southeast
Asia in the second half of last year, Taiwan's banks were able to
escape the plague because of their thin business relations with
Russia and Latin American countries, Tseng added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-based banks maintain closer business ties with Southeast
Asian countries but investment and loans provided by local banks in
such countries accounted for only 1 percent of their total assets,
according to Tseng.</P>
      <P>Pre-tax profit for Taiwan banks in the first eight months of this
year reached NT$82.5 billion (US$2.5 billion), an increase of 33
percent over the same period last year. In 1997, the banking sector
made pre-tax profits totaling NT$132 billion for the whole year, a
growth of 26 percent on a year-to-year basis.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, per-capita business revenue in the banking
sector rose from NT$11.9 million in 1996 to NT$14.1 million in 1997,
an indication that operations in local banks remained efficient,
Tseng said.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the ratio of bad checks has decreased, dropping to
0.29 percent in the first eight months of the year, from 0.32 percent
in 1997 and 0.44 percent in 1997, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PASSENGER SAFETY TOP CONSIDERATION, SAYS PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Passenger safety should be the top priority
in handling a hijacking case, Premier Vincent Siew said on Wednesday
after a mainland commercial plane was hijacked to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking through government spokesman Chen Chien-jen, Siew said
Taiwan will never condone any hijack attempt no matter how
sympathetic the culprits' motives might be. Hijacking is unacceptable
by any standard of domestic or international law and convention, he
added.</P>
      <P>Premier Siew has instructed relevant officials from the
ministries of transportation and the interior as well as the Mainland
Affairs Council to handle the hijack case, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Air China flight CA905 from Beijing to the southwestern city of
Kunming was hijacked by the pilot, identified as Yuan Bin, at around
10:00 a.m. A total of 95 passengers, including 20 foreign nationals,
and nine crew members, were aboard the Boeing 737.</P>
      <P>After the aircraft landed at Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport in northern Taiwan at 11:17, the pilot and his wife were
taken away for questioning.</P>
      <P>Yuan was reportedly unhappy with mainland China's civil aviation
system and his living quarters allocated by authorities. It is
unclear whether his wife was an accomplice in the incident.</P>
      <P>The case will be handled under international law and convention
and Taiwan's consideration of the cross-strait situation, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>He added that it would be better for him and the premier to gain
a more thorough understanding of the incident before commenting any
further.</P>
      <P>Taipei may abide by the provisions of the Hague Convention, which
requires separate treatment for hijacked aircraft and hijackers. It
would mean that the plane, its passengers and crew will be returned
soon to the mainland while Yuan Bin will be prosecuted and
incarcerated in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's intermediary body with mainland China, the Straits
Exchange Foundation, informed its Beijing counterpart, the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, about the
hijacking and Taipei's possible handling of the matter.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chin Chieh-shou, a Taipei County councilor who has
long advocated establishing the three direct links across the Taiwan
Strait, led supporters to the CKS airport. They waved banners which
read "peace across the strait, no more hijackings," and "direct
links, not hijacking." Taiwan currently bans direct trade, postal and
transportation links with the mainland.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  28  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's controversial One Nation
Party is facing a grassroots revolt with party members drafting a new
national constitution to strip its leader and two of her advisers of
their powers.</P>
      <P>The draft is designed to see Pauline Hanson step down as party
leader because she lost her re-election bid. It also aims to strip
Hanson's two advisers -- David Oldfield and David Ettridge -- of
their positions.</P>
      <P>A meeting will be held in New South Wales on Saturday to vote on
the draft's contents, according to media reports.</P>
      <P>Under the proposal, the company that currently runs One Nation
Party with Hanson, Oldfield and Ettridge as directors would be
scrapped so they would not be entitled to use or gain the majority
control of the party's trust fund that administers US$1.9 million.</P>
      <P>The US$1.9 million was given by the federal government to One
Nation because the party won an 8 percent of support from the
election despite its defeat.</P>
      <P>Hanson and the two advisers have been criticized for their
"undemocratic" party structure as they run the party as a company not
a political group.</P>
      <P>One Nation, considered racist for advocating anti-Asian
immigration, anti-Aboriginal, anti-foreign investment and
anti-multicultural policies, won 11 seats in elections for Queensland
State Parliament on June 13. However, it was the biggest loser in the
Oct. 3 federal election, only winning one Senate seat, falling far
short of Hanson's prediction of up to 12 seats in the federal
parliament.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  28  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ethnic Chinese in Indonesia now fear a
new eruption of violence as they face a hostile government under
President B.J. Habibie, according to a report in the Sydney Morning
Herald.</P>
      <P>Across Indonesia, the Chinese are cowered, frightened and
dismayed by routine reports of looting and arson, fearing that
further violence may be on the way, Asian editor David Jenkins
reported.</P>
      <P>Resentment of the ethnic Chinese, who account for 3 percent of
Indonesia's 211 million population but are said to control 70 percent
of the nation's corporate wealth, is never far below the surface.</P>
      <P>Habibie is seen courting anti-Chinese members for his Cabinet and
advancing the interests of indigenous businessmen so they can replace
ethnic Chinese who permanently fled the country during the May riots
which toppled the Suharto government.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to advance his agenda, Habibie has arranged for the
State Logistics Agency to cancel rice and cooking oil distribution
arrangements with hundreds of ethnic Chinese businessmen and award
them instead to indigenous Indonesian entrepreneurs, some of whom
have little or no experience in the field, the report said.</P>
      <P>Indonesia's rice distribution network, formerly dominated by
Chinese traders, is now in disarray because some Chinese who fled the
country have not returned and others have been encouraged to drop out
of the network.</P>
      <P>The most obvious solution to the food problem would be to
encourage the Chinese to get back into business, providing them with
guarantees that the Habibie government is serious about their safety.
But this is unlikely to happen, Jenkins reported.</P>

(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US administration has reaffirmed
its commitment to Taiwan's security in recent talks with officials
from both Taiwan and mainland China, a senior US official said on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Kurt Campbell, deputy assistant secretary of defense, also said a
top ROC military official met with Defense Secretary William Cohen
during a trip to Washington last week.</P>
      <P>Campbell said he had held "extremely good discussions" with Gen.
Tang Fei, the ROC chief of general staff, who also met with Cohen,
Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Henry Shelton and
senior officials responsible for Asia.</P>
      <P>Without going into details, Campbell told Taiwan reporters both
sides "discussed all aspects of our security relationship" in the
meetings.</P>
      <P>"And we affirmed our intention to stand by the Taiwan Relations
Act," he added.</P>
      <P>The question of Taiwan's possible participation in the US-led
development of Theater Missile Defense system also came up during
discussions.</P>
      <P>Campbell said Tang showed interest in being able to study the
system. "We stand by our commitment to talk with Taiwan about this
and study it intensively," he said.</P>
      <P>The United States has in the past had discussions with Taiwan
about TMD, a technology still on the drawing board, but Taiwan
remains uncommitted mainly because of a steep price tag.</P>
      <P>Tang left Washington on Oct. 25 after a low-profile, week-long
visit.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the question of US arms sales to Taiwan came up
during separate talks between US and mainland Chinese military
officials earlier this month, Campbell emphasized that the United
States stands by its commitments to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Walter Slocombe, "as
every senior American official always does, made clear that the
United States will stand by its commitments, particularly those made
in the TRA".</P>
      <P>Slocombe led a delegation to Beijing in mid-October for a new

    <TEXT>
      <P>The resumption of talks between
negotiators across the Taiwan Strait is a positive development for
the United States but it must remain a neutral party in the dispute,
a US China affairs expert said in a report.</P>
      <P>Harvey J. Feldman, senior fellow for China policy at the
Washington-based Heritage Foundation, said Washington must now urge
mainland China to renounce the use of force against Taiwan and
encourage cross-strait dialogue. But it must avoid getting involved
to best advance US interests in preserving peace in the region.</P>
      <P>Koo Chen-fu, chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation,
was received well by his counterpart, Wang Daohan of the Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, and PRC President Jiang
Zemin. However, many difficult issues remain to be resolved between
the two sides, including the matter of sovereignty over Taiwan,
mainland China's refusal to renounce the use of force against Taiwan,
and mainland China's refusal to allow Taiwan to participate in
international organizations, Feldman noted.</P>
      <P>The retired US ambassador said it is in the US' best interests
for cross-strait dialogue to continue and produce results that do not
endanger Taiwan's democratic or economic freedoms. The key to
ensuring this result is to pursue a policy that does not force the
United States to choose sides.</P>
      <P>Feldman said President Bill Clinton made a dangerous move by
affirming the "three noes" policy -- no support for Taiwan
independence; no one China, one Taiwan formulation; and no support
for Taiwan's membership in international organizations requiring
statehood for membership.</P>
      <P>The US should return to its previous policy of refusing to state
a preferred outcome on these specific issues. Washington should
encourage cross-strait dialogue but only state its conviction that
differences must be resolved peacefully in a way that does not
prejudice freedoms on Taiwan, according to the former Department of
State official in charge of Taiwan affairs.</P>
      <P>While avoiding the temptation to become involved as a mediator,
or to propose "solutions," Feldman continued, the US can tell Beijing
that its campaign to squeeze Taiwan completely out of international
life, such as its refusal to allow Taiwan's participation in
international humanitarian organizations like the World Health
Organization, only strengthens sentiment on Taiwan for a declaration
of de jure independence.</P>
      <P>The US should point out that a relaxation of this stand, perhaps
even agreement to sponsor Taiwan's participation in organizations
like the WHO, would have a very positive effect on cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>He added that to urge mainland China to renounce the use of force
against Taiwan is another important confidence-building measure
Washington can promote. Beijing has argued that such a renunciation
would be a limitation on the sovereignty it claims over Taiwan, and
in fact might encourage independence sentiment on the island.</P>
      <P>But Beijing's acceptance of the principle that reunification
cannot be imposed by force, and can come about only on terms agreed
by the people of Taiwan, would have a positive effect on relations
between the two sides, explained Feldman.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he noted, as stated in the Taiwan Relations Act,
America's decision to establish diplomatic relations with the
mainland "rests upon the expectation that the future of Taiwan will
be determined by peaceful means," and "any effort to determine the
future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts
or embargoes, (would be considered) a threat to the peace and
security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the
United States."</P>

    <HEADLINE>WORLDWATCH  INSTITUTE  WARNS AGAINST BIOLOGICAL POLLUTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Biological pollution is sweeping the
planet as global trade carries exotic species across all boundaries,
the US-based ecological organization Worldwatch Institute warned in a
report issued earlier this month.</P>
      <P>The institute said the bio-invasion -- the spread of exotic
species -- has become the second greatest threat to biological
diversity. Natural boundaries like mountains, deserts, and ocean
currents used to isolate one ecosystem from another, but trade,
travel and other human activities are moving more and more organisms
around these boundaries, touching off more and more invasions, the
report said.</P>
      <P>Bio-invasion is a kind of "smart pollution," because it brings
the intelligence of evolution to bear, Chris Bright, researcher and
editor at the institute, indicated.</P>
      <P>Compared to living things, chemical spills are "dumb," but when
an exotic species establishes a beachhead, it can proliferate over
time and spread to new areas, and can also adapt to get better and
better at exploiting an area's resources and at suppressing native
species.</P>
      <P>This biopollution, combined with international releases of
certain exotics, is pushing invasion rates far beyond their natural
background levels. In some areas, particularly islands, current rates
of invasion may be more than one million times their natural levels.</P>
      <P>No ecosystem can stand up to that kind of pressure indefinitely.
The bio-invasion is becoming a new measure of unsustainability within
the current economic order, Bright stressed.</P>
      <P>The need to act is growing more acute, because time does not heal
invasions and there are many potential emergencies just waiting in
the wings, Bright asserted, the biggest danger of all is global
ecological disruption.</P>
      <P>He suggested that a counterinvasion strategy should include:
repairing loopholes and strengthening relevant international
treaties; plugging the pathways through which exotics move;
developing international monitoring systems and databases to overcome
the fragmentation of information about invasive species; ending the
introduction of exotic species by natural resource managers; and
developing ecological literacy in the population as a whole.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA CHANGES TACK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct.  28  (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's decision to allow
foreign investors to borrow local currency to support their
joint-venture operations is a welcome sign that the leadership there
does not underestimate the Asian economic crisis, Singapore's The
Business Times said in its Wednesday editorial.</P>
      <P>Finally, it seems, Beijing's leaders have been compelled to take
steps to make the nation's investment environment more competitive
and business-friendly, it said.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has thus far escaped the worst of the crisis, but
it is nevertheless feeling its sting. Foreign direct investment (FDI)
is stagnating as funds from Asian countries have dried up. Before the
crisis hit, Asian investments accounted for some 70 percent of the
mainland's FDI inflow, the paper said.</P>
      <P>Officially, the mainland's FDI stands at US$20.5 billion for the
first half of this year -- a dip of a mere 1.3 percent over the
corresponding period of 1997.</P>
      <P>Given that the mainland also had a trade surplus of US$22.4
billion for the same period, the country appears well-cushioned from
the current crisis.</P>
      <P>But appearances can be deceptive. Mainland China's currency is
convertible only for trade and services payments, and investment
capital flow is tightly controlled.</P>
      <P>But the fact remains that whenever there is capital control,
there are leakages. In the past, the amount under the entry of
"errors and omissions" in its capital account -- considered a
reasonable estimate of capital flight -- was around US$20 billion per
year.</P>
      <P>This year, despite repeated official pledges not to devalue the
yuan, persistent market rumors of such a move have greatly
exacerbated capital flight; domestic institutions and individuals
hoard hard currencies, and foreign investors hold back their
investment plans, and it would be unrealistic to expect them not to
do so, the editorial said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the decision to allow foreign investors access to
yuan-denominated capital loans will do far more to lure foreign funds
back to the mainland market.</P>
      <P>By shifting the exchange rate risk from investors to the mainland
banks, the authorities are sending a powerful signal that they intend
to maintain the value of the mainland currency, the editorial said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  28 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Air China plane hijacked to Taiwan on
Wednesday morning left Chiang Kai-shek International Airport for
mainland China at 6:01 p.m.</P>
      <P>It was piloted by the original crew members minus the plane's

with his wife, Xu Mei, and was scheduled to return to the mainland
via a third country, in compliance with Taiwan's ban on direct air

aircraft and the hijack suspects.</P>
      <P>The plane was hijacked to Taiwan on Wednesday morning while on a

investigators that he carried out the hijacking because of a personal
grievance against the airline, and that no one except his wife was

    <HEADLINE>CAL PILOT SET EXAMPLE OF PILOT HIJACKING IN 1986</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Yuan Bin became the first mainland Chinese
civil aviation pilot to hijack a commercial airliner across the
Taiwan Strait on Wednesday, when he flew an Air China Boeing 737,
with 104 people aboard, to Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in
northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But Yuan was not a trendsetter. Back in 1986, a pilot from
Taiwan's flagship carrier China Airlines (CAL) diverted a Boeing
747-200F cargo plane to the southern mainland city of Guangzhou on a
flight from Bangkok to Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Wang Hsi-chueh flew the plane to Guangzhou's Bai Yuan Airport on
May 3, 1986, after he managed to overpower co-pilot Tung Kuang-hsing
and engineer Chiu Ming-chih with an ax.</P>
      <P>At that time, cross-strait relations remained tense and Taiwan
still adhered to its "no contact, no negotiation" policy. Mainland
China seized the opportunity to pressure Taiwan to conduct direct
talks and used the incident for its "united front" propaganda
purposes.</P>
      <P>Mainland authorities gave Wang a hero's welcome when he arrived
in Beijing aboard the hijacked plane. CAL first commissioned Hong
Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways to negotiate with Beijing for the
return of the plane, but was later forced to negotiate directly with
mainland China's civil aviation authorities. They finally struck a
deal under which a mainland crew flew the plane to Hong Kong for
return to CAL.</P>
      <P>Tung and Chiu were allowed to return to Taiwan, but as for Wang,
mainland authorities failed to indict him on charges of hijacking in
accordance with the international civil aviation agreement.</P>
      <P>Instead, he was appointed deputy director of the Beijing branch
of the Civil Aviation General Administration of China in June 1986.
Later that year, Wang was also named a vice chairman of the
Beijing-based Civil Aviation Professional Commission, and even served
as a standing committee member of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference.</P>
      <P>Wang had been an ROC Air Force U2 reconnaissance aircraft pilot
before he retired from the military and joined CAL. Today, his family
still cannot fully understand why he defected.</P>
      <P>Wang has now retired from all his mainland positions, and lives
in Beijing, unable to return to Taiwan as he is still wanted by the
Taipei Prosecutor's Office for his defection. His wife and children
still live in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The cargo plane hijacked by Wang crashed into mountains in the
northern Taiwan township of Wanli on Dec. 29, 1991, killing all of
the five crew members aboard.</P>
      <P>As cross-strait relations have eased since the late 1980s, the
mainland pilot who hijacked his own plane to Taiwan faces a different
fate to that of Wang.</P>
      <P>Yuan has been transferred to the Taoyuan Prosecutor's Office for
questioning, where he faces charges of hijacking. Yuan's wife,
identified as Xu Mei, an elementary school teacher, has also been
detained for suspected involvement in the case.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING URGED TO DISCUSS CROSS-STRAIT PRACTICAL ISSUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) on Wednesday urged Beijing to consult with Taipei on practical
issues arising from increasing exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The council, which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China,
made the appeal after a mainland Chinese commercial airliner, with 95
passengers and nine crew members aboard, was hijacked by its pilot to
Taiwan at 11:17 a.m.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Sheu Ke-sheng said the incident has once again
highlighted the urgency in signing a bilateral agreement on handling
cross-strait hijackings.</P>
      <P>It was the 13th time that a mainland passenger plane had been
commandeered to Taiwan over the past five years. The pilot of the
hijacked Air China Boeing 737, Yuan Bin, and his wife, Xu Mei,
have been detained for questioning, while the plane and its other
crew members and passengers were permitted to return to the
mainland in the evening.</P>
      <P>Sheu said Taiwan has handled cross-strait hijackings in
accordance with international law and practices since it
allowed cross-strait civilian exchanges and enacted a statute
governing relations between the people on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait in 1992.</P>
      <P>"We have consistently condemned hijacking and done every effort
to ensure the safety of innocent crew members and passengers," Sheu
said.</P>
      <P>The 16 mainland people involved in the previous 12 hijackings
between 1993 and 1994 have all been sentenced in Taiwan, serving
terms of six to 13 years.</P>
      <P>Two of them, Huang Shugang and Han Fengying, were already
repatriated in July 1997 after being released on parole. Six other
hijackers -- Liu Baocai, Shih Yuehpo, Lo Changhua, Wang Yuying, Yang
Mingde and Wang Zhihua -- have also been released on parole and
are staying at an illegal mainland immigrant detention center in
the northern city of Hsinchu for repatriation.</P>
      <P>The remaining eight mainland hijackers -- Zhang Wenlung, Zhang
Hai, Han Shuxuei, Li Xiangyu, Gao Juang, Qi Daquan, Lin Wenjiang and
Zhou Weijiang -- are still serving their prison terms.</P>
      <P>It remains unclear whether mainland China gave additional
penalties to the two repatriated mainland hijackers. Mainland China
has been reluctant to recognize the Republic of China's sovereign
status and its legal jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Partly because of humanitarian considerations, Taiwan has
temporarily suspended repatriation of the paroled mainland hijackers
for fear that they may face harsh punishment after their return.
Some paroled mainland hijackers had protested over their continued
"imprisonment" at the illegal mainland immigrants detention house.</P>
      <P>Sheu said Taiwan hopes to resolve these issues as soon as
possible.</P>
      <P>"We hope to work out clear and definite principles or regulations
for handling such cases in cooperation with mainland China," Sheu
said, adding that Beijing should show sincerity by resuming
cross-strait consultations on these urgent practical issues that are
closely related to the rights and interests of the people on both
sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and Beijing's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) once
discussed principles for resolving issues related to
illegal mainland immigrants and cross-strait hijacking and fishing
disputes.</P>
      <P>The two intermediary bodies authorized by their respective
governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence of
official ties, however, failed to reach consensus on several key
points, particularly those related to recognition of the ROC's
sovereignty or legal jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS originally agreed to further discuss the problems
in a planned meeting between SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu and ARATS
Chairman Wang Daohan in mid-1995. Beijing, however, unilaterally
canceled the meeting and broke off institutionalized SEF-ARATS
dialogue in anger over Taiwan's drive to upgrade its international
profile.</P>
      <P>Although cross-strait relations showed signs of warming-up
following SEF Chairman Koo's ice-melting Oct. 14-19 mainland visit,
it remains uncertain when SEF-ARATS talks on practical issues can
be resumed.</P>
      <P>Sheu said he is convinced that if an agreement on handling
cross-strait hijackings can be formally signed, it will help make
more mainland people understand that Taiwan is not a haven for
hijackers and discourage them from doing so any more.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Jaw Shau-kong, a New Party heavyweight and
manager of the party's election campaign, denied on Wednesday a
Taipei city councilor's allegation that a legislator within the party
has been recruited by Beijing to sabotage the island's economy.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Councilor Lin Rei-tu, an independent, accused New
Party lawmaker Yok Mu-ming of having been recruited by Beijing with
the aim of toppling Taiwan's economy. To back up his claim, Lin
furnished a faxed document that suggests Yok is in Beijing's employ
and that the mainland government has a list of specific Taiwan
companies whose operations it hopes to destabilize.</P>
      <P>Lin said the recent domestic economic turmoil stemming from the
financial crises of companies such as Taiwan Pineapple and Tong Lung
Metal Industry are part of Beijing's plot.</P>
      <P>Recently the New Party released information indicating links
between the ruling Kuomintang officials and some companies. But Jaw
said Wednesday that information made public by the party originally
came from Lin.</P>
      <P>Lin, together with Lin Chau-hsin, a candidate for Taipei city
council, showed a document to the press Wednesday at the council's
offices in which Yok is said to have been praised by Zeng Qinghong --
a member of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and
an alternate member of CPC's Political Bureau. Zeng allegedly
complimented Yok on a job well done, although what Zeng was crediting
Yok for was not indicated.</P>
      <P>The document also contained remarks indicating the campaign to
hamstring Taiwan's economy should be intensified in the face of
year-end elections. The disclosure of improprieties by Taiwan
companies would embarrass and damage the ruling KMT, resulting in
further turmoil in Taiwan's financial markets, according to the
document.</P>
      <P>The material shown by Lin identified 12 companies as targets in
the destabilization campaign. Among them are: Feng An Metal, Taiwan
Pineapple, China Rebar, the Cathay Group, the Evergreen Group, Hua
Eng Wire and Cable, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and United
Micro Electronics.</P>
      <P>Yok dismissed Lin's claims as ridiculous, arguing that the
information released by the New Party indicating the links between
the KMT officials and local companies was proven true during a
subsequent government investigation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Jaw said that all the information released by the New
Party was obtained from Lin himself. If anyone is working as
Beijing's operative, he said, it is Lin.</P>

    <HEADLINE>URUGUAY HAS A CHANGE OF HEART REGARDING ROC'S UN MEMBERSHIP: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Uruguay has changed its attitude toward the
Republic of China's bid to join the Untied Nations, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>MOFA made the remarks after Didier Opertti, Uruguay's foreign
minister, said in a recent radio interview that there is growing
support for Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations, despite
Beijing's persistent opposition.</P>
      <P>Opertti's remarks were made in an interview with Sonia Breccia,
host of an afternoon program broadcast on Radio Sarandi in
Montevideo, Uruguay.</P>
      <P>Opertti, who was chairman of the General Assembly of the United
Nations in September, spoke of his experience in presiding over the
assembly's general debate and of Uruguay's political situation.</P>
      <P>The problem of Taiwan's UN membership would probably be solved if
a consensus with mainland China could be reached, he said.</P>
      <P>MOFA said that as Uruguay has always observed a "one China"
policy, it has not been very supportive of the ROC's bid to join the
international organization. Opertti's remarks, however, indicate a
change in attitude, it said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WORLD BANK CHIDES WEST OVER TRADE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Oct.  28  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A top World Bank official blasted major
industrial powers for not doing enough to help the poorest nations to
engage themselves fully through trade and investment.</P>
      <P>Joseph Stiglitz, the World Bank's senior vice president and chief
economist, said that the West has advocated a trade policy agenda for
developing countries that has demonstrated a single-minded focus on
liberalization through the reduction of trade barriers.</P>
      <P>Stiglitz urged Western nations to fulfill a moral obligation to
global growth. He argued that rich nations have effectively reneged
on their responsibilities, reinforcing a perception of hypocrisy and
unfairness in which developed countries preach openness while
engaging in restrictive practices.</P>
      <P>While instructing developing nations on liberalization developed
nations "use anti-dumping and safeguard measures to protect their own
industries that are adversely affected" by such liberalizing
measures, Stiglitz said.</P>
      <P>The Uruguay Round of trade liberalization talks did not do enough
to open markets to exports from developing countries, he said. In the
case of Africa, he said the talks "offered relatively little in the
way of new market access."</P>
      <P>More needs to be done to stem the wave of new protectionism in
the West, he said. In recent years, new measures to block imports
have arisen along with laws that do not make sense economically, he
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA OFFICIAL LAUDS RUSSIAN TECHNOLOGY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  28 (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Lin Yi-fu said on
Wednesday that Russia's national defense technology is quite advanced
and that it will be conducive to upgrading Taiwan's hi-tech level
by commercializing the technology.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks at the opening of a two-day Sino-Russian
technical cooperation meeting jointly presided over by Lin and
Russian Representative to Taipei Victor Trifonov.</P>
      <P>More than 100 people, including Lin Neng-chung, director-general
of the Industrial Development and Investment Center under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA); Hsieh Fa-ta, director-general of
MOEA's International Cooperation Department; representatives from
private enterprises, and from the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial
Park; attended the meeting.</P>
      <P>Lin pointed out that two-way trade between the Republic of China
and Russia has grown from US$1.19 million in 1990 to US$1.4 billion
last year, but was affected recently by the onset of Asia's economic
crisis. However, Lin said, there remains ample room for economic
and trade development between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Trifonov noted that as there are still no Taiwan banks
in Russia, the main difficulty for both sides is the lack of a
financial channel between them. The two countries may, however,
engage in technical cooperation projects to promote economic
relations.</P>
      <P>Russia, which is in the throes of recession, is eager to earn
hard currency by selling its advanced technology, and the MOEA, which
is setting its sights on ensuring the market's long-term success,
believes now is a good time for Taiwan to import Russian
technological know-how.</P>
      <P>Dmitry L. Zouber, one of five Russian technological experts at
the meeting, explained that the financial turmoil in Asia has in turn
triggered a crisis in Russia as well. As a result, Russia has come to
the meeting in hopes of entering into cooperative agreements with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said they will demonstrate 69 transferable Russian
technologies to Taiwan and will take back to Russia concepts on
operating and managing modern enterprises.</P>
      <P>Among the technologies presented at the meeting are ones
concerned with the purification of drinking water, the treatment of
industrial waste water, the recycling of tires and polymers and the
establishment of factories to process industrial waste.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND PILOT HAS NO REGRETS OVER HIJACKING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  28  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Yuan Bin, the pilot who hijacked an
Beijing-based Air China airplane to Taiwan Wednesday morning, said he
does not regret his actions.</P>
      <P>Yuan, 30, who diverted the Beijing-Kunming flight to Taiwan, was
detained in Taoyuan by investigators, as the plane was returned to
mainland China Wednesday evening.</P>
      <P>Yuan told investigators that he felt sad but not remorseful for
what he did, adding that he would do it again given his personal feud
with the airline's authorities.</P>
      <P>Yuan complained to investigators that he had been treated
unfairly by the airline and that about half a month ago he and his
wife Xu Mei concocted a plan to hijack the plane and fly it to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Xu, a 27-year-old primary school teacher, is in custody in
Taoyuan. During the flight to Taiwan she sat behind the co-pilot in
the cockpit.</P>
      <P>Yuan said he diverted the plane from its normal route to Kunming,
in the province of Yunnan as he passed through Taiyuan, located in
the province of Sanxi.</P>
      <P>After learning what Yuan had done, the co-pilot, Wen Fei, tried
unsuccessfully to dissuade him from hijacking the plane.</P>
      <P>The plane arrived in Taoyuan at about 11 a.m., and Yuan and his
wife alighted under the escort of local police.</P>
      <P>The couple admitted hijacking the plane and expressed their
willingness to stand trial in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The airplane, a Boeing 737-300, left Taiwan for Xiamen at 6:01
p.m. Wednesday evening.</P>
      <P>Before the plane left for the mainland, Beijing had demanded its
immediate return, along with the return of Yuan and Xu, in a letter
sent by its Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait to
Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>The letter faxed to SEF Wednesday afternoon also asked Taiwan to
arrange for the plane to be flown to Xiamen in Fujian province and to
ensure the safety of its passengers.</P>
      <P>The plane, carrying 95 passengers, was flown to Xiamen under the
control of an Air China relief crew that was to have replaced the
original crew once the plane reached Kunming. From there it was to
have flown to Rangoon, Myanmar.</P>
      <P>Yin Tsung-wen, director of Taiwan's National Security Bureau,
ordered Taiwan's intelligence agencies to investigate the hijacking.
He issued the order at a meeting of a Cabinet crisis management
panel, which convened Wednesday. It was the panel that decided to
detain Yuan and his wife while returning the plane to the mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRECONDITIONS TO ARATS HEAD'S VISIT TO TAIWAN HARMFUL: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York, Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By K.C. Huang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If Beijing were to set preconditions for
a visit by its top negotiator to Taiwan, it would only be harmful to
the gradually warming cross-strait relations, a Hong Kong-based China
affairs scholar said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Prof. Byron Weng of the Chinese University of Hong Kong made the
remark in a roundtable discussion on relations across the Taiwan
Strait held at Columbia University. He was referring to a planned
visit to Taiwan early next year by Beijing's Wang Daohan, chairman of
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Wang and his Taipei counterpart, Koo Chen-Fu, chairman of Straits
Exchange Foundation, met earlier this month in Shanghai and forged a
four-point agreement. One of the points was a Taiwan visit by Wang.</P>
      <P>Weng said Koo's Oct. 14-19 visit to the mainland was helpful to
the cross-strait ties. He added that although Koo's visit to Shanghai
and Beijing did not narrow the distance between Taipei and Beijing,
it did allow both sides to state their positions much more clearly,
which is conducive to redressing the cross-strait differences.</P>
      <P>Another factor hampering cross-strait dialogue is US President
Bill Clinton's affirmation of Beijing's "three-noes" policy toward
Taiwan, Weng noted. The codifying of the policy has only made
rapprochement efforts more rigid and limited, he said. The policy's
three provisions are no support for Taiwan's independence, no
support for "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan," and no support
for Taiwan's membership in international organizations that require
statehood.</P>
      <P>However, Weng said he understood the US made the statement out of
consideration of its own interests, and under pressure from Beijing.</P>
      <P>There is no rule on separated nations in current international
law and convention for Taiwan and the mainland to follow, therefore
Taiwan has been deprived of just and equal opportunities in the
international community, Weng stated.</P>
      <P>He urged the United States, as leader of the international
community, to take the initiative in studying relevant rules toward
that direction.</P>
      <P>Andrew Nathan, a professor with Columbia University, who also
took part in the roundtable talk, said the United States' attitude
toward China took a turnabout in 1996 after Beijing launched missiles
and held live-fire war games in the Taiwan Strait. Washington went
from being not concerned to being seriously concerned about a
possible break out of war in the strait.</P>
      <P>Although President Clinton made the "three-noes" announcement
under the United States' own judgment, Nathan said, the decision was
made mainly as a result of Beijing's pressure.</P>
      <P>Nathan said US engagement with China is apparently not serving
Taiwan's interests, because it is shrinking Taiwan's activity arena
and forcing the island to return to the negotiating table with the
mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US SHOULD SUPPORT TAIWAN: OBSERVER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States should support Taiwan
because the island represents the best model for mainland China's
future, a US observer wrote in the Washington Times on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Mark P. Logan, a research fellow at the Chicago-based Council on
Foreign Relations, said the Clinton administration wrongly believes
Taiwan is an explosively sensitive issue with Beijing and must not be
allowed to sidetrack perceived progress in Sino-US dialogue. This
view was highlighted in US President Bill Clinton's affirmation in
Shanghai of Beijing's "three noes" regarding Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The tilt away from Taiwan began months preceding Clinton's visit
to the mainland, Logan stated. To avoid high-level official contact
with Taiwan, a group of former Clinton hands went to Taipei in
January 1998. They included former defense secretary William Perry,
former chairman of joint chiefs of staff John Shalikashvili, and
former assistant secretary of defense Joseph Nye. Their message to
Taipei was -- don't provoke Beijing with moves toward independence.</P>
      <P>The Clinton administration and most foreign policy officials came
away with the wrong lesson from the March 1996 missile crisis in the
Taiwan Strait, Logan said. While China was lobbing missiles near
Taiwan's two principal ports during its first free presidential
election, elite opinion believes it is Taiwan which is the dangerous
source of provocation.</P>
      <P>One lesson of the Reagan era which still applies despite the
dissolution of the Cold War is that weakness and ambiguity beget
aggression by autocracies, wrote the research fellow. The Clinton
administration's self-professed strategic ambiguity about supporting
Taiwan only exacerbated the March 1996 crisis -- necessitating
deployment of two carriers in the Taiwan Strait at the eleventh hour.
"Backing Taiwan is an important part of a regional policy which
deters China as a rising military power," he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is even more significant to the United States on the
political front. Taiwan has successfully moved away from a one-party
dictatorship to a full-fledged democracy, thereby offering a road map
for the mainland to follow, Logan wrote.</P>
      <P>Foreign policy and business elites who seek trade in Asia and
urge don't-rock-the-boat diplomacy with China often look to Singapore
as a model for the PRC's future. In the eyes of Lee Kuan Yew's
admirers, Singapore harnesses a potent engine of capitalism with
governance which stresses order above all.</P>
      <P>However, Logan said Taiwan's openness is a far better model for
the PRC. Skeptics about Taiwan cite fisticuffs in its Legislative Yuan
and evidence that the Democratic Progressive Party is not ready for
the prime time. But intense debate in the national legislature and
development of a vital opposition are examples of political
competition, he explained.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC-AUSTRALIA TIES PROGRESSING STEADILY (1)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  29  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Relations between Taiwan and Australia
are progressing steadily despite Canberra's strict adherence to its
one-China policy, the representative of the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office (TECO) in Canberra said.</P>
      <P>Liu Po-lun, in an interview with CNA, said there is still room
for further improvement in substantive ties between the Republic of
China and Australia as the two countries compliment each other.
However, there is only limited improvement in high-level contact
between the ROC and Australia because Canberra is very careful not to
upset Beijing given its one-China policy.</P>
      <P>Political analysts agreed, saying there is a limited scope for
Taiwan to make any breakthrough in political ties because of China's
constant pressure on Australia.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan wants to gain some ground in high-level contact with
Australia, it has to keep a low profile in order not to upset
Canberra's one-China policy," said Associate Professor C.L. Chiou of
the University of Queensland in Brisbane.</P>
      <P>He cited the low-profile overnight stay of ROC Premier Vincent
Siew in Australia as an example. Canberra allowed Siew to make a
stopover in Brisbane on his way to Guam in June this year, making him
the most senior official from Taiwan to set foot in Australia.</P>
      <P>While Australia considers the mainland as a big country and a
huge market, Taiwan continues to offer substantial investment
opportunities, TECO's Liu said.</P>
      <P>Foreign investment from Taiwan to Australia increased in 1997
after Taiwan Sugar Corp. and Taiwan Pineapple Co. established a joint
venture with their Australian counterpart in the livestock industry.
Taiwan interests invested in hog raising and prawn farm ventures in
Queensland and the Northern Territory. All this followed a 10 percent
investment by Taiwan Power Co. in an Australian coal mining venture
in Hunter Valley in New South Wales in 1996, he added.</P>
      <P>A nearly US$1 billion joint venture by An Feng Steel Corp. of
Kaohsiung with its Australian partner Kingstream Resources in Western
Australia was launched and is expected to be completed with
production beginning in 2000.</P>
      <P>In addition, a group of senior executives from Taiwanese computer
firms, including Acer Taiwan, arrived in Australia in October for an
on-the-spot survey to explore possible opportunities in setting up
joint ventures with their Australian counterparts.</P>
      <P>Liu said the ROC is strong in IT hardware while Australia is
strong in software. Australia is also strong in its health sciences,
environmental protection activities, information and biological
technologies, all areas of possible future cooperation and exchange.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Howard administration is currently undergoing a
tax reform, in which a reduction in income and corporate taxes is
expected.</P>
      <P>"This is good news for our investors because lower taxes would
help cut their costs and sharpen their competitiveness in the world
market," Liu said.</P>
      <P>"There is room for expansion in two-way trade despite the impact
of the Asian financial crisis," Liu said. Both Taiwan and Australia
are less affected by the Asian crisis, and this reflects a steady
growth in two-way trade in fiscal 1997-98.</P>
      <P>Australia's exports to Taiwan in 1997-98 rose 17 percent from the
1996-97 level while trade between Australia and mainland China and
other Asian countries dropped during the same period.</P>
      <P>In calendar 1997, Australia's exports to Taiwan jumped 18 percent
to A$4 billion (US$3.22 billion), the highest growth rate for
Australia in terms of export growth rate in Asia that year, Liu said.
Meanwhile, Australia exports to China plunged 17 percent in the first
six months of 1998.

    <HEADLINE>ROC-AUSTRALIA TIES PROGRESSING STEADILY (2)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  29  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In 1997, Taiwan was Australia's fifth largest market, trailing
behind only Japan, South Korea, the United States and New Zealand.</P>
      <P>In the first nine months of 1998, two-way trade between Taiwan
and Australia rose 9.7 percent to A$4.9 billion (US$3.3 billion).</P>
      <P>Taiwan continues to be one of the largest buyers of Australian
iron ore, coal, lead, copper, agricultural produce, seafood and beef.
Taiwan is also a major importer of leather, nickel, zinc, petroleum,
woodchip and rotating electric plant from Australia.</P>
      <P>Liu predicted the prospects of two-way trade are bright in coming
years with Australia.</P>
      <P>He said two-way investment remains behind trade volume, but
investment from Taiwan in Australia has been showing signs of
increasing since 1996 and the trend could continue in the foreseeable
future. Liu added that investment from Australia in Taiwan has not
increased as rapidly as Taiwanese investment in Australia.</P>
      <P>"We hope Australia can increase its investment and use Taiwan as
a base to market its products to other Asian countries, including
mainland China," he said.</P>
      <P>In terms of Australian travelers to Taiwan, the number is far
below those traveling in the opposite direction, Liu noted. Although
there was some increase in the number of Australians going to Taiwan,
most of these visitors were conducting business rather than pleasure
trips.</P>
      <P>Australian official statistics showed there were 33,255
Australians going to Taiwan in calendar 1997, up 6.64 percent from a
year ago. Taiwanese tourists to Australia rose almost 1 percent to
98,915 in the first 7 months of 1998.</P>
      <P>The depreciation of the Australian dollar has helped it in terms
of higher exports to Taiwan and is attracting more Taiwan students to
study Down Under.</P>
      <P>"Australia is now more competitive than other educational
exporting countries as a result of its currency devaluation," Liu
said.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are about 9,000 students from Taiwan studying in
Australia and Liu hoped Australia will pay more attention to the
Taiwan market.</P>
      <P>Other ties, including cultural and scientific exchanges, have
also increased steadily between Taiwan and Australia in the past
year, Liu said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Provincial Government has sent some of its officials
to be trained in Australia and the Queensland government is expected
to send its officials to receive training in Taiwan so that each side
is familiar with the other which is conducive to the forging of
better ties in the future.</P>
      <P>"We are glad that our ties with Australia are progressing
steadily. And we hope we could do even better to improve our
bilateral ties in the coming years so that both countries could
benefit mutually," Liu said.</P>

(By Herman Pan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US Department of Commerce announced
on Wednesday it will levy preliminary anti-dumping duties on imports
of stainless steel plate in coils from Taiwan and five other
countries.</P>
      <P>The Commerce Department's preliminary determination was that
imports of stainless steel plate in coils from Belgium, Canada,
Italy, South Africa, South Korea and Taiwan were sold at less than
fair market prices in the United States.</P>
      <P>Imports from Taiwan received the highest initial anti-dumping
duty with 67.68 percent, and South Korea the lowest with 2.77
percent.</P>
      <P>Importers will now be required to post bonds to get clearance
with the US Customs Service to assure payment of the anti-dumping
duties.</P>
      <P>The department's investigation was initiated on March 31 when
four US producers of stainless steel plate, the United Steelworkers
of America, and two independent unions petitioned the US government
to look into dumping charges.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the US Specialty Steel Industry of North America
said, "We expect these (dumping) margins to go higher after further
investigation."</P>
      <P>The Commerce Department is expected to make its final ruling
early next year. After the final anti-dumping orders are published,
imports of stainless steel plate in coils from the targeted countries
will be subject to collection of anti-dumping duties.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing authorities shut down a fledging
pro-democracy group and questioned its leaders after signing earlier
this month an international human rights treaty, the Sydney Morning
Herald reported.</P>
      <P>Chinese police raided the offices of the China Development Union
(CDU) this week, detaining its secretary Peng Ming and two other
officials for three hours questioning before ordering them to close,
the report said.</P>
      <P>President Jiang Zemin was widely congratulated for signing the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which guarantees
the right to organize political parties and protects the freedom of
expression.</P>
      <P>According to the CDU, Jiang ordered the closure of the party.
"The closing down of the union shows that Jiang has no plans for
political reform at all," the CDU said in a statement.</P>
      <P>Human rights groups have been skeptical about China's willingness
to fully implement the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights after
the official media signaled that China would seek exemptions. They
also suspected China would delay ratifying the treaty for as long as
possible, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>Chinese authorities have moved to block other challenges to the
Communist Party's monopoly on politics. Dissidents in nine provinces
and in Beijing and Shanghai have unsuccessfully attempted to register
the China Democratic Party in recent months as activists test the
government's willingness to allow more political freedom, the Herald
reported.</P>

      <P>Australia has canceled war games and
suspended other contact with Indonesia following damaging reports
over human rights abuses by its elite special forces, the Australian
reported.</P>
      <P>The Australian Defense Force (ADF) has abandoned two major
military exercises and other contacts with Indonesia's elite special
forces -- Kopassus -- because of its record of systematic human right
abuses, the paper said.</P>
      <P>Since the fall of former President Suharto in May, the Kopassus
abuses, including its repression on dissent, were becoming known to
the public.</P>
      <P>Aside from canceling the two exercises in Australia, the ADF
also abandoned a special armed service exercise in Indonesia in June
and the scrapping of planned command-level visits.</P>
      <P>The two exercises involving small contingents of troops from
Australia's special armed services and Kopassus are designed to train

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's inflation rate in the third
quarter of 1998 rose to 1.3 percent per annum, far below government
expectation of between 2 and 3 percent.</P>
      <P>Lower inflation helped boost the local stock and foreign exchange
markets on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Inflation, measured by the consumer price index, rose 0.2 percent
in the third quarter, which translated into an inflationary rate of
1.3 percent yearly compared to the previous year.</P>
      <P>The lower inflation rate prompted financial market economists to
predict that the Reserve Bank of Australia would further reduce
official interest rates by at least 0.25 percentage point.</P>
      <P>The All Ordinaries Index rose 32.3 points to close at 2,615.2 on
Wednesday from Tuesday's close. The index increased 16.7 points
further in Thursday morning trade.</P>
      <P>The Australian dollar also rose 0.22 US cents to close at 61.72
US cents on Wednesday from the Tuesday level. The dollar remained

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SECOND-SAFEST ECONOMY IN ASIA: PERC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Oct.  29  (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China on Taiwan was
rated the second-most stable economy for business of 10 countries and
areas in Asia in 1998 by the Hong Kong-based Political and Economic
Risk Consultancy Ltd. (PERC).</P>
      <P>In the findings of a survey devoted to social unrest in Asia,
PERC said that Singapore was regarded by respondents as the most
socially stable economy in Asia since the region was hit by economic
turmoil in late 1997. Taiwan and Japan, meanwhile, tied for second
place.</P>
      <P>On a scale of zero to 10, with zero indicating absolute
stability, Singapore received a rating of 1.5. Taiwan and Japan both
received a score of 2, a marked increase for Taiwan, which scored 3.5
in 1997 and 4.5 in 1996.</P>
      <P>In the survey Hong Kong received a score of 3.5, the Philippines
4, Vietnam 4.5, mainland China 5.5, India and Thailand 6, South Korea
7, Malaysia 7.5 and Indonesia 9.</P>
      <P>Over the last 10 months only Taiwan, the Philippines and Vietnam
showed declines in their social unrest index, or improved stability,
the organization said.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted in mid-October, PERC officials said, and
Taiwan's decline in the social unrest index can be attributed to the
reduced number of political protests and demonstrations during the
last 10 months.</P>
      <P>Despite its rising unemployment, Taiwan has come through the
regional crisis relatively unscathed, making it the region's most
competitive economy, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Compared with last year, Taiwan is now more socially stable, and
that stability is largely related to its democratic development, PERC
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's political system has successfully changed from a
single-party to multi-party democracy, it noted. For the most part,
emotional and often unreasonable political arguments have been
replaced by debates on issues involving social welfare and garbage
handling, it added.</P>
      <P>PERC said the Asian economic crisis has deepened social unrest
throughout the region. From Hong Kong to South Korea, regional
economies have been affected by the crisis, although Indonesia and
Malaysia have been hardest hit.</P>
      <P>In the face of the economic meltdown, some governments adopted
tougher financial policies, which scared off foreign capital, further
slowing economic growth in those countries, PERC said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE'S MANUFACTURING WAGES REMAIN HIGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,   Oct.   29   (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's manufacturing wages
continued to rank higher than those of other east Asian economies
last year, although wages in Taiwan and Hong Kong trailed fairly
close behind.</P>
      <P>According to the 1998 World Competitiveness Yearbook, the average
hourly income of manufacturing workers in Singapore was US$6.70 last
year -- the highest in Asia, excluding Japan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Hong Kong followed close behind, with hourly wages of
US$5.60 and US$5.10, respectively, while South Korea's hourly
manufacturing wage averaged US$3.90. The figures were based on data
from the US Department of Labor and from organizations in Singapore.</P>
      <P>Singapore's average manufacturing wage was reported as US$7.30
per hour in the 1997 yearbook, while the average hourly wages in
South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong were US$7.10, US$5.60 and US$4.80,
respectively. Those figures, however, referred to pay levels in 1996.</P>
      <P>For many of the 46 economies tracked in the rankings -- compiled
and presented by IMD, an executive management school in Lausanne,
Switzerland -- the decline in manufacturing wages in US dollar terms
last year was the result of a regional economic slowdown and weaker
currencies.</P>
      <P>This year's report also indicates Asian workers, excluding those
from Japan, are hard-working, yet produce less per person than their
European and American counterparts, the figures show.</P>
      <P>But Singapore's industrial productivity, adjusted for purchasing
power parity, ranked 17th, while South Korea finished seventh. In
terms of service, Singapore finished 12th, behind both Hong Kong and
Taiwan. In terms of gross domestic product per person employed,
Singapore finished 13th at US$47,945 while Hong Kong was ninth with
US$51,086.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S RESPONSE TO US CALLS VERY SLOW: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los Angeles, Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Chu Lu-sheng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing is reacting slowly to US calls
for greater trade balance, cooperation over North Korea, and economic
reforms, dubbed the "three slows" in a Los Angeles Times report on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The latest trade figures, made public last week, showed that the
US trade deficit with mainland China reached US$6 billion in August
-- higher than the deficit with Japan or any other country.</P>
      <P>US exports to the mainland have been dropping while its imports
from China have been rising, leading Clinton administration officials
to becoming increasingly irked at Beijing's efforts to protect its
markets for items such as pharmaceuticals.</P>
      <P>In recent months, North Korea has fired a missile over Japan and
there have been new signs that it may be secretly continuing its
nuclear program despite the agreement it reached with the US in 1994.</P>
      <P>Yet whenever the US asks Beijing officials to help restrain North
Korea, they reply that they have little clout in Pyongyang. That line
is beginning to wear thin in Washington even in the Clinton
administration, which is far more inclined to sympathize with
Beijing's view than Congress.</P>
      <P>Clinton administration officials have also begun to voice
unhappiness with the way the Beijing regime has retreating from
economic liberalization.</P>
      <P>As Beijing continues to drag its feet, a bubbling confrontation
between it and Washington may be brewing. These problems are not at
the moment matters of intense controversy, but they could easily
become so when a new Congress convenes in Washington next year, the
report said.</P>

reminded the public that mainland Chinese currency should not be

    <HEADLINE>DPP POLL FINDS PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR KMT MAJORITY IN LEGISLATURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  29  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Public support for the ruling Kuomintang
seems to have rebounded after the party suffered a spate of
embarrassing electoral defeats in the past few years, according to
the results of an opinion poll released on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 1,090 eligible voters residing across the
island was conducted by the main opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) between Oct. 22-24 with a view to understand public
opinion about major domestic political parties.</P>
      <P>Survey results showed that 41 percent of the respondents said
they hoped to see the KMT win more than half of the legislative seats
up for grabs in the upcoming parliamentary elections, while 34
percent said they would not like to see the ruling party control
majority seats in the legislature. Another 20 percent didn't clearly
express their opinion.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Chiou Yi-jen said the poll results
indicated that local people remain wary of the scenario that no
party manages to control half of the seats in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chiou pointed out that whether or not the KMT wins half of the
legislative seats is tantamount to a choice between "stability" and
"instability" or "chaos."</P>
      <P>"Those who hope to see the KMT win majority seats apparently
opt for stability, while those who choose the opposite prefer to see
the government subject to tighter supervision," Chiou explained.</P>
      <P>He stressed that if the KMT loses its dominant status in the Dec.
5 elections, it will mark a a new stage in Taiwan's political
history. "If no single party manages to control majority seats in
the new legislature, our government will then be subject to stricter
parliamentary supervision and our political check-and-balance system
can therefore be truly substantiated."</P>
      <P>Among major domestic parties, 25 percent said they most like the
KMT; 23 percent chose the pro-independence DPP; only 5 percent said
they most favor the pro-unification New Party.</P>
      <P>The main reason cited by the respondents for their affection for
the KMT is that they feel the party has the ability to rule; public
affection for the DPP lies with their conviction that the party is
more reform-minded; while the biggest attraction of the New Party is
its clean image.</P>
      <P>As for the party most unattractive to those interviewed, 25
percent cited the New Party; 12 percent chose the DPP; only 6
percent cited the KMT; and 58 percent said they couldn't make a
choice.</P>
      <P>Poll results showed that many DPP opponents perceived the party
as "violent, radical and divisive"; while the KMT's most serious
shortcomings were corruption and inefficiency; and intraparty
squabbling was most detrimental to the New Party's public image.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 70 percent of the respondents have
not yet decided which party they will support in the year-end
legislative elections; 13 percent said they will vote for the KMT; 9
percent said they will opt for the DPP; 1.9 percent said they will
throw support behind the New Party; and only 0.2 percent said they
will vote for the burgeoning Taiwan Independence Party.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, those who hope to see the KMT win more than
half of the legislative seats age over 40 and are less educated.
About 40 percent of male respondents said they do not like to see the
KMT win majority legislative seats, but only 28 percent of
female respondents said they hope the KMT will lose its majority
status in the new legislature.</P>
      <P>"The figures indicated that local women still remember
the DPP's previous violent, radical image," Chiou said.</P>
      <P>Survey results further showed that local people generally feel
that the KMT is more competent at handling issues related to national
security, economic development, educational reform and diplomatic
problems and that the DPP is more good at planning a reasonable
social welfare system, environmental protection, crime-fighting and
taking care of underprivileged groups.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CNFOI URGES SETTING ASIDE OF CROSS-STRAIT POLITICAL DIFFERENCES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  29  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Both sides of the Taiwan Strait should
shorten the process of political discussion and seek to set aside
their political differences for the sake of mutual economic
development, urged the Chinese National Federation of Industries
(CNFOI) on Thursday.</P>
      <P>CNFOI Chairman Kao Chin-yen made the remarks while meeting with a
five-member delegation from mainland China. The delegation was headed
by Zhou Ruijin, deputy editor in chief of The People's Daily -- an
organ under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.</P>
      <P>Kao expressed his hope that an environment free of political
differences across the strait can be created. He likewise urged
people on both sides of the strait to prepare themselves to work for
sustained economic development over the next 50 years, as the Chinese
people will be in the driver's seat of the global economy in the next
century, he said.</P>
      <P>The just-concluded meeting between Taipei's top envoy to the
mainland, Koo Chen-fu, and his mainland counterpart, Wang Daohan,
will lead to improved economic development for both sides, Kao said.</P>
      <P>If political differences cannot be delt with peacefully,
engagements between the two sides will remain fraught with risks, he
said, adding that this is not something Taiwan's business community
wishes to see.</P>
      <P>Kao suggested people on both sides of the strait make economic
development, not political discussion, their common goal during the
next 50 years, with an eye toward playing the leading role in driving
the global economy in the 21st century.</P>
      <P>The CNFOI chairman said that if both sides maintained an emphasis
on economic development, mainland China and Taiwan's gross national
product per capita could amount to US$15,000 and US$30,000,
respectively, within 50 years. At that point, reunification between
the two sides could be easily achieved, he said.
 Besides Zhou, the delegation comprised Wang Xien, director of the
Liaison Department under the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait; Gao Haihao, deputy editor in chief of the East China
Branch of The People's Daily; Yang Zhengwu, deputy director of the
science, education and culture section of The People's Daily; and
Gai Lihua, general manager of the mainland news company under The

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA SEES FEWER ASIAN TOURISTS THIS YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China has become a fast-growing
tourist market for Australia, while the number of tourists coming
from Hong Kong and Taiwan remain significant even in the wake of the
Asian financial crisis, according to the Australian Tourist
Commission (ATC).</P>
      <P>ATC Managing Director John Morse said in statement Friday that
strong inbound tourism growth from both emerging markets, including
mainland China, and traditional ones have helped offset the impact of
softening Asian markets.</P>
      <P>In the first seven months of this year, 45,080 mainland Chinese
tourists visited Australia, an increase of 26.5 percent over the same
period last year. Meanwhile, arrivals from Taiwan rose nearly 1
percent to 98,915 during the same period as compared with
year-earlier levels. The number coming from Hong Kong, however, fell
7 percent to 87,648.</P>
      <P>Morse said the slump in Hong Kong tourists was more strongly
pronounced at the beginning of this year and that the number coming
to Australia has since picked up.</P>
      <P>In the first seven months of this year, Australia attracted
nearly 2.34 million foreign tourists, down 5 percent from the same
1997 period, he said. Australia's broad tourism marketing strategy
enables the industry to withstand a slowdown from any single region,
he added.</P>
      <P>Arrivals from Australia's largest tourist market, Japan, dropped
6.2 percent to 440,657 in the first seven months of this year
compared with year-earlier levels.</P>

      <P>Australia requires a population of 50
million people to keep pace with technological developments and to
develop companies sufficiently large and smart enough to survive the
rigors of globalization in the next century, according to John White,

      <P>As of March 1998, Australia's population totaled only 18.7
million, smaller even than the 21.1 million population of Taiwan,

    <HEADLINE>ROC FOREIGN MINISTER ON OVERSEAS VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu has left for an
overseas trip, Vice Foreign Minister David Lee confirmed on Friday,
without divulging the country or countries Hu is to visit.</P>
      <P>Lee said only that Hu is going to a country which does not
maintain formal diplomatic relations with the Republic of China, and
pointed out that "as the country does not maintain official ties with
the ROC, we cannot divulge any details at the moment."</P>
      <P>Despite a thaw in relations across the Taiwan Strait, mainland
China has not eased off in its efforts to isolate Taiwan in the
international community.</P>
      <P>"In the face of Beijing's persistent diplomatic strangulation
strategy against the ROC, we cannot simply stay at home, and must
instead step boldly into the world arena to forge friendships and
relationships with as many countries as possible," said Lee.</P>
      <P>He would not elaborate on how many countries Hu will visit during
his trip. "The minister's itinerary has not yet been finalized, but
his overseas visit will not last for long," he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry spokesman Roy Wu said the ministry
will brief the press on where Hu has visited, and who he has met, as
well as the main purposes of his visit, after he has returned to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Beijing refuses to recognize the ROC's sovereignty, and is very
sensitive to Taiwan's engagements with countries which recognize
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Against this background, senior ROC officials have often kept
their overseas travel plans secret, particularly in regard to
countries which do not maintain official ties with Taipei. In some
cases, ROC officials have been forced to cancel their scheduled
overseas trips simply because of strong protests to the host country
by Beijing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC AIR FORCE LOGISTIC COMMAND RECEIVES AS9000 CERTIFICATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  30  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Air Force Second Logistic Command in
the central Taiwan city of Taichung on Friday became the first
Republic of China military unit to receive AS9000 quality
certification.</P>
      <P>Maj. Gen. Wu Hu-sheng, commander of the logistic command,
received the certificate of quality from Tsai Tung-yi, representative
in Taiwan of the US-based Bell International Certification Co., in a
ceremony held in Taichung to mark the achievement.</P>
      <P>AS9000 certification is based on the Aerospace Basic Quality
System jointly worked out by the US Department of Defense, the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Federal
Aviation Administration last year.</P>
      <P>The new certification system, patterned after ISO9000 which
certifies the quality of general industrial products and commercial
services, is aimed at standardizing product and service quality in
the newly flourishing aerospace industry.</P>
      <P>Wu said the military has for some time consistently asked all of
its technological units to meet ISO9000 standards of quality.</P>
      <P>"After the AS9000 quality certification system for the aerospace
industry was unveiled last year, we stepped up our efforts to further
improve our product and service quality to meet its requirements," Wu
said, adding that the logistic command's acquisition of AS9000
certification indicates that its efforts over the past year have paid
off.</P>
      <P>With aerospace-related engineering technology, products and
services becoming ever more complicated, Wu said, military logistic
units should devote even more effort to quality control in importing,
designing and manufacturing aerospace facilities and relevant
equipment to prevent mishaps and ensure smooth combat preparedness.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the military-run Chungshan Institute of Science and
Technology has signed an agreement with Bell on certifying product
and service quality of military logistic and professional service
units over the next three years.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the contract, Bell will only collect document
fees while exempting all other service charges for certifying work
quality of ROC military logistic and professional units. This will
help save the ROC military coffers more than NT$10 million annually.</P>
      <P>Bell said its generous offer is aimed mainly at helping promote
the ROC military's modernization and professionalism.</P>

(By F. C. Kuo and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China and Thailand finally
initialed an agreement on Friday on exempting double taxation on
investors from both countries.</P>
      <P>The Double Taxation Agreement (DTA) with Thailand was struck
after five rounds of talks spanning more than seven years.</P>
      <P>The final round of negotiations opened in Bangkok on Wednesday,
with Sam D.S. Wang, director-general of the Taxation Department
under the ROC's Ministry of Finance, and Sanit Rangnoi,
director-general of the Thai government's Revenue Department,
serving as chief negotiators.</P>
      <P>As the ROC doesn't maintain formal diplomatic ties with
Thailand, the two sides have spent much time mending their
differences over some technical issues, including the title of the
agreement.</P>
      <P>"We have finally managed to reach agreement based on three key
principles -- promoting mutual investment, mutual tax exemption and
boosting friendship," Wang said.</P>
      <P>The agreement is still pending the approval and ratification of
the govenrments and legislatures of the two countries.</P>
      <P>After the accord takes effect, Wang said, the tax burden for
Taiwan investors in Thailand will be reduced, and vice versa. "The
exemption of double taxation is expected to help stimulate Taiwan
entrepreneurs' interest in investing in Thailand and may also
attract Thai companies, particularly those owned by ethnic Chinese
business people, to invest in Taiwan," Wang added.</P>
      <P>Similar double taxation exemption agreements the ROC has signed
with Singapore, Indonesia, New Zealand, Australia, Vietnam and South
Africa have already taken effect.
 In addition, Taiwan has also initialed similar TDAs with
Swaziland, the Gambia, Poland, Paraguay, Malaysia and Thailand,
which are still pending legislative approval.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN DELEGATION IN JAPAN EXPLAINS STANCE ON CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Oct.  30  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A visiting Taiwan expert in cross-Taiwan
Strait affairs said Thursday that Taiwan regards the recent Koo-Wang
meetings as a constructive beginning to cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>Tsan chih-hung, deputy secretary of the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) made the remarks while explaining Taiwan's view of
the meetings to around 50 local and foreign journalists in Tokyo.</P>
      <P>Tsan, along with Tseng Yung-hsien, an advisor to ROC President
Lee Teng-hui, and Chang Jung-kung, director general of the
Kuomintang's Mainland Research Department, are on a five-day visit to
Japan to report on the results of the Oct. 14-19 "ice-melting trip"
to mainland China by SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu.</P>
      <P>The SEF is a quasi-official organization founded in 1991 by the
ROC authorities to handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence of
official links.</P>
      <P>During the 90-minute press conference, Tsan explained Taiwan's
next step will be to revive regular cross-strait exchanges, and to
plan for a visit by Wang to Taiwan next year, as well as to enhance
services for the people of both sides.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the meetings, one Japanese political observer
expressed his disagreement with the view that Taipei can persuade
Beijing to give up the threat of using military power against Taiwan
and that it can bring about democracy on the mainland merely by
talking.</P>
      <P>Chang said he agreed with the doubt, noting that late Beijing
leader Deng Xiaoping's reluctance to renounce the use of military
force against the island is deeply rooted among the mainland
leadership. "It's very difficult for them to change," said the expert
in China affairs.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chang pointed out that mainland China now needs a
peaceful environment in order to carry out economic reforms, while
the Taipei authorities are at the same time devoted to easing the
tense cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Although enormous differences still exist between the two sides,
efforts have been made on both sides to obtain a better mutual
understanding, Chang said.</P>
      <P>In reply to a question on whether cross-strait relations will
deteriorate after Beijing shows its attempt to undermine Taiwan's
position in the international community during President Jiang
Zemin's November visit to Japan, Tseng answered that as far as Japan
is concerned, the Taiwan sovereignty problem is clearly set out in
the 1945 Potsdam Declaration, under which Taiwan was returned by the
defeated Japan to the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Echoing Tseng's words, Chang said that public opinion polls in
Taiwan show that despite Beijing's strong pressure, most Taiwan
people still hold to the idea that the ROC on Taiwan should not stop
trying to carve out its international space.</P>
      <P>Beijing's pressure can only raise the Taiwan people's
unwillingness to reunify with mainland China, the expert said.</P>
      <P>Following the press conference, the three-member delegation held
talks with representatives from the Chinese society in Japan and the
Japanese academic sector.</P>
      <P>The delegation arrived in Tokyo on Monday, and visited several
Japanese congressmen. The delegation flew back to Taiwan on Friday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT ONLY CHANCE FOR NEGOTIATIONS WITH BEIJING: ADVISOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Oct. 29 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee and Neil Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui is the only
leader in Taiwan who can provide Beijing with the chance of
negotiations in the foreseeable future, a senior presidential advisor
said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Tien Hung-mao said at a seminar at Stanford University that this
is because of all Taiwan's senior officials, Lee enjoys the greatest
amount of popular support.</P>
      <P>The recent visit to mainland China by Koo Chen-fu, chairman of
the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), has seen the opening of an
"indirect channel of communication" between the leaders of the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait, said Tien, who is also president of the
Taipei-based National Policy Research Institute.</P>
      <P>He said that Koo, who is also a senior presidential adviser, was
acting as a de facto envoy of the president in the mainland,
otherwise he would not have been able to talk with mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin on national sovereignty and other political
issues.</P>
      <P>Dubbed an "ice-melting" trip, Koo visited Shanghai and Beijing
from Oct. 14-19 to meet with his mainland counterpart, Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) Chairman Wang Daohan,
Jiang, and Vice Premier Qian Qichen.</P>
      <P>Tien said that Lee in turn will receive Wang when he comes to
Taiwan in the near future.</P>
      <P>Wang, known as a mentor of Jiang, has accepted an invitation from
Koo to visit Taiwan at "an appropriate time."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the victory of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) in the last county magistrate and city
mayoral elections has prompted both Washington and Beijing to
consider the possibility of the DPP coming into power in the future,
and other relevant issues.</P>
      <P>This is one of the reasons Beijing allowed Koo's visit to take
place, Tien said.</P>
      <P>With regard to rumors that Beijing "has no expectations of Lee"
as far as cross-strait ties are concerned, Koo's successful mainland
trip can be indirectly interpreted as showing that Beijing has
somehow changed its past strategy (of no contact with Lee), Tien
said.</P>
      <P>Given Lee's high reputation both domestically and intentionally,
and the great support he has received from even the pro-independence
camp, the president is currently the only Taiwan leader who can
afford to provide Beijing with a chance of negotiations to improve
ties, Tien said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN TO VISIT 115 CANDIDATES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui, who is concurrently
chairman of the ruling Kuomintang, on Friday began a series of visits
to all 115 candidates being fielded by the party to run in the
yearend legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsiao-yen, KMT secretary-general, noted that Lee will spend
more than one month on an islandwide trip to provide moral support
for all the KMT candidates in their bids for the Legislative Yuan
seats.</P>
      <P>Lee started his trip by going to the election campaign
headquarters of four KMT candidates in northern Taipei City in order
to boost morale.</P>
      <P>Chang pointed out that few leaders of other countries would
personally visit all their candidates, and said the move has shown
that the KMT chairman is deeply concerned about this year's
elections.</P>
      <P>In addition to Lee's islandwide morale-boosting tour, The KMT
Department of Cultural Affairs is planning to hold a total of six
huge evening parties in Taiwan's major cities. The first will be held
at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Taipei on Dec. 31.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the ruling party, which has never held any such
pre-election parties in the past, is hoping to create a spirited
atmosphere at the parties, in order to win more votes from women and
young people, who are traditionally disinclined to vote for the
ruling party.</P>
      <P>The KMT secretary-general has also instructed KMT committees in
various counties and townships to hold similar activities prior to or
after the KMT anniversary, which falls on Nov. 24.</P>
      <P>Chang stressed that many people have recognized that if the
ruling party fails to win a majority in the year-end legislative
elections, the situation in the Legislative Yuan will become de
stabilized, which will lead to difficulties in the passing of
important bills.</P>

that the US Federal Communications Commission recognizes Taiwan's
EMC certification for computers, audio-visual, medical and
telecommunications equipment and other related facilities.</P>
      <P>The EMC accord was initialed during the third annual meeting
under the ROC-US Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA)
which opened in Washington, D.C. earlier this week.</P>
      <P>The four-day meeting was jointly chaired by Chen Ruey-long,
director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade, and US Assistant
Trade Representative Robert Cassidy.</P>
      <P>Wu Hui-mei, deputy director-general of the Bureau of Commodity
Inspection and Quarantine, said billions worth of Taiwan-made
information-technology products exported to the United States
annually will no longer be subject to US EMC tests after the accord
takes effect.</P>
      <P>The EMC accord will be put into force after some legal
formalities are completed.</P>
      <P>Wu said the EMC pact is a key achievement of the current TIFA
meeting.</P>
      <P>The two sides also reached a consensus on the signing of an
agreement on mutual recognition of telecommunications equipment
certification under the framework of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum. Both Taiwan and the United States are APEC
members.</P>
      <P>Negotiators from both sides, however, failed to come to terms on
issues related to Taiwan's intellectual property rights (IPR)
protection measures and systems. Consequently, the US Trade
Representative office has decided to retain Taiwan on its Special
301 "watch list" to pressure the island to take further steps to
improve IPR protection.</P>
      <P>During the working-level TIFA meeting, US negotiators also
expressed concern about Taiwan's pharmaceutical and medical equipment
pricing formula under its national health insurance program, the
timetable for telecommunications services deregulation and the
liberalization of its services market. Continued discussion on
these issues is needed to mend bilateral differences, ROC delegates
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MUST TAKE PART IN INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY: ROC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  29  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC deputy secretary general to
President Lee Teng-hui, on Thursday stressed that the ROC must be
allowed to take part in the international community.</P>
      <P>Su Chi said that the diplomatic blockade by mainland China serves
only to antagonize the people of the island.</P>
      <P>Su, who was in the US capital to debrief the United States on the
recently concluded high-level meeting between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait, made the remarks at a seminar at the American
Enterprise Institute (AEI).</P>
      <P>He said that Beijing must realize the divided state of China, and
that its allegation that Taiwan is trying to split the nation is
completely wrong. He questioned Beijing's stance, pointing out that
since the two sides are not even married, one side cannot be
described as trying to divorce the other.</P>
      <P>He also said that Beijing's lobbing of missiles and verbal
intimidation is no way to create an environment conducive to good
relations.</P>
      <P>He said that both sides of the Taiwan Strait should try to
understand each other, so that both can unite willingly. For this
reason, he said, bilateral relations should move at a gradual but
steady pace.</P>
      <P>Su said that 80 percent of the people of Taiwan have reached a
consensus that the status quo should be maintained, Taiwan
independence should not be declared, and unification with the
mainland should not be rushed into.</P>
      <P>At least 70 percent of the public also support Taiwan's
participation in international affairs, even if the promotion of
pragmatic diplomacy affects cross-strait relations, Su said.</P>
      <P>Su said that the ROC is the 13th or 14th-largest trading nation
in the world, and many other indicators show that the ROC is one of
the top 20 nations in terms of national strength in the world. It is
therefore entitled to play a more active role in the international
community and to participate in international organizations, he
added.</P>
      <P>However, he stressed that this has nothing to do with Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>On the significance of the high-level cross-strait meeting, Su
said that Taiwan believes that the meeting between Koo Chen-fu,
chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation, and his mainland
counterpart Wang Daohan of the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait, was a success.</P>
      <P>The Koo-Wang meeting has improved the atmosphere on both sides of
the Taiwan Strait, but it has also exposed big differences, although
both sides also agreed to increase exchanges and dialogue, which Su
said is a beneficial and constructive development.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is the second-most stable country
among 12 Asian states, behind only Singapore and tied with Japan,
according to a survey by a Hong Kong-based consultancy.</P>
      <P>The survey conducted by the Political and Economic Risk

Taiwan has been able to shield itself from the brunt of the Asian
crisis, and public demonstrations arising from social and political
issues have declined considerably on the island.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was given a score of two on a scale from zero to 10, with
zero the highest score. Last year, the island was ranked fourth, with
a score of 3.59.</P>
      <P>Although the Asian crisis has plunged many countries in the
region into social turmoil, leading to some major reshuffling of the
rankings, Singapore remains top with a score of 1.5. Japan ties with
Taiwan with a score of two.</P>
      <P>They are followed by Hong Kong, at 3.5; the Philippines, at four;
Vietnam, at 4.5; mainland China, at 5.5; India and Thailand tie at
six; South Korea, at seven; Malaysia, at 7.5; and Indonesia, at nine.</P>

(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A New Party legislator accused of being
recruited by Beijing in Taiwan's year-end elections said on Friday
all evidence regarding such activity should be made public instead of
being used as a smear tactic.</P>
      <P>New Party Legislator Yok Mu-ming urged national security
organizations to investigate whether there is capital from mainland
China intervening in the Dec. 5 elections. If this is the case, then
the evidence should be made public before the elections for
legislators, Taipei and Kaohsiung mayors and councils are held.</P>
      <P>He asked that investigators take a special look at those who have
had close contact with China-owned enterprises.</P>
      <P>Yok went on to accuse Liu Tai-ying, chairman of the KMT's
Business Management Committee, of involvement in bribing mainland
China's officials during his contact with China-owned enterprises.</P>
      <P>There are close relations between the KMT's Liu and mainland
Chinese-owned enterprises such as the China International Trust &amp;
Investment Corporation Group, and the China Venturetect Investment
Corporation, Yok claimed.</P>
      <P>Tsai Pi-huang, director-general of the Sun Yat-sen Institute on
Policy Research and Development under the KMT, said on Thursday that
the National Security Bureau and investigation organizations have
confirmed charges made by Taipei City Councilor Lin Ruey-tu. Lin had
earlier said mainland-owned enterprises are trying to intervene in
the island's year-end elections.</P>
      <P>Those who have accepted mainland funds are not restricted to
candidates of the party Lin cited, Tsai added.</P>
      <P>Responding to Tsai's accusations, Yok demanded that Tsai clarify
which party he believes is guilty of accepting mainland money.</P>
      <P>Seeing as security and intelligence organizations have found
evidence of intervention efforts by mainland-owned enterprises in the
year-end elections, then why have they not taken any actions in the
matter instead of letting the city councilor and KMT official make
all the allegations, Yok questioned.</P>
      <P>He demanded the relevant government bodies during the legislature
session make efforts to collect all the evidence and publish it
before the elections take place.</P>
      <P>Yok went a step further and requested that election offices under
the Interior Ministry cancel the eligibility of candidates found
guilty of accepting mainland funds.</P>
      <P>As for Taipei City Councilor Lin's allegation that Yok is an
"operative" of Beijing, Yok said the mainland-issued ID Lin offered
as evidence should be examined by the Ministry of Justice for
authenticity. Yok said he would take appropriate action himself after
the investigation.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Councilor Lin Ruey-tu, an independent, on Wednesday
accused New Party lawmaker Yok Mu-ming of having been recruited by
Beijing with the aim of toppling Taiwan's economy. To back up his
claim, Lin furnished a faxed document suggesting that Yok is in
Beijing's employ and that the mainland government has a list of
specific Taiwan companies whose operations it hopes to destabilize.</P>

(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The European Commission will bring forward
proposals for restricting the use of some antibiotics in animal feed
amid fears that human health is being endangered, the World Trade
Organization (WTO) reported on Friday.</P>
      <P>Franz Fischler, the farm commissioner, said the European
Commission did not expect to have the final results of tests on beef
hormones by May, a deadline imposed by the WTO on the EU to comply
with a ruling that a ban on beef hormones was unjustified.</P>
      <P>His statement will heighten speculation that the EU will push for
a continuation of the 10-year hormone ban, claiming support from the
scientific tests, the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>The EU has been given until May 13 to implement a ruling that a
10-year ban on beef hormones is inconsistent with its WTO
obligations. The US, which took the case to the WTO, argues this
means the ban must be implemented.</P>
      <P>However, the commission has said lifting the ban is not automatic
and its action in May will depend on the scientific studies.</P>
      <P>The commission announced its plan for antibiotic restrictions
after calls by Denmark, Sweden and Finland for a ban on the use of
all antibiotic growth promoters in animal feed.</P>
      <P>Environmentalists and a growing number of scientists believe that
the use of antibiotics in animal feed harms human health because when
passed through the food chain, they weaken resistance to antibiotics
used in medicines.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's China Petrochemical Development
Corp. (CPDC) on Friday accused Japan's Marubeni Petroleum Co. of
breaching a contract, saying it will consider taking legal action
against the Japanese firm.</P>
      <P>CPDC Chairman Kuan Yung-shih said his company signed a contract
in September to buy 32,000 metric tons of liquefied petroleum gas
(LPG) from Marubeni Petroleum Co.</P>
      <P>The LPG was to be delivered to Huahsing Petroleum Chemical Co., a
CPDC subsidiary in Fujian province, between Oct. 27 and Nov. 4.</P>
      <P>Kuan said without his company's consent, the Japanese firm resold
the LPG allocated for Huahsing Petroleum Chemical Co. to a third
buyer, apparently for higher profits.</P>
      <P>Kuan was originally scheduled to preside over a ceremony marking
the delivery of the Marubeni LPG at the Fujian subsidiary company on
Nov. 1.</P>
      <P>Owing to the breach of contract on Marubeni's part, Kuan said the
Fujian company will be unable to deliver related products to its
clients on time, seriously damaging his company's credibility.</P>
      <P>Kuan visited the Taipei office of the quasi-official Japan
Interchange Association on Friday to lodge a protest and seek the
institution's help in solving the problem.</P>
      <P>However, the deputy director of the association, Takashi Inoue,
said as a quasi-official institution, his association was not in a
position to interfere in business operations.</P>
      <P>Kuan said his company will discuss the case with attorneys and

    <HEADLINE>MOFA: NO FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT ON CHANGE OF TIES FROM TONGA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has
not received a confirmation over the reports that the Kingdom of
Tonga is ready to sever its diplomatic ties with the Republic of
China, the ministry said on Friday.</P>
      <P>If Tonga does issue a formal statement on its intention to switch
diplomatic ties from Taipei to Beijing, MOFA will issue a quick,
effective and appropriate response, a ministry official said.</P>
      <P>According to an AFP report from Auckland, New Zealand earlier on
Friday, Tonga is planning to make a switch in diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>"The move, made by the new Foreign Minister, Prince 'Ulukalala
Lavaka Ata, ends a long running dream of his father, King Taufa'ahau
Tupou IV, to be the only state to achieve diplomatic ties with both
China and Taiwan," the report said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, MOFA spokesman Roy Wu said the ministry
has instructed the ROC embassy in Tonga to confirm the report, but
the Tonga government has not made any formal announcement on the
matter.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Jason Hu is reportedly on his way to
an unnamed country which maintains diplomatic relations with Beijing.
Wu denied that Hu's trip has any direct relationship with the Tonga
issue.</P>
      <P>Replying to questions why the ROC would respond only after
Beijing or Tonga make their formal announcements, Wu said the ROC
values each of its allies and will not easily abandon them until the
last minute. However, he added, Beijing has never ceased in its
pressure to isolate the ROC in the international arena.</P>
      <P>The MOFA official also urged Beijing to clarify three incidents
concerning its diplomatic isolation strategy against the ROC if it
claims to have goodwill and sincerity in cross-strait negotiations
and dialogue. He added that now is the time for negotiation, not
confrontation.</P>
      <P>On Oct. 17, Vice Foreign Minister David Lee asked mainland
authorities to clarify a report that said immediately prior to Koo
Chen-Fu's departure for the mainland they had used every possible
means to tempt one of the ROC's allies to forge official ties with
Beijing within two weeks of Koo's return to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Despite any setbacks, the ROC will continue to try to make
friends in the international community, try to turn an enemy into a
friend, and will offer its own experiences to developing countries
for reference, Wu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC REPRESENTATIVE TO US SPEAKS ON TAIPEI-BEIJING-WASHINGTON TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Oct.  29  (CNA)
(By J. J. Huang  and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's "one China, two systems"
formula for Hong Kong does not suit Taiwan, and the people of Taiwan
will not accept such a scheme, Stephen Chen, the ROC's representative
to the United States, said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China is willing to consider unification with
mainland China on a gradual basis under the framework of freedom,
democracy and prosperity, Chen said in a speech at a seminar
sponsored by the Boston-based Foreign Policy Institute. More than
100 people attended the event.</P>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait currently are two independent
political entities under separate rule, and wide differences remain
in each other's political systems and the way of life, Chen said.
However, he added that the existence of differences is not tantamount
to separatism or independence.</P>
      <P>In compliance with the National Unification Guidelines, Taiwan is
willing to share its democratization experience with the mainland by
boosting bilateral cultural and economic exchanges as a means of
pursuing China's eventual unification.</P>
      <P>The ROC de-facto ambassador said Taiwan is not opposed to the US
government's engagement with mainland China as long as it is helpful
to regional stability and world peace. But the US government should
also take Taiwan's interests and position into account in the
process, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that Washington should maintain a parallel
relationship with Taipei while seeking to improve its ties with
Beijing. He said he believes Taiwan can play a positive role in US
engagement with mainland China, as bilateral Taiwan-mainland
exchanges are close.</P>
      <P>The people of Taiwan have mailed more than 100 million letters
over the past decade and paid more than 12 million visits to the
mainland since the ROC government lifted a ban on travel to mainland
China in 1987, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>But he lamented mainland China's reluctance to denounce the use
of force against Taiwan. The US' decision to continue selling
defensive arms to the island in accordance with the Taiwan Relations
Act is extremely important to Taiwan's security under such
circumstances, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen urged the international community to deal the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait on an equal footing, which he said will help bring
about China's unification in the long run and boost world peace.</P>

President Wang Chung-yu meeting with European steel industry
representatives, while an economic official from Taiwan's

      <P>The meeting stemmed from complaints filed by some European
steelmakers against alleged dumping by some Asian steelmakers,
including some from Taiwan. Wang tried to explain how Taiwan sets its
steel prices which he said are not unreasonably low, and do not

    <HEADLINE>US OFFICIAL: RELATIONS WITH BEIJING WON'T HURT TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  30  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A White House official stressed on
Friday that the United States strongly supports cross-Taiwan Strait
dialogue, and that better relations between the United States and
Beijing will not come at Taiwan's expense.</P>
      <P>In an address at the National Press Club in Washington, National
Security Adviser Samuel Berger said: "Obviously we strongly support a
cross-strait dialogue, and there have been some steps in recent
months ... that have been constructive."</P>
      <P>But he went on: "This is a matter, obviously, for the people in
China and Taiwan to resolve themselves in a peaceful fashion. So we
have encouraged all involved to be forthcoming and constructive about
that dialogue."</P>
      <P>The policy of engagement that the Clinton administration has
pursued over the past three years has improved US relations with
mainland China, the national security adviser said, adding: "There
are still many areas where we have serious differences with the
Chinese, but we confront those differences directly with them, face
to face."</P>
      <P>However, Berger stressed: "In my judgment, better relations
between the United States and Beijing do not come at the expense of
our relationship with the people of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Over the past 20 years the United States has had generally
improving relations with China, and its relationship with Taiwan has
also flourished. This has been good for stability in the region and
it has been good for both Taiwan and China, "so I think these things
do not have to come at the expense of one another," he said.</P>
      <P>Berger emphasized that "the cornerstone of our Asia policy
remains our longstanding alliance with Japan. A healthy Japan is
indispensable for the stability and prosperity of Asia and, indeed,
the entire world."</P>
      <P>But he said the role mainland China plays "will have a profound
impact on the new century, for better or for worse. The president
(Bill Clinton)'s trip to China in June advanced important American
interests, from seeking peace in Korea to reducing weapons
proliferation, to promoting cleaner technologies for our
environment."</P>
      <P>Berger added that Clinton has not hesitated to speak frankly in
mainland China, to say clearly that when it comes to human rights,
mainland China remains on the wrong side of history.</P>
      <P>Although the US strategy of engagement has brought results,
Berger admitted that there is still far to go. Mainland China
continues to jail dissidents, even as it has signed the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. "But China is becoming more
open, not just to commerce but to ideas, and our engagement is
helping to empower the Chinese people as they seek more freedom," he
said.</P>
      <P>A strategy of confrontation, by contrast, would likely push
mainland China toward isolation, "undermining our hopes for greater
democracy and stability in Asia," added Berger.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC ANNOUNCES SEVERANCE OF DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH TONGA (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 31 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China announced on Saturday
that it has decided to sever its diplomatic relations with the
Kingdom of Tonga, effective Nov. 2, 1998.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) made the announcement at a
news conference hosted by ministry spokesman Roy Wu.</P>
      <P>Wu said the ROC has also decided to terminate all agreements and
cooperation with the South Pacific island nation and to recall its
ambassador.</P>
      <P>Wu read a prepared MOFA press statement which condemned Beijing
for its incessant efforts to obstruct the ROC's diplomatic relations
by enticing and menacing Taiwan's allies. Such moves indicate that
the mainland Chinese authorities lack goodwill or sincerity in
improving relations across the Taiwan Strait, the statement said.</P>
      <P>MOFA issued the statement after the Tonga foreign minister
formally announced at 8 a.m. on Saturday (Taipei time) that his
country will switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing
from Monday.</P>
      <P>Tonga will be the fourth ROC ally to switch diplomatic allegiance
so far this year, following the lead of South Africa, the Central
African Republic, and Guinea-Bissau. With the loss of Tonga, the ROC
now has just 26 diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>The MOFA statement said Tonga, in a breach of good faith,
succumbed to the enticement of the Beijing regime and decided to
develop full relations since King Taufa'Ahau Tupou IV made a visit to
the Chinese mainland in July 1997.</P>
      <P>The ROC government has made every effort, including inviting the
King of Tonga to Taiwan in both July 1997 and July 1998, and inviting
Princess Salote Mafile'o Pilolevu Tuita in October 1998, to try to
dissuade them from having further contact with the Chinese communist
authorities. However, despite its best efforts, the government failed
to change the course of events, the statement said.</P>
      <P>"Based on its national sovereignty," the statement said, "the ROC
government holds that the intention and action of the Tongan
government has seriously damaged its national interests. To express
its firm position, the ROC government must hereby undertake the
above-mentioned resolute measures."</P>
      <P>The statement went on to say that in recent years the ROC
authorities have appealed more than a hundred times to the Beijing
authorities to resume normal interaction between the two
quasi-official intermediary bodies -- Taipei's Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) and Beijing's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>"In fact, before SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu's recent visit to the
Chinese mainland, the ROC canceled a military exercise to show its
goodwill and to create a `win-win' situation for both sides," the
statement said, adding: "Unfortunately, in response, the Chinese
communist authorities continued to demonstrate two-faced tactics."</P>
      <P>The statement pointed out that communist China has never ceased
its efforts to restrict the ROC's international space. On the one
hand, it plays to the international community by ostensibly seeking
peace talks with Taiwan, while on the other it obstructs the ROC's
diplomatic relations by enticing and menacing ROC allies.</P>
      <P>"The Kingdom of Tonga is a case in point," the statement said,
adding that ARATS Vice Chairman Tang Shubei denied on Oct. 15 that
Beijing intended to dislodge all ROC allies by the year 2000, yet
before Koo's departure for a mainland visit on Oct. 14, the Chinese
communist authorities had been aggressively planning to establish
diplomatic relations with Tonga within a week of Koo's visit.</P>
      <P>"This indicates that the Chinese communist authorities have no
goodwill or sincerity in improving their relations with us," the
statement said.</P>
      <P>Faced with this situation, the statement said, the ROC government
and people will continue to expand their activities in the
international sphere with even greater resolve and pragmatism, to the
extent necessary for their continued existence and development.</P>
      <P>The ROC established diplomatic ties with Tonga in April 1972, and
set up an embassy with a charge d'affaires in that country's capital
of Nukualofa in June 1975. There has been a resident ROC ambassador
in Tonga since 1977.</P>
      <P>Over the past years, the ROC has extended many kinds of
assistance to Tonga, including the services of an agricultural
technical mission. (By Sofia Wu)

      <P>Air Canada will be cutting at least 1,000
jobs before the end of the year, its chief executive officer, Lamar

      <P>Durrett said the company is looking for ways to cut costs because

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian government is determined
to go ahead with plans to allow uranium mining near the Kakadu
National Park in Northern Territory and to disregard the findings of
an on-the-spot inspection by a UN delegation.</P>
      <P>Environment Minister Richard Hill on Friday reaffirmed the
government's determination to allow the uranium mining even if the UN
delegation declares the Kakadu National Park area in danger due to
the mining at Jabiluka, about 20 km from the park.</P>
      <P>The fears of endangering Kakadu Park were raised at the UN by
Aboriginal traditional owners, scientists, heritage experts and
conservationists, but the government on Friday remained unmoved by
their concerns.</P>
      <P>"We have said that we believe the (UN) mission is unnecessary. We
take our world heritage responsibilities seriously. In fact I know of
no other country in the world which does as much as we do to meet the

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA URGES INDONESIA TO REDUCE TROOPS IN E. TIMOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  31  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer has urged Indonesia to reduce its troops in East Timor or face
problems in its peace negotiations after leaked documents showed an
increase in troop numbers in the former Portuguese colony.</P>
      <P>Downer told Australian reporters that he has argued for more than
two years that a reduction in Indonesian troop numbers is an
important component in any confidence-building process in East Timor.</P>
      <P>Speculation mounted in Canberra on Friday that a new push to
destabilize Indonesian President B.J. Habibie could be behind the
leak in Jakarta of confidential Indonesian military documents
revealing details of troop numbers in East Timor.</P>
      <P>Australian officials said they were not surprised by disclosures
in the documents that the troop numbers were much higher than claimed
by Indonesia's most senior officials. None of them doubted the
authenticity of the documents.</P>
      <P>However, Indonesia's Department of Foreign Affairs said officials
were checking the authenticity of the documents which showed that
17,834 troops were stationed in East Timor as of August, an increase
in numbers despite highly publicized troop withdrawals the previous
month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL LANDMARKS THAT ARE BOOKSTORES AND SO MUCH MORE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  31  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>When Robert C.Y. Wu started the first Eslite bookstore back in
1989, selling books limited to mainly the arts and humanities, he was
thinking only of sharing his interests and "good things" with
friends.</P>
      <P>After all, Wu, already a self-made millionaire through his highly
successful business of selling catering equipment and supplies to
top-notch hotels, restaurants, hospitals, and other large
institutions, was dabbling in a completely unfamiliar field.</P>
      <P>But Wu has seen his bookstores, unconventional by Taiwan
standards, grow and flourish, and is expecting a sales turnover this
year of NT$1.6 billion (US$49.23 million), the first time in a decade
that his brainchild will have broken even after years in the red.</P>
      <P>The 48-year-old entrepreneur, sitting by a large sparkling window
in his spacious, elegant office, says that he is planning to list
Eslite on the local stock market in between three and five years.</P>
      <P>Despite the applause and plaudits he has received from all sides
over the years, Wu's feelings are mixed. On the one hand, he says, he
is happy, but on the other, he is worried that Taiwan still lacks a
cultural establishment to match its economic clout.</P>
      <P>Tall, urbane, and always impeccably dressed, Wu peers gently
through his spectacles and says modestly: "I was only lucky enough to
be able to put my ideals into practice, and still win some
accolades."</P>
      <P>From the outset, no one expected Eslite to make money, and indeed
it did lose money, even as it build its enviable reputation. However,
Wu is tenacious -- a trait he says he inherited from his father --
and admits that he was also a little curious himself as to how long
his project would last.</P>
      <P>When the first Eslite opened its doors on March 20, 1989 on the
posh Jenai Circle in the heart of downtown Taipei, it created an
instant phenomenon and became a new landmark in Taipei that people
wanted to introduce to all their friends.</P>
      <P>The first store was devoted mainly to the selling of imported
books on fine arts, design and architecture, becoming the first store
in Taiwan to excel in both quality and quantity in the field of
humanities and the arts, although it was also a gallery, and sold
stationery, imported porcelain and ceramics, furniture, and antiques.</P>
      <P>The shop, with its cozy atmosphere but spatial design, was a
world away from the cramped and musty confines of traditional local
bookstores, and soon became a hangout for the local artistic set.</P>
      <P>Although it seemed to cater only to a small coterie of clientele,
the shop lured many browsers who just wanted to admire the unique
bookstore that was an oasis of peace and refinement in the gray
concrete drabness of Taiwan's largest city.</P>
      <P>Since then, the Eslite name and the distinctive "three squares"
logo have become synonymous with discreet style and refined taste.</P>
      <P>Wu, however, insists that appearances are unimportant, and says
"the most exhilarating part of the store will invariably be its
patrons. It is not the store that is tasteful, it is our patrons who
are naturally polite and gentle when they step inside, and that is
what graces all our shops."</P>
      <P>In a way, Eslite seeks not only to cater to its patrons, it wants
to pamper them, in the hope that the store will become a "third"
place after the office and the home where the public can enjoy
spending time.</P>
      <P>Wu stresses that a bookstore should not be just a place for the
buying and selling of books. "It should impart a feeling of pleasant
space and good people around you."</P>
      <P>He points out that many of those who step into an Eslite
bookstore have no intention of buying a book, but are seeking rather
to soak up some of the tranquil atmosphere, a welcome panacea against
the stresses of urban life.</P>
      <P>The first priority of a bookstore is of course a rich collection
of books, he says. Each book sold by Eslite is still carefully
selected, and the titles are diversified to meet the needs of a
pluralistic society. The flagship Eslite store on tony Tunhua South
Road boasts 65,000 titles, and over 1,000 magazines, the largest
collection of magazines in Taipei.

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL LANDMARKS THAT ARE BOOKSTORES AND SO MUCH MORE (II)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  31  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Eslite is committed to making every one who enters the shop feel
good. For this reason, Wu believes that a pleasant space is
imperative. Convinced that local designers are highly talented, and
that Eslite should be a stage where they can display their talents
and creativity, he has commissioned many, including Chen Juei-hsien,
Lin Zhou-min and Yao Jen-Hsi, to undertake the interior design of the
shops.</P>
      <P>Although modern and sophisticated spatial design is one of the
oft-cited features of Eslite, Wu is also careful that each branch has
its own individual style, with its own distinctive atmosphere.</P>
      <P>For example, he says, the Hsimenting branch with its hip, avant
garde style, differs from the Tunhua main branch, which is elegant
and graceful, and different again from the National Taiwan University
branch, which is simple, yet no less delightful.</P>
      <P>The individuality doesn't stop with the design, however. "Each
Eslite also has a different title mix, a different scale, and caters
to a different set of readers," says Wu.</P>
      <P>For example, there is a manga section targeted at teenagers in
the Hsimenting branch, a hangout for the young and trendy, while the
title mix in the suburban Tienmu branch and the NTU branch have an
overlap of no more than 50 percent, reflecting the different
clientele in each shop -- the former targets the local community
where there is a high percentage of expatriates, while the latter is
patronized mainly by students from the nearby university.</P>
      <P>Wu is vehemently opposed to any attempt to "MacDonaldize" the
operation of his bookstores, with each identically designed outlet
selling the same uniform products. "We are different and
unconventional," he stresses.</P>
      <P>Even if it is simply a poster to promote an Eslite activity, it
has to be designed in a creative, humorous, off-beat, and unorthodox
way, he says.</P>
      <P>Wu goes to great length to explain that all the efforts are to
ingratiate its readers so that they will enjoy their visits.
Consideration of the comfort and convenience of the patrons is
evident in each Eslite, perhaps most notably in the provision of
sloping ramps built between each floor to help the movement of the
disabled, mini bookshelves in the children's sections, and connecting
pathways between the children and adult sections to allow parents to
watch over their children while they browse.</P>
      <P>Each Eslite is ideally divided into five sections, according to
Wu -- books, stationery, a cafe, a gallery, and the "Eslite Vision"
(activity center). While this format is shared, any other
similarities end there.</P>
      <P>"Eslite has never intended to promote a `metropolis culture,'" Wu
says. Rather, each branch identifies closely with local color and
culture, and hopes to contribute to local cultural development.</P>
      <P>Wu harbors a fervent love for his country, and does not want his
shops to simply win the applause of the local people, but is
determined to ensure that each Eslite makes a positive contribution
to local cultural development.</P>
      <P>He cites as an example the Eslite branch in the northern Taiwan
city of Hsinchu, which has a section dedicated to information on
local features, personalities, and locally related publications,
prominently displayed at the entrance of the store.</P>
      <P>He stresses the importance of the galleries and the Eslite Vision
centers, noting that an estimated 450 activities will take place in
the Tunhua South Road branch alone this year, including lectures,
meetings, art exhibitions, performances, wine tastings, and related
cultural activities.</P>
      <P>Elaborating on his ideas of what Eslite should be, Wu says that
he also wants the shop to play an active and positive role in the
community.</P>
      <P>He believes that Eslite should provide a place that enables
interaction between an audience and performers. A place where the
people of a community can participate and get a chance to meet each
other, as well as have access to local literary and artistic
information -- all these, he believes, are services that patrons now
expect and deserve from an Eslite store.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the most amazing thing about Eslite is that the bookstore
was born in Taiwan -- it is a completely indigenous product. Although
the store sells many books imported from the United States and Europe
with the aim of nurturing a global vision for local readers, it does
not cooperate or engage in any technology exchanges with any foreign
bookstores.</P>
      <P>Wu has often been asked how he accomplished this feat. "It may
have started from a midlife crisis," he replies with tongue in cheek.

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  31  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wu graduated from the Department of Mechanic Engineering at the
Taipei Institute of Technology, and joined a food-service equipment
and supply company, the forerunner of Faithful Standard Group, at the
age of 23.</P>
      <P>A diligent man, he worked his way up from salesman to partner
until finally taking over the company, amassing fame and fortune. He
also witnessed Taiwan's rapid economic growth during the interim.</P>
      <P>Although Faithful Standard Group was successful, and to this day
still commands about an 80 percent share of the large-scale catering
equipment market, Wu said he began to seriously question his life by
the age of 35.</P>
      <P>He said to himself: "Life is now pretty much routine. Do I want
to continue with this kind of life for the rest of my life, day after
day?"</P>
      <P>Although he is considered aggressive, dynamic and optimistic by
his peers, he says this kind of reflection used to leave him with a
feeling of total emptiness and uncertainly.</P>
      <P>He gradually realized that years of sustained focus and a
high-stress lifestyle -- working 12-14 hour days to pursue the
growing success of the company -- had drained him mentally and had
alienated him from cultural and artistic activities.</P>
      <P>"For years, I had focused on marketing and corporate management,
and was a stranger to the arts," Wu says. This realization led him to
get in touch with more cultural and artistic activities, beginning
with music and architecture, then moving to painting and sculpture.</P>
      <P>Although he did not understand what was before him, Wu let his
intuition be his guide. Little by little, he not only felt
invigorated, he also realized that a brand new world was opening up
to him.</P>
      <P>It was at this point that Wu made the decision to choose
something he believed would give him a more meaningful life, even
though it would not make him rich.</P>
      <P>The opening of Eslite was the beginning of a dream. Wu realized
clearly that the bookshop would not be a business that he could
depend on for a livelihood, yet he devoted time and money on it "with
all my heart."</P>
      <P>"I did it willingly," Wu says, adding: "I couldn't be tight with
money if I wanted Eslite to be a place and space that would help
satisfy the needs and soothe the spirits of hundreds of thousands of
people on Taiwan."</P>
      <P>That is why he was, and is, meticulous in choosing only the best
quality, and spending profusely to create a comfortable setting. Such
a concept does not come cheaply, and defies the conventional wisdom
in Taiwan at the time that every business should be
completely profit-oriented.</P>
      <P>By the end of this year, Eslite branches around the island will
have increased to more than 20. Pointing to a demographic map of
Taiwan showing the population and size of each county and town, Wu
says solemnly: "I envision a total of 129 Eslites in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>This expansion may come from his dream of influencing more people
or, perhaps more importantly, influencing more influential people on
the island with the belief that a fertile culture will nurture all
other national development, whether it be political, technological,
or economic.</P>
      <P>He is optimistic that the reading population will grow rather
than decline, pointing out that today, there are more young people on
the island born after 1945 in peacetime. They have received higher
levels of education than their predecessors, which, coupled with the
island's rapid economic growth and a strong desire to learn and excel
in the world, means that reading and lifelong learning will be a
future trend.</P>
      <P>He estimates that next year, there will be 20 million visits to
Eslite bookstores, and that there will be five million transactions
on books.</P>
      <P>Looking back at the last 10 years in the trade, Wu says modestly:
"There is still ample room for Eslite to improve." However, he is
also quick to point out, with some pride, that the management of the
company has been greatly improved.</P>
      <P>Despite Wu's attachment to his land, and his decision to keep
Taiwan as his main priority, Eslite is nevertheless thinking of
making inroads into Hong Kong.

LOCAL LANDMARKS THAT ARE BOOKSTORES AND SO MUCH MORE (IV)</P>
      <P>Wu says he wants to open Eslite branches in Hong Kong, not
because Eslite has won praise from Chinese in Hong Kong, Singapore,
and mainland China, but because Hong Kong is an international
metropolis, and will give Eslite a unique chance to compete with its
newly gained confidence in bookstore management.</P>
      <P>Wu's desire to obtain a foothold in Hong Kong, however, is also
part of a bigger picture, in that he is also eyeing the mainland
market, and hoping the day will come when the ban on exchanges of
publications between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will finally
be lifted.</P>
      <P>"Hopefully, I can open an Eslite in Hong Kong by the end of next
year," he says.</P>
      <P>After all, he points out, Eslite will have to brace for an
impending onslaught in Taiwan by large-scale international book
chains from companies such as France's FNAC and Japan's Kinokuniya,
and has yet to prove whether it can excel in the face of such stiff
competition.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China will step up efforts
to cement relations with its three South Pacific allies following the
Kingdom of Tonga's decision to switch diplomatic recognition from
Taipei to Beijing from Nov. 2, diplomatic officials said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The officials said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
attaches great importance to the possibility of a domino effect
caused by the Tongan move on the ROC's three remaining South Pacific
allies -- the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Nauru.</P>
      <P>"We'll pay close heed to the developing situation, but we are
confident that our relations with our three South Pacific allies will
remain firm and cordial," said George Jin-gou Chang, director of the
MOFA's East Asian and Pacific Affairs Department.</P>
      <P>Chang said senior Tuvalu, Nauru, and Solomon Islands officials
have often assured their ROC counterparts that they will uphold their
commitments to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"They have told us that they believe only the ROC can faithfully
assist them in their national development," Chang said.</P>
      <P>He divulged that several Solomon Islands cabinet ministers will
lead large delegations to Taiwan in December when that country's
parliament will be in recess.</P>
      <P>As for relations with Nauru, Chang said the ROC maintains close
cooperation with that country in the agriculture and fishery fields.
During the annual meeting of the South Pacific Forum held earlier
this year, ROC and Nauru delegates discussed a variety of new fishing
and agricultural cooperative programs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said, the ROC has decided to set up an embassy
and appoint a resident ambassador in Tuvalu in the near future.</P>
      <P>Chang also said that the ROC Ambassador to Tonga will lodge a
formal protest to the Tonga Foreign Ministry on Monday over its
unfriendly and detrimental move towards the ROC.</P>
      <P>Since the forging of diplomatic ties in 1972, the ROC has
extended many kinds of assistance to Tonga, including the services of
an agricultural mission. Nevertheless, Chang said, the ROC has not
offered any loans to Tonga.</P>
      <P>Chang said Tonga probably switched diplomatic allegiance for two
major reasons -- promises from Beijing to help it build and launch
satellites and join the United Nations.</P>
      <P>MOFA announced on Saturday that the ROC has decided to sever its
diplomatic relations with Tonga, terminate all agreements and
cooperation between the two countries and recall its ambassador,
effective Nov. 2, 1998.</P>
      <P>MOFA issued the statement after the Tonga foreign minister
formally announced at 8 a.m. on Saturday (Taipei time) that his
country will switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing
from Monday.</P>
      <P>Tonga will be the fourth ROC ally to switch diplomatic allegiance
so far this year, following the lead of South Africa, the Central
African Republic, and Guinea-Bissau. With the loss of Tonga, the ROC
now has just 26 diplomatic allies.</P>

      <P>The highest priority of the Republic of
China government is to protect China's first democratic society on
Taiwan in 5,000 years of history, the top ROC representative to the
US said in Boston on Friday.</P>
      <P>Stephen Chen, representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Representative Office in the United States, made the remark in a
speech on the latest developments and future challenges of the ROC to
some 200 people gathered at Harvard University.</P>
      <P>He said people's freedom and well-being on Taiwan must be secured
to provide a development model for the Chinese mainland to use as
reference.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the promotion of cross-strait relations and the
ROC's participation in international affairs are the major challenges
the Taipei government faces.</P>
      <P>For the sake of national survival, he stressed that the ROC

      <P>As to the development of cross-strait relations, Chen reiterated
Taipei's stance of engaging in contact only on the basis of
reciprocity and equality to gradually narrow the gaps between the two
sides on political, economic and social levels.</P>
      <P>He urged Beijing authorities to recognize the existence of

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Chinese-American male was arrested at San
Francisco airport on Thursday for making a phony bomb threat on an
EVA Airways flight to Taipei.</P>
      <P>The man, identified by his surname Chi, was arrested minutes
after making a phone call to staff at the EVA airport counter saying
there was a bomb aboard the airline's flight BR27 to Taipei.</P>
      <P>According to reports, Chi initially approached the airline
counter to inquire whether a passenger surnamed Liang was aboard the
flight. He left the counter after being told no such person had
checked in.</P>
      <P>Chi then tried to enter the exit gate area where passengers for
flight BR27 were boarding -- under the guise that he was looking for
a friend's mother who was sick. EVA security guards intervened and
prevented him from approaching the area.</P>
      <P>Soon afterward, Chi is believed to have made the call saying
there was a bomb aboard the flight as the plane was taxing on the
runway in preparation for takeoff.</P>
      <P>Since Chi was at the counter minutes before the call, airline
staff recognized his voice and called in police to apprehend him.</P>
      <P>After being detained, Chi admitted to having made the threatening
phone call in a bid to prevent the plane from taking off.</P>
      <P>The bomb threat did not cause a delay in the flight as it went
ahead as scheduled, and arrived safety in Taipei at about 10:00 p.m.
on Friday, an EVA representative said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>New Party Legislator Yok Mu-ming on Friday
urged the government to conduct a thorough investigation over whether
a member of the ruling Kuomintang was a broker for mainland
China-owned enterprises entering Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liu Tai-ying, chairman of the KMT's Business Management
Committee, has lashed out angrily at Yok's allegations. Liu suggested
that the New Party request the Control Yuan, the country's top
watchdog, to investigate his possible involvement with the alleged
mainland-held businesses in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liu said he is willing to immediately resign his position if he
were found guilty. Otherwise, the legislator making the charges
should stop participating in public service, he added.</P>
      <P>The opposition New Party held a news conference on Friday during
which it demanded the government's security and intelligence agencies
investigate possible interference by mainland-owned enterprises in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yok pointed out that Liu was seen by John Tkacik -- a former
senior intelligence official with the US State Department -- as being
a secret envoy of ROC President Lee Teng-hui, and conducting a liaison
between Lee and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>There has been a close relation between Liu and those groups
tinged with mainland-owned businesses, the New Party legislator
remarked, adding that relevant organizations of the government should
find out whether Liu has been a go-between for the mainland in
exchange for funds.</P>
      <P>The chairman of KMT's business management committee dismissed the
New Party's allegation as baseless, and said he did not and would
never play such a role.</P>

      <P>Several piracy operations were busted and
eight suspects were turned over to prosecutors recently, the Ministry
of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Authorities have broken piracy rings in mobile exhaust purifiers,
toys and stationary products, as well as video game CD-ROMs in recent
weeks.</P>
      <P>Acting on a tip, investigators raided an underground factory in
Tamsui on Friday and seized over 2,900 copied mobile exhaust
purifiers for well-known Japanese car makers such as Honda, Toyota,
and Nissan.</P>
      <P>The operator of the ring, identified as Chen Chia-nan, was
arrested. After questioning, Chen said he had turned out tens of
millions of New Taiwan dollars worth of bogus purifiers a year, and
sold them to local mobile components distributors.</P>
      <P>In another operation, an owner of a toy store and an owner of a
stationary store were arrested on similar charges after the MJIB
found them selling copied goods bearing the Hello Kitty, My Melody,
and Kero Kero Keroppi brand names. Investigators also apprehended the
two suppliers of the contraband items.</P>
      <P>The MJIB said its Taipei office confiscated about 140,000 copied

results with participants reducing their weight by 4-10 kilograms in
six weeks.</P>
      <P>The program, financed by the Department of Health (DOH) under the

Tsaotun Township, Puli Township, Luku Hsiang and Shuili Hsiang.</P>
      <P>The six-week free classes consisted of instruction on a balanced
diet, reduced intake of calories, improved dietary habits, and
regular exercise.</P>
      <P>Officials of the county's Health Bureau said they advised
participants not to reduce their weight too quickly because it may
lead to physical problems.</P>
      <P>After the program, participants found that their weight had been
reduced by more than four kilograms. Some even lost up to 10
kilograms.</P>
      <P>The happy participants pledged to maintain their new weight as

reduce weight is to have a balanced diet, regular exercise and
persevere, they said.</P>
      <P>According to a government survey, one in every seven adults in
Taiwan suffers from being over-weight. As being over-weight is often

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO REOPEN REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE IN KINSHASA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China will reopen its
representative office in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
once the situation there stabilizes, Foreign Ministry spokesman Roy
Wu said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the statement after his mainland Chinese counterpart,
Tang Guoqiang, said on Friday that Beijing appreciates the DRC
government's recent move of closing Taiwan's representative office in
Kinshasa in accordance with the so-called "one China" policy.</P>
      <P>Wu said the ROC temporarily shut its representative office in the
DRC capital in August mainly because of political and economic
turmoil in that country.</P>
      <P>"When the civil war in the DRC ends and the general situation
there returns to normal, we'll consider reopening a representative
office in Kinshasa," Wu said.</P>
      <P>He said the ROC signed a five-year agreement with the DRC's
precursor -- Zaire -- in June 1991 on the opening of an ROC
representative office in Kinshasa.</P>
      <P>When the bilateral agreement expired in 1996, Wu said the ROC
negotiated with Zaire officials for an extension of the accord.
Before the two sides could strike a deal, a civil war erupted in that
country and rebel leader Laurent Kabila managed to seize power in May
1997. Kabila then changed Zaire's national title to the Democratic
Republic of the Congo.</P>
      <P>As the DRC's situation has remained mired in instability and
chaos, Wu said the ROC has been unable to reach a new agreement with
the DRC on the renewal of its representative office's mandate.</P>
      <P>In July this year, an army of Tutsi rebels, Rwandan soldiers and
disenchanted troops from Kabila's army -- the same people who helped
Kabila ousted longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997 --
staged a revolt against the Kabila regime, triggering a new round of
civil war.</P>
      <P>With the situation there deteriorating, the ROC evacuated its
officials and nationals from the war-torn DRC in mid-August.</P>
      <P>"As continued political instability in the DRC in the past few
years has hindered work on promoting substantive Taipei-Kinshasa
ties, we find no need to reopen our representative office there in
the near future," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, staff members of the ROC representative
office in the DRC took advantage of a slowdown in fighting there to
return to Kinshasa to handle some evacuation affairs.</P>
      <P>Wu said only two ROC nationals remain in the DRC at present,
while all other ROC citizens were evacuated together with the staff
members of the representative office on Aug. 16.</P>
      <P>The ROC first established diplomatic ties with Zaire in 1960, but
cut such ties in early 1973 after the African state switched
diplomatic recognition to Beijing in late 1972.</P>

human rights group said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and

mainland Chinese State Council in Beijing Friday ordered An Jun, a
dissident living at Xinyang, Henan province, to terminate all
activities of the organization, which has nearly 100 members from 11
provinces at the present time.</P>
      <P>The order, sent through officials of the civil affairs bureau of
Xinyang city, also said that the organization is not lawful, because
it is composed of members from several provinces. An and several
other dissidents applied with the civil affairs ministry last month
for permission to register the organization.</P>
      <P>Another dissident organization, the China Development Union, was

      <P>Another dissident, Cha Jianguo of Beijing, was detained at

(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The First Commercial Bank will open its
first branch in Palau on Nov. 2, becoming Taiwan's first bank to open
a branch office in the South Pacific island nation.</P>
      <P>Bank officials chose Palau because a greater number of Taiwan
businessmen have moved their investments there from Thailand, Vietnam
and Malaysia due to lower production costs.</P>
      <P>The Palau branch will be the First Commercial Bank's sixth
overseas branch office opened this year.</P>
      <P>The opening will bring the number of the bank's branch offices
abroad to 11, including those in Guam, Singapore, London, New York,
Los Angeles, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Phnom Penh.</P>
      <P>The bank also maintains five representative offices abroad
located in Bangkok, Manila, Ho Chi Minh City, Rangoon and Kuala
Lumpur.</P>
